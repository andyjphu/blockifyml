I am 5/1 with an absolute insane UW Deck playing for the 2 boxes of Duskmourn. Loosibg one game to being stuck on 2 islands for 5 turns without drawing one more. Shit happens and so does variance. But feeling strong going into the final game. I am close to winning it, swinging in with my 2 creatures having one of my two the Wanderers to give my creatures hexproof plus an instant bounce spell in hand. Already feeling the excitement to achieve something I have never done before, a sudden loading screen pops up on attackers declared. After only 2-3 seconds it kicks me back to the lobby still being at 5-1.

Feeling super frustrated about the stolen win and thus also the 2 boxxes, I download the log and open a ticket at Support.
After I submit it I go back to MtGA, checking the game for bugfiles. After it takes 5 minutes to check all files I get back to the game ‚Ä¶and‚Ä¶. received a loss so am at 5-2.

I don‚Äôt know how and why this can happen as my internet connection has been stable the whole time. It feels just super miserable to not only get kicked out of the winning game but also end up receiving a loss and not even get a chance to get another go with an awesome deck.

Anybody knows what to do in my place? I feel scammed by purchasing gems for this result of technical errors. Might be my bad to spend money nonetheless. "
"My Review - So much potential, only some of it realized",HarryPotterGame,1i9xcxg,2025-01-25 16:20:02,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HarryPotterGame/comments/1i9xcxg/my_review_so_much_potential_only_some_of_it/,Warder45,User Reviews,"Having watched the Hogwarts Baking Show and having thrown on some hogwarts Christmas backgrounds from the game over the holidays, we noticed the game on sale and decided to give it a shot. Overall, I'd give it a 3 out 5 stars. Generally the first half of the game is really good, with the back half being pretty mediocre to bad.



**The Good**: The art and design team deserves some major praise. Hogwarts is amazingly detailed, even without ray tracing, the reflections, lighting, textures, are all really well done. The size of the environments as well as your ability to just mount up and fly around outdoors is really technically impressive. Even the forbidden forest, which I assumed would be a no-fly zone, was open to fly to, which was great. But it's not just all technical, moving portraits, or a hall of music playing one, ghosts wandering around, the school feels full of life. There is a plethora of outfit options you can mix and match. I'm not sure there are words to do justice to just how well the art and design team did in this game.

The reason the first 40-50% of the game is good is that it does a better job at capturing not just the vibe of the books/movies, but even outside of the IP, it's what you'd want in a cozy-ish, YA, school style game. You get to go to a fancy school with classes about learning magic, making friends, and solving problems. They've build a ton of puzzles into the game, some that work really well in the beginning, like portraits that show a location and you need to find it. Helps with exploration of the massive space. Having spells that can levitate and move objects makes for some Breath of the Wild like puzzles. While the Astrology puzzles aren't really hard, they are still pretty fun for what they are.

In fact, as someone who enjoys cozy games, they really iterated on a lot of cozy game concepts and refined them. You get your own magic room, to decorate how you like, to brew potions, house animals, grow plants, etc. They've done an excellent job making all your materials matter. In many cozy games, animal husbandry is more for enjoyment than tangible in game effects. For example, you almost always get more crops for less effort than animal products when trying to make money. Here, everything is used, animal products are required to upgrade your gear, which gets improved with each level, so you'll constantly be swapping things out and wanting to upgrade them again. 

Speaking of husbandry, the animals are all very well animated and realized. There are some very cute creatures in this game. And in your vivarium's where they live, you can launch balls for them to play with or use a spell to pet them, which can be very calming since cat animals purr, duckbill like animals will fall on their back while you pet their tummy. When it comes to animal husbandry, this is the game to beat now.





**The Meh**: While collecting decorations and clothes is a great incentive for solving puzzles, it does have the downside of ""you have to hope it randomly gives you X"" when you solve one. If items were tied to specific puzzles and camps, that would allow player who wanted a specific hat, glasses, coat, etc to beeline it to there so they could equip their look early on. 

The day/night cycle isn't great. It never feels like it's day long enough, and you have to open your map, hold F to then ""sleep"" where you are to move time forward. But weirdly it seems to move from day, to early night, to late night, to day again, which is strange since there are things at night and things during the day, not sure why there is 3 parts to the cycle.

Character models are also quite limited. For how much they put into the environments, it's a shame. It seems they have a couple professors that are slightly higher but otherwise, some look just like students (gardening professor) or just had wrinkles applied to be ""older"". It's really strange they didn't build in different body types.

The map could also use work. Not sure why they though holding down a button to rotate then zooming you back out after you let go was a good design choice. The map constantly fights you in Hogwarts, since floo flames are hard to make out where they really are.

And I'll just leave this here, I did a side quest to save a lady's pet Niffler. Reward? A Niffler lined hat...





**The Bad**: Well lets start with quick one, it's still Harry Potter, warts and all. They did a better job than the movies with diversity, but removing the horrible house elf stuff was a bridge too far I guess. They could have used literally anything, a magical ghost or item instead of Deek and him talking about his crappy master (why do they all come from bad wizards?)

Outside of Potter specific stuff, the last 50% is just not great. The main story was always sort of a filler, but there was a lot of build up for not a lot of payoff towards the end. Since it's YA, I'm even going to cut them some slack in how an army of goblins is setup around a school of wizards and literally no adult is doing anything about it. The main drag is that it just doesn't feel like the same school cozy game. There are still a few side quests, but there are no more classes, even Hogwarts feels a bit lesser since professors will just disappear from their classrooms never to be found. Say nothing of the ""good""/""bad"" paths in the game. It feels like the bad path was tacked on at the end to get the illusion, but it's just ""I want money vs not"" for 90% of the choices.

Sadly combat is also just not very satisfying. You are almost always alone, there are too many spells, forcing you to rotate the bar constantly since some spells just don't work well on certain enemies. I never use the block option, since dodge rolling was infinitely easier and more useful. The idea of color coded shields is a good idea to start, but in the context of the entire combat design, it never really came together. Descriptions of how to tackle enemies gets buried in the glossary and even then, it's not very helpful (boy it would be nice to have a class to take where to showed you how to fight certain monsters...) And this is all before talking about balance.

The games balance is really bad. For as great as upgrades and adding traits to clothing is for making husbandry useful, they did a really bad job balancing those traits out and the power curve as you get higher level. I had 1 level 3 trait increasing all plant damage (out of 6 pieces of gear, so I could have had 5x as much) and with just that one, 2 cabbages and 2 vine plants would wipe out every camp in the game. Hell I'd throw 2 sets of cabbages out and they'd pretty much solo a Troll (the hardest non-boss unit in the game). But it's not just plants, with a couple ancient magic ones, I'd constantly be full and could 1 shot anything. 

I'm not 100% sold on how you collect animals as well. If the game was setup so you rescued animals from poachers and that's how you filled your vivarium, that would have been infinitely better than going to their natural habitat, sucking them up into your bag, then bringing them to your own personal zoo. You are literally a poacher in this game, kidnapping animals to create materials you can harvest. It wouldn't be that hard to build our vivarium via poacher camps (giving players another reason to do them) and put some puzzle system in place to protect animal dens, just re-allocate a couple dozen merlin trials ha.

Speaking of merlin trials, for as great as having so many puzzles in the game is, half of them are not really puzzles but busy work. Once you understand what to do with the merlin trials, there is no difficulty at all. It's just going and doing. It seems like they would have been better served cutting those in half and making the remaining ones a bit better. Which leads to another major pain point, the game doesn't do a good job tracking what has been done. Looking for that remaining page in hogsmede? I hope you have a picture perfect memory for the other 50 you already got if you plan on looking up the rest. This goes for all collectables in the game. I think part of the problem is that they re-use page locations later in the game, so having one that you got still flying around marked as such, would cause too much stuff at one time. 



Overall, I really enjoyed the first 40-50% of the game, and wish the they had been able to harness that for the entire game. I couldn't help but play the remaining game re-designing it in my head. If they had designed this more like a Bioware game, with students you could befriend, they would then be companions on quests, it would open up so much more of the game. Now you could design a better combat system, with all sorts of combos. The room of requirement has so much wasted space by the end, if it was the hangout for your friends, maybe there would be a table where you could suggest classes they take, so help with their builds? Maybe there would just be games or things to do? Speaking of classes, clothing being limited to traits and health would help make classes required for increasing spell damage. Maybe you take potions class to improve your purple spells, or transfiguration for yellow, take botany for increased plant damage. But you can't do them all, which would allow for actual builds in the game. I could probably go on for a while here but you get the idea.



I hope the developers are cognizant of the issues if they plan on doing another game. The game engine, art, and design are really top notch, just let those folks cook. But I hope they take another look at the core game design. "
Noticable Lag/Stutter when combat starts/stops,skyrimmods,1i9xcky,2025-01-25 16:19:38,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1i9xcky/noticable_lagstutter_when_combat_startsstops/,AGx-07,PC SSE - Help,"I've got a bit of an issue and I'm looking for some help to see what my options are. My game otherwise runs perfectly fine >60FPS at all times with no lag/stutter or CTDs. I can unsheath my weapon and swing it around or cast spells to my hearts content but if I engage any enemy in combat there's a noticable stutter that occurs for about half a second or so when combat starts or stops. An enemy can be right and I can be pickpocketing him or shooting arrows in it's direction to where it will start looking for me but only if combat is about to engage does the lag occur and I can't figure out what that is. 

I thought at once that it was something making the game auto-save when combat starts/stops but there are no saves to be found. I do have a lot of mods (about 600, mostly cosmetic like textures and replacers).

Has anyone encountered anything like this or know of mods that are known to cause it? Any thoughts on script loggers or something that would give me some sort of indication about what scripts are firing off at that time?"
Why You Should Use a Banishing Spell,occultspells,1i9xcfo,2025-01-25 16:19:28,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/occultspells/comments/1i9xcfo/why_you_should_use_a_banishing_spell/,swingerlover,," 

Banishing spells are among the very critically essential tools that  one needs in their lives. They are so crucial that they can lead to a  complete change in someone‚Äôs life. Simply described, banishing spells  establish a safe environment, a psychically secured bubble around you  that may be guarded by hexagrams, pentagrams, Archangels or other beings  and figures

This spell is still regarded as one of the fundamental practices of  ceremonial magic. This spell is quite helpful for everyone who feels  under some negative attacks feels a lot of negativity around them, or  simply feels some sort of possession. It is ideal for banishing  negativity and cleaning the spiritual space. Banishment spells have been  around since the dawn of time and used often with other spells to  enforce the results, especially love spells.

In several cultures of Paganism, banishing is conducted to eliminate  negative or undesired energy, or in some instances people who can cause  problems in our work or general life. While some cultures view banishing  as a retrogressive practice because of their reasons i.e. like the  saying that it affects the free will of others if your culture has no  bans against such matters, then there is no basis that you can‚Äôt  practice a banishing spell. Remember the main aim of a banishing spell  is to eliminate those trying to interfere with your relationship, work  or the smooth running of your life. It is not about harming other  innocent people who may have nothing negative about your life.

There are distinct approaches that can be applied to achieve  successful banishing. Depending on your preference, you will need to  choose one among the available approaches- depending on how satisfied  you are with the varying methods and what you are trying to attain.

**Dealing with the unknown spirits.**

Knowing your enemies presents the easiest way to handle the problems  they are causing in your life. If you are fortunate, you can face the  person you no longer wish to see in your life and let them know that.  They will leave you alone. Nevertheless, this may seem simple said than  done. In some worst scenarios, you may not be aware of the person  causing the problems you are facing. This is where the Banishing spells  come in. Even though you may not know the source of your problems, you  will still get the assistance you deserve.

**Banishing Ritual**

According to experts of magic and life, the worst enemy that can  impact negatively on your life is bad spirits. These can either be cast  by your rivals or you may be the one who invited them. While handling  the spirits cast by your rivals may be somewhat challenging, there is  arguably no other thing you should do apart from dealing with the bad  spirits that you may have attracted into your life.

By now, it should be clear that the things you draw into your life  are nothing but the things you are preoccupied with. In this regard, I  imply that in case you are preoccupied with anxiety, you will draw the  same anxiety into your life. By equal measure, if you are overwhelmed by  a dislike for someone you are destined to draw hatred to your life as  well. If you trust that everyone you find in your everyday life is  anticipating harm you then that is what will possibly occur.

With that in mind, the ideal defense from evil spirits is to make  sure that you guard yourself with joyful situations and joyful people.  Above all, use the banishing spell. Never allow others space to control  the state of your spirit at any instance; God should only have such  right in your life. Allow the energies of the banishing spell to defend  you. Rise every day with the determination that you are safe with the  spell. You should always keep in your mind that you are the boss of your  fate and your life will run as per the way you desire it to.

If you have any doubt that there may be harmful spirits in your life,  your place of work or your relationship, it is time to act. The  Banishing spell will eliminate them and allow you to live a free life. I  have had many people casting away the most dangerous spirits in their  lives by utilizing these spells. Note that it is preferable to protect  yourself with the banish spells rather than to wait for something to  befall you to act.

[DS3] I could use some help putting together some builds.,darksoulspvp,1i9xb7s,2025-01-25 16:17:59,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/darksoulspvp/comments/1i9xb7s/ds3_i_could_use_some_help_putting_together_some/,Frogsplosion,DS3,"So I want to create multiple builds for multiple soul levels that are constructed in such a way that I can use them not just for PvP but also to kill bosses or help people through the levels, This way I have all of my options open so I can continue to engage in multiplayer even as the population thins out.

My first creation has been a complete success thus far. It is a salt level 20 / +1 pyro build and I have been having a ton of fun at the high wall crushing vordt and trolling players as a mad phantom. I figured I didn't really want to take invasions at such a low level too seriously because I didn't want to chase people away. 

Here is that first setup: https://soulsplanner.com/darksouls3/180905

I would like to continue scaling up in this way, with different builds for different parts of the game that utilize all of their different multiplayer components. 

So for example, I would like to build something like a soul level 30 / +3, which would be a farron watchdog and help people in crucifixion woods, cathedral, and the swamp, and kill sages, deacons, and abyss watchers. 

I would also like to build something for catacombs and smoldering lake, and I wasn't sure if it should be somewhere between 40 and 50 or if I should jump straight to 60 but 60 / +6 seems like the domain of irithyll.

Abyss watchers and wolnir are both weak to lightning, and old demon king does not like Black Knight weapons, so I was considering maybe a strength build in that catacombs area with the Dragon Slayer Greataxe, and the Black Knight Ultras, possibly with a tiny bit of faith for some support spells or maybe gnawing and lightning spear, and I could carry some more PVP oriented strength weapons for one I want to invade.

My biggest problem is I have never really played at these low levels so aside from super low levels when it's really obvious, I don't know what weapons and spells start with high base damage or high initial scaling and thus are much stronger at lower levels, and aside from high wall where you can just acquire a much higher amount of resources than a new player, what qualities exactly make a mid-level build strong."

"While Hwei is not OP per say, power should be shifted out of QE by reducing its range and giving higher mana return on WE",leagueoflegends,1i9x754,2025-01-25 16:12:55,0,0.3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1i9x754/while_hwei_is_not_op_per_say_power_should_be/,The_Data_Doc,,"I think Hwei's laning phase, as it stands, is incredibly cheese. Basically just a QE bot from under turret. No other control mage has wave clear like this, Taliyah, Orianna, and anivia all require some level of downtime during laning phase before the wave is clear. Orianna QE the back wave, Taliyah's e isnt strong enough early to wipe waves, and q is body blocked.

I'm not really saying champions cant have niche's, but I feel just wiping wave from turret is definitely cheese, and he has more of enough niche already with the variety and impact of his spells.

His niche is already stopping movement speed boosters(like hecarim and briar) which taliyah and orianna dont handle as well."

But I dropped my ring. Bent down to pick it up. Then saw it on the ground again. I hadn‚Äôt dropped it twice. Bent down again to pick it up, and realized I was lucid. The dream had been full of amazing and impossible signs, but I didn‚Äôt realize until this point. 

Slid the ring on my finger and marveled at how physical it was. Indistinguishable. Felt it on my finger. Suddenly got so excited I pooped my pants. 

Crestfallen realizing I had to wake up and clean myself. Opened my eyes with unbroken consciousness. Realized I had not evacuated my bowels in the physical. Was a bit put out of the immediate end to the lucid experience, and quite relieved there was nothing to clean up and I hadn‚Äôt really shit myself. 

Super brief lucidity is still a profound rush. "

I‚Äôm considering subscribing to ChatGPT Pro, but I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs worth it for my specific use case. Here‚Äôs what I need:

	1.	Training the model for a specific translation style

I‚Äôd like to train ChatGPT to translate text using a particular style. This would require consistency and adaptability over time.

	2.	Heavy editing and proofreading

I‚Äôm looking to use it heavily for editing manuscripts. This includes proofreading based on a specific style, checking grammar, spelling, and even diacritical marks (where applicable).

	3.	Handling large documents

My manuscripts typically range from 100 to 300 pages in Word format. Ideally, I‚Äôd like to upload the entire document, have it processed (even if it takes hours), and get the edited file back with tracked changes.

Is this asking too much from ChatGPT Pro, or would it fit my needs? Would I need additional tools or workflows to make this feasible? I‚Äôd appreciate any insights or suggestions!

"Empathy, Alexithymia & Compatibility",AutisticAdults,1i9x06s,2025-01-25 16:04:11,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1i9x06s/empathy_alexithymia_compatibility/,lvasnow,seeking advice ,"Compatibility Problem

Hi all, 
My autistic partner and I have been having some really hard conversations lately. We love each other but aren't sure we're compatible anymore. 

I'm fairly sure he has cognitive alexithymia - he always needs quite a long time (hours to days) to identify his emotions and others. 

He *can* feel what others feel implicitly, but he can't describe it or talk about it without difficulty (writing things down is somewhat easier for him). 

This all translates to him not realizing when things aren't okay with me until I spell it out for him. If I go quiet, withdrawn, or seem down, he occasionally notices but often I have to say something first. 
The other day I was crying - hard - and he was holding the roll of toilet paper I'd been using for tissues. He just watched me cry without offering me any, or saying anything to me, although judging by his face and posture I could tell he was feeling sad *with* me. 

The main problem is that I'm hyper empathetic. I'm a teacher, disabled and a woman, AND my mom was a social worker, so I was raised to be self-aware and aware of others to the extreme. 

I feel like I take care of everyone else's big feelings all day, staying strong and not giving into my own so my students have a calm, steady adult they can trust, but when I get home, I want someone to take care of *my* feelings a bit: offer me a cup of tea, notice when I'm sad, that sort of thing. I hate that I always have to verbally ""wave my arms around"" to get my partner to be ""attuned"" to me. 

We've talked about his struggles with empathy and he knows that if nothing changes, this is a deal breaker for me.

I don't want to change him, or make him be someone he's not. He's said he doesnt want to keep hurting me without meaning to.But he's also expressed that he doesn't want to lose me and is doing some soul-searching to assess whether anything can -or should- be done about the situation. 

I don't even know what I need; just kindness, I guess. 
Thanks for listening, gang. "
The Mystical Symbolism of the Key: Unlocking Hidden Knowledge,DaughtersOfLilith_666,1i9x05o,2025-01-25 16:04:09,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DaughtersOfLilith_666/comments/1i9x05o/the_mystical_symbolism_of_the_key_unlocking/,MortismaStMacabre,,"The Mystical Symbolism of the Key: Unlocking Hidden Knowledge





https://preview.redd.it/5cpnrl2jf7fe1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6e2ffba05bcce8d7f9a4b75efd49e6773d783f9

Introduction Throughout history, the key has served as a powerful symbol in mystical traditions, folklore, and spiritual practices. Its dual nature‚Äîas both a tool of access and restriction‚Äîconnects it to profound themes of mystery, transformation, and hidden wisdom. Across cultures, the key is a potent metaphor for unlocking doors to new opportunities, guarding sacred spaces, and bridging the gap between worlds. Keys in History and Mythology

1. Ancient Civilizations:

* In ancient Egypt, the ankh, often interpreted as a ""key of life,"" symbolized eternal life and was believed to unlock the gates of the afterlife (Wilkinson, 2003).
* Greek and Roman mythology depicts gods like Hecate, the goddess of crossroads, and Janus, the god of transitions, holding keys. These deities embodied access to hidden realms, marking the key as a symbol of passage and authority (Ker√©nyi, 1951).

1. Medieval  Symbolism:

* During the Middle Ages, keys were emblems of power and responsibility. Guardians of sacred or protected spaces often carried keys as symbols of their authority (Coveney, 1988).
* In alchemy, keys represented the unlocking of esoteric knowledge, marking the transformative journey from ignorance to enlightenment (Fabricius, 1994).

1. Folklore:

* In European fairy tales, keys often appear as instruments of both curiosity and caution. Stories like Bluebeard use keys to symbolize forbidden knowledge and the consequences of seeking it (Zipes, 2013).

The Key as a Mystical Symbol

1. Access  and Transition:

* Keys embody the concept of transition, representing access to new opportunities, solutions, or spiritual realms. They are often associated with liminality‚Äîthe state of being on the threshold between two worlds  (Turner, 1969).
* They also symbolize closure, enabling individuals to lock away past pain,  negativity, or unwanted influences.

1. Guardianship  and Protection:

* Keys have been used as protective talismans. Hung over doorways, worn as jewelry, or placed under pillows, they were believed to ward off evil spirits or misfortune (Danaher, 1972).
* The act of locking something away with a key symbolized safeguarding treasures, secrets, or sacred knowledge.

1. Hidden Knowledge:

* In mystical traditions, the key represents the seeker‚Äôs journey to uncover truths. Possessing a key often implies mastery over knowledge or access to divine mysteries (Chevalier & Gheerbrant, 1996).
* In some magical systems, the design or material of the key carries symbolic weight, such as an antique key representing ancestral wisdom or a modern key symbolizing contemporary insight.

Keys in Witchcraft and Rituals

1. Ritual Tool:

* Keys are often used in rituals to open or close energetic pathways. For example, a key may be used to symbolically ""unlock"" a sacred circle or ""seal"" a spell (Cunningham, 2002).
* They are also employed in spells to unlock opportunities, love, or prosperity‚Äîor to close doors on harmful influences.

1. Crossroads and Choice:

* Keys are deeply tied to the symbolism of crossroads, a common theme in witchcraft. At a crossroads, the key becomes a metaphor for decision-making, transformation, and guidance through life‚Äôs transitions  (Guiley, 1999).
* Hecate often depicted holding keys, represents the ability to navigate these pivotal moments and unlock new paths.

1. Symbolic  Uses:

* A  single key can symbolize simplicity and focused intention, while a ring of keys may represent knowledge, authority, or the ability to unlock multiple possibilities.
* Skeleton keys, in particular, are favored in magical practices for their versatility and association with unlocking any door (Grimassi, 2004).

Cultural Symbolism and Practices

1. Hecate‚Äôs Keys (Ancient Greek Tradition):

* Hecate,  the Greek goddess of witchcraft and crossroads, is often depicted holding keys, symbolizing her role as a guide through transitions and a guardian of thresholds (Johnston, 1990).
* Devotees of Hecate might include a key in rituals to invoke her guidance, often leaving a key as an offering at a crossroads.

1. Roman  Rituals with Janus:

* Janus, the Roman god of doorways, beginnings, and endings, was associated with keys. In Roman tradition, keys were symbolic tools during New Year‚Äôs rituals, representing the opening of new opportunities and the closing of the past (Beard, 1998).
* Celebrants often used symbolic keys in blessings to invoke prosperity and protection for the year ahead.

1. Keys in Marriage Traditions:

* In some Scandinavian and Eastern European traditions, keys were incorporated into wedding ceremonies. The groom would gift a symbolic key to the bride, representing the opening of a new life together or her role as guardian of the household (Murdoch, 2001).
* In  India, the key to the family‚Äôs safe or treasure chest is traditionally given to the matriarch as a symbol of her authority and responsibility.

1. Shinto Shrine Practices (Japan):

* Keys often appear in Shinto shrines, associated with the deities Inari and their fox messengers. These keys, typically held in the mouths of fox statues, symbolize the unlocking of rice granaries and prosperity (Rosenberger, 1992).

1. Key-Carrying Customs in Europe:

* In medieval Europe, women often carried a key as a sign of their authority over the household and its resources. This practice extended into rituals where keys were buried in new foundations to bless the space and ensure protection (Sennett, 1994).

Keys in Modern Symbolic Practices

1. Keys for Manifestation:

* Modern practitioners often carry a small key charm as a reminder of their personal goals, representing the ability to ""unlock"" potential or manifest dreams (Andrews, 2002).
* Vision boards may include images of keys to symbolize opening doors to success or new opportunities.

1. Key Tattoos and Jewelry:

* Key designs in tattoos and jewelry are popular as symbols of individuality,  secrets, or life transitions. They often serve as reminders of the wearer‚Äôs ability to unlock their destiny or protect their own inner ""treasure.""

ConclusionAcross cultures and traditions, the key has played a vital role in rituals and symbolic practices. Whether used to protect, unlock hidden truths, or signify authority, the key remains a universal emblem of transformation and possibility. Its enduring power lies in its ability to represent both access and protection, making it a deeply personal and mystical tool. References

Anyway, my mom had this word she would always use when I did something stupid. Like if I dropped a plate and broke it. It was pronounced like en-throw-mah-tia. I never asked for the pronunciation or what exactly it meant, I just knew that if I heard it I was usually in trouble lol. I always assumed it was something like ‚Äústupid girl.‚Äù

I have here Part 2 of ""Things I'll come up with that I'll likely never get to play"".  My last installment was the Anthropomorphic Pangolin, [the Tengglin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/mqa7wa/new_race_idea_tengglinoid_anthropomorphic/)!

This time, I've cobbled together a Druid archetype that is really all about Vermin.  I took the concept of the pack lord and ran with it.  

Swarm Lord - Druid Archetype

Some druids focus on the creepy and the crawly and bond themselves to vermin over animals.¬†¬†

**Swarm Bond (Ex)**: A swarm lord druid may not select a domain and must choose a vermin companion. The swarm lord gains a +2 bonus on wild empathy and Handle Animal checks made regarding her vermin companion. The swarm lord may have more than one vermin companion, but she must divide up her effective druid level between her companions to determine the abilities of each companion. For example, a 4th-level swarm lord can have one 4th-level companion, two 2nd-level companions, or one 1st-level and one 3rd-level companion.

Each time a swarm lord‚Äôs druid level increases, she must decide how to allocate the increase among her vermin companions (including the option of adding a new 1st-level companion). Once a druid level is allocated to a particular companion, it cannot be redistributed while that companion is in the swarm lord‚Äôs service (she must release the companion or wait until the companion dies to allocate its levels to another companion, which she can do the next time she prepares spells). The share spells vermin companion ability only applies to one vermin companion at a time‚Äîthe swarm lord cannot use it to cast a one-target spell and have it affect all of her companions.¬†

This ability replaces nature bond.

V**ermin Empathy (Ex)**: A swarm lord can improve the attitude of a vermin. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The vermin rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical vermin normally have a starting attitude unfriendly.¬† This ability replaces wild empathy.

**Swarm Stride (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a swarm lord learns to move through vermin without danger. She can safely pass through swarms of vermin and does not take swarm damage while within a vermin swarm‚Äôs space. In addition, she is immune to a swarm‚Äôs distraction ability. If the swarm lord or her vermin companion(s) attack a swarm, they lose this protection against only that swarm. This ability replaces woodland stride.

**Resist Corruption (Ex)**: At 4th Level, a swarm lord gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against disease.¬† If she beats the DC by 10 or more, she can treat the save as 2 consecutive saves.¬† This ability replaces Resist Nature‚Äôs Lure

**Vermin Shape (Su)**:¬† At 4th level, a swarm lord gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium vermin and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the vermin type and are either mindless or have an intelligence of 2 or less. This ability functions like the beast shape I spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to vermin or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of a vermin with which the swarm lord is familiar.

A swarm lord loses her ability to speak while in vermin form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained vermin can make, but she can communicate normally with other vermin of the same general grouping as her new form.¬† A swarm lord retains the empathic link to their companion(s) whilst changed.¬†¬†

A swarm lord can use this ability an additional time per day at 8th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of seven times at 18th level. At 20th level, a swarm lord can use vermin shape at will. As a swarm lord gains levels, this ability allows the swarm lord to take on the form of larger and smaller vermin and vermin swarms. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.

At 6th level, a swarm lord can also use vermin shape to change into a Large or Tiny vermin. When taking the form of a vermin, a swarm lord's vermin shape now functions as beast shape II.¬†

At 8th level, a vermin can also use vermin shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive vermin or a swarm of Tiny vermin that does not have a hive mind or intelligence.¬† When taking the form of vermin, a swarm lord‚Äôs vermin shape now functions as beast shape III.¬†

When a swarm lord takes the form of a vermin swarm, she gains swarm traits and the distraction universal monster ability.¬† She retains all of her ability scores, except for Strength (-6) and Constitution (+2).¬† She takes up a single 5-foot square.¬† Her speed is dependent on the ability of the vermin she chooses.  Flying vermin impart a speed of 5 feet and fling speed of 20 feet (average).  Crawling vermin impart a speed of 10 feet. Swimming vermin impart a swim speed of 10 feet.  When she encounters another creature, she can choose to inflict damage as a swarm with HD equal to her level.¬†¬†

At 10th level, a swarm lord can also use vermin shape to change into a swarm of Diminutive or Fine vermin.¬† Her size increases to 2-5‚Äô squares.¬† Her ability scores change to Strength (-6), Dexterity (+2), and Constitution (+2).¬† Ground vermin now impart an additional climb speed of 10 feet.¬† She also gains poison (Injury; *save* 10 + ¬Ω Druid level + Constitution modifier; *frequency* 1/round per every 3 Druid levels; *effect* 1 Dexterity damage; *cure* 1 save.¬† The save DC is Constitution based)

At 12th level, a swarm lord adds half her level to the DC for caster level checks or a Will Save for distraction.¬† Her size increases to 4-5‚Äô squares.¬† Her ability scores change to Strength (-6), Dexterity (+4), and Constitution (+2).¬† Flying vermin impart a speed of 10 feet, with a flying speed of 30 feet (good).¬† Ground vermin impart a speed of 20 feet, climb speed of 20 feet, and burrow speed of 10 feet (where indicated by vermin type).¬† Swimmers increase their swim to 20 feet. Her poison improves, as well (Injury; *save* 10 + ¬Ω Druid level + Constitution modifier; *frequency* 1/round per every 3 Druid levels; *effect* 1d3 Dexterity damage; *cure* 2 save.¬† The save DC is Constitution based)

This ability replaces wild shape.

**Improved Empathic Link (Su)**: The swarm lord gains an empathic link with all of her vermin companions. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar. In addition, as a swift action the pack lord can shift her perception to one of her companions, allowing her to experience what it sees, hears, and so on. She can maintain this connection as long as she likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and end it as a free action. The swarm lord can only use this ability on one companion at a time, and cannot see, hear, or smell with her own body while maintaining this connection. This ability replaces the 6th-level additional use of wild shape.

I looked at the Swarm Skin spell, as other archetypes use that in place of Wild Shape, but it really didn't fit with the vision.  I didn't want s Swarm Lord to use a swarm as a weapon.  I want her to be the swarm, if that makes sense.  "

Theory Crafting: Human Blender?,ESObuilds,1i9wsoe,2025-01-25 15:55:14,4,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ESObuilds/comments/1i9wsoe/theory_crafting_human_blender/,AHumbleWeeb,,"Jerensi's Bladestorm + Orpheon the Tactician + dark convergence seems like  recipe that turns any ground AOE into a human blender, right?

+387 weapon spell damage
+1096 max Magicka
+4491 offensive penetration
1. Casting abilities that leave an effect on the ground will create an area that applies a 60% snare and pulls enemies after a 1 second delay, stunning them for 1 second. After 4 seconds, the area deals 821 Magic Damage to all enemies in the 10 meter area, and 1642 Magic Damage to enemies within 3 meters of the center, increasing by 50% for each target. This effect can occur once every 25 seconds and scales off the higher of your Weapon or Spell Damage.
2.  While in combat, casting an ability that leaves an effect on the ground creates a 6 meter Spike Vortex that deals 3855 Physical Damage over 5 seconds to enemies inside it. After 5 seconds, enemies within the Vortex are dealt 1925 Physical Damage over 5 seconds. This effect can occur once every 15 seconds and scales off the higher of your Weapon or Spell Damage
3. While in combat, casting an ability that leaves an effect on the ground summons a tentacle at the target's location. After 2 seconds, the tentacle swings wildly in a 5 meter radius, dealing 229 Physical damage and stunning up to 6 enemies for 3 seconds. Enemies immune to stun take 1429 Physical damage instead. This effect can occur every 8 seconds and the damage scales off the higher of your Weapon or Spell Damage

So dark convergence is snaring them, stunning them, and if they cc break they're taking extra damage from tenticles, they're also taking Magic damage from convergence, and physical damage from the vortex, so basically every 25 seconds you turn everyone in a 10 meter AOE into a puree, and scales with damage which all sets give+penetration and because it's split damage it can proc overcharged and sundered."

I am also amazed at how everything has to be literally spelled out to students for a test with teachers doing everything but give the students the exact questions for the exam. 

It seems how the lack of standards have trickled down into a complete lack of discipline and drive with students, with students showing up in inappropriate clothing and treating teachers as if they are merely a vehicle for a grade. 

Working as a teacher and reflecting on my time as a student, I feel like some of the most formative experiences in my life was when I failed and had to face serious adversity in order to succeed. Have we failed our students/children by shielding them from this vital learning experience in exchange for the misleading reward of an inflated grade? 
What do you all think?

When sorcerers level up, do they just go to sleep and wake up with an epiphany about how to cast new spells?

Last night at my LGS I was playing casual commander with a group of new people. One of my opponents played Rocco and moved to end step, triggering the ability and having the top card of each players library exiled and able to be cast until the end of the Rocco's controller next turn. A different opponent had an instant card exiled off the top of his library and tried to cast that card during the same players endstep before my turn began. 

As far as I understand, he shouldn't have been able to do that since the end step would have ended after the triggered ability resolved and he'd have to wait for priority during my upkeep to cast the spell. This wouldn't have changed anything about the game state or how it ended, but I just wanted confirmation on whether he could have cast the instant or he would have had to wait. Thanks."

More of a double date board game night. We decided to go to Costco to pick up two large pizzas, and the closest Costco is 20 minutes away. After deep cleaning the whole house, we have to quickly get over there pick up the pizzas at a very specific time and then head home to have enough time to finish cleaning. I called in for one large pepperoni and one large cheese to be ready at 6:15. The guy I spoke to on the phone said they could absolutely do that, and I gave him my name... spelled correctly, with four letter letters‚Ä¶

We drive over there, run into the food court, and let them know we're here. I confirmed my name in my order, she said it would be out in five minutes. This is rough because with the time crunch those five minutes are very valuable, so I'm a little frustrated.

after five minutes of standing around, my boyfriend reminded me he needs to get gas. I tell him I will wait and then I'll go on the concrete outside so he can circle back when he gets gas. He leaves, so I walk back up and ask if it's done or close to done. I watch people who just ordered immediately get their full pizzas, which is very frustrating. The lady says oh didn't you come with your boyfriend? It'll be out soon. I tell her thank you and go back to waiting. Eventually, I hear her call out my name, I look at the card, and it's spelt incorrectly. She drops them off in front of me and then just ran off. I walk over to the cash register with my two pizzas, but nobody came back for several more minutes. I decided I wasn't going to wait, I've already waited 15 extra minutes, and I really need to get home. By the time I made it out, my boyfriend had already gotten gas so we just left. 

so here's my question,  am I the asshole for stealing pizza from Costco?"

I‚Äôm working on my Italian dual-citizenship application and could really use a reality check about the impact of document discrepancies. I‚Äôd appreciate any advice or strategies for handling these kinds of issues!

Here‚Äôs my situation:

\- My grandfather came to the U.S., where he lived for six years before marrying my also Italian national grandmother. My father was born a year later in the U.S.  
  
\- My grandfather never naturalized, so I believe I meet the citizenship eligibility requirements.

The problem is that my grandfather consistently provided incorrect information about his age and birthdate on official documents. I do have his¬†**CONE**¬†(Certificate of Non-Existence of Naturalization), which lists all the birthdates he gave (ranging over three years apart!). Additionally, his age/birthdate is incorrect on:

1. His marriage certificate (incorrect age),  
  
2. My father‚Äôs birth certificate (incorrect age),  
  
3. And even his death certificate (incorrect birthdate, though it does list him as an Italian national).

I have my grandfather‚Äôs¬†**birth certificate from Italy**, which confirms the correct date, and I‚Äôm certain it‚Äôs his because:

\- We still have family in his birth village.  
  
\- His¬†A-File¬†includes information about his three sisters, and I have their birth certificates as well to prove the connection.

Another issue is name misspellings on my father‚Äôs birth certificate, which I‚Äôve already requested corrections for with the state of California using the correct spellings from my grandfathers marriage certificate as proof.

My question is:¬†Are all the different birthdates and ages my grandfather used going to be a problem? Are there proven strategies to overcome the issue?

Any tips, experiences, or guidance would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks so much!"

Currently running a galvanic shard/lightning rod build. It‚Äôs fun enough and have been clearing content ok for the most part so far (roughly 5-7k DPS), just looking to change it up a bit and the chaos spells look fun.

Have been trying to theory craft in PoB, but I know there‚Äôs so much I‚Äôm missing (key synergies, nodes/items best for chaos, support gems, etc.) that it‚Äôs tough to judge what I‚Äôve been putting together. It‚Äôs also annoying spending all my ‚Äúgaming time‚Äù reading every gem, node, etc. and it‚Äôs hard to retain it all without testing in game, and I likely only have enough gold to reset once. 

Hoping I can lean on this thread to spark some ideas or at least point me in the right direction to help building something that will be effective in Cruel."

I just played an event and met this lovely 200 IQ fella. The strat (if I got it right) was to throw Omniscience into the graveyard and pull it up with Abuelo's to shit out cards at immense speeds from the sideboard. It looked like a lot of fun and I tried to recreate it myself, but it feels like I missed something.

If you're on here, could you share your deck and give a lil tip on how to play it? Or if someone else has played something similar, how do I do this? I'm putting what I threw together below:

Is My DM Power Hungry??,rpghorrorstories,1i9w8c9,2025-01-25 15:30:16,3,0.64,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpghorrorstories/comments/1i9w8c9/is_my_dm_power_hungry/,excellafan,Extra Long,"Sorry for how long this is. TLDR: My character got punished mechanically and had his mouth taken away for being ""mean"" to other party members. The DM explained he'd had a tally being made of every time my character did something ""shitty"" and was waiting to punish me with it. He tried to tell me that my character felt humbled by the punishment despite me saying he absolutely didn't and doubled down on it that he was the DM and could tell me how the character felt. And in our first big boss fight that he heavily encouraged us to take on, he made his creature incredibly OP and had an NPC come save the day and defeat it.

So quick backstory: I've been wanting to play DND for forever but all of the friends I've ever made were completely new, meaning I have been the forever DM whenever we play. The problem is that I want to play a player character. Zoom to now, I have a friend that has a coworker willing to DM. We agree, get a bunch of friends involved to a 7 person party and go off to adventure.

This DM basically puts us in a story he's been writing for 15 years (a novel). He's super against long backstories (understandable) but by session 1 he hasn't really read the 1 page limit backstories we all made. He has a very particular world that we're fitting these characters into so we all had to kind of change them to fit. Overall, it's not too bad. We start off in a guild and tasked with a quest to find the cause of entire towns being stranded and refugees running to nearby towns. There's a big reward for being able to stop the cause.

Overall he treats it like a tutorial for the first six or so sessions. He's guiding us the right way with NPCS that push us to do certain quests. There's not a ton of freedom but that's to be expected because... where else are we going to go but follow the trail, right?

Now quick context, my character is the party leader. During all of this adventuring, he's become suspicious of another party member because they have an ability (they are a Shade) that makes them look eerily similar to what we're chasing. This causes a lot of in game drama between them with petty back and forth fighting and getting other members involved, including a party member that seems to be the DMs favorite. My character now doesn't like the Favorite and regularly throws verbal shots at her. Again, everything is in game drama but the DM makes small comments about how bitchy my character is but I just laugh it off because I'm playing him that way on purpose.

Anyway, the trail eventually leads us to a mine shaft. We hear sounds coming from a magically locked room and have to find the keys. We do so, but my character brings up the fact that maybe we should... not open the door. We should let the guild know and have them deal with it since the job feels out of our scope. The DM interjects ooc to make us read the contract again and points out that there's a much bigger reward for stopping it ourselves. I assume he's pushing us this way because he has a big plan for us that will pay off. I was wrong.

I use a spellslot to give our rogue invisibility to scout the place first, she gets about 5 steps in before the DM tells her she can go no further unless she brings the party. There's no logical in game reason for this. He's just forcing us to go inside, making my cast useless and I've lost my last 2nd level spell slot for the day.

We end up going inside where we find a new party member (a new friend joined the campaign) and of course, the monster we're set to fight. At first, it's fine. The boss hits hard but not enough to one shot any of us, even my squishy wizard on a crit. I try to use a 3rd level invisibility to get me and our druid out of harms way as it teleported in front of us, but of course it can see through invisibility so I get hit running away from it.

We're hitting it back, it's somehow resistant to necrotic and radiant damage despite being undead. There's back and forth, we think we're getting somewhere, then the shadow begins casting a spell. Our sorceress gets excited to finally cast counterspell... but the DM says the DC is 20. Meaning it is a LEVEL 10 spell that the monster is casting. We're all shocked because we are level FIVE characters.

The counterspell fails and the spell ends up being... animate dead or something of the sort. He causes 5 ghouls to animate which immediately grapple all of the player characters but two. My character and another, our druid, that has a budding romance with him. My character attempts to save our cleric with a magic missile spell, our druid uses Bitter Wind but somehow every single ghoul is completely immune to the effect so it's useless. In game, I tell the druid to run. But just as I do, explosions begin to appear.

In comes the guild leader NPC that gave us the job with enough soldiers for every ghoul. A big anime fight breaks out between the leader and the shadow as the soldiers all attack the ghouls to save us (everyone is also unaffected by bitter wind, presumably because they're all SO much more powerful than the druid is) and the DM describes it as a big battle of two bosses meeting until we're all blinded by a bright light and the shadow is defeated.

I assume this was meant to be an amazing, cool moment of showing off his really cool NPC. But I was frustrated. We spent WEEKS building up to this. We were so excited for our first big boss fight all week until this session. And then the big moment gets taken from us by... an NPC we interacted with one time? So I make my character react accordingly. Despite the fact that I'm a bit annoyed ooc, it's very in character for him to be frustrated too as his backstory revolves around him wanting to become stronger and prove himself.

He stomps up to the guild leader and accuses her of using the party, giving them a job they were clearly in over their heads with and using them as personal scouts for her to follow and take the final moments from. The guild leader chokes him for disrespecting her, some of the party back him up, he stands firm in his stance that he doesn't like to be used. Eventually they get to the surface where the party is then arrested and shackled. Every time we rp an action, the DM adds a new detail he didn't say at first. Our sorceress bends down, turns out we're on our knees. We shuffle on our feet, turns out they're shackled too. You get the idea.

  
Edit: I forgot to point out, we are not being arrested due to my character's disrespect but instead because we opened up a sealed letter address to the all important council in the world. At the time, we were not told OOC how much of a crime it was. But as we all gave pushback, he told us that we would all know that it was an extreme crime so we didn't have much to fight about since our characters would have known. But he did not tell us that it was that big of a deal during the two sessions we spent trying to unlock the arcane lock on it (I learned the Knock spell SOLELY to unlock the letter). 

My character refuses to back down. He's pissed. Everything he did was useless, he didn't get the kill, almost all of the spells he used had no meaning, and now he's getting arrested. He's literally at rock bottom and I'm a roleplayer willing to take punishment for my character by him acting out of line. Hit him, put him in solitary confinement, gag him etc. But instead, what he does feels so much worse.

My character is an Order of the Scribes Wizard. That means his book is sentient. Well, the book (which has been with him since birth) floats off of his side and yells at him for acting out of line and acting like a ""brat."" At first, I'm excited. Then the book magically takes my character's mouth away so I can't respond to it anymore. It goes on to tell our druid that my character was using him as a body shield despite the fact that I was purposefully keeping him close to protect the druid and for my character to die with the rest if we were going to. It has a nice moment with the Favorite, which makes my character more annoyed because he doesn't like her. And to top it all off, the book *takes away my character's magic*. And when my character has an outburst that he doesn't even care, it gives him a point of exhaustion. Another outburst, he loses 5 max hp. The DM explains that he's been keeping track of every time my character has done something ""shitty"" (which is just my character being ""mean"" to another character) and was waiting to pull out this punishment on him.

He then tells me that my character feels humbled. I explain he's not humbled at all, he's angry and annoyed. He tells me that he IS humbled and I double down, saying he can't tell me how MY character feels. He says he can because he's the DM and I say again, no you absolutely can't and my character IS NOT humbled, he's angry. He finally relents to say that he feels SCOLDED which I'll accept because that's more objective.

Now, like I said, I don't MIND being punished for rp choices. What makes me mad is that this book, which supposedly has been with him since birth, doesn't know my character enough to see past the surface level of his actions. He has logic to why he doesn't like people and backstory related emotional reasons not to like others. For him to use the book to mischaracterize him when he can't speak and say he used someone else as a BODY SHIELD was just like... WHAT? And then getting this mechanic type punishment for just being an outspoken character instead of getting corporal punishment all just felt so off. Like he was trying to humble ME as a player for playing a character he doesn't like or something.

Am I crazy? Should I have expected worse for roleplaying a character willing to disrespect people stronger than him? I know I was playing with fire while I was doing it but it's not like I didn't expect punishment, just not from the source it came from. Also, am I crazy for being ooc annoyed about the NPC saving the day? He explained she's a level 18 Paladin. It just felt so... like we were in his dollhouse and we're just side characters that he can read his story to, if that makes sense. I don't know."

Every song felt like a short-lived love story between the audience and the performers. From the fireworks to the syncing LED bracelets to 100,000 people singing and moving in harmony... It felt less like a concert and more like a reunion of  thousand of hearts.

I thought I was done crying at _The Scientist,_ but tears of happiness poured down pretty quickly with every other song. 

Coldplay's truly something I wish every person gets to witness something akin to their live performances. It's worth every single penny. More importantly, it's a reminder of the power of love, music and magic."

I came in for the 2nd semester as they had subs the 1st. I have already noticed that many of the 0% Fs are actually turning in work and putting in effort in my class. I'm not strict at all with the spelling as I'm more concerned with them understanding the scientific concepts. 

For example, I have been teaching my 7th graders about food webs/chains and the trophic levels. When answering ""What is the tertiary consumer in the food chain?"" Some would answer ""Kobra"" or ""snakee"" and I still gave them full points because they understood the concept and vocabulary. 

I was made aware that I may be doing a disservice to them by not being strict about spelling but my fear is that I'm potentially discouraging them from wanting to learn science by focusing on that. I figured that I would be boosting their confidence and that would encourage them to read and learn more and the spelling would fall into place through that constant exposure. TBF I didn't learn the difference between the ""theirs"" until I was constantly exposing myself to more reading in late high school... "

The question is speech as a related service. He is right on the cusp of average for articulation with scores of 84, 88, 89. Language is average. Has been getting speech basically his whole life. Arguably, the articulation in isolation doesn't currently impact his education, but he is only in Kinder and spelling/reading/writing with the sounds he doesn't have isn't really an expectation.. He's got some phonological processes -- stopping, fronting, gliding. He doesn't have a clear j, sh, ch, th, z, v.  BUT, he's like 85% intelligible

Would you reccomend exit from school based services? I feel like we don't have great evidence that the artic currently impacts his education, but I also feel like he is at risk to never develop these sounds naturally and it isn't a great look for discharge a kid only to have the mom question testing again in like six months and have him show even lower scores...

Demon Summoning,dccrpg,1i9w0fw,2025-01-25 15:20:26,7,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dccrpg/comments/1i9w0fw/demon_summoning/,YtterbiusAntimony,,"Maybe I'm just not a seasoned Occultist, but...

The duration on the spell seems weird to me. It's a casting time of 1 turn, but most of its effects only last rounds.

The language in ""Binding"" doesn't seem to indicate an affected creature would remain summoned either. (Though, I suppose you could interpret that way, and it would solve my issue.)

I understand this isn't meant to be a combat oriented spell, but still what are its use cases?

What do you do with a demon in less than a minute? A few rounds doesn't seems long enough to negotiate a deal, nor does there seem to be a way (beyond quest for it) to bind a demon into service long term. Are type II and above allowed to stay beyond the spells duration since they can freely plane shift back home? Or are they necessarily forced back?

Phlogistonic Summoners, how do I bend these foul creatures to my will?

Is this spell wholly Judge Fiat/Quest For It territory? Or are there more rules/spells somewhere I'm missing? Any fun 3rd party stuff concerning Summoning or Magic Circles? Or any general mechanics for tweaking spell parameters (like duration)?

However when he is revealed then I can only use his effect AFTER the trap's effect resolved.

Example: (opponent's turn). I activate ""small scuffle"" (ss a level 2- monster) and choose ""testudo"" (neither player can summon high atk monsters) then I should be able to chain Lords effect before testudo is summoned by scuffle. 

However when I had him revealed then due to this wrong timing, scuffle will resolve and summon testudo before I can chain Lord.

I know there‚Äôs a lot of folks that can relate to the disparity there, but man, that just hurts. Hearing that from my mother felt like a low blow for me just trying to take care of her, and brought me back to a distinct instance when I was maybe 8 years old and hearing her scream at me ‚ÄúI hate you‚Äù because she was mad at me for something, don‚Äôt even remember what now, but I‚Äôm feeling as heavy now as I did then.

Why are people butchers?,tragedeigh,1i9vxyn,2025-01-25 15:17:24,0,0.2,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/tragedeigh/comments/1i9vxyn/why_are_people_butchers/,WebDevMom,in the wild,"We named our youngest (a daughter) Henrietta. 

When she was a newborn, while I‚Äôd planned Hetta as her nickname, Henny felt like a better fit for her, so that‚Äôs what we used. 

My post today is because we as a family are entirely consistent about spelling it Henny, however, these are all of the permutations we‚Äôve received from people (who have seen the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù spelling numerous times in written form):
- Heney 
- Heni
- Henni


Note: We are happy to call her whatever she prefers and right now, as an 8yo, it‚Äôs Henny"
We're Expanding Our User Flairs! (Villagers & Special NPCs),ACForAdults,1i9vxdd,2025-01-25 15:16:40,21,1.0,14,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9vxdd,SprintsAC,,"Hey everyone, recently we've made some posts that have mentioned our intentions to expand the available user flairs of r/ACForAdults. This has been an ongoing project for the subreddit & we're going to be continuously expanding our choice of user flairs for a very long time still, so please let us know if there's any user flairs you'd like to see that aren't yet available! üòä (Please make sure to check beforehand that they're not already there)


This is our 1st time adding flairs to the subreddit that aren't villagers ingame & it's something that's very interesting to see for us, so please let us know what your opinions are here! We would like to note that due to the cap on available user flairs on display, we will not be putting any flairs that aren't in-game villagers for New Horizons as visible flairs, however you'll still be able to have these flairs available by doing the following:




-From r/ACForAdults, click the top right corner (with the 3 dots going downwards)


-Click on 'Change User Flair'


-Select a user flair & click 'Edit'


-Type in the name of the flair in the text box that will appear & once you have all the flairs added, click 'Save'



**Please be aware that to display the user flairs available, you will need to type a : symbol & the correct spelling of the flair (this is case sensitive also, so please use a capital letter for the 1st letter of flair names)**




We will be leaving a pinned comment here with the names of each flair that has been added in (yet is not visibly displayed on the list of flairs). We'd like to apologise also that this is something we have to do & it purely comes down to the cap on user flairs that are visiblly shown as flair options.



We'll be working on expanding these flairs even more over time & we'd love to know your ideas on user flairs that you'd like to see! (It doesn't need to be limited to in-game villagers/characters). üòä If you do have any questions about how to set your user flair aswell, please feel free to either leave a comment here, or send us over a modmail & we'd be glad to offer any assistance!



Thank you & hopefully some of the new additions here will be of interest to you! üòä"
