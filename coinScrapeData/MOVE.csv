Character rotation in isometric game,Unity3D,1i9xgr5,2025-01-25 16:24:44,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1i9xgr5/character_rotation_in_isometric_game/,FunHaverStudio,Question,"Been looking for an answer to this question, but haven't found anything so that works, so here goes -

  
In an isometric game, I'm trying to rotate my character in the direction that he's moving. When I implement transform.rotation as shown below, the player does rotate the direction I hold down, but he starts moving in an unexpected way. (I hold down A or D, the player moves in the -x direction, I hold down W or S and the player moves in the +x direction).

Without the transform.rotation portion of the code, the player moves as intended. (W moves the player in the isometric up direction, S moves the player in the isometric down direction, etc.)

My movement code is applied to an empty game object (Player1) with the  modeled player game object and metarig as child objects.

"Bit early for this, but here's how I'd balance stuff",MyHeroUltraRumble,1i9x4y6,2025-01-25 16:10:13,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyHeroUltraRumble/comments/1i9x4y6/bit_early_for_this_but_heres_how_id_balance_stuff/,Perdita-LockedHearts,Game Feedback,"Firstly, these are all opinions. Early opinions too, but we've seen a lot of Kurogiri combos and stuff these last few days, and I think we've got a good grasp on him, no? Maybe not in a 3 stack, since a lot of people play solo queue, but still. Balance is a huge issue, and I plan on copy and pasting this stuff to the official discord's feedback. if I'm not being stupid with these changes, and add more changes based off of what you say about characters I was never skilled in (My aim and mechanics feel terrible now, so no way I'm good at Iida or Ibara all of a sudden). Skill sets will have parenthesis with the skillset's name. If I think a special action should be changed, I will put it under both the OG character and the skill set, labeled (Character's name) Special Action.

Izuku Midoriya: Crouched Alpha at lvl 9 deals 115 damage, and previous levels are adjusted accordingly, and 2nd Gamma is received at level 4.  Gamma now properly pulls targets (bug fix)

Izuku Midoriya (Full Bullet): Alpha has larger spread and deals 1 less damage per pellet (at lvl 9 he does 100 damage), and a fully charged Beta requires more height.

Katsuki Bakugo: Alpha deals 7 more damage across all levels, and Gamma now properly drags opponents for the final hit

Katsuki Bakugo (Machine Gun): Now only has 1 Gamma, and 3rd Beta charge is gained at lvl 7.

Ochako Uraraka: Gamma now comes out faster. Gamma does full knockdown upon ""releasing"" the Gamma. Decrease Alpha reload speed at all levels by 1 second.

Shoto Todoroki: Alpha hitbox is widened at all levels, and damage is increased by 5 across all levels. Beta is slightly further away. Gamma travels faster.

Shoto Todoroki (Ice Fang Wind Flame): Alpha deals 20 less damage across all levels. Now only has 2 Beta charges. 

Tenya Iida: Alpha deals 5 less damage across all levels. Beta deals 20 less damage at lvl 9, and progression is scaled accordingly.

Asui Tsuyu: Alpha now starts with 3 charges, and deals 10 more damage across all levels

Denki Kaminari: Alpha deals 5 less damage across all levels. Beta has stuns on every hit (NOT electrify). Gamma deals 15 less damage across all levels.

Eijiro Kirishima: Alpha now properly carries, even when turning. Beta deals 15 more damage across all levels, and has significantly longer range at lvls 1-3, and slightly longer range at lvls 4-8, and Beta no longer stops at an opponent- Instead, Kirishima has an active hitbox for Beta for the entire duration.

Eijiro Kirishima (Red Drive): Alpha travels slower. Bug fix so that Alpha>Beta movement tech no longer works.

Momo Yaoyorozu: Beta comes out faster and now blocks attacks in a semicircle in front of Momo. Attacks behind Momo still hit. Gamma takes less time to place and start firing.

All Might: Alpha deals 11 less damage across all levels.

All Might (Special Action): It now takes 40 seconds to fully recharge, whether from jump or fully depleting the gauge from carrying someone.

Shoto Aizawa: Alpha now properly pulls targets to you (bug fix). 

Tomura Shigaraki: Both Alpha AND Beta now hit slightly above the ground in a similar manner as Overhaul Gamma, in such a way that Hawks flying at ground level, alongside certain moves performed along the ground after jumping (such as Iida's Alpha- it temporarily stops the damage from what I found). 

Tomura Shigaraki (Catastrophe): Alpha, Beta, and the last hit of Gamma now hit slightly above the ground in a similar manner as Overhaul Gamma and the Strike Shigaraki changes for the same purposes. Alpha now travels faster and knocks down upon 2nd hit. In addition, the direct hit deals 12 more damage, and the indirect hit deals 10 less damage across all levels. The 1st hit of Gamma knocks down faster so that you cannot perform a second Gamma or beta after landing a direct Beta at the same target.

All for One (Special Action): Special Action now has a 5 second cooldown, instead of 20 seconds.

Dabi: HP increased to 400. Alpha travels faster. Beta now deals all damage in a single hit, and does 160 damage at max level, with level one dealing 20 more damage, and the levels inbetween adjusting accordingly. Additionally, you have 1 more charge at levels 1-3.

Dabi (Crazy Torch): HP decreased to 300. Alpha, when not powered by Gamma, charges faster. Beta no longer has tracking, and travels further when not powered by Gamma. Additionally, the final hit of Beta always does a hard knockdown, and the kick, when the grab does not connect, allows for recovery. Finally, the hit registration is now fixed. Gamma has a cooldown similar to Iida's Gamma, and no longer generates flame rings while active. Additionally, upon ending Gamma, it always does the final burst. 

Himiko Toga: Alpha, at levels 1-3, have a cooldown of .75 second per bullet, and at levels 7-9, a cooldown of 0.4 seconds. Beta cooldown increased by 7 seconds. Beta's range for the initial hit is doubled. At max level, the first hit of Beta deals 10 more damage, and the second and third hits now deal 42 more damage, and the following hits deal 50 damage each. (For an explaination, the ""dash"" at the start of Beta comes out in 3 hits. Right now, it deals 10, 33, and 33 damage, respectively. Afterwards, we get the 88 damage per hit. With the changes I made, it deals I think 41 damage more for hitting all hits? However, not hitting it at the start means you deal less damage.) Gamma has better tracking, a cooldown increase of 8 seconds, and deals 7 less damage across all levels per needle. (The following cooldown changes are VERY dependent on the Special Action changes I made)

Himiko Toga (Sting Dance): When using Alpha, there is a .5 second delay instead of the .33(?) delay before you can fire another Alpha, the bullet count is now increased to 10, and the cooldown is increased to 1.75 per bullet. Beta's cooldown is now doubled. Gamma's distance is increased by 1.5 at levels 4-9, alongside the speed of the second part of Gamma, and Gamma now does not gain an additional charge. Additionally, the cooldown for each charge is increased by 3.5 seconds (The following cooldown changes are VERY dependent on the Special Action changes I made)

Himiko Toga (Special Action): Transform now no longer resets your cooldowns. Instead, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma all recharge at the same rate while Transformed. (This effectively requires Toga to use blood effectively for longer periods of time to fully recharge their abilities. Also, Transform effectively has a ""cooldown"" until the next down OR until Gamma recharges- which, for both, is around 12-13 seconds \[per charge\] if I did my math right, meaning she ACTUALLY has to juggle cooldowns.)

Endeavor: Alpha and Beta bug fixes (ofc). Alpha now hits one additional time for each bullet (without changing the duration), and he has 6 bullets at all levels. Beta's first hit deals 40 more damage at level 9, 20 more damage at lvl 1, and all other levels are adjusted accordingly.  Gamma now takes less time to activate.

Endeavor (Special Action): Sustaining Sprint while using special action now costs 75% of the current drain. Using it to jump consumes 35% of the gauge, instead of 50%, and has less startup, and you can't use it if the gauge is under 35%.

Mirio: Increased to 250 HP (Mirio mains before the nerfs- tell me the old combos plz- I'll take it into consideration when posting to the discord)

Nejire Hado: Alpha travel speed is increased. Beta size is decreased, and subsequent hits deal damage every .5 seconds instead of .25 seconds(? Still- the point stands). Additionally, the gauge for Beta goes down faster. 

Overhaul: Alpha deals 5 more damage on the initial hit (so 80 per bullet, as, right now, the first hit is 15, while the other 3 are 20). Gamma deals 30 less damage across all levels, but stuns for twice as long.

Overhaul (Special Action): When healing, instead of fully healing and healing 125 shields while self-healing and fully healing both upon healing an ally, both using up both charges, self-healing heals for 175, prioritizing HP, and uses one charge, and healing an ally heals for 300, prioritizing HP, and uses one charge. (This allows him to be more flexible with his heals but heal for less during a fight most of the time. Also, allows for the second charge to be used to disrupt a combo even if you healed once.)

Twice: Remove Gamma tracking. (From what I know, Twice was fine before they added tracking? Correct me if I'm wrong tho)

Compress: Alpha stun is reduced, and fire rate is SLIGHTLY reduced (Maybe to 1.5 times a second instead of what seems to be 2 times a second?). 

Hawks:  Alpha deals 3 less damage at all levels. The subsequent hits of Beta now deal the same damage as the first hit. The last hit of Melee now causes a full knockdown. 

Itsuka Kendo: Alpha has a tighter spread. Beta insta-break bug fixed (if it wasn't already). Gamma damage increased by 36 damage at lvl 9, and damage for previous levels is adjusted accordingly. 

Mt. Lady: Gamma recharges at 6.5 seconds per bullet at levels 4-6, and at 5 seconds per bullet at levels 7-9. 

Cementoss: Alpha structure is shorter, and the second hit of Alpha deals 20 less damage at all levels. Gamma is thinner at levels 4-9. Beta is now fixed, if they didn't fix the wall bug stuff where it instantly broke sometimes. (People who have fought more Cementoss, and people who play him- tell me if these are bad changes)

Ibara: Alpha finishes faster. Beta now deal their second hit of damage faster, and finishes faster. Gamma hits faster. (I feel like the main reason why she isn't that great compared to the rest of the cast is because of how immobile she is. Hopefully this would help her? I don't play her though. I once again request help from people who main this character.)

Kurogiri: Alpha now properly is perpedicular to the surface it hits, if it hits a wall, floor, or ceiling. Beta damage is reduced by 15 at all levels. Gamma travels faster. (The beta change is mostly because triple Beta into Alpha is a thing, and while I think it's good that they have it, it does need toned down a LITTLE so that most the cast isn't screwed over by it and being flesh.)

Present Mic: Beta, when held down, now deals 5 less damage per hit. Gamma now has 2 charges instead of 3, and deals 20 less damage at all levels. Additionally, the multipliers for 1 and 2 teammates down or dead is now 1.25 and 1.5, respectively. (He should still be a proper strike character with this, but he's definitely overtuned, even if not as overtuned as other characters)

Present Mic (Special Action): Has 2 charges instead of 3.

If you're wondering, the character I changed the MOST was likely both Togas. In third place, it's Strike Dabi thanks to all the Beta and Gamma changes lol. In fairness though, I overhauled how Toga's Transform worked, and made sure to change a bunch of cooldowns, alongside the other changes I made.  Anyway, that's quite literally EVERY character, except for Denki (Lightning), which hasn't released yet, so if these changes are trash, tell me which ones! I'll start copying the list of changes at 3 PM CST to the official discord TOMORROW, so 23 hours and 50 minutes from this post going live (it took me 3 hours to type this all out, thanks to me having to test/find some stuff and find proper damage numbers, as the database only displays 1 of several damage numbers for multi-hit moves).

Twitching?,POTS,1i9wubb,2025-01-25 15:57:12,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1i9wubb/twitching/,TypicalMistake4040,Symptoms,"I'm not diagnosed with anything yet because I haven't been able to really talk much about it, but recently I tried to speak up about it with a family member but they kept saying it was ""anxiety"". I've had problems for YEARS and never said anything because I thought it was normal because people said it was just anxiety but it most definitely is not JUST anxiety  something is seriously wrong and it keeps getting worse everyday. I've talked to many people online trying to get somewhat of an idea of what might be happening, and my suspicion is that is might be POTS and VVS. I started getting ""shaking episodes"" in my hands back in 2021 were my hands would just start shaking so bad sometimes out of nowhere. I noticed a long time ago that my right was always worse then my left, and majority of the time it would happen in stressful situations but not always like I said. But recently I had a pots like ""episode"" and it was my whole body not just my hands(along with so many more symptoms) which is more typical for me. And again I assumed that the shaking was just anxiety again like everyone said but then it got worse. The shaking would get to the point where I couldn't hold things or do anything in general. I couldn't and can't function like everyone else. A while back it would be not just every once in a while, but more then once a day. Lately I've developed a new problem and I wouldnt really classify it as shaking, more like twitching. Probably like 2 months ago I would notice small jolts like movements every once in a while didn't really think much of it but not my hands this time it's my head. But then again it got worse, the moments in general and everything that comes with it. And ever since the last ""episode"" I had, it has gotten so bad that I'm literally constantly twitching. And I kept having spasms in parts of my body like, fingers, legs, and eyes mainly my right. And when I had that ""episode"" my mouth was stuck in place, weird to explain but my lips were puckering well I wasn't making them, in fact I tried to get it to stop but It didn't until a little bit after. This has happened for the second time yesterday when I kept twitching over and over again but not as bad. The twitching makes me even more anxious so it gets even more worse, and at some times I feel a bit out of it and kinda ""dizzy"" like ig? Not so sure to describe it. It makes me so exhausted and I feel so tired of moving but I can't control it and my neck hurts so bad. My eyes kinda move weird I would say that they are rolling back a bit but I feel that may be a bit of an exaggeration again not to sure how to describe it. The twitching also effects my speech a bit which I've always had a bit of a problem with but it makes it worse and I start to stutter, but when it's extremely bad i just can't think at all. Someone has mentioned before that the ""shaking episodes"" that I mentioned may be a result of tremors which may be true but again I'm not a doctor. But if it is, does the twitching relate to it? Or is it something completely different. I heard something about anxiety tics or something maybe that's a possibility but I'm not sure considering I don't think people with that have as long of ""episodes"" as I do but maybe I'm wrong. I honestly don't have a single clue on what's going on. I need to go to the doctors because everything just keeps getting worse and I'm literally going insane because of it, I can't function in general because of everything and I don't even have a choice. But the thing is my family member won't take me in, and on top of that the last time I had that ""episode"" she called for me and they wouldn't even let me come in because I needed to just go to the emergency room because my blood pressure was so high. My family member just said we'll go to the emergency room next time it's that high. Any idea of what might be going on?"

The other participants stare at the woman in curiosity.

The group is only known by its codename, Phoenix. Each individual present has a unique niche, yet their roles are equally important for the war effort and are not to be underestimated. The team captain pulls her arm to make her face him. He scans his notepad with his pen along the names until it stops the more feminine-sounding one.

""Mallorie, you're up. We have identified the whereabouts of a terrorist arms dealer and his small army, and we’re going to take him on.""

""Sir, I-""

The captain cut her off, his voice stern and uncompromising.

""This operation needs someone fast, discreet, and smart enough to get out unnoticed. We believe that's you. Go back to your apartment and meet here tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Don’t be late. Don’t.""

“Please call me May, sir.”

“Sorry, May.”

He forced a smile on his face and walked away from her, choosing another member to focus on. 

May reached home and spent a long time kicking a soccer ball against her wall. Surprisingly, she enjoys doing that since nothing she does can solve her endless yawning. She turns on her television and mindlessly scrolls through the channels, stopping at sitcoms out of habit. 

She lays on the couch, reaching for the TV remote without moving from her position to get it. She slumps her fingers along the keys and starts putting on her favorite show to watch, a habitual choice. Though it doesn’t necessarily spark her interest. As her eyes scan the screen, she gets lost in her thoughts, the bright colors and happy dialogue displaying a distraction, yet she can’t describe this empty feeling while watching this show. She doesn’t know what it is, but the show gave her something to focus on. As she watched her show, she felt no genuine interest and didn’t know why. May didn’t feel like answering all the questions her mind raced upon her. May walked towards the mirror, peeking one last glance at the screen before returning to her reflection. Her eyes focused on her rather tired expression, noticing the circles under her eyes. She paused, sighed, and then free-fell onto her bed. She shut her heavy eyelids before slowly dozing off.

Just as she was having vivid pictures dance through her mind, an unnecessarily loud ringtone woke her up and set her up in that manner, knowing she would have ignored all her calls otherwise.She grabbed the phone and laid her gaze on the screen, and as soon as the contact name read “Big Shot Captain Guy,” she pressed the green answer button.

""I’ll send you the coordinates. I have booked a place for us to meet. There are rooms there, so there is no need to go back to your apartment just to come back after every mission. Pack up.""

“Yes, si-“

The sound of a sudden beep of her phone call met her end.

May looks down at her clothes, her eyes landing on a water stain. Refusing to get out of bed, she rolled around. Her head thumped, and with an internal cry, she finally mustered the strength to get up. May started walking toward her closet to get something new to wear. It was sparse, with only 24 pairs of white wool T-shirts and 25 pairs of regular blue jeans, both in size L. Even though she was 90 pounds and 4'11"", she didn’t care about whatever image people perceived of her because of this. She preferred the feeling of loose clothes to tight ones; they made her feel itchy. Why should she sacrifice her comfort for the amusement of mere mortals? 

May's hands landed on the clothing hanger following a weary sigh, removing it with slow and meticulous movements, making sure not to snap this one. May tried to recall the last time she had broken a hanger, realizing it had been quite some time. She smiled, reminiscing about this fact, but she still frowned at the steps of switching attire. letting out another tired breath and continuing her movements, she removed her previously stained clothes and put on her clean pair. She starts walking to get out of her room, a realization now popping up in her brain like a lightbulb in a cartoon, coming back to her room and grabbing her bags."

I prefer voice chat but some use text. What ever and when ever works best for you.

So the campaign is set is the Dalelands of Faerun.
All maps are hand drawn on Grid paper.
You can go off the edge of the map, although ""here be dragons"" is literal. You've been warned.

Every grid square is 1/2 mile.
Movement on the main road, marked on the map is faster than moving through the forest. Dungeons have teleport circles for the same purpose.

You can go anywhere and do anything you want (within reason). There will be quests to complete that will possibly take you through the forest. As you move across the map, I will roll to check if you have an encounter. If you do, I roll on a D100 Random chart. If the outcome is thematic, you'll meet that encounter.
If the encounter isn't thematic enough, you won't meet that encounter. 

So it's not totally random what you encounter, but the dice do the majority of the decision making.

We are currently using the 2014 rules with some homebrew characters for balance purposes.

We use standard array +1, so all stats get a +1. Making the lowest stat a 9 and the highest a 16.

There is currently an TomeLock, a battle master, a divination wizard, a glamor bard, and an occasional Redemption Paladin.

You can play any official class/subclasses you want.

Most players are using dnd beyond for character creation.

Players are currently level 9.I don't run combat unless it makes role play sense. Most encounters can be talked your way out of with the right tools.
You will get exp for successful social encounters."

There were no atoms, only free baryons and free electrons. Photons were trapped in this cloud because they were unable to move significant distances before being scattered in this plasma. It was a dark and chaotic ""ocean"".

As the Universe expanded, it cooled, until parts reached about 3000K. At these points, the energy was low enough that electrons and protons were able to combine to form atoms -- the first hydrogen -- thus allowing the free movement of light.

This did not happen everywhere in this cloud all at once. Rather it happened in points that grew in spherical pockets. What was once a completely opaque plasma became interspersed with floating, glowing bubbles of transparency ...

Zanpakuto Sealed Appearance: Handmade Spring Steel Straight Blade Chinese War Dao Broadsword With Black Scabbard. 


Zanpakuto Name: Jinan (次男)
Translation: Second born Son 

Release command:
Translation: All Things in Your Creation, All Memories in Your Mind, All Emotions in Your Heart, All Colors Within Your Soul, Flicker and Spark, Creating Embers in the Moonlight, as all things are Gambled Away


Zanpakuto spirit & Inner World: Now The inner world of Jinan is a vast and extravagant, but oddly confusing, taking the form of a opera theater house, mixed with a carnival performance tent, creating a awe inspiring attitude, with ornate architecture and a sense of grandeur. The theater is adorned with velvet curtains as well as maroon, gold and black tapestries lining the overhead booths, gilded pillars wrapped in painted designs, and intricate carvings along the walls depicting ancient religious stories, creating an atmosphere of mystique and enchantment. The seating area stretches out in all directions, seemingly infinite, with rows upon rows of empty seats that fade into the distance, With red carpets rolling out Into the infinite as well inbetween each row, Leading up to a ornate door that can never be reached or opened from within the inner world. Despite the vastness of the theater, the audience seats remain seemingly empty. However, upon closer inspection, one can detect faint silhouettes of figures occupying the seats. These shadowy entities represent the spirits of past dreams and aspirations that I had at one point in my life observing and lending their support to me. They remain silent, their presence a reminder of the hope and power contained within my Soul.
Now Throughout the theater, suspended in mid-air, are a multitude of playing cards. These cards hover and swirl around the magician, creating intricate patterns and displays of magic. The cards emanate a soft glow, each representing a different aspect or ability of Jinan. They shimmer with energy and occasionally transform into ethereal manifestations of the Jinan's powers.
At the center of the theater a stage stretches out, as the stage looks like it could perform 15 musicals all at once, and in behind the stage are musical instruments as well as props and set pieces that change dynamically to match the magician's tricks and illusions. Trap doors, mirrors, and hidden compartments are scattered throughout, allowing for seamless transitions and unexpected surprises. as far as the eye can see, as the curtains to the stage are always drawn back and shining and candle torches go throughout the theater along the walls lighting it up. 
The stage serves as the arena where Jinan's abilities are unleashed with dramatic flair. 
And standing at this very center of the stage, stands the magician performer himself,  Jinan, the physical Zanpakuto, Behind him are two beings dancing and singing, one is a woman of fire, the other is a man made of oil. Now although his attire has changed numerous times, Jinan is mainly seen Dressed in an elegant, Black and Gold tailored suit with a top hat cape and fully covered gold and ivory Face mask, the magician, Jinan, exudes an aura of a charismatic devil wrapped up in showmanship. And while Some other attire consists of leopard print jackets, some of them being from halfway across the world, from different regions, with some of his costumes being completely goofy And in some cases look almost completely unusable because of how thick they are, With them also appearing completely over the top some of them even featuring things like peacock feathers, snake skin, and even rhinoceros horns. In additional to his attire, he possess a mischievous smile and twinkling star filled eyes that hint at their mastery of illusion and sleight of hand. The magician Jinan's movements are graceful and precise, their every gesture accompanied by a flourish of glowing cards.


Shikai Appearance: Although I am by no means bound to a release command to enter the Shikai state, as My unity with my Zanpakuto will have long-since and indefinitely surpassed such a point, Just like most other captain class Shinigami, I would mostly Say so as a way of showing respect to My Zanpakuto, giving it what I believes is the proper respect. 
To initiate the release form of My Zanpakuto, I nonchalantly grab My Zanpakuto with My right hand before holding it out in front of me the point of the tip facing fowards, then releasing the hilt of the sword I then leave it suspended in the air, as I begins, turning and levitating the weapon vertically to the right using delicately controlled vibrating strings of Rieatsu, which leaves it hovering right in front of Me. Then with a loud and authoritative voice, I speak aloud and in a deep and authoritative tone, the release command as if it were a personal mantra or a saying from a lifelong religious understanding. 

“All Things in Your Creation, All Memories in Your Mind, All Emotions in Your Heart, All Colors Within Your Soul, Flicker and Spark, Creating Embers in the Moonlight, as all things are Gambled Away, Jinan.”

Now upon the usage of the release command, my I grab my blade upside down and begin spinning it in my hand causing It to transform and turn into a golden beam of light, that shines as bright as the sun, before it begins transforming itself into large metal spear, over six feet tall, and Is similar in appearance to the legendary norse spear Gungnir, the metal of the spear is engraved with multiple different kanji/katakana such as Gamble (ギャンブル, Gyanburu) Fortune (財産, Zaisan) Luck (運, Un) Wish (願い, Negai) Value (価値, Kachi) Increase (増加, Zōka) Probability (確率, Kakuritsu) Jackpot (ジャックポット, Jakkupōtto) and with two smaller extensions on either side just underneath the spearheads similar in design to eagle wings, Now the spearhead is wickedly pointed and narrow and is nearly twenty inches long, it boasts a razor-sharp cutting edge along either side of the spearheads edge, and it is dull and indented on either side, capable of either blocking or slamming into an opponent, like a hammer, to cause massive bludgeoning damage. Now the deadliest part of the spearhead, however, is the tip, which rests at the end of the elongated pole. Although its strange and narrow blade makes it seem unwieldy to use the long-spear in a stabbing motion, with its sharpened point off-center thanks to its arrowhead-like design, its use is so purely ingrained within Me that i can find my target nearly one hundred percent of the time, calculating the difference between My line-of-thrust and the curve of My Zanpakutō. The reason why the puncturing tip is so deadly is simply due to it's weight along with both it's sharpness and roughness; with a point less than a few particles in diameter, and the sides of the blade being so rough, it can pierce through and shatter almost any material with ease upon impact, barreling and plowing through defenses and other Zanpakutō like a hot knife through butter.



Shikai abilities & Explanations. Now In the Shikai state, the Zanpakuto, known as ""Jinan - Second born Son,"" has one Ability known only as Kakekin no Zōka (賭け金の増加, Increased Bet): and while powerful it lacks directly ""defensive capabilities"" but it possesses the unique ability to absorb and convert energy wether reishi and rieatsu from the surrounding environment into indestructible playing cards which constantly float above and around my head. The first card that is created is the Number Ace card, representing duality and balance, As i can absorb energy from every sources, whether it be spiritual energy, reishi particles, or even the force of attacks directed towards me. Each attack absorbed contributes to the creation of a new card. However, to create each subsequent card, I must first either absorb energy which is equal to double the amount of attacks as compared to the previous card, Or i Charge my own Zanpakuto With my own power, Which allows me to cut the full charging time in half. For example, to create the first card the Ace, I must first absorb the amount of energy equal to that of two attacks. To create the second card, I must absorb energy which is equal to the amount of four attacks, and so on. This pattern continues, with each new card requiring double the amount of energy as compared to the previous card.
With the cards allowing me a multitude of abilities, such as the ability to use different card games to my advantage, the ability to Is seal away outside attacks, and even ""cut through"" other attacks. 
Now as more cards are created and exist on the battlefield, My own strength, speed, healing, and defense are enhanced. The presence of the cards acts as a catalyst, amplifying My physical attributes and granting them heightened capabilities, As I am able to draw on them like a battery. This boost is proportional to the number of cards in play.
Additionally, i gain control over the four elements - Water, Earth, Eind, and Fire, By using the power of my Zanpakuto (energy conversion) i can Convert the original energy into elemental energy. With them I can summon and manipulate these elemental forces to launch long-range attacks, create defensive barriers, or further augment My own abilities. The elemental control further adds further to my versatility in battle, allowing for strategic offensive and defensive maneuvers.
It also has one final passive ability which can be initiated at any time and it is called Gisei Dekki (犠牲 デッキ, Sacrificial Deck) it is an ability that when activated absorbs all of the cards belonging to whichever suit chosen and element they are affiliated with, this then transforms the Zanpakuto from its normal State of spiritual energy conversion, into a state which embodies said element.


Supēdo (スペード, Spade): Now the spade cards have the unique ability to enhance and boost my speed, and control the air surrounding airwaves, as the Spades suit can summon tornadoes, control air currents, and execute lightning-fast strikes and motions with enhanced speed and precision. 
Now when the Ace card is thrown it can cause a lightning storm that spans over 3-miles with multiple funnels of air surrounding the area that shoot out blades of high pressurized air and allows Me to enhance their speed by using streams of air and static electricity in the air to constantly move faster. But also creates a large sphere of swirling wind around Me, enhancing my defense and shield me from the gerated force, and Anything within my field related to earth can be controlled granting dominion over one element of wind, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both wind and sky, temperatures and weather, lighting static electricity and electricity, atmospheric pressure and temperatures, both mist and fog, weightlessness mass and flight, pollution and poison, both tornadoes hurricanes and tropical storm's, sound soundwaves and music, spinning and motion. With the King card having the ability to generate a large and condensed and electrified tornado of over ten miles, moving and spinning over 300 mph, as everything is absorbed into it's domain ot is stripped of its reishi and rieatsu Literally erasing them as they are pulled in. 
Now when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the suit of the Spade. 
Doing so transforms the Spear into a near perfect Wind type Zanpakuto as the Spearhead of the pole weapon becomes weathered and rusted as if it has been exposed to the elements for hundreds of years. 
As the Spearhead of the spear becomes Jagged and crooked pieces of it flake off as it crackles with lightning which dances and Arc's all across its surface. 
It then becomes covered in a powerful but nearly invisible force of Wind with the very edge of the spearhead being covered in a very large and violent gailing wind which is seemingly thin and sharp able to cut through most if not any type of metal as if it was a knife through butter.
With this ability I can generate hundreds of Wind type attacks creating Blades of wind which can split buildings in two, tornadoes of wind which can completely demolish parts of the battlefield, Cyclones and Vortexes which seemingly pull in and Shred opponent's bodies apart, As well as giant balls of wind which trap and shred the opponent apart from the inside their blood mixing with the Wind and turning it red, and more.  


Shinzō (心臓, Heart): Now the hearts cards If have the unique ability to heal My physical body, and are powerful as The Hearts card can create overly powerful water-based attacks and healing waves that wash over allies, cleansing and revitalizing them. strength and healing. 
When the Ace card is thrown, it emits a radiant watery dark aura aroumd me that not only enhances my healing power and capabilities but also shield me from the generated force and causes the water molecules in the air to shift around and take on form. Creating a whirlpool flood within a 1-mile radius that I can control, as using this water I can heal wounds on other people forcefully implant the water into an opponent's body allowing Me to control said water in the body to manipulate enemies like a puppet and can even use this water like a weapon, So I can either shoot off a simple, high pressurized bowl of water or even create entire low level tsunamis, as Anything within my field related to water can be controlled granting dominion over one element of water, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both ocean and sea, rain and clouds, snow ice and slush, aquatic wildlife, both cold and sub zero temperatures, arctic material and blizzards, blood and corpses, both hail snowstorms and frost, liquids and liquid state's, primordial water's. With the King card having the ability to Expand my field of control up to 13-miles allowing me to Generate a Large flood that churns and spins itself into a Whirlpool which Breaks apart everything in its domain, As it spins, All of the debris caught within turns it muddy and murky , but it continues to spin anyways as everything that collapses into It turns it poisonous and acidic to anything spiritual in nature the healing waters now turned deadly as it in dragged into the depths of the ""oceans floor"".
Now when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the suit of the Heart. 
Doing so transforms the Spear into an almost near perfect Water type Zanpakuto as the Spearhead of the pole weapon becomes unique and has a newly formed shape to it. 
As The spearhead then reforms as a rushing Gale of water which then solidifies the spearhead being made out of 100% pure ice water. 
As the inside of spearhead of the pole weapon is still liquid like as if the blade was water itself it begins flowing softly gently starting from the base and flowing directly up to the tip of the spearhead.
Moreover the edge of the spearhead begins to seemingly pour out and generate and endless amount of water which shoots outwards like a waterfall covering and coating the blade in pure glass like water which breaks off from the original and floats upwards as if lighter than air, as Through the water Other's are able to see as individual water droplets Cascade over the surface of the spearhead mixing with the gales of rushing water.
It is at this point that I become capable of manipulating water in any way to desire shaping it forming it altering it and generating it anyway that they pleases. 
With this ability I can generate hundreds of Water type attacks creating Blades and whips of water which can sever buildings in two, tsunamis and waves of water which can completely demolish parts of the battlefield, Bullets and pillars which seemingly Tear and rip opponent's bodies apart, As well as giant whirlpools of water which trap and shred the opponent apart from the outside inwards. 


Kurabu (クラブ部, Club): Now the club cards have the Unique ability to enhance my physical strength, and are incredibly powerful as The Clubs suit can unleash infernos, create walls of flames, and deliver explosive fire-based attacks, leaving trails of destruction in its wake and have the unique ability to constantly increase my physical and swing strength more with every swing. 
When the Ace card is thrown it allows me to generates a multitude of five large explosions, that form into hundred foot powerful pillars, of spinning fire which can burn anything until even it's ashes are burned away and which can summon hundreds of fireballs turn anything that it hits into ash, it also generates a powerful outward explosive burst that not only delivers a devastating blow to the opponent, but also creates a fiery aura around Me, enhancing my natural Strength in my body which shields me from the gerated force, and Anything within my field or reach related to fire can be controlled granting me dominion over one element of fire, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both heat and temperature, light and colors, explosions combustion and different nuclear possibilities, oils and napalm, both smoke and smog, volcanic based materials, bones soot and ash, both solar nuclear and different types of energy, candles and wax, and even divine flame. With the King card having the ability to create a total of sixty five, hundred foot tall powerful pillars, of spinning electrical flame within a 10-mile area that then extends outwards incinerating everything in it's path, before it collapses in on itself as all of the flames are absorbed into one pillar, which then explodes outwards and upwards, In the shape of a Blade, causing anything caught inside to be Incinerated as their body and even ash is burned away, from only the sheer heat of the explosion. 
Now when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the suit of the Club.
Doing so transforms the Spear into a near perfect Fire type Zanpakuto as the Spearhead of the pole weapon undergoes a change in nature the spearhead heating up in the very hand that wields it threatening to burn everything in it's path. 
Embers seemingly Flickering at the base of the spearhead with the edge of the spearhead becoming lit aflame as fire crackling with lightning Cascade over the surface of the spearhead twisting and churning. Whenever the spear is swung it leaves a trail of fire in it's path which can wilt anything left behind.
With this ability the I can generate hundreds of Fire type attacks creating Blades and Swords of fire which can completely reduce buildings to ash, as well as summon tornadoes and pillars of fire which can seemingly deconstruct and reduce parts of the battlefield to mere embers, even creating Balls and miniature suns which seemingly spread outwards and scorch the opponent's very bodies to nothingness, As well as create colossal beings of fire which both burn and destroy the opponent from the outside their body mixing with the Fire and being reduced back into atoms, and more. 


Daiyamondo (ダイヤモンド, Diamond): Now the diamond cards Have the unique ability to enhance my physical defensive capabilities, and they are incredibly strong as The Diamonds suit can allow me to control the shape and architecture of the earth itself, creating massive golems, protective fortifications, and devastating seismic attacks and have the ability to enhance my defense and manipulate the very earth.
Now When the ace card is thrown, it allows me to control anything within a 1-mile radius it also generates a powerful shockwave that not only delivers a devastating blow to the opponent but also creates a protective barrier around Me, enhancing my defense and shield me from the gerated force, and Anything within my field related to earth can be controlled granting me dominion over one element of earth, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both rock and stone, crystal and gemstones, steel iron and different metals different oils, both nature and poison, volcanic material and obsidian, bones and corpses, both sand glass and mirrors, mud and clays, marble. With the King card having the ability to Expand my field of control up to 13-miles allowing me to shatter and create mountains, control fault lines and the very crust and tectonic plates, cause earthquakes and can then use the broken rock to form and create asteroids, and More. 
Now whenever the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the card suit of the Diamond insignia. 
Doing so transforms the spear into a near perfect Earth type Zanpakuto as the spearhead of the pole weapon becomes old and worn out the blade becoming heavily chipped and rough as if it was struck hundreds of times by a large and jagged rock it's own surface adorned in scratches.
It also appears heavily covered in dust and dirt with debris covering the edge of the sword as if it was lodged in stone for years on end the body is now wrapped in old and aged dirty bandages.
Now whenever the spear is swung a giant cloud of dust and sand is always sure to follow in it's wake trailing in behind it. 
Now with this unique ability I can generate hundreds of Earth type attacks creating Gigantic Weapons made of Earth which can completely crush buildings with relative ease, form titanic powerful display of earth which can completely destroy and reform parts of the battlefield, make Landslides and Earthquakes which seemingly pull in and break opponent's bodies Into Peices crushing them with it's weight, As well as creating giant shockwaves of Earth which trap and shred the opponent's body into peices from the outside, and more.  


Jōkā (ジョーカー, Joker): Now the Joker cards are extremely special and are almost never actually used the reason being that these cards can only be especially summoned after I have created the entire deck and if i use any of the other cards even after the Joker cards have been summoned the ritual will become incomplete and the cards will dematerialize and fade out of reality, When these Two cards are summoned however the Pommel of the Spear transforms, emerging a pod that blooms open taking the form of a golden flower with its appearance taking the form of a mixture of three flower those being a guren, lotus, and spider lily. 
Now the Joker cards are incredibly powerful and unique as the Joker suits can shape Light and Darkness itself, creating massive constructs of of hardened light and darkness, the cards drawing power from both dark spaces like the color black, and the light of a person's soul, as well as draw power directly from the sun and moon as well as shadows, and can even completely warp the power of others by creating Illusions and bypassing the defenses of others by pulling the darkness directly out of their body and the light directly out of their soul a process which is extremely painful and nearly illegal for me to use against others, except for prisoners of the maggots nest and opponent's. 


—————————(Techniques)—————————


Erementaru Rūretto: Unmei no Te (エレメンタル ルーレット: 運命の手, Elemental Roulette: Destiny's Hand): Now this ability is one of the most powerful techniques that Jinan has as unlike normal techniques this one is played out into three different parts. Now additional information is that, Only in the Shikai state, can I perform the (Erementaru Rūretto: Unmei no Te) technique. Now the first part of this technique is called Kādo Genshō no Rensa (Card Decrease Cascade,) technique Or the first stage. 
By selecting and throwing multiple cards from the deck, each representing a different elemental suit, I can create a powerful elemental cascade of attacks. For example, throwing a Hearts card could generate a water-based projectile at full power, followed by a Diamonds card launching an earth-based attack, then a Spades card creating a gust of wind, and finally a Clubs card engulfing the target in flames. However The successive elemental assaults create a cascading effect, overwhelming the opponent with a rapid sequence of varied elemental forces but if I throws each card even one I would not be able to perform the second part of this technique.
Now the second part of this technique is called Kādo Genshō Saikuron (Card Decrease Cyclone,) technique. 
Now in order to perform this part of the technique I must have all 52 cards and when this technique is utilized I gather an immense amount of spiritual energy, before infusing it into the deck of cards. Then With a powerful swing of the Zanpakuto, the deck is sent spinning into the air, creating a swirling vortex of cards. The opponent becomes trapped within this vortex, and the cards start to rapidly rotate, each card representing a different element.
I then calls upon my own ""destiny, allowing fate to determine the order and nature of the attacks"". As The cards unleash a relentless barrage of elemental assaults, each card randomly selecting an element to manifest. 
The onslaught can include devastating water-based torrents, earth-shattering tremors, lightning-fast winds, and engulfing infernos. The unpredictable nature of the technique makes it extremely difficult for the opponent to defend against or evade, as they are subjected to a relentless assault of ever-changing elemental forces this however allows them to perform the third and final part of this technique.
Now the third and final part of the technique is called Kādo Genshō Hokai (Card Decrease Collapse,) technique.
Now In this devastating technique, the wielder utilizes the power of Jinan, to trap their opponent within a cyclone of elements and spiritual energy. 
Once trapped within the cyclone, the opponent becomes weakened by the intense forces exerted upon them.
As the opponent struggles to withstand the cyclone's onslaught, the Zanpakuto releases a surge of energy, causing the enchanted cards to stack themselves one atop the other  into a colossal deck just above the trapped opponent. 
This deck is encircled by four distinct spheres, each representing a different element: water, earth, wind, and fire.
With precise control over the elemental forces, the wielder commands the deck to plummet directly onto the opponent. The spheres surrounding the deck intensify, imbuing it with the combined power of the four elements. Now in a devastating display of elemental power the deck descends, and Upon impact, the colossal deck and the elemental spheres unleash an overwhelming wave of destruction. 
The destructive force generated by the elements rip open a tear in spacetime which then transforms into a cataclysmic void which obliterates everything in the pre-existing space within the cyclone, leaving no room for escape. The opponent is subjected to a cataclysmic assault, as the cards rain down upon them with immense force. The power generated by the elemental convergence eradicates the opponent's defense, obliterating them completely. Furthermore, the sheer force of the technique erases and resets the space within the cyclone, removing any trace of the opponent's presence until the technique dissipates. This ensures that the opponent is not only defeated but erased from existence within the confines of the cyclone.


—————————(weaknesses)—————————

Shikai Weakness. Now the weaknesses for My Zanpakuto is very simplistic in nature as the I cannot utilize this Zanpakuto to rush and forcibly attack opponents, Without being left vulnerable, instead the nature of it can only allow it to absorb defend and use the cards it creates as a way to both counter attack and use for a form of Defense. It can also be utilized in such a way that it won't need to counter attack instead it could unleash the barrage all at once but this would be unwise as this can lead to Me being trapped in places some minutes on end and even being constantly and consistently exposed to the combined attack of one or more people. 
Now I could overcome this weakness by channeling my own spiritual pressure into it but the drain on me would be greater then simply absorbing outside forms of energy, As it would require, more energy expenditure on my part. 
However when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it completely transforms not only the Zanpakuto but also transforms it's weaknesses, As whenever it selects a suit of cards it will destroy everything else other than said suit beyond that each time I chooses a suit I can no longer have access to any of the other elements and I can only use the sword for 10 minutes at most. With the final downside being that whenever the shikai is once again inevitably sealed the wielder will not be able to use his own Zanpakuto for an entire day. 


Shikai Technique Weaknesses. The weaknesses for this technique are also very simple as well as in order to use it it requires a full deck of 52 cards and in the first part if any cards are thrown Directly at the opponent it is attempting to harm them instead of trapping them they will not be able to use the next two parts of this ability this could lead to the wielder unfortunately not being able to correctly use the technique as it would not have the same amount of power as since it requires all 52 the wielder would need to get the last card before they could then unleash the technique again and if all 52 cards are used in this technique they can then not activate the bankai as the Bankai requires all 52 cards as well.

Zanpakuto Sealed Appearance: Handmade Spring Steel Straight Blade Chinese War Dao Broadsword With Black Scabbard. 


Zanpakuto Name: Jinan (次男)
Translation: Second born Son 

Release command:
Translation: All Things in Your Creation, All Memories in Your Mind, All Emotions in Your Heart, All Colors Within Your Soul, Flicker and Spark, Creating Embers in the Moonlight, as all things are Gambled Away


Zanpakuto spirit & Inner World: Now The inner world of Jinan is a vast and extravagant, but oddly confusing, taking the form of a opera theater house, mixed with a carnival performance tent, creating a awe inspiring attitude, with ornate architecture and a sense of grandeur. The theater is adorned with velvet curtains as well as maroon, gold and black tapestries lining the overhead booths, gilded pillars wrapped in painted designs, and intricate carvings along the walls depicting ancient religious stories, creating an atmosphere of mystique and enchantment. The seating area stretches out in all directions, seemingly infinite, with rows upon rows of empty seats that fade into the distance, With red carpets rolling out Into the infinite as well inbetween each row, Leading up to a ornate door that can never be reached or opened from within the inner world. Despite the vastness of the theater, the audience seats remain seemingly empty. However, upon closer inspection, one can detect faint silhouettes of figures occupying the seats. These shadowy entities represent the spirits of past dreams and aspirations that I had at one point in my life observing and lending their support to me. They remain silent, their presence a reminder of the hope and power contained within my Soul.
Now Throughout the theater, suspended in mid-air, are a multitude of playing cards. These cards hover and swirl around the magician, creating intricate patterns and displays of magic. The cards emanate a soft glow, each representing a different aspect or ability of Jinan. They shimmer with energy and occasionally transform into ethereal manifestations of the Jinan's powers.
At the center of the theater a stage stretches out, as the stage looks like it could perform 15 musicals all at once, and in behind the stage are musical instruments as well as props and set pieces that change dynamically to match the magician's tricks and illusions. Trap doors, mirrors, and hidden compartments are scattered throughout, allowing for seamless transitions and unexpected surprises. as far as the eye can see, as the curtains to the stage are always drawn back and shining and candle torches go throughout the theater along the walls lighting it up. 
The stage serves as the arena where Jinan's abilities are unleashed with dramatic flair. 
And standing at this very center of the stage, stands the magician performer himself,  Jinan, the physical Zanpakuto, Behind him are two beings dancing and singing, one is a woman of fire, the other is a man made of oil. Now although his attire has changed numerous times, Jinan is mainly seen Dressed in an elegant, Black and Gold tailored suit with a top hat cape and fully covered gold and ivory Face mask, the magician, Jinan, exudes an aura of a charismatic devil wrapped up in showmanship. And while Some other attire consists of leopard print jackets, some of them being from halfway across the world, from different regions, with some of his costumes being completely goofy And in some cases look almost completely unusable because of how thick they are, With them also appearing completely over the top some of them even featuring things like peacock feathers, snake skin, and even rhinoceros horns. In additional to his attire, he possess a mischievous smile and twinkling star filled eyes that hint at their mastery of illusion and sleight of hand. The magician Jinan's movements are graceful and precise, their every gesture accompanied by a flourish of glowing cards.


Shikai Appearance: Although I am by no means bound to a release command to enter the Shikai state, as My unity with my Zanpakuto will have long-since and indefinitely surpassed such a point, Just like most other captain class Shinigami, I would mostly Say so as a way of showing respect to My Zanpakuto, giving it what I believes is the proper respect. 
To initiate the release form of My Zanpakuto, I nonchalantly grab My Zanpakuto with My right hand before holding it out in front of me the point of the tip facing fowards, then releasing the hilt of the sword I then leave it suspended in the air, as I begins, turning and levitating the weapon vertically to the right using delicately controlled vibrating strings of Rieatsu, which leaves it hovering right in front of Me. Then with a loud and authoritative voice, I speak aloud and in a deep and authoritative tone, the release command as if it were a personal mantra or a saying from a lifelong religious understanding. 

“All Things in Your Creation, All Memories in Your Mind, All Emotions in Your Heart, All Colors Within Your Soul, Flicker and Spark, Creating Embers in the Moonlight, as all things are Gambled Away, Jinan.”

Now upon the usage of the release command, my I grab my blade upside down and begin spinning it in my hand causing It to transform and turn into a golden beam of light, that shines as bright as the sun, before it begins transforming itself into large metal spear, over six feet tall, and Is similar in appearance to the legendary norse spear Gungnir, the metal of the spear is engraved with multiple different kanji/katakana such as Gamble (ギャンブル, Gyanburu) Fortune (財産, Zaisan) Luck (運, Un) Wish (願い, Negai) Value (価値, Kachi) Increase (増加, Zōka) Probability (確率, Kakuritsu) Jackpot (ジャックポット, Jakkupōtto) and with two smaller extensions on either side just underneath the spearheads similar in design to eagle wings, Now the spearhead is wickedly pointed and narrow and is nearly twenty inches long, it boasts a razor-sharp cutting edge along either side of the spearheads edge, and it is dull and indented on either side, capable of either blocking or slamming into an opponent, like a hammer, to cause massive bludgeoning damage. Now the deadliest part of the spearhead, however, is the tip, which rests at the end of the elongated pole. Although its strange and narrow blade makes it seem unwieldy to use the long-spear in a stabbing motion, with its sharpened point off-center thanks to its arrowhead-like design, its use is so purely ingrained within Me that i can find my target nearly one hundred percent of the time, calculating the difference between My line-of-thrust and the curve of My Zanpakutō. The reason why the puncturing tip is so deadly is simply due to it's weight along with both it's sharpness and roughness; with a point less than a few particles in diameter, and the sides of the blade being so rough, it can pierce through and shatter almost any material with ease upon impact, barreling and plowing through defenses and other Zanpakutō like a hot knife through butter.



Shikai abilities & Explanations. Now In the Shikai state, the Zanpakuto, known as ""Jinan - Second born Son,"" has one Ability known only as Kakekin no Zōka (賭け金の増加, Increased Bet): and while powerful it lacks directly ""defensive capabilities"" but it possesses the unique ability to absorb and convert energy wether reishi and rieatsu from the surrounding environment into indestructible playing cards which constantly float above and around my head.

Supēdo (スペード, Spade): Now the spade cards have the unique ability to enhance and boost my speed, and control the air surrounding airwaves, as the Spades suit can summon tornadoes, control air currents, and execute lightning-fast strikes and motions with enhanced speed and precision. 
Now when the Ace card is thrown it can cause a lightning storm that spans over 3-miles with multiple funnels of air surrounding the area that shoot out blades of high pressurized air and allows Me to enhance their speed by using streams of air and static electricity in the air to constantly move faster. But also creates a large sphere of swirling wind around Me, enhancing my defense and shield me from the gerated force, and Anything within my field related to earth can be controlled granting dominion over one element of wind, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both wind and sky, temperatures and weather, lighting static electricity and electricity, atmospheric pressure and temperatures, both mist and fog, weightlessness mass and flight, pollution and poison, both tornadoes hurricanes and tropical storm's, sound soundwaves and music, spinning and motion. With the King card having the ability to generate a large and condensed and electrified tornado of over ten miles, moving and spinning over 300 mph, as everything is absorbed into it's domain ot is stripped of its reishi and rieatsu Literally erasing them as they are pulled in. 
Now when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the suit of the Spade. 
Doing so transforms the Spear into a near perfect Wind type Zanpakuto as the Spearhead of the pole weapon becomes weathered and rusted as if it has been exposed to the elements for hundreds of years. 
As the Spearhead of the spear becomes Jagged and crooked pieces of it flake off as it crackles with lightning which dances and Arc's all across its surface. 
It then becomes covered in a powerful but nearly invisible force of Wind with the very edge of the spearhead being covered in a very large and violent gailing wind which is seemingly thin and sharp able to cut through most if not any type of metal as if it was a knife through butter.
With this ability I can generate hundreds of Wind type attacks creating Blades of wind which can split buildings in two, tornadoes of wind which can completely demolish parts of the battlefield, Cyclones and Vortexes which seemingly pull in and Shred opponent's bodies apart, As well as giant balls of wind which trap and shred the opponent apart from the inside their blood mixing with the Wind and turning it red, and more.  


Shinzō (心臓, Heart): Now the hearts cards If have the unique ability to heal My physical body, and are powerful as The Hearts card can create overly powerful water-based attacks and healing waves that wash over allies, cleansing and revitalizing them. strength and healing. 
When the Ace card is thrown, it emits a radiant watery dark aura aroumd me that not only enhances my healing power and capabilities but also shield me from the generated force and causes the water molecules in the air to shift around and take on form. Creating a whirlpool flood within a 1-mile radius that I can control, as using this water I can heal wounds on other people forcefully implant the water into an opponent's body allowing Me to control said water in the body to manipulate enemies like a puppet and can even use this water like a weapon, So I can either shoot off a simple, high pressurized bowl of water or even create entire low level tsunamis, as Anything within my field related to water can be controlled granting dominion over one element of water, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both ocean and sea, rain and clouds, snow ice and slush, aquatic wildlife, both cold and sub zero temperatures, arctic material and blizzards, blood and corpses, both hail snowstorms and frost, liquids and liquid state's, primordial water's.

Now when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the suit of the Heart. 
Doing so transforms the Spear into an almost near perfect Water type Zanpakuto as the Spearhead of the pole weapon becomes unique and has a newly formed shape to it. 
As The spearhead then reforms as a rushing Gale of water which then solidifies the spearhead being made out of 100% pure ice water. 
As the inside of spearhead of the pole weapon is still liquid like as if the blade was water itself it begins flowing softly gently starting from the base and flowing directly up to the tip of the spearhead.
Moreover the edge of the spearhead begins to seemingly pour out and generate and endless amount of water which shoots outwards like a waterfall covering and coating the blade in pure glass like water which breaks off from the original and floats upwards as if lighter than air, as Through the water Other's are able to see as individual water droplets Cascade over the surface of the spearhead mixing with the gales of rushing water.
It is at this point that I become capable of manipulating water in any way to desire shaping it forming it altering it and generating it anyway that they pleases. 
With this ability I can generate hundreds of Water type attacks creating Blades and whips of water which can sever buildings in two, tsunamis and waves of water which can completely demolish parts of the battlefield, Bullets and pillars which seemingly Tear and rip opponent's bodies apart, As well as giant whirlpools of water which trap and shred the opponent apart from the outside inwards. 


Kurabu (クラブ部, Club): Now the club cards have the Unique ability to enhance my physical strength, and are incredibly powerful as The Clubs suit can unleash infernos, create walls of flames, and deliver explosive fire-based attacks, leaving trails of destruction in its wake and have the unique ability to constantly increase my physical and swing strength more with every swing. 
When the Ace card is thrown it allows me to generates a multitude of five large explosions, that form into hundred foot powerful pillars, of spinning fire which can burn anything until even it's ashes are burned away and which can summon hundreds of fireballs turn anything that it hits into ash, it also generates a powerful outward explosive burst that not only delivers a devastating blow to the opponent, but also creates a fiery aura around Me, enhancing my natural Strength in my body which shields me from the gerated force, and Anything within my field or reach related to fire can be controlled granting me dominion over one element of fire, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both heat and temperature, light and colors, explosions combustion and different nuclear possibilities, oils and napalm, both smoke and smog, volcanic based materials, bones soot and ash, both solar nuclear and different types of energy, candles and wax, and even divine flame. With the King card having the ability to create a total of sixty five, hundred foot tall powerful pillars, of spinning electrical flame within a 10-mile area that then extends outwards incinerating everything in it's path, before it collapses in on itself as all of the flames are absorbed into one pillar, which then explodes outwards and upwards, In the shape of a Blade, causing anything caught inside to be Incinerated as their body and even ash is burned away, from only the sheer heat of the explosion. 
Now when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the suit of the Club.
Doing so transforms the Spear into a near perfect Fire type Zanpakuto as the Spearhead of the pole weapon undergoes a change in nature the spearhead heating up in the very hand that wields it threatening to burn everything in it's path. 
Embers seemingly Flickering at the base of the spearhead with the edge of the spearhead becoming lit aflame as fire crackling with lightning Cascade over the surface of the spearhead twisting and churning. Whenever the spear is swung it leaves a trail of fire in it's path which can wilt anything left behind.
With this ability the I can generate hundreds of Fire type attacks creating Blades and Swords of fire which can completely reduce buildings to ash, as well as summon tornadoes and pillars of fire which can seemingly deconstruct and reduce parts of the battlefield to mere embers, even creating Balls and miniature suns which seemingly spread outwards and scorch the opponent's very bodies to nothingness, As well as create colossal beings of fire which both burn and destroy the opponent from the outside their body mixing with the Fire and being reduced back into atoms, and more. 


Daiyamondo (ダイヤモンド, Diamond): Now the diamond cards Have the unique ability to enhance my physical defensive capabilities, and they are incredibly strong as The Diamonds suit can allow me to control the shape and architecture of the earth itself, creating massive golems, protective fortifications, and devastating seismic attacks and have the ability to enhance my defense and manipulate the very earth.
Now When the ace card is thrown, it allows me to control anything within a 1-mile radius it also generates a powerful shockwave that not only delivers a devastating blow to the opponent but also creates a protective barrier around Me, enhancing my defense and shield me from the gerated force, and Anything within my field related to earth can be controlled granting me dominion over one element of earth, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both rock and stone, crystal and gemstones, steel iron and different metals different oils, both nature and poison, volcanic material and obsidian, bones and corpses, both sand glass and mirrors, mud and clays, marble.

Now whenever the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the card suit of the Diamond insignia. 
Doing so transforms the spear into a near perfect Earth type Zanpakuto as the spearhead of the pole weapon becomes old and worn out the blade becoming heavily chipped and rough as if it was struck hundreds of times by a large and jagged rock it's own surface adorned in scratches.
It also appears heavily covered in dust and dirt with debris covering the edge of the sword as if it was lodged in stone for years on end the body is now wrapped in old and aged dirty bandages.
Now whenever the spear is swung a giant cloud of dust and sand is always sure to follow in it's wake trailing in behind it. 
Now with this unique ability I can generate hundreds of Earth type attacks creating Gigantic Weapons made of Earth which can completely crush buildings with relative ease, form titanic powerful display of earth which can completely destroy and reform parts of the battlefield, make Landslides and Earthquakes which seemingly pull in and break opponent's bodies Into Peices crushing them with it's weight, As well as creating giant shockwaves of Earth which trap and shred the opponent's body into peices from the outside, and more.  


Jōkā (ジョーカー, Joker): Now the Joker cards are extremely special and are almost never actually used the reason being that these cards can only be especially summoned after I have created the entire deck and if i use any of the other cards even after the Joker cards have been summoned the ritual will become incomplete and the cards will dematerialize and fade out of reality, When these Two cards are summoned however the Pommel of the Spear transforms, emerging a pod that blooms open taking the form of a golden flower with its appearance taking the form of a mixture of three flower those being a guren, lotus, and spider lily. 
Now the Joker cards are incredibly powerful and unique as the Joker suits can shape Light and Darkness itself, creating massive constructs of of hardened light and darkness, the cards drawing power from both dark spaces like the color black, and the light of a person's soul, as well as draw power directly from the sun and moon as well as shadows, and can even completely warp the power of others by creating Illusions and bypassing the defenses of others by pulling the darkness directly out of their body and the light directly out of their soul a process which is extremely painful and nearly illegal for me to use against others, except for prisoners of the maggots nest and opponent's. 


—————————(Techniques)—————————


Erementaru Rūretto: Unmei no Te (エレメンタル ルーレット: 運命の手, Elemental Roulette: Destiny's Hand): Now this ability is one of the most powerful techniques that Jinan has as unlike normal techniques this one is played out into three different parts. Now additional information is that, Only in the Shikai state, can I perform the (Erementaru Rūretto: Unmei no Te) technique. Now the first part of this technique is called Kādo Genshō no Rensa (Card Decrease Cascade,) technique Or the first stage. 
By selecting and throwing multiple cards from the deck, each representing a different elemental suit, I can create a powerful elemental cascade of attacks. For example, throwing a Hearts card could generate a water-based projectile at full power, followed by a Diamonds card launching an earth-based attack, then a Spades card creating a gust of wind, and finally a Clubs card engulfing the target in flames. However The successive elemental assaults create a cascading effect, overwhelming the opponent with a rapid sequence of varied elemental forces but if I throws each card even one I would not be able to perform the second part of this technique.
Now the second part of this technique is called Kādo Genshō Saikuron (Card Decrease Cyclone,) technique. 
Now in order to perform this part of the technique I must have all 52 cards and when this technique is utilized I gather an immense amount of spiritual energy, before infusing it into the deck of cards. Then With a powerful swing of the Zanpakuto, the deck is sent spinning into the air, creating a swirling vortex of cards. The opponent becomes trapped within this vortex, and the cards start to rapidly rotate, each card representing a different element.
I then calls upon my own ""destiny, allowing fate to determine the order and nature of the attacks"". As The cards unleash a relentless barrage of elemental assaults, each card randomly selecting an element to manifest. 
The onslaught can include devastating water-based torrents, earth-shattering tremors, lightning-fast winds, and engulfing infernos. The unpredictable nature of the technique makes it extremely difficult for the opponent to defend against or evade, as they are subjected to a relentless assault of ever-changing elemental forces this however allows them to perform the third and final part of this technique.
Now the third and final part of the technique is called Kādo Genshō Hokai (Card Decrease Collapse,) technique.
Now In this devastating technique, the wielder utilizes the power of Jinan, to trap their opponent within a cyclone of elements and spiritual energy. 
Once trapped within the cyclone, the opponent becomes weakened by the intense forces exerted upon them.
As the opponent struggles to withstand the cyclone's onslaught, the Zanpakuto releases a surge of energy, causing the enchanted cards to stack themselves one atop the other  into a colossal deck just above the trapped opponent. 
This deck is encircled by four distinct spheres, each representing a different element: water, earth, wind, and fire.
With precise control over the elemental forces, the wielder commands the deck to plummet directly onto the opponent. The spheres surrounding the deck intensify, imbuing it with the combined power of the four elements. Now in a devastating display of elemental power the deck descends, and Upon impact, the colossal deck and the elemental spheres unleash an overwhelming wave of destruction. 
The destructive force generated by the elements rip open a tear in spacetime which then transforms into a cataclysmic void which obliterates everything in the pre-existing space within the cyclone, leaving no room for escape. The opponent is subjected to a cataclysmic assault, as the cards rain down upon them with immense force. The power generated by the elemental convergence eradicates the opponent's defense, obliterating them completely. Furthermore, the sheer force of the technique erases and resets the space within the cyclone, removing any trace of the opponent's presence until the technique dissipates. This ensures that the opponent is not only defeated but erased from existence within the confines of the cyclone.


—————————(weaknesses)—————————

Shikai Weakness. Now the weaknesses for My Zanpakuto is very simplistic in nature as the I cannot utilize this Zanpakuto to rush and forcibly attack opponents, Without being left vulnerable, instead the nature of it can only allow it to absorb defend and use the cards it creates as a way to both counter attack and use for a form of Defense. It can also be utilized in such a way that it won't need to counter attack instead it could unleash the barrage all at once but this would be unwise as this can lead to Me being trapped in places some minutes on end and even being constantly and consistently exposed to the combined attack of one or more people. 
Now I could overcome this weakness by channeling my own spiritual pressure into it but the drain on me would be greater then simply absorbing outside forms of energy, As it would require, more energy expenditure on my part. 
However when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it completely transforms not only the Zanpakuto but also transforms it's weaknesses, As whenever it selects a suit of cards it will destroy everything else other than said suit beyond that each time I chooses a suit I can no longer have access to any of the other elements and I can only use the sword for 10 minutes at most. With the final downside being that whenever the shikai is once again inevitably sealed the wielder will not be able to use his own Zanpakuto for an entire day. 


Shikai Technique Weaknesses. The weaknesses for this technique are also very simple as well as in order to use it it requires a full deck of 52 cards and in the first part if any cards are thrown Directly at the opponent it is attempting to harm them instead of trapping them they will not be able to use the next two parts of this ability this could lead to the wielder unfortunately not being able to correctly use the technique as it would not have the same amount of power as since it requires all 52 the wielder would need to get the last card before they could then unleash the technique again and if all 52 cards are used in this technique they can then not activate the bankai as the Bankai requires all 52 cards as well.

Annihilation = Eat Pray Love,AnnihilationMovie,1i9w58e,2025-01-25 15:26:18,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnnihilationMovie/comments/1i9w58e/annihilation_eat_pray_love/,TraditionalCollege70,,"I originally had Annihilation as my least favorite Garland movie, I just thought it was a mess of inconsistent sci-fi ideas. After rewatching 5 years later I now think it's my favorite Garland movie, despite what I consider inconsistent sci-fi ideas and a world that has effectively random rules. The reason being that I know see the much more consistent emotional story driving the plot and manifesting the metaphorical world of the shimmer. Although I am not a fan of eat pray love; a similar story where “eat” is a mutated nightmare bear and pray is your buddy encouraging you to cut out their intestines? sign me up!

First watching the movie the cheating subplot seemed like a boring set of scenes meant to have some emotional grounding for the story. I was wrong. The marriage subplot is the story, and the rest a symbolic narration of how love can disappear and the very real human ways we deal with this loss. Garland wrote a layered narrative that I think is meant to raise many different kinds of questions. I don’t think the mutations in the movie have one meaning or purpose, but I think the interpretation I will provide now is the core story behind all the layers. Its an almost purely emotional story, and very well told.

The summary is this: wife has affair, husband discovers it, withdraws. Wife is confounded, *why is this man now a stranger to me?* Wife goes on a journey to find out only to realize she knew what it was all along, he has moved on, he is a different person now. In confronting this truth she must decide whether she will seek annihilation or acceptance. The answer at the end is unambiguous, acceptance. Now let me explain:

When Kane reappears he is somebody else, an alien basically. He is a stranger to her. Although he is in a hospital bed somewhere Lena is compelled to “save” him, inexplicably by going into the shimmer. We enter the shimmer.

Everyone in the shimmer has some kind of trauma, a child passed away, addiction, terminal illness, shattered marriage, etc. Another tidbit that Cass lays out is they all have “passed lives”. A past life implies some version of you has been transformed (or destroyed). The psychologist says: “People dont understand there is a difference between self-destruction and suicide”, revealing the psychological nature of annihilation.

Lets detour into the tittle’s meaning. The constant references to cancer and biological mutations lay out a duality of beauty and death: irrevocable transformation can mean the death of one thing, but the rebirth of another, perhaps more beautiful thing. I believe the title is Annihilation and not Transformation though, because it captures the key fact that as one thing transforms into another, it must die in some way, what it was once gets lost.

All this leads me to the lighthouse scene. This is Lena symbolically reaching her core, and accessing the information she would not let herself see before. The video tape and her husband incinerating himself, and then an alien in his body walking out is a physical representation of the psychological process that took place, which she could not face until now. She destroyed the marriage. The man that loved her is dead. 

The above sets the stage for her battle with an enemy that is at the very center of the shimmer, an enemy that takes her form and her movements. Because it mirrors her perfectly, to hurt it means it would hurt her. I cannot think of a better more beautiful way to capture with sci-fi an inner struggle like the one Lena goes through. This is a fight against herself. According to one of the characters the psychologist wanted to face “it” and Lena wanted to fight “it”, but the cathartical moment for Lena was that when facing “herself” she chose to annihilate herself and her double. Her manner of fighting wasn't driven by rage or fear, it was driven by acceptance, that she would not leave that lighthouse, yet her double must not leave it either. As soon as the decision is made and the grenade explodes (in her face) she magically runs away unharmed.

Why exactly this happens makes sense only from the emotional standpoint. When she is back at the base and meets her husband she asks if he is the man he was before. He says “I don't think so”, without anger, without ulterior motive, without trying to take over the world or whatever the alien might want to do. He does not want, as the psychologist said of the alien. That is because Kane has gone through his own character’s arch of transformation and transcendence. He does not feel anything for her, he has moved on.

On the other hand when he asks Lena we don't get an answer, but we don't need one, the prior scene gave us the answer. When interviewed we see a strange glimpse of her hand refracting in the glass of water. Her refracted hand (this is genius) appears to face her while her own hand faces away, giving the impression that her hand is being held by another, and featured prominently in these hands are wedding bands.

I think this is the answer to what happened in the lighthouse, the climactic scene. Viewing the lighthouse scene though its symbolism, when she exploded that granade she accepted her own destruction. But it wasnt borne out of fear, struggle, or rage against herself. It was acceptance. Acceptance of the ugly side of herself, her actions, her destructiveness. Thats what escaped, an integrated whole. That hand we see holding hers, with the wedding band, thats the part of her that loves Kane, and will continue to love him. But her survival is her acceptance that she has lost him. To get there she had to go on a journey, face her fears, and make the hardest choice: to destroy herself in order to make room for something better."
Does anybody else feel desensitized about women at this point?,itsthatbad,1i9w4on,2025-01-25 15:25:37,2,0.75,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/itsthatbad/comments/1i9w4on/does_anybody_else_feel_desensitized_about_women/,Cute-Revolution-9705,Men's Conversations,"I feel like I’ve “evolved” to the point where romance doesn’t even interest me. Nor do I look at anything cute or sexual that women do that used to be attractive to me. I’m just like checked out in a sense. I think my biology has caught up to my brain or something because most thirst traps I see just feel like blantant attention seeking instead of anything remotely sexy. I think when women TRY to be sexy now it just comes off as unattractive. I think at this point it’s more interesting to me when a woman’s sexy without trying. 

I think we need to bring back finishing schools or schools where young women are just taught and trained to act in a respectful and tasteful manner where they just do it automatically without thinking. You know the thing where they walk with a book on their head? I’m not saying it should be done as formal education, but the same way I as a young man spent years in the gym and looksmaxxing to be better I feel women should be held to that standard as well. When I watch old movies and read old books and see how women used to balance books on their heads or sit a certain way or even posture in a certain way the training process actually looks rigorous and feels respect worthy. 

I think this is slightly off topic, but my coworker Tina is a woman in her 40s, but she’s a perfect example of this. She’s very tastefully pretty, but her charm comes off from her mannerisms and the way she sits, or eats or moves. It’s very charming and extremely rare. It’s like she was trained to be this way, but it’s so natural. It’s not like she’s got a voluptuous, pornstar body but she’s thin, has a pretty almost doll like face but it’s all tied together with the mannerism, postures and movements. I think women would get much more higher quality men if they were more like my co-worker Tina. "

Should I stay with this company or should I switch? (For indians),careeradvice,1i9w01z,2025-01-25 15:19:58,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1i9w01z/should_i_stay_with_this_company_or_should_i/,beautifully_insanee,,"Here’s a little context: I graduated last year from a reputable college under the University of Delhi and landed a job at Zomato through campus placement. It’s a customer experience role (yeah, proper chat and CALL process). I and a lot of other freshers fell for it as it was pitched under the name of (Associate Accelerator Program), where it was mentioned that with a maximum of 6 months’ experience in customer support, we’d be given opportunities to move to our preferred departments (any). I wanted to move to the marketing vertical.

Fast forward, I am now more than 7 months in, and the only opening I was offered (not individually—they rolled out a form to test the writing abilities, and I was good at it) was for the Online Relationship Management role, and they rejected me in the interview (most likely because I mentioned marketing as my interest in the interview). This profile was for replying to the queries raised on Zomato’s support handle on social media channels.

Others who were hired in the same batch as me, in majority, have been moved to the 
Discount management team, 
restaurant support team, 
ORM, 
restaurant onboarding (administrative work), 
District’s support supervision, 
travelers team (basically managing travel plans for high-end customers). 

A few have become quality analysts or team leads in customer support (they prefer experienced ones for this one). Some have been moved to the key accounts manager profile (sales role).

In my opinion, all of the people (and mind you, there are HANDFUL only who were moved) have settled for something just in the name of promotion. It wasn’t really a promotion, nor was this their preference. They all were approached by HR and then moved.

Now, coming to me—I haven’t been approached. The reason they have given me: I have a high number of leaves. I had typhoid last year, so I was on bed rest for 15 days straight and took some extra leaves besides that. This year, my motivation to work has literally died, and hence, I am taking many leaves.

I never saw myself stuck in such a profile and feel that I have WASTED 7 months of my life/career. I feel this profile is not even worth putting in my CV. Worst of all, I don’t even get leaves for festivals!!!! (No extra pay either + 2 hours of overwork asked.)

My close ones have been suggesting I get another profile/job, maybe in a startup, and the best ones I have been shortlisted for are social media manager roles. It seems fun to me, but honestly, I don’t want to leave the name tag of such a brand either. It’s the hope of “maybe I’ll get approached for movement tomorrow” that is keeping me here.

Now, what do you think I should do? Stay here and hope for a better opening for me or go for a profile in some startup, which might not have much visibility?

Suggest me some good roles too in which I can kickstart my career as I eventually want to move towards a “brand manager” profile in a reputable company

TL;DR: I graduated last year and joined Zomato through campus placement in a customer experience role, hoping to transition to marketing through their “Associate Accelerator Program.” Seven months in, I’ve only been considered for an ORM role, which I didn’t get, likely due to mentioning my marketing interest. Others from my batch have been moved to various teams, but I haven’t been approached, with HR citing my high leaves from typhoid and low motivation. Feeling stuck and undervalued, I’m debating whether to stay for better opportunities or move to a startup"

In my opinion, all of the people (and mind you, there are HANDFUL only who were moved) have settled for something just in the name of promotion. It wasn’t really a promotion, nor was this their preference. They all were approached by HR and then moved.

Now, coming to me—I haven’t been approached. The reason they have given me: I have a high number of leaves. I had typhoid last year, so I was on bed rest for 15 days straight and took some extra leaves besides that. This year, my motivation to work has literally died, and hence, I am taking many leaves.

I never saw myself stuck in such a profile and feel that I have WASTED 7 months of my life/career. I feel this profile is not even worth putting in my CV. Worst of all, I don’t even get leaves for festivals!!!! (No extra pay either + 2 hours of overwork asked.)

My close ones have been suggesting I get another profile/job, maybe in a startup, and the best ones I have been shortlisted for are social media manager roles. It seems fun to me, but honestly, I don’t want to leave the name tag of such a brand either. It’s the hope of “maybe I’ll get approached for movement tomorrow” that is keeping me here.

Now, what do you think I should do? Stay here and hope for a better opening for me or go for a profile in some startup, which might not have much visibility?

Suggest me some good roles too in which I can kickstart my career as I eventually want to move towards a “brand manager” profile in a reputable company

TL;DR: I graduated last year and joined Zomato through campus placement in a customer experience role, hoping to transition to marketing through their “Associate Accelerator Program.” Seven months in, I’ve only been considered for an ORM role, which I didn’t get, likely due to mentioning my marketing interest. Others from my batch have been moved to various teams, but I haven’t been approached, with HR citing my high leaves from typhoid and low motivation. Feeling stuck and undervalued, I’m debating whether to stay for better opportunities or move to a startup"

Introducing $WINDOWS—the cryptocurrency that brings back the nostalgia of simpler times, when every blue screen was an adventure and every system update was a thrill (or a challenge). This isn’t just a token; it’s a legendary throwback reimagined for the blockchain age.

Once the gateway to the digital world, Windows defined an era of innovation, chaos, and connection. Now, $WINDOWS picks up the legacy, combining the charm of the past with the limitless possibilities of the future.

Introducing $WINDOWS—the cryptocurrency that brings back the nostalgia of simpler times, when every blue screen was an adventure and every system update was a thrill (or a challenge). This isn’t just a token; it’s a legendary throwback reimagined for the blockchain age.

SHIB Daily Projection: Saturday,SHIBArmy,1i9vw74,2025-01-25 15:15:11,5,1.0,0,https://i.redd.it/jnd1kpnz67fe1.jpeg,NihilistHUGZ,Technical Analisys 🖍✨✨✨,"Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

These are all the signs of a market at a crossroads. The best way to think of everything currently is going back to my ‘Group A and Group B’ analogy where you have Neutral ground across multiple time frames with multiple Indicator classes aligning to show a Weak Bullish outlook overall. The way to look at these two pressures today is in a Short term group A versus a Long term group B. Our Short term Bullish signals are showing Buyers spiking OBV Short Volume and STC signaling the beginning of an Uptrend cycle. When we combine some of our positive CMF and CO values, we can see that this Short term group is accumulating, helping to hold the price in a positive Consolidation.

The pressure of the Long term Bearish investors, appears in the OBV Long term values combined with the price being BELOW the 200-Day EMA shows that it's enough pressure to keep the market from ‘Price Action’. The negative PPO and PVT values signal the underlying Sell pressure. All of this Neutral ground is highlighting the overall Consolidation with RSI and CMO highlighting Momentum indecision. The price is within our Ichimoku Cloud and Bollinger Bands, which is one of the characteristics of Consolidation. The good thing is with our LOW Volatility Indicators, we can expect that any price movements will be quite stable without a clear catalyst. Unfortunately, that drifting sideways tends to stretch the patience of investors and can lead to increases in FUD/FOMO.

We are positioned similarly to yesterday and again, it's only going to go the way of the Bulls or the Bears. If we can find ourselves breaking ABOVE the Supertrend with increased Buy Volume, we will begin to test our ‘Wall of Resistance’. My expectation is that for whatever reason, the $0.00002000 level is crucial for SHIB and we will stay right around that price for the foreseeable future until something changes in the market which catalyzes the Long term Sellers to slow their pace or for Short term Buyers to increase theirs.

Looking into our Long term Support and Resistances shows we rest right around the Neutral major pivot point at that expected price mentioned earlier of $0.00002000. The market has the potential to break ABOVE either the ‘Wall of Resistance’ or BELOW the ‘Wall of Support’ at any time. If we see the price begin rising rapidly, then we're going to probably at MAX reach up to the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00002160. If we begin to see Sell Volume outpace Buy Volume and a sharper Downtrend with increasing Volatility sets in, we could see the price push as LOW as the bottom of the ‘Wall of Support’ around where the 3-Day moving average crosses over the 10-Day moving average and should stall out around the 3rd level Support pivot point in a range from about $0.00001900 to as LOW as $0.00001850.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. 

The petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.

Stretching lol? I can’t stretch tight muscles without releasing them first (myofacial trigger point ect),flexibility,1i9vt3n,2025-01-25 15:11:24,0,0.33,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/flexibility/comments/1i9vt3n/stretching_lol_i_cant_stretch_tight_muscles/,MooseBlazer,,"Kind of a rant and informational post combined. And wondering if there are others here who have  this. 

If you disagree, that means your body is different than mine. Don’t down vote me for it.

Quickpoint- I am somewhat trained in the varieties (and trademark names ) of myofascial release. 

Throughout the years on the Internet, I’ve seen so many people offer suggestions of stretching and or Yoga to people who have very tight muscle tension. Unfortunately is not always possible unless you release the muscle tension first and let it melt away.  In addition to being rigid, movements with this condition are often jerky.

People with “normal” muscle health would not know this.(or at least not the extreme version of it.)

15 years ago, I learned from several sources of different variations of muscle and tendon release.  using thumbs lacrosse ball and other various odd tools . This is the only relief I get. Quite frankly it’s a pain in the ass. I have to do this repeatedly.

There are people with this mysterious condition who are actually athletic and work out their whole lives so it’s not a question of not being fit. It’s a question of the tissues not healing correctly and maybe some sort of insufficient blood flow to the muscle tissues. 

It’s amazing the amount of different types of physical therapist chiropractors, and doctors I’ve asked about this with no explanation. At least in modern times most of them know some type of muscle release to do versus trying to stretch a muscle that won’t stretch.

It would be interesting to see if there’s others out there like this who can make this a conversation. 

In my case, if there is a medical reason for this, the fact that I work out might be covering it up.  

If I did not exercise and work out or did not do my muscle release things stated above, I would be totally out of shape and almost unable to move. 

The fibromyalgia label is a well used scapegoat for doctors to get you to leave without conventional medicine actually figuring out a root cause.  Taking pain relievers, and muscle relaxants to cover up a problem is not the answer lol.

#KipRunsFast,nosleep,1i9vkpb,2025-01-25 15:01:14,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i9vkpb/kiprunsfast/,Resident_Tooth_8892,,"*Here’s the truth: this gear is nothing without me. My legs, my mind, my talent—that’s what makes the magic happen. Sorry to everyone who bought the same shoes thinking they’d run like me. They won’t. #KipAndOnlyKip #WahoosAreTheFuture #KipRunsFast.*

These are the types of posts Kip Hoffbloom posted – along with a perfectly curated flat lay of his gear, with a trophy in the corner for motivation, and his lucky blue Brooks hat. One could imagine him posting, quickly exiting out, and waiting for his phone to chirp out notifications. Kip was trail running’s poster child—living proof that not all grit and glory comes without a side of ego.

You know the ones – those guys (and sometimes ladies – let’s not be judgemental), who preach being an ultra trail runner isn’t just a lifestyle—it’s a higher calling. Sure, not everyone can handle it. And, let’s be real: it takes a special kind of person to spend hours alone on the trails, conquering terrain that would break most people in minutes. While others waste their weekends binge-watching TV, ultra runners are out there grinding through miles of wilderness, proving they’re tougher, faster, and more resilient than 99% of the population. This isn’t just about running—it’s about domination. It’s for people like Kip—people who refuse to settle for mediocrity and need the world to know it. And the best way to let the world know? Post it.

And, he did – daily. Actually, multiple times a day. There were posts of his clothes, supplements, and medals. Smiling wide, Kip always standing tall in the middle, flanked by his supposed minions. Sprinkle in a few ambassador branded salutes, a couple support the efforts to bring a missing female runner home, and a lot of coffee cheers – and you had his feed set to a science.

Kip was training for a 100-mile trail race – the MadMan 100. And, though Kip was egotistical, rather sexist, politically small minded, and enlisted predatory tactics to coerce attention from females in the run club, people began to take notice. As soon as he posted about this next training cycle, The Wahoos, a local run club, jumped in to comment and like the posts. He got invited to podcasts, and soon his fanbase on Insta and Strava soared. Training for an ultra is grueling, but he was thriving. By February, his routine locked in. The winter landscape made for even better pictures. Running in shorts in sub-zero weather? That’s the kind of grit that gets you reshared.

One morning, after snapping a quick selfie, breath fogging the air, his beard already dripping with icicles, he set off on a secluded trail he had run hundreds of times. The trailhead sign was littered with flyers – upcoming events, missing people notices, and an advertisement for hunting guide services. Kip obviously didn’t read these – why would he? He knew what races were coming, and frankly, they made for a poor backdrop to any selfie.

This morning felt like any other—until he saw her. In the distance, through the trees, a woman moved, her gait impossibly fluid, like she was floating over the uneven terrain. Other runners frequently populated these woods, but something about her—the way she seemed to vanish just as he thought he’d catch up. Her tracks were light and small, like a deer’s. Farther away, her pony tail bobbed like a rabbit’s tail, as it ducked for cover.

Over the next few weeks, he couldn’t stop looking for her. Every few days, Kip would catch a glimpse of this phantom female runner – her pink hat bobbying through the brush. Each time, she would remain just out of reach. His heart raced, not from exertion, but from anticipation. Kip never saw her car in the lot, so she must’ve used another access point. He began parking at different trailheads, running at odd times, burning through PTO just to find her. Ultra running can be an obsession, and for him, it (or she) had become all-consuming.

The lack of sleep and the miles were taking their toll. Kip’s times were slowing, his body aching from shin splints, blisters, and frostbite. Kip’s beard grew shaggy, streaked with gray, and his eyes—he could see it in the rearview mirror—had that wild look. 

MadMan 100 was less than a month away, and Kip was ready to begin tapering – which meant less time on the trails – unless he wanted to die trying. 

And then, in early March, Kip saw her again. This time, she was clearer, her form more defined based on the proximity to him. She stopped, waved, and then disappeared into the trees. His heart pounded as he slammed his truck into park, leaving the keys inside. He knew these trails like the back of his hand and sprinted to cut her off at the bridge.

The mist clung to the forest that morning, muffling Kip’s footsteps as he closed the distance. The closer he got, the more uneasy he felt. Light in a forest can be uncanny – and, as he moved swiftly, Kip couldn’t help but notice there was a darkness creeping onto the trail, though no clouds or canopy obstructed the light from above. Trees and their limbs, barron and naked, moved uncharacteristically, appearing to shudder and jut at him as he approached. Large black birds perched, high above, watching his progress.

 At the cutoff, Kip finally closed in at the bridge. Just ahead, was his trophy – the runner. He could see her whole figure now – swiftly running, feet seeming to never quite touch the ground. Suddenly, her form seemed to shift unnaturally, bending and blurring like something out of a nightmare. Her pace wasn’t a run or a walk but a strange, erratic rhythm that both drew Kip in and filled him with dread. As her image seemed to flash in and out before him, like a television with a poor signal, her image was transferred to a tangled mess of bushes and brush.

When Kip finally stopping, reaching her, reality hit him like a blow. She wasn’t alive. She wasn’t even human anymore. What Kip saw was a decayed corpse, grotesquely entangled in the gnarled branches of an ancient oak. She was still in running gear, her bright clothing dulled by moss and dirt, even the bright, pink hate. She’d been there a long time, swallowed by the wilderness, forgotten. The only movement now was the gentle swishing of her hair, caught, yet free flowing in a cool breeze.

Kip stumbled back, his breath hitching in his throat. The woods were silent, save for the pounding of his heart and a low shuddering from the trees that groaned in the wind. Turning, he bolted toward his truck, mind racing. He couldn’t explain what he had seen—and wasn’t sure he wanted to. Had this woman – this runner – ever actually been here? Had he been running all this time for nothing? Who was he chasing?

These thoughts played through in his mind, as he tried to make sense of what just happened. Moving swiftly, Kip began to mediate the same words over and over – Kip Runs Fast. Kip Runs Fast.

But now, the trails are darker, the paths overgrown. He had  been here before, yet he couldn’t find his way out. Trees he hadn’t noticed before lay across paths, and the well worn grooves in the spring mud appeared grassed over. The mile markers became distorted or the numbers no longer followed a logical sequence. The woods went on forever. More than once, he turned a corner and saw the woman, with sun bleached hair, still entangled in the branches of the tree. Opening his mouth to scream, his voice was lost – or possibly overshadowed by the angry caw of the crows watching the scene unfold. All he could do was press on, as the night gathered around him. 

Those who followed Kip were alerted to a new post, which was accompanied by an image of a man, huddled up in a fetal position in a clearing of brambles. Hugging himself, hand holding his phone, which shined like a beacon from the matted grass:

*I’ve been running forever. No end. She’s still here. I’m still here. #NoWayOut #Endless #LostInTheLoops. Maybe I never will. #LostForever #EndlessLoop #UltraRunnerHell #KipRunsFast #KipRunsForever #NoWayOut*"

In Youku's infinite wisdom, all the remaining episodes have been uploaded but are locked behind a paywall until Jan 29, when regular airing will resume at the pace of one episode per day. My plan's to cover Eps 9-12 and the Biyou Village battle in two posts, this one and the next, saving the finale for a separate discussion of its own. At one post every couple days or so, I'll be finished around the time the paywall lifts and can then reply to comments or answer any questions people might have as they catch up on the whole season.

**RECAP**

*Episode 9*

Feng Baobao, a red backpack strapped across her chest, rides a bicycle hitched to a covered cart down the streets of Biyou Village at night. A man exiting a bar greets her and asks what she's doing up so late. Her answer that she's delivering goods makes the man laugh. She motions him closer and knocks him out, putting his unconscious body on the cart. At the village entrance, she's collected a pile of unconscious villagers that she counts before riding her way back to the village to fetch more. She's confronted by Qiu Rang, who's suspicious of her doings. Her initial blow to knock him out doesn't land, so she grabs and twists his arm, interrupting his posturing. Qiu Rang pulls away and postures some more, telling Baobao that he'll demonstrate his power to her as he reaches for his Flowing Golden Ruyi. Only to find that Baobao had pickpocketed him earlier. His attitude instantly changes, and he pleads w/Baobao to return his treasure to him since she can't use it, anyways, but Baobao simply takes off across the rooftops w/a ""come and get it"" wave of the stolen Ruyi. The two start to argue, Qiu Rang calling Baobao shameless for taking advantage of the unsuspecting and Baobao rejoining that it's his own fault for sticking the Ruyi so conspicuously in his pocket, quoting Xu Si as an authority on this, and that she's wanted this toy ever since she saw him use it. Qiu Rang is infuriated.

Somewhere in the woods, Fu Rong runs to meet up w/Ma Xianhong's other operators while Zhuge Qing tries to convince her to stay out of the coming battle. He asks whether Biyou Village is really that important to her and says the temps are not so easy to handle. Fu Rong is disappointed at his lack of care and loyalty, to which Zhuge Qing replies that it's not that he doesn't feel those emotions, but rather that he doesn't extend them to just anybody. The only one he cares for and is loyal to here is her. He holds no friendship towards the other people of the village and still doesn't know why Fu Rong came here. When she seems reluctant to tell him, he doesn't press, only adding that while you can lay down your life for causes that are worthwhile, she needs to think hard about whether there's any cause worth her life in Biyou Village. She admits that she shouldn't have expected him to get involved. Zhuge Qing clarifies that he's not unwilling to go w/her; if she's certain of her decision, he'll support her, for her sake alone. Fu Rong receives a message that the fighting has started, and the two hurry away.

They encounter Lao Meng, who's relieved he's finally found them. He says they're different from the other operators, and there are some things that must be explained in person. The temps' only targets are Ma Xianhong and Biyou Village itself. They plan to set fire to the village, driving the uninvolved villagers to evacuate; they don't intend to harm anyone who doesn't stand by Ma Xianhong's side. Fu Rong has never seen Ma Xianhong do anything save for help those in need, so how can it not be harm to destroy him and the village he worked so hard to build? Lao Meng argues that whether Ma Xianhong is good or bad doesn't matter when, in his blind self-righteousness, he's sheltering criminals like Zhao Guizhen. Fu Rong maintains that she has an obligation to defend the village that took her in when she was in desperate straits. She moves to attack the reluctant Lao Meng, who pulls out a sheaf of papers for her to peruse. Seeing Fu Rong grow more and more upset as she reads, Zhuge Qing asks her what's wrong. Lao Meng says there's nothing NDT can't uncover and tells Zhuge Qing that in those records is a side of Fu Rong he may not have seen. When she moves again to attack him, Lao Meng begins reading aloud bank transactions from his phone, each one hitting Fu Rong like a physical blow w/a comic book bang effect until Fu Rong is kneeling on the ground, buried under debt statements and loan defaults. Turns out Fu Rong spent all her money on the men she dated, who variously cheated on her w/other women or broke up w/her soon as they squeezed her dry, moving on to the next target. Lao Meng and Zhuge Qing can't help laughing a bit at all this. Zhuge Qing eventually crouches down next to a sniffling Fu Rong, telling her that love can make you crazy and lose sight of your own bottom line. She must learn to love herself a little more and not be so afraid that no one will love her in return. He adds that he finds her love-obsessed brain cute and that at least, unlike her past boyfriends, he's not after her money.

Zhuge Qing informs a politely trying to be inconspicuous Lao Meng that they surrender to NDT. Lao Meng assures them that NDT won't detain them for long if they cooperate w/the investigation. He further tells Fu Rong that NDT's evaluation of her is very good, as she never used her swordsmanship to cause trouble even under the duress of her financial problems, and that NDT's willing to discuss providing aid to pay off her debts. Zhuge Qing hugs Fu Rong to his side and is about to depart w/her when suddenly he turns around to see Wang Ye watching him. Lao Meng's normal voice is replaced by a sports announcer's tones as he narrates Wang Ye's running tackle of Zhuge Qing, who shoves Fu Rong aside. Zhuge Qing tries to tell Wang Ye that he's already surrendered, only for Wang Ye to seal his mouth w/a clod of dirt and clothesline him gleefully up into the air, then down--""KO!"" commentates Lao Meng--where he continues to punch Zhuge Qing and bash his head against the ground, yelling all the while that he's heartbroken it's come to blows, he really didn't want to do this, please don't blame him, etc. On the sidelines, Lao Meng asks Fu Rong if maybe Zhuge Qing owes Wang Ye money. Wang Ye implores Zhuge Qing to not worry about their friendship and fight back. Zhuge Qing again tries to tell Wang Ye about his surrender. Wang Ye jumps high in the air, both hands making victory signs, and steps all over Zhuge Qing, an actual shot from the donghua w/Hou Minghao's face copy-pasted on like a meme cutting in. Zhuge Qing finally gets through to Wang Ye. Who pulls him up by the arms and very disingenuously apologizes for his premature attacks against Zhuge Qing, though Zhuge Qing should have *of course* told Wang Ye about the truth of his situation sooner, which raises Zhuge Qing's ire.

The two keep swatting at each other while Lao Meng reminds them that it's best for Zhuge Qing to take Fu Rong down the mountain to where NDT reinforcements will meet them. Fu Rong is surprised that NDT is sending so many forces, and Lao Meng explains that Biyou Village must be contained before matters grow serious. Wang Ye pulls a somewhat unwilling Zhuge Qing away for a private talk. He calls Zhuge Qing a coward for surrendering soon as the going gets tough. Unfazed, Zhuge Qing suggests that as a coward, he should've been spared his beating, which Wang Ye deems a light punishment. Wang Ye goes on to admit he's actually very pleased that Zhuge Qing was able to pull back from being drawn into Ma Xianhong's troubles at the brink but wonders whether Zhuge Qing has even the slightest regret in regards to betraying Ma Xianhong, who after all treated him quite well. Zhuge Qing tells Wang Ye he need not worry that his association w/Ma Xianhong has deepened into any sort of sympathetic friendship b/c, unlike Wang Ye whose compassion is warm and understanding, Ma Xianhong disregards all propriety and never considers the feelings of others. As Zhuge Qing figures his business w/Ma Xianhong is finished after helping him perfect his furnace, Zhuge Qing can now leave w/a clear conscience. Wang Ye recalls that Zhuge Qing claims to make decisions based on his own selfish interests. Is what he came to Biyou Village seeking already his then? Zhuge Qing smiles and says that, as a sorcerer same as him, Wang Ye can go divine that.

Later, as he watches Zhuge Qing walk away w/Fu Rong, Wang Ye inwardly thinks that Zhuge Qing's changed and become much more relaxed in his own skin. Lao Meng has one last question for Zhuge Qing. Besides Qiu Rang, Zhuge Qing's the only other in the village who could've learned Divine Mechanism Converts All. Has he? Zhuge Qing denies it. Lao Meng's disappointed b/c the temps were hoping Zhuge Qing could help them dismantle Ma Xianhong's defensive formation so Zhang Chulan can locate the furnace, but Zhuge Qing returns that you don't have to know Divine Mechanism Converts All to do that. Back in the village, Baobao shouts that there's a fire, waking up the villagers, who gather outside to look around. When Qiu Rang accuses her of lying, she tells him that she'll set the fire presently and starts running across the rooftops reaching into her backpack to throw out the bottles, actually Molotov cocktails, she prepared earlier. The villagers and Qiu Rang scramble to put out the fires, but it's no use, and the whole village is soon ablaze.

Ma Xianhong views the chaos through his fly cams and orders his operators by radio to capture the temps alive, to serve as bargaining chips in negotiations w/NDT after. Chulan finds him there in the courtyard where the puppet show was held, empty stage lit red by many hanging lanterns, and once again tries to convince Ma Xianhong to back down. Ma Xianhong accuses Chulan of delaying him in conversation to buy time for his accomplices to make their moves. Chulan emotionally declares that he is trying to protect Ma Xianhong, in recognition of their grandfathers' sworn brotherhood. He begs Ma Xianhong to stay put until the battle's outcome is decided, arguing that Ma Xianhong has already done enough for Chen Duo. Ma Xianhong sits down on the courtyard steps and asks Chulan to share w/him how he and his grandfather have been these past years.

Elsewhere, Ding Zihuan, Zhong Xiaolong, and Hamuchagai are about to lead a group of villagers into the fight when suddenly Ding Zihuan is violently kneecapped, his leg twisting under him. He looks up only to get headshotted by a bullet of qi. Hei Guan runs around a corner and starts popping dudes like he's in a multiplayer FPS game; Zhong Xiaolong and Hamuchagai take cover. Zhong Xiaolong activates his X-ray vision and reports Hei Guan's position to Hamuchagai, who tackles him and holds him down. Just as Hei Guan is about to shoot Hamuchagai in the face, Zhong Xiaolong flicks out a projectile of his own--a rock, like he used against Wang Ye--and knocks off Hei Guan's forearm pipe weapon, but not before Hei Guan's shot lands, sending Hamuchagai flying into a wall. Zhong Xiaolong's follow-up shot slams Hei Guan through a door into an adjacent street.

Zhong Xiaolong is taken aback when Hei Guan stands up again unhurt from his attack. Hei Guan explains that his black pipe isn't a weapon but a training tool that siphons off some of his qi. Zhong Xiaolong has been joined by about a dozen other noob villager Outsiders, and one of them encourages the rest not to be afraid of fighting one man. They all charge at Hei Guan. Meanwhile, Ma Xianhong tells Chulan that before his great-grandfather died--that is, Ma Benzai, creator of Divine Mechanism Converts All--he only had one eye left and both his arms were broken. Ma Xianhong also personally saw his grandfather die, his left leg cut off. He comments that Chulan and his grandfather have not had an easy time of it either, and Chulan replies that people like them should cherish their present lives even more. He asks Ma Xianhong what changed recently, as when Biyou Village was first founded, its inhabitants mostly kept to themselves. Stalking Wang Ye and Zhuge Qing, sending Chen Duo to kidnap Mei Jinfeng--these are not like Ma Xianhong's usual MO. Ma Xianhong says that he just can't treat the other inheritors of the Eight Supremes as strangers.

He originally watched the Luotian Dajiao (Outsider Martial Arts Contest) for Chulan, but Chulan's behavior was so shameless--cue highlights reel--he didn't know whether to laugh or cry. At any rate, Ma Xianhong was reassured that Chulan had the protection of NDT. His attention instead turned to Wang Ye, as Fenghou Qimen's successor, and Zhuge Qing, skilled in both sorcery and qi forging. Of Jinfeng, he only says he was tasked by a person he can't refuse and Chulan shouldn't inquire further. While he admits he was seeking a sorcerer to help him perfect his furnace, he built it and Biyou Village to help others like Chen Duo. And, he adds, to help himself. Chulan seizes upon this new information, asking Ma Xianhong what's wrong w/him. Ma Xianhong only reveals that his mind is sick and that he's almost recovered, thanks to his furnace. Then he calls an end to their conversation, remarking that Chulan has done enough to delay him. He advises Chulan to not interfere in his fight w/the temps, who he's certain he can handle. As Ma Xianhong turns to leave, Chulan again stops him and this time spouts a lie about how Ma Xianhong must choose btw Chen Duo and Biyou Village, his furnace. Give up Chen Duo, Chulan begs Ma Xianhong, and keep your village and furnace. Ma Xianhong tells a sorrowing Chulan that he can't do this and prepares himself for battle, the round red beads of the bracelets he wears on both wrists splitting apart to slot into a glowing array that lines his hands and feets atop a pitch black armor. Ma Xianhong intends to keep both Chen Duo and Biyou Village. After he's out of earshot, Chulan laments that Ma Xianhong is too honest; it's *almost* embarrassing to destroy Ma Xianhong's furnace. He radios Lao Meng for an update. Zhuge Qing wonders that Chulan is so confident he'll help them but starts giving directions.

Ma Xianhong apologizes to the villagers via the speakers on his insect drones for concealing that Biyou Village was in conflict w/agents from NDT, who finally made their move tonight. As his voice-over continues that the enemy is here to capture Chen Duo for reasons he won't get into, Wang Zhenqiu knocks out another man in a street alley, gloved hand glowing pink as he draws it in a caress over the man's face. Xiao Zizai, wearing a backpack, hikes through the woods. As Xiao-*ge*, Lao Meng, Qiu'er, and Hei Guan listen in frames across the bottom, Ma Xianhong declares that he won't let them take away Chen Duo but will instead go to war against them. Chen Duo dresses, as Ma Xianhong tells the villagers this battle has nothing to do w/them and they're no match for the strength of the temps. It's his own personal choice to fight, and he's already opened the road out of the village. He implores those who don't wish to get involved to leave the battlefield w/a clear conscience. Many of the villagers run to escape, but some argue that even if they run, they'll simply fall into NDT's hands. Ma Xianhong welcomes those who remain to fight w/him. He locates Lao Meng and Qiu'er, who waves at him, by fly cam and instructs his followers to stall them until he arrives to deal w/them. Qiu Rang goes after Lao Meng by himself while sending the villagers against Qiu'er. As he's chased down the streets by a mob, Qiu'er radios that easy mode is over.

Zhao Guizhen runs through the woods, a cloth satchel slung over his shoulder, but stops when he spots Xiao Zizai waiting for him. After Xiao-*ge* kicks him to block his escape, Zhao Guizhen tells him that he won't interfere in their business w/Chen Duo. Xiao-*ge* radios that he's in position. Hei Guan confirms, an alley full of groaning people behind him. Baobao pops out of the ground, dragging w/her an unconscious Zhang Kun; she reports in, as Ma Xianhong steps into view before her. Lao Meng says he's coming as he runs down the village streets, complaining that he hasn't exercised enough recently. Qiu Rang arrives to be his sparring partner. Lao Meng summons a swarm of hornets w/a snap of his fingers that Qiu Rang sucks into one of Ma Xianhong's Pokéballs. When Lao Meng rushes forward to attack, Qiu Rang easily blocks his strike onehanded and sends him flying back. Qiu Rang mocks that Lao Meng ought to summon some ancient guardian monster to fight him. Lao Meng laughingly asks what era they're in. Qiu Rang takes just one step forward and suddenly starts swaying on his feet, blinking his eyes and shaking his head as if to clear it.

Lao Meng, back to Qiu Rang, explains that beast tamers were indeed the laughingstocks of the Outsider world in the past b/c the conception the people of the past had of what counts as an animal was too narrow. Whereas the development of science and technology has weakened other Outsider abilities, advances in biology have greatly expanded the limits of a beast tamer's power. As Qiu Rang breaks out in hives all over his body, Lao Meng reveals that he's trained his beast taming technique to control bacteria and other microbes. One touch, and he can stimulate the microorganisms w/in your body to rapidly reproduce and even target your organs. Qiu Rang falls to the ground, convulsing. Better than calling himself a beast tamer, Lao Meng prefers to be considered a microbiology expert and poses for a hero shot, back appropriately to the explosion. Lao Meng turns to leave, embarrassed when he trips on a fallen pole.

In a standoff w/Baobao, Ma Xianhong notes that she seemingly defeated earthbender Zhang Kun in his own domain and robbed Qiu Rang of his treasured Ruyi; Chulan didn't lie to him about the temps' strength. Baobao chucks the Ruyi at Ma Xianhong, whose protective talisman blocks it automatically. He moves forward to attack as Baobao retreats, only for her to bizzarely stop and in exaggerated slow motion tell a confused Ma Xianhong to come chase her quickly, then resume running away as fast as she can. She reports that, as planned, she's very cleverly luring Ma Xianhong to the village center. Qiu'er, practically dancing through his opponents to leave them rolling on the ground in a pink haze, radios that he's in position. Back to Xiao Zizai, who tells the rest he's starting then.

Xiao-*ge* informs Zhao Guizhen that Chen Duo is of little matter to him. He does want to question Zhao Guizhen about something: a serial murder case that happened about a year ago; seven Outsider homicides that all had the same MO, no clues as to the killer. Not long after, a herb collector from Mt. Mao stole his sect's martial arts manuals, wounded a guard, and disappeared. The culprit in both these incidences was Zhao Guizhen. Who gives Xiao-*ge* a wide smile, asking if Mt. Mao wants him caught. He approaches, humbly admitting his mistake in injuring the guard, only to attack Xiao-*ge*. The two begin to fight, Xiao-*ge* running Zhao Guizhen around in a wide circle w/a barrage of golden palm strikes. One finally lands, on Zhao Guizhen's high-grade protective talisman, a string of ancient coins, which automatically activates. Zhao Guizhen draws a couple talisman runes on his hand, attacking Xiao-*ge* w/a black smoke that he quickly disperses, rushing forward to hit Zhao Guizhen in the chest. Xiao-*ge* comments that Zhao Guizhen sure has stolen many techniques.

What follows is a brief history lesson on Mt. Mao. While best known for its talisman arts, Mt. Mao's true focus is inner cultivation, practicing self-discipline and reflection towards the goal of achieving an enlightened character. (Addendum: Zheng Zibu, Lu Jin's friend and creator of Eight Supremes Infinite Heavenly Talisman from S1, was from Mt. Mao, sometimes also called the Shangqing Sect.) At some point, a bunch of *jianghu* riffraff started presenting themselves as disciples of Mt. Mao to trick the unwary. Xiao-*ge* names Zhao Guizhen a fake. Zhao Guizhen laughs. Those true disciples of Mt. Mao cultivate diligently for three years only to be rewarded w/one talisman manual while he's gained half a lifetime's worth of mastery in half a year's training. Who are they to dismiss his techniques as evil? Zhao Guizhen sheds his outer robes and shirt, all his exposed skin turning black. When he activates his power, the black surface of his skin roils w/ripples and seven monstrous heads w/glowing red eyes sprout all over his body. The heads stretch away from Zhao Guizhen to bite Xiao-*ge* and pull him closer, as Zhao Guizhen shouts in a distorted voice that he's going to eat Xiao Zizai bite by bite.

Hei Guan asks Chulan for an update. Zhuge Qing is already in place and, commenting that Ma Xianhong's still bound by the laws of heaven no matter how powerful he is, uses his Qimen Immaculate Scrutiny in conjunction w/a village-wide Wuhou Qimen array to locate Ma Xianhong's furnace. Back to Xiao Zizai vs Zhao Guizhen. Xiao-*ge* is disappointed that Zhao Guizhen is so ignorant of himself that he feels the need to rationalize his desires. Zhao Guizhen's also misunderstood him: Xiao Zizai isn't here to bring Zhao Guizhen to justice but, he says w/a beatific smile, to meet a like-minded friend. Zhao Guizhen backs away, confused. Xiao-*ge* laments how hard it is for people like them to behave normally and how lucky Zhao Guizhen was to be able to murder seven innocent people w/o getting caught, then starts ranting that instead of savoring the deaths of his victims, all Zhao Guizhen cares about is gaining power, finally screaming that Zhao Guizhen's got it all wrong. He begs, a single tear rolling down his cheek, for Zhao Guizhen to wake up. They are both perverted freaks obsessed w/death who can only dwell in the dark. If one of their kind deep down longs for the light, the only solution is to use poison to cure poison. Xiao-*ge* flashes a thoroughly unnerved Zhao Guizhen a slasher smile and tells him to accept his punishment.

He smashes Zhao Guizhen from above w/a golden hand, cracking and breaking Zhao Guizhen's protective talisman, which has reached its limits. Now scared for his life against an opponent of a type he's never faced that he's no match for, Zhao Guizhen tries to run back to the village and Ma Xianhong's protection. Xiao-*ge* yanks him back w/qi and one by one rips the monster heads from Zhao Guizhen's body. Zhao Guizhen begs Xiao-*ge* to spare him and offers as ""medicine"" three of Ma Xianhong's Pokéballs w/villagers he'd kidnapped inside, ones that wouldn't be noticed if they went missing. Xiao-*ge*'s sickness is more advanced than his, and he promises NDT won't know if Xiao-*ge* takes these people to do as he wishes w/them.

Xiao-*ge* simply shakes his head, saying that his case is hopeless. Three years ago, a Shaolin monk tells his disciple, Xiao Zizai, to remember their agreement. (Addendum: The monk is Master Jiekong, who very briefly appeared in S1 as part of the Council of Ten Elders, though likely not the same actor.) Control your inner demon and no more killing. Xiao-*ge*, however, is worried that while his inner demon remains, he'll one day again harm the innocent. The monk encourages him to not give up, and if that day comes when he's lost to his inner demon, he's to first kill the monk. Xiao Zizai kneels to his master, leaving Shaolin. Back in Biyou Village, Zhao Guizhen is tied to a tree, gagged. Xiao-*ge* says it's a pity, but he'll hand over the villagers Zhao Guizhen kidnapped to NDT. Pulling on surgical gloves, Xiao-*ge* continues that he'll now help Zhao Guizhen eradicate the disease w/in him. Zhao Guizhen has the look of a man who's realized he's about to die a terrible death he can't escape.

*Episode 10*

Zhuge Qing directs Zhang Chulan by radio to the location of Ma Xianhong's self-cultivation furnace. Meanwhile, Feng Baobao runs from Ma Xianhong, who brings out his Soul-Shaking Bell (晃魂铃) that can directly attack the spirit by sound, causing temporary disorientation. It has absolutely no effect on Baobao, of course, who keeps on running to Ma Xianhong's surprise. Next, he controls three pairs of large red beads (六合珠 or Six Matches Beads) to trap Baobao in a cube that's walled in red force fields. Ma Xianhong turns to leave, assuming Baobao's imprisoned, only to stop when Baobao starts trying to break his force field cut by cut, each strike of her knife creating a long gash. He realizes she's a beginner qi forger, and her knife must be a weapon she's refined for years or it would've already broken against his. He retracts his force field beads; Baobao figures one more hit would've destroyed the barrier. Ma Xianhong pulls out another two qi weapons, and Baobao immediately books it again. He reminds himself to not underestimate the temps. Baobao dodges the force field beads and gets blown away by the attack of a flying head that resembles a traditional Chinese lion w/thin dragonfly-like wings (空哭吼 or Crying Air Howler), hurting her arm.

Ma Xianhong tires of this game of chase, Baobao neither fighting nor fleeing. A sitting Baobao answers that she has no choice b/c the temps all agreed to not fight Ma Xianhong and lead him to the village center, if they encountered him. Just as Ma Xianhong directs his Air Howler to blast Baobao again, a villager's body is thrown btw the two to shield Baobao. Hei Guan steps out of the woods, telling Ma Xianhong he doesn't need to hunt them down one by one--they're all here. A large group of villagers charge in from behind Ma Xianhong to aid him, but a staff flies through the air to bar their way, Qiu'er arriving soon after, eyes aglow w/streaking flame, to kick them back. From his running spin around his staff, Qiu'er uses it as a springboard to engage Ma Xianhong in close quarters. Hei Guan leaps in to join the fray after Ma Xianhong kicks Qiu'er away. Ma Xianhong controls his hover ball qi weapon (盗呑兽 or Devouring Thief Beast), black w/a glowing red center, to face Hei Guan; it opens and begins drawing in his qi. Hei Guan hastily kicks off it and retreats to Qiu'er, the two men in front of and on either side of Baobao.

Hei Guan notes that the closer you are, the faster the hover ball can vacuum your qi away. Qiu'er, who sounds like he's in a Peking opera, asks after Baobao's arm; she replies that it's fine, her bone fractures already healing. Inwardly, Ma Xianhong is impressed by how quickly Hei Guan reacted. Baobao wonders what happened to their agreement to fight Ma Xianhong in the village center; Hei Guan visibly winces while Qiu'er tells Baobao to be more flexible. The noob villager Outsiders rush up to help Ma Xianhong. Hei Guan nonchalantly breaks one man's leg w/a stomp, prompting Ma Xianhong to order the rest to fall back. Liu Dang declares that they're not afraid. On the other side, Qiu'er reminds Hei Guan of their orders. Hei Guan clarifies that while they're not permitted to kill the villagers--who can't hurt them but can exhaust them--crippling the villagers to teach them a painful lesson they'll remember for life is fine, and Baobao agrees. Qiu'er draws a gloved hand down his face, his Nezha makeup clearing, saying that he's naturally playful and it isn't his style to cause people pain. Ma Xianhong names this technique Divinity Mask (神格面具).

Flashback to a week ago at Mei Jinfeng's house, where Xia Liuqing sits across a table from Qiu'er teaching him how to use the glove. Qiu'er can't get a reaction from the glove and wonders if it can truly summon a god. Xia Liuqing explains that gods are created by men, specifically mankind's collective belief, which some see as a divine power, though Xia Liuqing prefers to call it the power of faith. Ancient Outsiders performed ritualistic dances to inspire awe and other emotions in the audience that they then distilled into power; passed down through the generations, these rituals eventually became theatrical productions, and the gathered power was imbued into objects like the glove. When activated correctly, the glove will release its power as a performance, transforming its wearer to embody a god. The possibilities are limitless given the right mindset. Xia Liuqing asks Qiu'er if he's capable.

Back in Biyou Village, Qiu'er dons a new mask, the Monkey King by his fiery phoenix feather headpiece. He thanks Ma Xianhong for inspiring in him the sense of righteousness needed to play this role and vows to show Ma Xianhong what a true god looks like. The noob villager Outsiders ignore Ma Xianhong's order to retreat, charge in, and are promptly wiped out by one sweep of Wang Zhenqiu's now extendable staff, sent tumbling back to fall at Ma Xianhong's feet, groaning in pain. Qiu'er does his best Sun Wukong impression, asking if Ma Xianhong will admit his mistake. The temps, Ma Xianhong's operators, and Ma Xianhong himself trained their Outsider abilities through years of due diligence and hardship that most people cannot imagine or withstand. By making the villagers into noob Outsiders overnight, Ma Xianhong let them achieve power w/o effort, and thus they've lost touch w/reality, growing arrogant and reckless. These people are not Outsiders, Qiu'er judges, but clueless tourists LARPing in the Outsider world. The villagers are about to rush Qiu'er again, who spins his staff rapidly in one hand behind him, when Ma Xianhong shouts for them to stop. Hei Guan calls Ma Xianhong an idiot; these noobs are as much in his way as they're in the temps'. Ma Xianhong admits his mistake and tells the villagers they have no place in this battle. He implores all of them to leave now.

Liu Dang and the others still refuse to back down. Liu Dang says that, thanks to Ma Xianhong, he can enjoy his first battle as an Outsider. His pride and honor as an Outsider is on the line, and even if he fails, he at least won't regret missing this opportunity. The other villagers all chime in to agree, not caring about NDT or why they're fighting, only seeking the thrill of battle. Hei Guan comments that this is a headache while Ma Xianhong looks like he regrets a great many things. Suddenly, from behind the villagers comes Xiao Zizai's voice, wondering what's going on. Xiao-*ge* drags by the strap a black backpack on the ground behind him. The temps didn't come here to fight a bunch of noobs, he continues. While HQ has ordered them to capture the villager Outsiders alive, those who can risk their lives w/unshakeable resolve are very much to his tastes. Key point being that they must choose to stay while calm and after having rationally assessed the situation. Hotheaded fools are not worth him being held accountable for their deaths. He gives the villagers five seconds to think things over, tossing over the backpack. A villager opens it and one of Zhao Guizhen's monster heads explodes out. Xiao-*ge* emphasizes that he will kill the villagers should they remain. Ma Xianhong, enraged, commands the villagers again to leave and this time is obeyed; he faces down the gathered temps alone.

Check-in on Chulan, who's wandering the fields suspecting Zhuge Qing of playing him. Zhuge Qing tells him to be patient, then spouts a whole paragraph of Qimen magitechnobabble, the gist of which (I *think*) is that he's sent Chulan to a location where he'll be able to find the furnace once the dials align in a certain way w/the passage of time. Back to Ma Xianhong vs Baobao, Hei Guan, Qiu'er, and Xiao-*ge*. Xiao-*ge* tells Ma Xianhong not to be angry; his other operators are fine, and Zhao Guizhen deserved death. Ma Xianhong has finally realized the temps are not just here for Chen Duo. Aaanddd **FIGHT!** The four temps run in together, dodging the Air Howler and force field beads. Qiu'er blows some qi hairs and makes three flying copies of himself to pull the hover ball to one side. Baobao closes and exchanges blows w/Ma Xianhong, then trades w/Qiu'er who does the same, before being blown back by the Soul-Shaking Bell. Hei Guan knocks aside Ma Xianhong's hand that's holding the bell and Xiao-*ge* hits Ma Xianhong in the chest, sending him straight to Baobao, who cuts the bell cleanly off its handle. During the pause as everyone repositions, Qiu'er inwardly savors the feeling of such smooth cooperation. Ma Xianhong, OTOH, is questioning why the temps are so steady, even holding back, and guesses that they must have a purpose, for instance to stall him.

When Ma Xianhong accuses the five temps of targeting Biyou Village from the start, Hei Guan wonders that Ma Xianhong still hasn't caught on to the fact that Chulan is one of them. Baobao corrects Hei Guan that there are actually seven of them, to his ire. Hei Guan then lays it out for Ma Xianhong: the villagers have been taken care of and they're here fighting Ma Xianhong, so what is Chulan doing? Back in the temps' strategy meeting, Hei Guan tells Chulan his first task is to stall Ma Xianhong. Chen Duo serves as blind for Ma Xianhong, diverting him from the temps' true goal of destroying Biyou Village. Before Ma Xianhong realizes this, they have to neutralize as many of the villagers and Ma Xianhong's operators as they can, at the same time wrecking the village. This will anger Ma Xianhong and keep him from thinking straight, allowing Chulan a chance at the furnace. However, while Chulan completes his second task, the other temps will be facing Ma Xianhong and the combined forces of Biyou Village, among which are the noob villager Outsiders whose lives must be spared.

Baobao interrupts to say there's no need to waste so much effort when she can just clock Ma Xianhong in his sleep, to the amusement of Qiu'er. Hei Guan is less amused and warns Chulan to watch Baobao. After Chulan tells Baobao she shouldn't spend her time on trivial things like planning, Hei Guan adds that all she needs to remember is to knock out villagers, set the village on fire, and lure Ma Xianhong to the village center so they can gang up on him together. Chulan asks what to do if Ma Xianhong discovers him while he's destroying the furnace. Hei Guan explains that he has to wait until the rest of them have engaged Ma Xianhong in combat. If they can defeat Ma Xianhong quickly, that would be best, but if not, they'll reveal Chulan's target and split Ma Xianhong's attention further, hurrying him back to his furnace while the temps harry him.

Zhuge Qing's meeting resistance in revealing the furnace to Chulan and lights up his Qimen array w/Samadhi True Fire. Finally, in the open field before Chulan, Ma Xianhong's self-cultivation furnace breaks out of the ground, rising maybe four to six stories into the night sky in a shower of dust and rocks. Zhuge Qing says his job is done, and he's going to find Fu Rong and will meet Chulan outside Biyou Village. He wishes Chulan good luck. His last delivery is a hammer he drops out of the sky, wreathed in lightning--a present from Baobao. Hammer over his shoulder, Chulan enters the furnace, amazed by it. He remembers Zhuge Qing's advice that brute force can't destroy the furnace and walks to the control box on the left side. Activating his lightning technique, he swings the hammer faster and faster over his head, then brings it down.

Ma Xianhong, however, doesn't seem overly concerned that Chulan may have found his furnace and plans to destroy it. Just as Chulan's about to strike the furnace control box, **Black Puppet**, Ma Xianhong's most powerful android creation, kicks him away. Black Puppet is imbued w/the techniques of three Outsiders: Ding Zihuan's Phantom Walk (诡影行), which hides its presence, (Bi Yuan's) Devious Needle (诡门针), a medical acupuncture art, and Chen Duo's Primordial Poison (原始毒), though not as potent. In his fight w/Black Puppet, Chulan has trouble tracking its movements, and while he wards off a needle strike to the back of his neck w/Golden Light Mantra, Black Puppet spews a cloud of poison at Chulan as he pulls away that he breathes in. As the poison attacks his body, Chulan collapses on the floor. Baobao tries to contact Chulan, but there's no response. Hei Guan, in hand-to-hand w/Ma Xianhong, asks what Ma Xianhong did to Chulan; Ma Xianhong answers that Chulan brought his death upon himself. Ma Xianhong continues to fight the temps, Xiao Zizai landing a golden palm smash on him from above that cracks his protective talisman, a necklace w/three golden oval beads strung together. One of the beads cracks, too, but heals over again, the protective crystal doing the same.

Back at the furnace, the power Zhang Huaiyi/Xilin passed to Baobao and Baobao to Chulan activates as Chulan lies dying. Past Chulan complains to Baobao that this Old Farmer's Technique (老农功) his grandfather gave him doesn't make any sense. There are no instructions on how to train and in fact no description of what it even does. Furthermore, as he practices, Chulan's belly is growing and he can feel movement w/in, increasing in strength and frequency. Baobao naturally concludes that Chulan is pregnant. A ball of qi inside Chulan's body begins absorbing Chen Duo's poison, changing into the shape of a baby that projects outward until it completely covers Chulan, open eyes and mouth glowing blue. It lets out a low-pitched cry, shockwaves spreading rhythmically outwards from it across all of Biyou Village, eventually reaching Ma Xianhong where he's surrounded by the temps. Sensing something's amiss, Ma Xianhong takes off running towards his furnace, the temps immediately giving chase.

Baobao throws her knife at Ma Xianhong, only for it to spin back around and attack her. Hei Guan warns that Ma Xianhong has already gained control over Baobao's knife during the course of their battle and that any non-living object could have been made into his weapon. As Hei Guan talks, Ma Xianhong manipulates the threads of his shirt to pierce through his vest over his heart. Hei Guan falls to his knees and over onto the ground. The other three glance at him but don't stop their pursuit of Ma Xianhong. Meanwhile, the qi baby, in control of an unconscious Chulan's body, gazes curiously at the self-cultivation furnace. It rises unsteadily to its feet and activates Golden Light Mantra, cooing in wonder, then Yang Five Lightning, streams of lightning coming from each finger. It giggles as it sends lightning everywhere. Black Puppet tries to attack it, only to be sent flying w/the touch of a single fingertip.

It latches onto Black Puppet, still giggling, and doesn't so much as fight Black Puppet as play around w/it. Black Puppet again spews poison at Chulan. The qi baby absorbs the poison unharmed and lets out the low-pitched cry from earlier, lightning pulsing in shockwaves, too, to strike Black Puppet and the entire furnace. Encased in the qi baby w/in his own body, Chulan can't move and has no idea what's happening. Ma Xianhong runs through the fields to w/in sight of his furnace, but it's too late. Inside, lightning forks all over the place, destroying the furnace, while outside the whole klin collapses in a fiery explosion, leaving behind a giant pile of rubble. A stunned Ma Xianhong can only say to himself that his furnace has been shattered.

Thoughts on Bretonnia after VH short victory on all four factions,totalwarhammer,1i9vf1z,2025-01-25 14:54:18,8,0.83,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwarhammer/comments/1i9vf1z/thoughts_on_bretonnia_after_vh_short_victory_on/,VeryUnderQualified,,"I did this a bit ago but never really wrote about it because I honestly did not think the community would agree with some of the things I say about it. I think getting my ideas out there might be helpful, but I am going pretty hard against the grain here.

# Outdated/bad

I think Bretonnia can feel a bit outdated, but I actually completely disagree with them being bad. After getting a decent amount of hours on them and changing my playstyle, they actually became pretty easy. The major things I did at first were

* Listen to the community and recruit a lot of lords to get vows in reinforcement battles
* Make doomstacks with knights and use minimal infantry
* Use a lot of farms to get a crazy economy

It never felt good to use this playstyle, and I really hated the Bordeleaux campaign using it. This strategy is extremely difficult there because Wulfhart and Skulltaker will both declare war on you, on top of a rogue army and the Lizard potentially looking to fight as well. The individual battles might be difficult sometimes, but the amount of armies you are fighting will just cause a situation when you trade settlements back and forth as your main few armies run all over the place. 

I changed my strategy going into the Lyonesse campaign, and it made me replay the other campaigns just to make sure I was not crazy. The way that everyone plays right now made my campaigns much more difficult to execute, and honestly just made the faction not fun. However, when I switched, the campaigns became comically easy. What I did was 

* Use fewer lords with much stronger armies
* Use the max amount of infantry I can get without the replenishment penalty 
* Never use farms

**Fewer lords**

With fewer lords and stronger armies, I was not always pressured to constantly run around and fight everything with barely any main armies. It allowed me to actually expand and defend at the same time without worrying about the AI taking settlements without defenders. I may not get as many vows, but the vows aren't what make the game hard anyway. If I started with two lords that had maxed out vows, it would barely make the game easier. That just allows me to get to late game faster when I have the proper units to do so. The battles that are already hard aren't going to be much easier if I can't afford an army of Questing Knights with vows, and Knights Errant are still going to get pummeled. You should be playing to survive early game to play for late game, not be greedy to try to skate to the late game sooner IMO. 

**More infantry**

Using the max amount of infantry allows the amount of armies to be insanely high sometimes. I believe it is around double the normal limit of peasants that you are able to use. This allows you to actually have a frontline that can hold for longer than 30 seconds without needing to recruit expensive units. Peasants have a lot of buffs that can be applied to them pretty quickly into campaigns, and I think most people skip them because they are going directly for either knight buffs or archer buffs (which I completely dropped anyway). The Bretonnian archers are (in my opinion) ACTUALLY hot garbage, and the reason why many people think Bretonnia has unusable infantry. You will almost always lose if you rely on their low damage, as they will simply not do enough before your unbuffed infantry will break. That means that if you do the normal slow ranged strategy that other factions do, you will think Bretonnia is really bad without a massive amount of cav.

**No farms**

I never use farms, which I know is a sin for most Bretonnia players. I think they are a huge bait because they basically completely lock out overloading infantry while not enabling you to spam a large amount of armies when you actually need them. If I go Bretonnia and build farms, I will basically never run out of gold. That is not actually a good thing though because that means I am building a giant treasury I can't actually use. Using industry instead allows you to use many more infantry units without actually stopping you from using knight stacks as well, if you even need knight stacks anymore. The industry building is still really strong, and the campaign movement buff is way more helpful in my experience than the growth, even if growth is important on Bretonnia. You still have the money to support a lot of knights without needing full knight armies to fight all of your battles. 

**How I fought battles**

The general strategy I used for most battles is to use the cav as reinforcements or as flankers, rather than the main force (I know this is standard for a lot of factions but is not how people play Bretonnia from what I have seen). Most of my armies would have one or two heroes, 6 trebs, and then infantry units with one or two grail relics. If they did not have a knight reinforcement army with them, then the trebs would be replaced with knights, and most likely Questing Knights. The lord would have buffs for infantry in their tree, and would not try to go fight the other lord most of the time. The gives more time for the knights to take care of their backline and flank important units without the infantry core falling apart. Single entities can be a problem, but they will always try to dodge artillery. This allows you to just spam them with the trebs, effectively cancelling out both units as your trebs miss and the single entities do a dance far from your army. Huge infantry blobs would just be wiped out by my spells, and other cav would lose to my cav when surrounded.

# Changes that I would make 

**Vows**

I think the vows feel super weird. I believe they should be all based off the things a lord has done that are more general (traveled a specific amount, killed a certain amount of enemies, defended Bretonnian land), instead of based off benchmarks that can seem super random. For example, the vow to fight a siege battle should be based on the distance a lord has traveled from their capital, not if they are in a jungle or desert, as that means entirely different things for different factions. The vows should also include more things involving the Daemons of Chaos, and it is almost comical that they don't. It is probably the thing that dates the vows the most, as it seems really obvious in lore. 

**Peasant Economy**

Controversially, I actually think it is fine if you do not spam farms. I would actually give Bretonnia the option to have professional archers like longbowmen. If they can't have that because they are based of France and not Britain and longbowmen are too British, then they should unironically just take the huntsmen from the Empire, or a very similar unit. I am unsure why the Empire even needed them or how they fit thematically, and Bretonnia needs better ways to deal with large single entities desperately. The fact that the only archer units are locked with the peasant economy is really goofy. 

 **Anti-large and anti-infantry bonuses**

This is a really important point that I will probably make another post about at some point. The anti-large and anti-infantry bonuses should probably be switched on the shock cav and normal cav. I actually have so many points for this I do not know if I will remember them all

* Cycle charging vs other cav is basically not possible and the units will get entangled 
* Charging a giant spider or dinosaur would knock the horse and the rider over 
* A sword can't reach the ground for infantry as easily as a lance
* A lance would not be able to fight as effectively against someone next to them on a horse 
* Charging infantry is about 9x as satisfying and effective
* The armor on shock cav is really helpful vs low level spearmen 
* Questing knights would probably be going on quests to kill monsters
* If Knights Errant could fight off other cav they would be much more useful as they don't want to get stuck in with infantry anyway
* Knights Errant having an anti-large bonus could give Mounted Yeomen space to have a small anti-infantry bonus, potentially giving them a place as a super early game backline killer instead of the most useless unit on the roster and maybe in the game
* Large entities normally need more sustained damage to take down instead of burst damage like charge bonuses give
* Questing Knights and Grail Knights don't have a shield and are more likely to fight ranged units given they fight infantry

I might have missed something, but I think you can make a VERY good argument here. 

 **Allow Chivalry to go negative with bonuses and penalties**

I know this would probably be for a DLC, but it would be pretty neat. Having an evil lord that fundamentally changed the faction could be pretty interesting. You could lock certain knights at certain levels of chivalry, and take away the Green Knight completely. Relations with certain factions could change, and evil knights could be in another building. Lords could have certain alignments they follow, etc. I don't remember if this follows normal Warhammer lore at all, but it does follow the game lore since there are rogue armies and quest battles against bad knights already. Grail knights being bad seems pretty goofy, and it would give them a unit to replace them with in the quest battles and rogue armies. 

**The tech tree should be more open with more specific bonuses**

This seems pretty self explanatory. I think there are two economic styles in Bretonnia with very little overlap. You shouldn't have to upgrade the other economic style that is never going to be used anyway. 

**Give them professional archers on another building**

I talked about this earlier in my post, but I think it should happen. Preferably an anti-large unit that doesn't do great into infantry, so Bretonnia still has its niche. I think Bretonnia should be particularly good at killing monsters given they are the fantasy medieval faction. 

**Move Alberic and give him more bonuses relating to the sea**

I saw a neurologist in July because I was having a hand tremor that worsened with physical activity, and was effecting my ability to do my job. While I was there, I decided to also talk to him about these twitches I've had ever since I was a kid. 

My earliest memory of them is when I was about 7, I twitched in a movie theater on a field trip and a concerned parent started freaking out. Basically, the twitches look/feel like this: a shiver will run up my spine, my body gets cold, and then my head will snap so fast I look possessed. It's not contained to one direction, it will twist left or right, even bob up and down--just once, and then it's over. Often, my shoulders and arms will move as well, typically retracting into my body. Sometimes, with the bad ones, I will also vocalize. Not words, just sounds usually. 

I remember distinctly telling the concerned parent that I was fine, and it was just a twitch. So
I must have already been having them by then, I just don't remember. And I don't remember who told me it was just a twitch. 

Fast forward more than 20 years, and I'm at this neurologist. I tell him all of this, we have a discussion about the twitches, when was the onset, etc. I also tell him that it used to happen less often, but it's gotten worse in my 20s. He ends up diagnosing me with Tourette's and an essential tremor, then sends me home. I haven't seen this doctor since, but he said there wasn't anything I could do about it, anyway. He advised that, if I really wanted to, I could go to a movement specialist but it wasn't necessary. 

The diagnosis was added to my chart, and I did not get to see a movement specialist. My insurance has now changed. I'm just unsure about how to move forward, or if I should investigate further, because I'm not really connected to the community and I don't know if there's anyone else who experiences similar symptoms (I really only have the one movement/sometimes vocal thing.)

Has anyone else experienced something similar?  (I am in the US btw) "

My left and right hips have never moved the same way with either side kicks or roundhouse kicks. My left hip seems to *turn over* (for lack of a better word) on extension. 

I'm stretching my piriformis and gluteus, as well as the abductors, hamstrings, and quads.

[TH] The Package,shortstories,1i9v2lk,2025-01-25 14:38:48,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1i9v2lk/th_the_package/,ComfortablePretty634,Thriller,"It was around 10:30 pm when I finally got into bed after a long day of work. I was sitting in bed with the only lighting being the soft, warm glow of my bedside lamp and the faint glow from the laptop resting on my lap while reading and replying to my newest emails when I remembered the package I was meant to receive today. Reaching over to the bedside table and unlocked my phone to open the video doorbell app. You see I got the video doorbell a few months ago because one of my neighbours had experienced a burglary and just to keep myself safe I got one. Opening the app and clicking on today’s footage I scroll to 11 am, the expected delivery time and watch the footage. Sifting through the footage I see a man walk towards the house with a package, leaving it on the doormat. “Strange..that wasn't there when I got home,” I thought to myself. Continuing to watch the footage to see what happened to the package. 10 minutes in, nothing had happened, I was starting to think I had completely missed the box when I walked in. Then another man walks towards the house. He’s wearing a zip-up black jacket with the hood up, black jeans and black shoes..almost as if he was trying to hide himself. He walks right up to the front door and reaches into his pocket, pulling out a key, unlocking the door and picking up the package on the way. “What the hell. How’d he have a key.” I think, watching the footage intensely. Lifting my finger to the slider and watching as the hours go by and there is no movement at the door. When I reach 6 pm I watch myself walk towards the house and unlock the door. He didn’t leave…He. Didn’t. Leave. Fear and anxiety took over my whole body as I realised...I watched that man enter my home but I never watched him leave. 

I sit up slowly and set down my phone..what should I do? Call someone? The police? As these thoughts fill my mind I hear a bang coming from downstairs. Oh my god. I immediately reach for my phone again and dial 999. As I'm on the call with the operator I hear the banging from downstairs get louder. And more aggressive as if they are searching for something. The operator informs me that the police are on their way...Thank god. While I'm sitting on the bed, hearing the noises get louder and louder until suddenly..it all goes quiet. Eerily quiet. “Maybe he left?” I ask myself. “Maybe he found what he was looking for and left..” Then another bang..but this time it was closer. No longer downstairs..but on the stairs, slowly creeping up the stairs. I immediately crept towards my dresser and pushed it with all my strength towards the door, creating a barricade between myself and the stranger. Silence again. No footsteps. No bangs...Nothing. For what felt like forever the door jolted..the dresser keeping it shut, then a laugh..a laugh of a maniac came from the other side of the door. “Come on Sara..Open the door” he roars. Hearing him call my name made me shutter..how did he know who I was..the bigger question was, who was he? Remaining quiet in the room I creep towards one of my two windows and slowly open it. “Come on Sara, I got your package” He taunts, attempting to break open the door banging it repetitively. Letting out a soft cry as I put one leg out the window and onto the roof, the banging on the door getting louder and louder as if he was getting closer. Throwing the other leg over the ledge I crawl out the window. Crawling across the roof of my home, legs shaking and my heart pounding while some maniac is trying to break into my room, is not my ideal day. As I’m down on my hands and knees crawling across my roof I hear the dresser move...He’s in.

Crawling as fast as I can across the roof I make my way towards the draining. I dropped my legs off the side of the house and wrapped them around the drain pipe, trying to use it to slide down and escape. “Where are you going..” an angry voice says. I look up to see him...He’s standing at the window, watching me. I don’t even speak before dropping down the side of the house, not caring if I got hurt I stand up and run. I run as fast as I can around the corner and onto the main street. Lights coming from up the street...Blue and red flashing lights. The police. Finally. Waving my arms in the air I direct their attention to me before telling them about the man. They ran inside, searching the entire house. Nothing. They found nothing..Downstairs was perfect, not a single thing out of place or broken. They also found that damn package. Sitting on the counter, as if it had been there the whole time..The dresser is in its original spot and the door is in perfect condition. I then remembered the footage, I showed them the 11 am footage of the man delivering the package, making them watch to see the mysterious man enter my home but he wasn’t there..there was no man. They thought I was crazy, they were taking me to the station to “seek help” as they led me to the car. That's when I saw him..standing on the street waving at me...So it was real."

I'm a big fan of Super and AM2R, and so I was eager to play Dread after a friend lent it to me.

Indeed, the combat and movement is great. I love the parry, and the way momentum is carried through moves reminds me of Donkey Kong Country (big praise). The EMMI parts are a great evolution of the Fusion Samus-clone scenes.

However, I enjoy Metroid for the exploration aspect, and I found it really lacking. Compared to even Zero Mission, I felt like Dread was soooo linear; I didn't feel like I explored ZDR, but checked boxes between bosses. The ambiance wasn't very interesting to me either-- the music wasn't notable and the world didn't feel cohesive (in the way that Zebes or SR388 do).

I'd be really interested to see what else people appreciated and didn't in it, because the praise for Dread seems really unanimous. "

**Morning**  
**Caedwyn Realm, Consolidated Frontier Territories**  
**Western Agricultural Annexia, Burley Farm**

Sheriff Reynard Mueller heaved a sigh, his gaze sweeping over the pearl-grain fields stretching out before him. The multitudes of stalks, heavy with ripe grain, appeared to shimmer in the sunlight as they swayed in the breeze. An idyllic pastoral scene common to Caedwyn Realm, the sort of sight that soothed Reynard's nerves in trying times, whether it was back in his days as a conscript in the Nexian legions, or dealing with the trials and tribulations of life on the frontier.

Reynard turned his gaze slightly to the right, the simple movement immediately souring his mood. Another plot of pearl-grain came into sight, but it was a far cry from the pristine view Reynard was admiring moments ago. A series of large and intricate patterns had been trampled into the field, as if it had been stamped by a giant branding iron from the heavens. The patterns were not confined to a single plot, but instead extended to several neighboring plots as well.

Worse still, the culprit behind the defaced fields had not been content to limit their mischief to the Burley farm. Similar patterns had been spotted out on the plains, grazing grounds, and even in the deep forest. As ever, the rumormongers were having a grand time speculating on the nature and intent of these mysterious markings. These myriad theories ranged from bored pranksters to foreign saboteurs. Even sinister beings from old folk tales were pointed to as the culprits. 

To add more kindling to the blaze, there had also been sightings of what folk were calling 'hexfire', strange and distant lights that danced in the sky with a speed and agility that did not match any creature or conveyance known to Caedwyn. Even worldly men like Reynard, who had served in the Nexian military in distant Realms, were at a loss to explain the bizarre occurrences. In the middle of this confusion, Reynard and the constabulary labored to carry out their duties. Looking to the mercifully clear skies, the Sheriff wondered if this was only the beginning of his troubles.

As if summoned by his dark mood, the angry thudding of hooves reached Reynard’s ears. That would be Eamon Burley, owner of this farm, no doubt ready to give him an earful about what an outrage this all was. Eamon was a gentleman who took it upon himself to voice his opinions at full volume, lest the world be deprived of his valuable insights. “Ah well, nice while it lasted,” muttered Reynard, bidding silent farewell to the lovely view, and turning to face Eamon.  
“Didn’t take half of forever to get here, did you, Mueller?” bellowed the irate farmer.  
“Good day to you too, Eamon,” greeted Reynard drily. “Steady on now, no sense in calling down the legions just yet.”  
“Hah! As if soldiers would be worth a damn for this mischief! There’s strange magic afoot!” said Eamon, gesturing to the defaced plot of pearl grain behind him.  
“Strange magic? How do you reckon that, Eamon?”  
Eamon leaned in and whispered conspiratorially to Reynard. “It’s dark business, I’m telling you. I’m no mage, but I did get a bit of the Sight from my blessed mother, and I didn’t feel one bloody bit of mana stirring during the whole commotion! How’s that possible, I ask you?”  
“That is a bit odd,” admitted Reynard. “Better off asking Dara about that sort of thing. She arrived ahead of me, didn’t she?”  
“Ah, Deputy Shelly, good egg that one, bright girl. Came up here with that wildman of yours in tow, she did.”

Reynard scowled at the epithet. While Meadowfolk and Woodfolk were branches of the same tree, they were often at odds with each other, given their differing ways of life. That estrangement had only deepened with the ongoing Nexian Reformations, which favored the Meadowfolk. The Nexians considered the Meadowfolk to be ‘more civilized’ than their ‘backward’ cousins, and some Meadowfolk had taken it to heart, branding the Woodfolk as ‘wildmen’.  
“Rabbit does honest work for the constabulary, Eamon. No need for that kind of talk.”  
“Pfah, what’s the lie in calling him a wildman, with his antlers looking like a tangle of brambles, and all that poppycock dangling from them?”  
“No lie at all, Farmer Burley,” Rabbit interjected suddenly, emerging from both men’s blind spots, as if appearing out of thin air.

To his credit, Reynard only flinched in surprise, while Eamon let out an undignified yelp. Rabbit stood before them, clad in his usual mottled leathers and woodsman’s gear. While Eamon’s description of Rabbit’s antlers was uncharitable, there was a kernel of truth to it. Woodfolk let their antlers grow free and untrimmed, favoring asymmetry, and decorated them with all manner of charms and talismans. The result was a vibrant mess that they proudly wore like crowns, a stark contrast to the well-trimmed and modestly decorated antlers of the Meadowfolk.

“Morning Sarge, Farmer,” greeted the smirking ranger. Most of the local Woodfolk had taken to calling Reynard ‘Sarge’ due to former military rank. Woodfolk were odd like that with names. By their reckoning, ‘Sarge’ was a name with real power behind it, a title earned by blood and deed. Not quite up to Nexian standards of professionalism, but things were a bit more relaxed out in the frontier realms.  
“Morning, Rabbit. Starting the day with a bit of stalking practice?” Reynard replied, pretending to not have been taken by surprise.  
""Oh, I weren't even trying. Easy work, coming up quiet on someone when their mind’s looking elsewhere,"" drawled Rabbit. ""But that’s not the story you want, so I’ll tell you the other. I was up on the roof, getting light prints of the mess in the fields. Dara’s out there having a closer look. Also spotted a bit of sheep track heading out to the grasslands.”  
“Oh! Right, I damn near forgot, I–”  
“Should come along so we can find those poor blighters and get them safely home. Fair plan, right?” Eamon could only mumble in agreement as Rabbit led him off to track down his lost sheep. Reynard tipped an imaginary cap to Rabbit in thanks. 

**Greater United Nations Long Range Expeditionary Force**  
**Survey Station Selene, Observation Deck**

Senior Technician Cristian Mendez heaved a sigh, taking in the stunning view from the observation deck. A vast starfield stretched out before him, a dazzling array of celestial jewels glittering against the cold void of space. The station was located on the dark side of Caedwyn’s moon, meaning planet-rise wasn’t visible to them, but Mendez preferred starfields anyway. “Sure is pretty out there. Damn shame it’s a damn death trap,” he thought aloud. Someone chuckled behind him. “Kinda like deep sea facilities, y’know? Surrounded by wonder and mystery that’ll kill you dead if you stepped out into it,” they commented.

Mendez turned to see Drone Operations Specialist Joseph Anders, his coworker and long-time friend. “More or less, yeah. At least we get bigger windows,” he replied, waving to Anders.  
“Flying drones are cooler than submersibles too, if you ask me,” said Anders, handing Mendez a cup of coffee.  
“Speaking of, wanna head to the Ops Center? Next flight is in 30, with a new rotation. Might be better to get there early to make sure the prep’s done right,” suggested Mendez, tilting his head in the direction of the Remote Drone Operations Center.  
“Damn, that’s right, double rotations after the brass went on the warpath. Let’s hop to it, then.” 

The pair set off to their workplace, sipping their drinks while continuing their conversation. “How’d that debrief go, by the way?” asked Anders. Earlier in the day, Mendez had gone through a marathon of a debriefing with the higher-ups, covering the system-wide glitch that caused all the commotion planetside. It was a dubious reward for not only being the ‘first responder’ to the whole mess, but also managing the ensuing damage control and cleanup operations.  
“You know how it goes, good work gets rewarded with more work,” answered Mendez, which got a nod of understanding from Anders. He continued, “On the plus side, they were all ears when I outlined the cleanup and retrieval plans, and they seem to be on board with playing things safer now.”  
“I’ll say they’re on board,” agreed Anders, grinning. “Word is that the computer janitors who screwed up are getting extra special attention from an oversight committee. Plus, total rollback of automated systems, manual operation with max supervision for all missions going forward.”  
Mendez nodded, his expression hardening. “About damn time. We’ve been over-reliant on the locals’ ignorance of Earth tech to stay invisible. These folks aren’t stupid. Give ‘em enough clues, and they’re gonna figure out what to look for, and where. Throw all that magic bullshit into the mix and we’re a coin flip away from our work becoming damn near impossible. High time we got back to playing it safe and using our damn heads.”  
“Look at you, all responsible and shit. Relax, all the code monkeys and their shiny toys got sent packing. We’re calling the shots until the dust settles,” reasoned Anders, which got a shrug from Mendez.  
“Yeah, I suppose that’s something. After we put out these fires, we can start pushing for some sane best practices. Speaking of cleanup though, I’ve got some plans that I need to go over with you.”  
Anders raised an eyebrow. “That sounds like more work, Cris. I already got an entire wing of drone jocks to babysit.”  
“Yeah, but this is about scooping up all the physical evidence and covering our tracks, including the stuff the locals might have in lockup. Just a big ol’ heist movie, figured you might be interested, buddy.”  
“Well shit, you know just how to bait that hook, dontcha? All right boss, lemme hear this cleanup plan of yours…”

**Caedwyn Realm, Consolidated Frontier Territories**  
**Western Agricultural Annexia, Burley Farm**

With Rabbit keeping Eamon occupied, Reynard was free to seek out his deputy, Dara Shelly. If anyone would be able to make head or tail of this bedlam, it would be her. Dara’s meticulous nature and arcane expertise made her well suited for the task. Her mana aptitude pushed the boundaries of the gifted commoners, but sadly fell short of the admissions requirements of the regional Academy of Magical Arts. It was the Academy's loss, by Reynard's reckoning. Dara had a keen mind in addition to her arcane talents, and had proven time and again to be a valuable member of the constabulary. If those gilded robes at the Academy failed to see her worth, they could go boil their heads for all he cared.

Looking around, Reynard spotted a woman with short-cropped red hair and severely trimmed antlers walking about the fields, taking notes and collecting samples. ""Hoi, Dara! Find anything?"" he called out as he approached her.  
""Nothing of note. Well, compared to all of this,"" She was standing in a perfect circle of trampled stalks, one of many that scarred Burley's fields. Beyond the circles were also concentric  rings, equally precise, as well as myriad geometric shapes, all connected by lines of varying width. Dara made a sweeping gesture, explaining, ""Same as all the other reports, a series of intricate patterns, joined by these straight lines in an irregular loop.""  
""Hm, looks like they were going in circles when they trampled the grain,” said Reynard, looking at the way the flattened pearl-grain lay on the ground. “Some kind of ritual, then?"" he asked.  
Dara shook her head in response. ""No, ritual magic requires consistent invocation patterns, but these are too haphazard. It’s all a jumble of circles, rings, and lines. If it’s following a pattern, it’s not an arcane one.""  
""Well, Nexian magic needs regular patterns anyway,"" Reynard mused. ""But it doesn't look like Druidic magic either. Druid runework is all... wibbly-wobbly, right?"" Reynard wiggled his fingers for emphasis, earning a scowl from Dara.  
""All wibbly-wobbly? Honestly Sheriff, would it kill you to use proper terminology?"" she grumbled. ""Technically you're right, though. This isn't anything like the vine and bough patterns of Woodfolk ritual magic,"" she continued. ""It's exceedingly strange. All of the individual parts of the pattern are remarkably precise. But when taken as a whole, they're complete nonsense,"" muttered Dara to herself.  
""Well there you go, we'll put a warrant out for an insane geometer with improbably large tools,"" joked Reynard.  
“Academicians run amok, may His Eternal Majesty deliver us,” deadpanned Dara in response. They shared a chuckle as Dara continued taking measurements and samples.

Reynard took a closer look at the trampled stalks while speaking to Dara. On its own, it was simple enough to figure out. Something heavy had come along and crushed the stalks flat. A group of strong youths with a wooden beam and a length of rope could have done the job, probably. No, what made this such a mystery was how swiftly the culprits had managed to do their work so swiftly in so many places, seemingly all at the same time. There was also the matter of the witnesses swearing up and down that they neither saw nor felt any spellwork being woven during the incidents. “It is a bit odd though, that nobody with the Sight felt any magic during all this commotion,” mused Reynard.   
Dara huffed. “Don’t get me started on the nonsense that’s been going around,” she growled. “Can you imagine? Something of the size they described going airborne without the aid of magic?” Dara shot to her feet and jabbed a finger skyward. “Not just airborne, mind you, but so high up the ‘hexfire’ blinked out, like it shot past the bloody Tapestry!”  
Reynard stifled a laugh, and ventured, “So you’re saying it’s not too likely this was something mundane?”

He swore she’d start shooting plumes of fire from her eyes, from the look she was giving him. As the constabulary’s most mana-gifted member, Dara did tend to get into a lather about the particulars of the magical arts. This hexfire business in particular was doing her head in, what with damn near everything about the incidents defying common sense. Dara took a deep breath, looking like she was about to let loose with a rant, but then thought better of it and slowly exhaled instead.   
“Right then, I’m not saying the witnesses are lying, or that they’re necessarily wrong,” she began, reining in her frustration. “The issue is that it’s irresponsible to fall back on fantastical notions like manaless artifices, as if mundane forces could somehow rival the power of mana. Just because you don’t see the mana fields moving, doesn’t mean you can just throw out the fundamental order of the world,” she explained.  
Reynard nodded. “It’s as you often say, nothing happens in contradiction to the natural order,” he began.  
“They are merely in contradiction to what we currently know of the natural order, exactly,” she finished, smiling. “Sounds like you’ve been paying attention to my ‘unofficial lectures’ at least,” she added with a laugh.  
“Contrary to popular belief, I can be taught,” quipped Reynard with a wry grin. “But getting back to the issue. If there is magic at play, but nobody sensed it, what’s the more reasonable explanation? Some kind of concealment?”  
“Concealment is one option we can look into. You see, according to current literature…”

**Survey Station Selene, Remote Drone Operations Center**

""Hey Mendez, check it out, it's Sheriff Rey-Rey and my homegirl Dara!"" said Anders excitedly, pointing to an infil-drone video feed of the Sheriff and his deputy. As persons of interest in the ongoing cleanup operations, the constabulary were under regular surveillance most of the time, and as such enjoyed minor celebrity status among the drone operators.  
""Christ, Anders. They're not a bunch of hypernet streamers, can the parasocial crap,"" replied Mendez.  
""Look, I'm a simple man. I see a redhead, I subscribe.""  
""Like you’ve got a shot, fanboy. Anything new with the law?""  
""Still the usual bagging and tagging of evidence, and interviewing witnesses. Basic police work, by the book stuff. Sheriff Rey, Dara, and Rabbit are scoping out the Burley farm, and we’ve got Baldie and Socks checking out a livestock mutilation out on the plains.”  
“Hm. And the Sheriff already swung by Splitskull?”  
“Yep, though he only dealt with Gladys’ goons, not the Hag herself. Her Ladyship was busy with other matters, apparently, and there was no sign of her outside,” explained Anders.  
“Shit, that can’t be good. The geological survey drone came back with a couple worms missing, didn’t it?” asked Mendez, referring to the burrowing sample collector robots that the survey drones deployed to take core samples over a given area.  
“Unfortunately, yeah. How much you wanna bet ol’ Gladys got her claws on one of ‘em?”  
“One of ‘em? That old bitch has got her half of the mountain sewn up tighter than a Vac-U-Seal bag. She’s gotta have snagged both, no question.”  
“All right, what kind of money you got on the failsafes actually working?”  
“So what if they did? The electronics and servos would be slagged, but that still leaves them with a bunch of goodies to play with. Space-age alloys, precision machined parts, hell, the cutting heads on those things alone would probably make ‘em shit a brick.”  
“Welp, better start brainstorming on what we’re gonna do for Operation Claim Jumper…”

**Caedwyn Realm, Consolidated Frontier Territories**  
**Western Agricultural Annexia**

A few minutes' ride from the Burley farm, Constables Daruth Val’Ged and Elwin Redfoot, better known as Baldie and Socks, were performing their duties in the wake of the hexfire’s rampage. They were currently investigating another incident site, similar to the others but with an alarmingly grisly difference: an eviscerated sheep lay splayed out in the middle of the strange pattern pressed into the plains grass. Socks was currently investigating the carcass. He was no stranger to gore, being a huntsman, but the display still managed to unnerve him with how bizarre it was. 

While he wasn’t the best student of magic, nothing he saw here resembled any of the rituals from the elders’ teachings. It didn’t even look like outlander magic, like what the Nexians used. The body itself harbored more mysteries. Scavengers had gnawed and mangled it some, shifting some parts from where they once sat, but a proper look revealed more. Scorch and puncture marks no wider than a knitting needle dotted the body, whether by chance or intent, he couldn’t say. The body had been cut open long before the vermin had gotten to it, surely with a magical blade. That was the only tool that could have left such clean and neat edges on flesh and bone alike. 

As for the innards, it looked like the culprit took their pick of the organs, snatching up the heart, liver, left kidney, and a good arm’s length of guts. The stomachs were cast to the side, each one punctured and emptied for gods only knew what reason. Socks couldn’t tell if this phantom butcher was a master or a madman. Whatever the culprit’s nature, Dara would definitely want to take a closer look at this. Weighing his options, he elected to bag up the carcass as evidence, seeing as carrion eaters had already run roughshod all over the scene. He silently cursed himself for not asking for the wagon.

Behind him, Baldie was interviewing Old Hob, the shepherd who had apparently witnessed the incident, but Baldie had serious doubts about that. He was trying his best to not let the cranky old cuss embarrass himself, but he was having quite the time of it. “All right Hob, let’s see if I’ve got this right,” began Baldie, his brow furrowed in consternation. Hob glared back at him. “You were out late at night, rounding up some strays that got loose, when suddenly some… thing–”  
""It were them witch-lights, a whole swarm of ‘em! I told you thrice already!”  
“Right, so down they come, shining light in your eyes. After blinding you, they snatch up the strays and leave you out on the plains.”  
“Aye, I sent up a signal too, but you lawmen showed up all slow like!”  
“We were busy, Hob. You weren’t the only one with… troubles last night,” countered Baldie. “In any case, by the time the night watch arrived, the strays had come back to you. So what’s all the fuss about, then?”  
“They’re marked by the hexfire, they are! A dark pall hangs o’er them!”  
“And that’s why you decided to shear them down to the bare hide?”  
“Well, how else was I s’posed to reveal the dark marks?”

Baldie glanced over at the shorn sheep. If they were in the thrall of some otherworldly force, they weren’t showing it. They were currently grazing on a patch of clover, blissfully unaware of the drama unfolding around them, making Baldie feel a pang of envy. Socks approached to join them, having completed the bloody business of packing up the evidence. He spoke to Hob while wiping his hands off on a rag.   
“Keep your velvet on, Hob. How about this, we’ll bring ‘em to the chattel physick to take a look-see. If he gives the all clear, you have to take ‘em back, and if something’s amiss, we’ll square away the price with you. All right?”  
“Whatever suits you, just get ‘em away from me. I don’t feel safe, knowing they’re watching me for their dark master. Who knows what they’re plotting?” hissed the old man, shaking his fist at the sheep. Baldie and Socks looked at the still oblivious animals, grazing away without a care in the world, then back to Hob. They were clearly unimpressed.

“They’re unclean, I tell you! Unclean!” insisted Hob, jabbing his finger at one of the supposed agents of the dark powers.

As if on cue, the sheep farted. Baldie and Socks remained unimpressed.

“Goddammit,” said Mendez with a tired sigh, watching Baldie and Socks on the screen as they led away their newly acquired sheep. “So we got three tracker-tagged sheep literally getting booked by the cops. What the hell is a ‘chattel physick’? Some kind of country vet or something?”  
“Yeah, a vet for farm animals, if I remember right. We’ve probably got a file on the guy and where his place is at. I’ll include it in the mission prep materials. Are we running a mission to get ‘em back?”  
“Depends. What did the drone stick ‘em with? Standard tracker, or a full on sensor package?”  
Tapping on his keyboard, Anders scanned his screen for the information. “Looks like they got the fauna biometrics tracking suite,” he said, wincing. He rattled off the specs, “Six low profile capsules, four subdermal, two intramuscular.”  
“Oh for fuck’s sake,” lamented Mendez, cradling his head in his hands. “The hell kind of retrieval mission do we fly for something like this?”  
“Aren’t you the one who said it’d be like a big ol’ heist movie? Think of it as a challenge! I can see it now, The Great Mutton Caper!”  
“*No manches* Mutton Caper! I oughta make mutton outta you, *cabron*,” grumbled Mendez.  
“Aw c’mon, look on the bright side, we’ll know exactly where they are at any given time, thanks to the trackers. That’s more than we can say for those missing driller bots,” replied Anders with a grin. 

Mendez remained unamused.

**Late Evening**  
**Caedwyn Realm, Consolidated Frontier Territories**  
**Miller’s Hollow, Municipal Guardhouse**

Reynard looked up from his ledger, glancing around the guardhouse offices. Flanking him were Baldie and Sam, busy with a stack of reports each. The three of them were handling paperwork, compiling witness testimonies for filing later. Dara and Socks were examining the animal remains and other perishable items. Rabbit and Belkund were in the evidence locker, tagging and sorting the rest of the items. They had burned every minute of daylight gathering everything they could in the wake of the hexfire sightings, and that was only half the job done. Now they had to attend to teasing apart the tangled account of events, and knit it back into a coherent and orderly telling. That’s what the Administratum would demand, and Reynard fully understood the risks of defying this expectation. 

The Nexian officials staffing the Administratum would be especially displeased with how the strange events seemed to be reviving old superstitions. Phrases like 'hexfire' were remnants of the past, rooted in the old magics of the realm, before the Nexians papered over the 'backward superstitions of ignorant rustics' with more civilized magical arts. The Nexians were accustomed to a newrealm’s old ways retreating to the margins of history, while the Nexus busily penned new chapters with grand, sweeping strokes.

Such gusto often placed a great deal of pressure on the local populace and their leaders. So far, the Nexians were content to push their Reformations at a gradual but steady pace. But Reynard knew their patience would not last forever. Soon enough, they would become much more insistent and far less polite. His time in the military taught him just how insistent and impolite the Empire could be. Not wanting to dwell further on such thoughts, Reynard busied himself with his paperwork once more.

He had a long shift ahead of him."
I Took a Shortcut Through an Empty Mall. I Haven’t Found the Exit Yet.,CreepsMcPasta,1i9ux83,2025-01-25 14:32:18,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepsMcPasta/comments/1i9ux83/i_took_a_shortcut_through_an_empty_mall_i_havent/,Frequent-Cat,,"I’ve been feeling kind of... off lately. Work has been insane, and most days, I’m too drained to do anything but go straight home and collapse in front of the TV. My routine’s been the same for months: walk out of work, zone out with my headphones, hope no one tries to talk to me, and drive home. It’s not exciting, but it works. Or at least, it did.

A few nights ago, I decided to mix things up. Traffic was bad, the rain was coming down in sheets, and I was tired of staring at the same depressing route home. I figured I’d try a shortcut, a faster way through the maze of downtown streets. The area’s a mess of half-finished renovations and old, crumbling buildings, but I thought I knew it well enough to find my way.

That’s when I remembered the mall.

I used to go there all the time as a kid. Back then, it was huge and crowded, full of life. There was a carousel in the food court, bright neon signs everywhere, and this old candy shop my mom used to bribe me with when I threw tantrums. But as the years went by, the place started to die. Stores closed, and the crowds disappeared. Last I heard, most of it was abandoned except for a few discount shops hanging on by a thread.

I was already running late, and the idea of cutting through the mall popped into my head like it was meant to be. I figured, why not? Even if it’s mostly empty, it’s probably faster than walking around the block in the rain. And hey, maybe I’d get a little nostalgia kick while I was at it.

The entrance I found was one of those side doors, the kind that janitors or delivery workers use. It wasn’t marked, just a plain metal door tucked into an alcove, but it opened without much effort. No locked chain, no rusted-over handle, just a gentle push, and I was in.

The hallway was dimly lit, and the fluorescent lights above buzzed faintly, flickering every few seconds. The air was stale, like it hadn’t been disturbed in a while, and there was this faint smell of mildew that hit me right away. But I shrugged it off. It’s an old building. What did I expect?

At first, it felt kind of cool, like I was stepping into a time capsule. The floors were that old-school white tile with black accents, scuffed and cracked in places, and the walls were covered in faded advertisements for stores that probably hadn’t existed in years. There was a quiet hum in the background, fans or something, maybe- but no voices, no footsteps. Just... stillness.

Something that hit me was the silence. Not the kind of quiet you’d expect in an abandoned place, this was something heavier. The air felt dense, like the building itself was holding its breath. The faint hum of the fluorescent lights above was the only sound, and even that felt like it was straining to break the stillness.

Most of the stores were exactly what I expected: boarded-up or empty shells, their faded signage barely clinging to the walls. A few windows still had displays, but they were like time capsules, mannequins in dated outfits, old movie posters advertising long-forgotten blockbusters, and sale banners with slogans that felt weirdly optimistic for a place like this.

I remember feeling a little uneasy, but I kept telling myself it was just the vibe of an old, abandoned mall. That’s what happens when a place gets left behind. It felt like a ghost of what it used to be, but that was normal, right? Still, I picked up my pace, hoping to get to the other side quickly. I just wanted to be out in the fresh air again.

That’s when I noticed something strange. The layout didn’t feel right. I mean, it had been years since I’d been there, so I figured my memory might be a little off, but the hallways seemed... wrong. Longer than they should’ve been. The way they twisted and turned didn’t make sense, like the angles were slightly off. I’d walk for what felt like minutes, only to turn a corner and find myself back at the same stretch of empty storefronts.

Then I reached the food court, or at least what was left of it. It was completely empty, save for one table sitting dead center. Just one. There was a single chair pulled out slightly, like someone had been sitting there and left in a hurry. On the table was a Styrofoam cup, and I swear, I could see steam rising from it.

That’s when I felt it, that first real twinge of fear. You know that cold rush you get when your body senses something is off before your brain catches up? I stood there for a long moment, staring at that cup, trying to tell myself it was nothing. Maybe it was an old trickle of heat from a vent, or maybe someone was here, just a maintenance worker or another person cutting through like me. I even called out, “Hello? Anyone here?”

Nothing.

I should’ve turned back then. I should’ve taken my chances in the rain, but I convinced myself it was fine. Just an empty building. People leave weird things behind all the time. Right?

So, I kept going. I turned the corner where the exit should’ve been, and... it wasn’t there. No double glass doors, no faded Thank You for Shopping! sign. Just another hallway, stretching deeper into the mall.

That’s when it hit me: I wasn’t getting out of here anytime soon.

\-

I can’t even tell you when it went from “a little weird” to full-blown terrifying, but it happened fast.

The hallways started to feel uncanny. Like, I know how ridiculous this sounds, but they weren’t just hallways anymore. They stretched longer than they should’ve, and every time I thought I recognized a turn, it either led somewhere completely new or looped me right back to where I started. I tried to stay calm. Old buildings are confusing, right? But the more I walked, the more it felt like the place was shifting around me.

Then I started noticing the details. The mannequins in the storefronts, I swear, they weren’t in the same positions when I looked back. I told myself I was imagining it, but I’m not that imaginative. One minute, they’d be posed normally, like you’d expect, arms out, wearing clothes from decades ago- and the next, one would have its head tilted toward me, or its hand would be raised, like it was pointing.

And the walls... God, the walls. Some of the advertisements looked normal from a distance, but when I got closer, the faces on them were all wrong. They were blurry, almost smudged, like someone had rubbed out the features, but I could still make out just enough to know they were faces. And the worst part? I thought I recognized one of them. It looked a little like me, distorted, warped.

I pulled out my phone, hoping I could get my bearings with GPS or at least check the time, but that was useless too. No signal, no Wi-Fi, just a spinning loading wheel that wouldn’t go away. And the time? It was all over the place. One second it said 4:47 p.m., the next it jumped to 11:13. Then it reset entirely, flashing 00:00 like I’d just turned it on for the first time.

I tried retracing my steps, backtracking the way I came, but nothing lined up. The food court? Gone. The hallway with the Styrofoam cup? Now it led to a dead-end with a boarded-up storefront I was sure I hadn’t seen before. I kept walking, though, because what else could I do? But the deeper I went, the stranger it got. Some of the hallways were so long, my phone flashlight couldn’t reach the end. The beam just disappeared into the darkness, like the mall was swallowing the light.

The whispers started soon after that. Faint at first, like someone just out of earshot, but they were definitely there. I couldn’t make out what they were saying, just this low murmur, almost like the hum of the fluorescent lights but... alive. Every now and then, I’d hear a word or two. I think I heard my name once, but I might’ve imagined it. I hope I imagined it.

And then the footsteps. God, the footsteps. I thought I was alone in there, knew I was alone, but suddenly, I could hear them. Just a soft, rhythmic tap-tap-tap behind me. I thought it was an echo of my own steps, so I stopped walking. They didn’t.

I whipped around, shining my flashlight down the hallway, but there was nothing there. Just empty space. The sound stopped too, like whoever, or whatever, was making it knew I was listening. I waited, holding my breath, and after a minute, I turned back around.

The second I started walking again, the footsteps started up too. This time, they were faster, louder, like something was closing the distance between us.

I didn’t look back again. I just started running.

\-

I don’t think I’ve ever felt as relieved as I did when I saw that exit sign.

After what felt like hours of wandering, corridors stretching endlessly, mannequins shifting when I wasn’t looking, whispers that I couldn’t place, I thought I was done for. But then there it was: the bright red glow of an Exit sign above a heavy steel door at the end of the hallway. It stood out like a lifeline in all that darkness, a promise that I wasn’t trapped after all.

I don’t even remember how fast I moved. One second I was standing there, staring, and the next I was sprinting toward it, the sound of my footsteps echoing like gunshots in the empty space. My heart was hammering, but it wasn’t from fear this time, it was relief. I was getting out.

The door was heavy, but it opened without much effort. The moment it swung open, I felt a rush of fresh air hit my face. It smelled like rain, clean and normal. I stepped outside and found myself on a street, one I didn’t recognize but looked like any other part of the city. I saw cars, headlights slicing through the twilight. People walked along the sidewalks, some carrying umbrellas or shopping bags. It was just... life. Real, tangible, normal life.

I actually laughed. I know that sounds crazy, but I did, I laughed out loud, this shaky, almost delirious laugh. All the fear, all the weirdness in that mall... it had gotten to me. I’d let it get to me. And now here I was, standing in the middle of a busy street, like nothing had happened. I even muttered to myself, “You really need to get a grip.”

But then I noticed something.

At first, I couldn’t put my finger on it. I was too busy calming down, trying to process everything. But as I watched the people on the street, I realized they weren’t... moving right. There was this stiffness to them, like their bodies were following a script but didn’t quite know how to stick to it. One woman in a red coat walked past me, her arms swinging in a loop, the same exact motion over and over. A man across the street adjusted his hat, then did it again, and again, as if stuck in a glitch.

And the cars, they were completely silent. No engines, no honking, nothing but the faint hum of the city, like a white noise machine trying to imitate what it thought a street should sound like.

I felt my stomach drop. My relief evaporated, replaced by a cold, sinking dread. Slowly, I turned around, hoping, praying, to see something normal behind me. But what I saw was worse.

The mall was still there. It wasn’t the same door I’d come out of, though. This one was different, taller, darker, with warped glass that seemed to shimmer in the dim light. It was like the building had followed me, refusing to let me go.

The laughter I’d felt earlier? It was gone. All I could think was, I didn’t escape. I never left.

\-

I don’t know why I went back inside. Maybe it was panic, maybe it was desperation, or maybe it was because the mall wouldn’t let me leave, no matter what I did. But as soon as I stepped through the door, I knew I’d made a mistake.

The air was colder, sharper. My breath fogged up, and the faint smell of mildew hit me like a punch. The layout was... different again. The hallways were narrower, the walls closer, and I swear I could feel them pressing in, like they were alive and watching me. Every step I took made the floor creak under my weight, like the building was groaning, unhappy I was back.

The mannequins were worse now. They were everywhere, lining the windows, slumped in the corners. Their heads were gone. Just smooth necks, bent at odd angles, as if they were staring even though they had no eyes. Some of them still had their hands outstretched, frozen in strange, almost pleading gestures. I tried not to look at them, but I couldn’t help it. Every time I glanced away, I could’ve sworn they’d moved closer.

And the whispers? They weren’t whispers anymore. The soft murmurs had deepened into something guttural and low, almost like growling, but still just quiet enough to make me question if I was really hearing it. It sounded like a crowd, all speaking at once in a language I didn’t understand. The echoes bounced off the walls, filling the air with this constant, oppressive noise that made it impossible to think straight.

Then I noticed the signs. Storefronts that had once been empty now had glowing signs, but they weren’t advertising anything normal. Some just had my name, in bold, flickering letters. Others had phrases that made my stomach churn, like “We’ve been waiting for you.” One sign simply read “Don’t run.”

I didn’t know what to do. I kept walking, my legs moving on autopilot while my brain screamed at me to get out, but there was no getting out. I rounded a corner and froze.

It was the food court again. At least, I think it was. The same peeling tiles, the same dim lighting, but now the table with the Styrofoam cup wasn’t off to the side. It was in the dead center of the room, like it had been waiting for me. The steam was still there, curling up from the liquid inside, but now the chair was pulled out and facing me.

Sitting in the chair was a mannequin.

It wasn’t like the others. Its plastic skin was cracked, and its hand- smooth, artificial, and horribly human, was wrapped around the cup. Its head was tilted, almost like it was looking right at me, even though it didn’t have a face. I don’t know how long I stood there, staring at it, but eventually, my legs gave out. I slid to the floor, pressing my back against the wall as my chest heaved with shallow breaths.

That’s when I felt it. The wall behind me, it wasn’t solid. It was soft, warm. And it was moving. Pulsing. Like I was leaning against something alive.

I shot up so fast I nearly fell over. My hands flew to the wall, touching it like I needed proof that it wasn’t what I thought it was. But it was. It was pulsing beneath my fingers, steady and rhythmic, like a heartbeat.

I panicked. I completely lost it.  
  
I don’t even remember making the decision to run, but suddenly my legs were moving, carrying me blindly through the endless corridors. I wasn’t trying to think anymore, I couldn’t. The walls pulsed, the whispers chased me, and the lights flickered in stuttering, seizure-inducing bursts. The shadows on the walls weren’t staying still anymore; they twisted and moved, stretching into shapes that didn’t make sense.

I screamed for help. I don’t know who I thought would hear me, but I screamed until my throat felt raw. The sound barely seemed to carry; it just fell flat, like the air was swallowing it. I turned corners without thinking, sprinting past storefronts that all looked the same.

The lights above me flickered so violently I could barely see, but up ahead, there was something else: an exit. A glowing green sign above a heavy steel door. It was different from the others, no warped glass, no sense of wrongness about it. It looked real. It felt real.

But so had the last exit.

I hesitated, torn between staying where I was and taking my chances with the door. That’s when I heard it behind me, the shuffle of footsteps, low murmurs just on the edge of hearing. Something was coming. And it was getting closer.

I didn’t think. I just ran for the door and threw it open.

For a second, I thought I’d made it. I felt the rush of air, the promise of open space... but then I looked around.

I was back in the food court.

At first, it seemed empty again, just like before. But as my eyes adjusted to the dim light, I realized I wasn’t alone. The tables were full. Dozens of people, or what looked like people, were sitting perfectly still, facing each other. No one spoke. No one moved.

And none of them had faces.

Their heads were smooth and blank, featureless ovals of flesh-colored nothingness. They all sat stiffly, their hands resting neatly on the tables. My eyes darted to the center of the room, and there it was again: the table with the Styrofoam cup, the steam still curling lazily into the air. The mannequin was gone.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. The figures didn’t react at first, but then, one by one, they began to turn. Slowly, methodically, they all turned to face me in unison.

I stumbled backward, my legs shaking so badly I almost fell. My back hit the wall, and I realized there was nowhere to go. The figures just kept staring, or whatever the faceless equivalent of staring was. I don’t know how long I stood there, frozen, but eventually, I heard it again: the whispers.

Only this time, they weren’t coming from the walls. They were coming from the figures. Dozens of them. All speaking at once in overlapping, distorted murmurs, like they were trying to form words but couldn’t.

And then, one of them stood up.

I couldn’t move.

The figures rose from their seats one by one, their movements stiff and unnatural, like someone was pulling them up with invisible strings. They didn’t speak, just that horrible, overlapping whispering sound coming from all of them. It filled the air, pressing down on me until I thought my chest might cave in.

They surrounded me slowly, forming a tight circle. Their faceless heads tilted, as if studying me. My heart was pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears, but my legs wouldn’t respond. I was trapped.

One of them stepped closer, its movements jerky but deliberate. It reached out, and I wanted to scream, to shove it away, to do something, but I couldn’t. Its hand was cold when it touched my face, like metal left out in the winter. The moment its fingers brushed my skin, a jolt shot through me. 

Everything went black.

\-

When I woke up, I wasn’t standing anymore. I was sitting at a table. The table. The one in the center of the food court. A Styrofoam cup of steaming liquid was in front of me, just like it had been before.

For a moment, I thought I’d imagined everything. Maybe I’d passed out, maybe it was all some kind of nightmare brought on by stress or dehydration. I looked down, ready to grab the cup and shake myself back to reality.

But the hands resting on the table weren’t mine.

They were smooth, plastic, and jointed at the knuckles like a mannequin’s. I tried to move them, and they obeyed, but it didn’t feel right, like there was a disconnect between the command and the action. My breath caught in my throat, and I looked around the food court.

The figures were back at their tables, sitting still and silent, just like before. None of them moved, but I could feel their attention on me. My mind raced, trying to understand, to process what had happened, but all I could feel was the crushing weight of realization.

I was one of them now.

I don’t know how long I sat there, staring at my hands and the cup in front of me. Time doesn’t seem to work the same way here. I don’t even know if I’m alive in the way I was before. But I can still think. I can still feel. And I can still remember what I was."
"At Gracepoint Ministries, ‘Whole-Life Discipleship’ Took Its Toll",GracepointChurch,1i9uwx4,2025-01-25 14:31:54,5,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/comments/1i9uwx4/at_gracepoint_ministries_wholelife_discipleship/,hamcycle,,"by Curtis Yee

*As the predominantly Asian American church network expands to dozens of college towns, former members come forward with claims of spiritual abuse.*

*Update (August 15, 2023): Gracepoint Ministries, formerly Gracepoint Church,* [*has rebranded*](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.acts2.network/about/our-story) *as Acts2 Network. The group’s website states that “the scope of our ministries is such that our original local church’s name no longer adequately captures who we are.” The church's highly coordinated top-down organization structure will shift to a more “locally-led, centrally-supported model” while still maintaining its “core DNA.”*

*The ministry has also clarified expectations around its “*[*Way of Life*](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.acts2.network/way-of-life)*,” which includes a “default position of support” for leaders and adopting a “common calendar.” Noting that Pastor Ed Kang and his wife, Kelly, are now in their 60s, the ministry says it is “restructuring to prepare for a future transition to the next generation of leaders.”*

Gracepoint Church checks all the boxes of a college ministry success story.

Founded in 1981 around the concept of whole-life discipleship, the church—then known as Berkland Baptist—established itself as a home for Asian American students attending the University of California, Berkeley. With the mission to plant “an Acts 2 church in every college town,” Gracepoint stands out among [the loose network](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://nyupress.org/9780814747902/gods-new-whiz-kids/) of predominantly Asian American college churches that pepper campuses across the West Coast and beyond.

Located on over 60 campuses, it has launched church plants in 35 cities nationwide, as well as one in Taiwan, with 15 new churches planted in 2021 alone.

At campus clubs like Klesis and Acts2Fellowship, Gracepoint pushes college students to wrestle with tough questions and pursue church mentorship. At graduation, it encourages young Christians to live life on mission by joining staff at one of its campuses or helping launch a new one. Staying at Gracepoint has a strong appeal, echoing the coming-of-age films that ask, *Why can’t college last forever?*

“I guess you could say we were just a bunch of people who enjoyed college life so much that we never left it,” the church quips in a [promotional video](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxlbN8MtjN4&feature=youtu.be).

“I think people experience a spiritual vibrancy and potency and just a warmth and depth of relationship with God that they haven’t experienced elsewhere,” said Michael Kim, a member at the church’s Santa Barbara campus who was raised at Gracepoint. “For serving members, it’s high pressure, high labor, high toil, but high gratification.”

[https://www.facebook.com/gracepointchurches/posts/pfbid02GdF6JpQmHiay2dxNNsrqKQiG2iwZfz2JeydHBKho9k8t1o7PtujUKeftePFcXkRHl](https://www.facebook.com/gracepointchurches/posts/pfbid02GdF6JpQmHiay2dxNNsrqKQiG2iwZfz2JeydHBKho9k8t1o7PtujUKeftePFcXkRHl)

But many who were involved in Gracepoint say the church’s desire to pursue radical living, coupled with the pace of its ministry, has come at a cost—its members.

“They do good, but the process in which they enforce that good is spiritually abusive,” said Joshua Mun, a former member who grew up attending the Berkeley church and served at various Gracepoint church plants throughout his 20s.

Thirty-two former Gracepoint members who spoke with *Christianity Today* for this story described a culture that was “controlling” and “coercive” for the sake of ministry efficiency.

Members said they were manipulated into confessing sins, screamed at by leaders, and overloaded with obligations to the point of illness. To keep members focused on mission work, Gracepoint effectively restricted dating, media consumption, and pet ownership. Leaders directed staff on how to arrange their homes, where to shop for clothes, and what cars to drive.

“My leader’s words were like the words of God,” said Mun, who left the church last year due in part to anxiety. “I viewed God as this incredibly sensitive, temperamental, judgmental being. I’m one sin away from him dropping the hammer and smiting me, because that’s what my leaders were representing to me.”

Gracepoint has faced decades of criticism from members who left its ranks, but allegations drew new attention last year on a channel of the message board site [Reddit](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/). Posters allege they were [belittled by church leaders](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://web.archive.org/web/20220226000204/Www.Reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/comments/t1h5ao/calling_me_a_dog/), encouraged to [take on credit card debt](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/comments/o2hgo5/credit_card_debt_email/) to fund ministry expenses, and slandered after [choosing to leave the church](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/comments/pp7htb/gracepoint_ignores_and_discredits_all_those_who/).

“I am very sorry for those who feel they have experienced harm under our ministry,” wrote Ed Kang, the church’s senior pastor and network leader, in an email response to questions sent by CT. Kang said he would be “eager to hear from them so that we can seek healing, apologize when necessary, and seek reconciliation.”

A regional director for the church, Daniel Kim (no relation to Michael Kim), shared his contact information on the forum, asking those looking for “personal reconciliation” to reach out. He told CT that eight people have contacted him since he first posted in April 2021.

Over the course of CT reporting this article, Gracepoint has begun to rethink aspects of its ministry style and implement reforms. Kang told CT the church is focusing on “dialing down the excellence” in response to internal reflection and public criticism.

“One conclusion was that a lot of our relationships have been disrupted because of our church planting efforts,” Kang said. “We have been too task oriented, trying to do a lot with fewer people and thinned-out relationships.”

Yet even when acknowledging former members’ hurt, leaders have prioritized the [damage they’ve done to Gracepoint’s ministry](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/comments/syzdcr/a_plea_from_gracepoint/) by making their grievances public.

On a [new church podcast](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfAkZ0jJ6RkfMZqaJVCqWNA) launched last month, Isaiah Kang, Ed’s son, said anonymous posters are “not messengers from heaven.” He added, “Whatever else may be true—you may be wronged, you probably were wronged—that doesn’t make what you do right.”

While college ministries like InterVarsity and Asian American Christian Fellowship were launching programs to serve a growing wave of Asian immigrants and second-generation Asian Americans, Rebekah and Paul Kim (no relation to the other Kims) [planted a church](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/fall-2009-constant-change/new-believers/) to minister to Korean Americans at UC Berkeley in 1981. On the border of Berkeley and Oakland, the church was named Berkland Baptist.

Berkland members bonded as both Christians and Korean Americans, often referring to older church members by Korean honorifics—*hyung* for older brother and *noona* for older sister.

“One of the things that’s good about the Korean culture is that when someone wants you close to them, they make you part of their family,” said a former longtime Berkland member who asked not to be named due to his close ties with Gracepoint leadership. “You’re not just a fellow brother in Christ; you are really my brother. You’re my true family. Those kinds of values were considered essential as part of the church.”

That familial attitude tied into the church’s model of whole-life discipleship. Like many college ministries where young adults commit to codes of conduct, accountability, and community obligations, Berkland attracted Asian American students with its strict but tight-knit ministry philosophy.

They joined the church, paired with disciplers for mentorship, fervently studied Scripture, and evangelized on their campuses, seeing more added to the church. (Because of the church’s focus on college ministry, leaders discouraged members from inviting coworkers or neighbors who were out of college.)

By getting involved in Berkland, and later Gracepoint, students were expected to forgo the typical liberties associated with college life. The church’s guidelines were enforced not as rules but as “stances” and “values.”

Undergraduate students were discouraged from dating and, in some cases, forced to break up. (The church is reconsidering its stance against dating, Kang said.) When disciplers approved of a dating relationship, both parties were still expected to keep it private. Half a dozen former members recalled learning that couples were together only upon receiving wedding invitations.

When they became part of the ministry team, Gracepoint members were required to install internet filtering software like Covenant Eyes on their devices. Leaders could track screen time not just to check for pornography but also to discourage users from listening to K-pop or watching too much ESPN. Kang told CT the church tries to mitigate “the effects of the media-entertainment complex and tech companies” and has historically discouraged the use of televisions and social media.

According to Len Tang, director of the Church Planting Initiative at Fuller Theological Seminary, high-pressure churches like Gracepoint often enforce a “methodological purity” within their ministry.

“A methodological purity might say that college ministry must be done in a specific way. You have to disciple them in a particular way, or you need to isolate them or separate them from certain influences,” Tang said.

Young members were being discipled to follow not only the Bible but also the church’s culture—what was acceptable, what was lauded by their leaders as signs of their devotion. And when they violated those expectations, often unknowingly, the results could be explosive.

Paul Lee said his pastor at UC Riverside called to yell at him for having coffee with a female friend on staff, which he had done before but didn’t know was frowned on. “He jumped so quickly to scolding me, really making sure I was in this posture of shame,” Lee said.

Documents from 2011 taught church leaders to rebuke members “so that the person gets to have proper fear toward God & proper shock over what he has done,” with the trainer modeling screaming and slamming the table, according to former staff. Kang said such rebukes are infrequent and such training couldn’t be used now with the “anxiety and emotional fragility” of today’s generation.

These outbursts shamed members for not following the standards of their community. But what might have felt like conviction from God at the moment they later saw as the leaders’ aggression.

One Thanksgiving, Austin Lee (no relation to Paul) was berated for not tithing enough after moving cross-country to help plant a church at the University of North Carolina without consistent employment. Pastor Richard Tjhen told CT he became “agitated and annoyed” because Austin Lee was defensive during their conversation. Tjhen said that his own actions were “totally inappropriate and not our church policy.”

>""I realized I was never going to be able to prove that I was taking my sins seriously.""

Members under discipline could be asked to refrain from serving in ministries and even attending services. But their restoration hinged on the whims of Gracepoint leaders, with the process sometimes dragging out and involving assignments to repent with written reflections and confessions. Kang said that a “period of withdrawal” from ministry can be appropriate, but the practice of writing reflections has tapered off over the years.

The Berkland network [disbanded](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/comments/nkbx1r/eds_letter_to_becky_2005_after_discussion_with/) in 2006, and the Berkeley and Davis churches rebranded as Gracepoint, eventually planting churches in college cities and towns beyond California. Under Kang’s leadership, Gracepoint campuses offered near-identical weekly [programming](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/http://www.course101.org/), down to [recipe](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/http://www.dishgracepoint.com/) recommendations.

Commitment to church ordered all of life: Tabulated spreadsheets organized staff schedules by the hour, often stretching late into evenings and weekends. Members realized their schedules were no longer their own. They were expected to ask permission to go on vacation or visit their families, former members said.

“I had a strained relationship with my parents,” said Martin Loekito, who was a member of Gracepoint’s Davis church for 14 years. “I could never spend time with them without feeling like I needed to get away, like I needed to be back at church.”

Another former member, Elaine Huang, said church leaders called her “selfish” when she opted to visit her parents in Taiwan the summer after her graduation from UC Berkeley in the early 2010s. Arguing that her parents were already saved and therefore required less of her attention, Huang’s leaders convinced her to cut her months-long trip short to participate in the church’s fall outreach.

For Loekito and others, the church’s warning of idolizing the family carried into married life. Loekito said his eldest daughter spent large portions of her early childhood at the church’s babysitting ministry while he and his wife were participating in events.

“When we left \[the church\], she was a year and a half old, and I kind of felt like it was a lost time,” he said, recollecting on missing his daughter’s first words and steps. “Just having dinner, everyone at the same table—that was very rare.”

Years of “whole-life discipleship” took a toll. Paul Lee, the former Riverside church member, experienced “physically debilitating” stress that caused stomachaches, headaches, and frequent panic attacks. Despite bringing his symptoms to his leaders, he said he was not allowed to step back from most of his church responsibilities.

“I think it was at that point when I realized that \[the church\] really did not care for my well-being,” Lee said. “They cared more that I was staying and being a productive sort of functioning member.”

In his CT response, Kang said the church has implemented changes including a monthly “sabbath week” when members are required to break from all formal ministry.

In an internal survey of 1,004 Gracepoint members late last year, 37 percent viewed the church primarily as a family, 34 percent viewed it as an army, and 29 percent viewed it as a factory.

Whole-life discipleship did in fact extend to every area of life. According to emails from former leaders, members were asked to change their wardrobe (“I think I need to get some odd clothes out of \[this member’s\] closet too so she doesn’t get tempted to keep wearing them.”), dietary habits (“I found out \[that you\] regularly eat late at night. I think you need to really curb that. I have noticed that you are looking more and more unhealthy lately.”), and living spaces (“I was appalled once again to hear that your house has been like a pig sty. … Either your life is out of control or you are extremely lazy or you are extremely selfish.”).

Leaders might recommend specific pieces of home decor (the affordable [Ikea Kallax](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/kallax-shelf-unit-white-80275887/)) or clothes (modest yet tasteful Ann Taylor and Banana Republic). Members even purchased similar vehicles—the Nissan Quest or Honda Odyssey, affordable minivans that could easily transport students and ministry supplies.

>37% of Gracepoint members viewed the church primarily as a family, 34% viewed it as an army, and 29% viewed it as a factory.

While oversight and granular life advice can be part of college formation and discipleship, Gracepoint’s influence grew more intrusive as members remained at the church. One member who attended Gracepoint Berkeley for 22 years worried that her involvement stunted her maturity.

“One of the things I’m learning now that I’m out \[of the church\] is that I can actually make my own decisions without checking with somebody, asking for permission, being afraid that I’ll get in trouble,” she said. “I know it sounds weird. This is what a 20-year-old would realize, but here I am at 40 just realizing this now.”

Evangelical ministries eager for holistic, 24/7, “all-of-life” discipleship have sometimes crossed boundaries into spiritual abuse, where members feel coerced and manipulated rather than guided and mentored. In 2020, Acts 29 CEO Steve Timmis [was removed from leadership for his level of bullying and control.](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2020/february/acts-29-ceo-steve-timmis-removed-spiritual-abuse-tch.html) The charismatic shepherding movement of the 1970s and ’80s ended with [former leaders disavowing](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/1990/march-19/shepherding-movement-idea-whose-time-has-gone.html) their own intrusive practices. (Former Berkland members said founder Rebekah Kim was [trained by University Bible Fellowship](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/comments/t74d8i/gracepoints_spiritual_heritage_university_bible/), a Korean offshoot of the shepherding movement.)

Six ex-Gracepoint staff said mental breakdowns contributed to their decisions to leave the church and, for some, the faith. Last year, Pete Nguyen left Gracepoint after experiencing severe depression and suicidal thoughts while attending.

Huang, the UC Berkeley student, said a church leader told her that her suicidal thoughts were because she didn’t “love God enough.” She said this response pushed her to walk away from Christianity. The leader, Suzanne Suh, said she did not recall the conversation but “would not talk to someone who is suicidal using this type of approach or using these kinds of words.”

A former UC Santa Barbara student said her declining well-being—depression and an eating disorder relapse—was seen as evidence of her unrepentance after she crossed a physical boundary with her boyfriend. She was asked to write reflections and was repeatedly told that she had not seen the full reality of her sin.

“These constant assessments about me being unrepentant—they didn’t reflect what I was actually thinking and feeling,” said Noelle, who is also an abuse survivor and asked CT not to use her last name due to her job as a teacher. “I realized I was never going to be able to prove that I was taking my sins seriously.”

Online criticism of the church’s high-pressure environment did not start with the Reddit posts. Anonymous blogs including *Twisted Gracepoint* and [*The Truth about Gracepoint Church*](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://gracepoint-berkeley.blogspot.com/) circulated online in the 2000s.

Emails obtained by CT show that Gracepoint maintained its own blogs to compete with those critiquing the church. Over the years, church members were told to avoid driving traffic to the online criticism and were instead encouraged to protect the church’s “online reputation.” At times, Gracepoint leaders asked staff and members to search and click on church webpages or positive blog posts at least three times a day to improve Google search rankings.

Church leaders were also encouraged to write positive Yelp reviews—and sometimes report negative ones. Both practices remain, especially in the ramp-up to fall quarter.

Gracepoint’s training documents teach staff to explain why the church’s “hierarchical leadership” is “not authoritarian” or why negative perception of the church’s culture of rebuke is “overblown” due to “an emotionally fragile generation.” Weary of internal programs being leaked, leaders asked members to periodically delete “sensitive” recordings and emails containing talks and trainings or to watch them under supervision.

An FAQ page on Gracepoint’s website answered the question “[Is Gracepoint a Cult?](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://web.archive.org/web/20220910014212/https://www.gracepointonline.org/is-gracepoint-a-cult)”—“Nope, not really”—while dismissing “Reddit trolls” and touting its Southern Baptist affiliation. (Kang previously sat on the [advisory board](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.gracepointonline.org/partners) for Send Network, the church planting arm of the Southern Baptists’ North American Mission Board. Vance Pitman, the network’s president, has [lauded](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.instagram.com/p/Ca6R5TysA9A/) Kang’s “kingdom leadership.”)

Some critics are taking their concerns offline. Several parents of former and current members, worried that the church is distancing them from their children, have raised concerns about the church’s fellowship groups to leaders at UC campuses and Biola University.

The University of San Francisco revoked the recognition status of Gracepoint’s Klesis fellowship in May 2021 because it “did not meet the requirements to be a USF affiliated ministry, misrepresented its relationship with Gracepoint Church, and continued to have contact with students” following an interim suspension issued in March. Kang confirmed the church no longer operates on the campus, though some students still attend the San Francisco location. He was unsure how the group may have misrepresented itself to the university.

For those who have left, connecting with other former members in person and online has helped their transition out of the church. Loekito, who left in 2019, said that the discussion has allowed him and his wife to process their experience, but reacclimating to a new church has been hard.

“My regrets are mostly about the people that I ministered to when I had no right to be called a minister,” Loekito said. “Some of them left, and I was able to reconnect with them and say I’m sorry for what I did to them. But the worst is those who are still there, young people who I told to defy their parents and throw away their ambitions and throw away their future to join the \[Gracepoint\] cause.”

Some former members said their departures were mischaracterized within the organization, with current attendees saying that those who left did so to “pursue the world” by purchasing pets or getting Disneyland passes.

“It feels like the bridge is being burnt from the other end,” said Mun. “I’m not going to negate the truth that God reached me through Gracepoint, but it doesn’t mean that Gracepoint is God’s heaven on earth.”

Gracepoint continues its evangelism efforts for the fall semester. Rebranding as Gracepoint Ministries, it has expanded Area Youth Ministry, a parachurch organization meant to evangelize middle- and high-school students and supplement church youth groups. The group operates in [24 cities](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.areayouth.org/locations), and according to Kang, Gracepoint staff are now split between college and noncollege ministries.

Nguyen, who left in 2021 after attending Gracepoint for a decade, has spoken at length with his former leaders at the Riverside and Pomona campuses, as well as with Daniel Kim, about the ways he felt wronged.

“If they really examine things, they really could change,” he said, “but I just don’t think they’re willing to let go of a lot of the practices they’ve been holding on to.”

During an April 2021 sermon on one of the Beatitudes, Kang told the church not to be discouraged by their online critics; Jesus himself warned that detractors would “utter all kinds of evil against you falsely” (Matt. 5:11, ESV).

“Clearly people who are posting are either genuinely grieved and wounded or so narcissistic that some small evil or injustice or wrong done to them is something utterly outrageous and they can’t move on,” Kang said.

“One thing that we must not do is be persuaded by criticism that there’s something wrong with us.”

This may damage the lugs. But ive noticed that it does have a different size. But it just fits right and doesnt have that much of a movement. Possibly just so minimal that naked eye wont even notice, only if you really take time to look at it very much super closely.

Im gonna give myself hopefully morethan a year to notice if id end up like the other casioak mods with models like ga2100/gab2100. 

To my other gbm2100 users have you changed your straps to a metal one? and does it also move like mine or stiff as well?

Id also noticed that the usual issue comes from an excessive force. 

Planning to use this as my beater.

Top 5 Ideas for Hosting a Princess Party in Tampa,u_erepresent,1i9uo5w,2025-01-25 14:21:30,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1i9uo5w/top_5_ideas_for_hosting_a_princess_party_in_tampa/,erepresent,,"Hosting a princess-themed party is a magical way to celebrate your child’s special day. In a beautiful city like Tampa, the options for creating an enchanting event are endless, thanks to its stunning venues, vibrant community, and sunny weather. Whether you’re planning an indoor or outdoor event, the right theme and activities can transform your celebration into a fairy-tale experience. To help you plan, here are the top five ideas for hosting a Tampa princess party that will make your child feel like royalty.

# 1. Transform Your Venue into a Royal Castle

One of the best ways to bring the magic of a princess party to life is by turning your venue into a regal castle. With some creativity and attention to detail, you can set the stage for an unforgettable celebration.

* **Decor:** Use pastel-colored balloons, shimmering curtains, and fairy lights to create a whimsical atmosphere. Add castle-shaped banners, royal thrones, and princess-themed table settings to enhance the theme.
* **Photo Backdrop:** Create a photo booth area with a castle backdrop, props like crowns and wands, and twinkling fairy lights for stunning pictures.
* **DIY Ideas:** Incorporate simple DIY projects, such as crafting paper crowns for the tables or decorating chairs with sparkly ribbons.

Whether you’re hosting the party at home or at a rented venue, the royal castle theme is guaranteed to captivate your guests.

# 2. Host a Garden Tea Party

Tampa’s sunny weather makes an outdoor princess tea party a fantastic choice. This idea combines elegance with fun, giving kids the chance to enjoy a royal afternoon in a beautiful garden setting.

* **Decor:** Arrange tables with lace tablecloths, floral centerpieces, and vintage tea sets. Add pastel umbrellas or canopies for shade and a touch of sophistication.
* **Activities:** Include crown decorating or flower crafting as pre-tea activities. Let the kids enjoy a “royal tea tasting” with pink lemonade or juice served in tea cups.
* **Menu:** Serve finger sandwiches, mini cupcakes, and cookies shaped like tiaras and stars.

This idea works wonderfully in Tampa’s parks or even your own backyard, creating a charming and memorable event.

# 3. Plan an Enchanted Under-the-Sea Adventure

If your child loves mermaids and ocean-themed adventures, an under-the-sea princess party is the perfect option. Tampa’s proximity to water makes this theme even more fitting.

* **Decor:** Use shades of blue, teal, and purple with touches of shimmering silver. Add seashells, starfish, and netting to create an underwater effect.
* **Activities:** Organize a treasure hunt for “pearls” and “gold coins,” set up a bubble-blowing station, or host a mermaid sing-along.
* **Menu:** Offer snacks like fish-shaped sandwiches, “seaweed” veggie sticks, and ocean-themed cupcakes.

Whether you host the event poolside or at a waterfront venue, an under-the-sea theme is sure to make a splash.

# 4. Create a Winter Wonderland Princess Party

Bring the magic of a snow queen to sunny Tampa by hosting a winter wonderland princess party. This frosty theme is perfect for kids who love all things icy and magical.

* **Decor:** Use icy blues, whites, and silvers for your color palette. Add snowflake cutouts, faux snow, and silver garlands to create a wintery atmosphere.
* **Activities:** Kids can decorate snowflake ornaments, enjoy a “snowball toss” game with white beanbags, or sing along to their favorite snow queen songs.
* **Menu:** Serve marshmallow “snowballs,” frosted cookies, and hot chocolate with whipped cream.

This theme works well for indoor parties or air-conditioned venues, offering a cool escape from Tampa’s warm climate.

# 5. Host a Princess-Inspired Dance Party

For a lively celebration full of movement and music, a royal dance party is an excellent choice. Kids can channel their inner princess while twirling and dancing the day away.

* **Decor:** Turn your venue into a royal ballroom with elegant drapes, chandeliers, and a dance floor. Hang a disco ball for extra sparkle.
* **Activities:** Hire a princess performer to teach the kids simple ballroom dance moves. Add a freeze dance game with princess-themed music for extra fun.
* **Entertainment:** Play classic princess movie songs or hire a DJ to keep the energy high.

A dance party is perfect for kids who love to move and is guaranteed to have everyone smiling from ear to ear.

# Tips for Enhancing Your Princess Party

No matter which theme you choose, there are a few additional touches that can make your Tampa princess party even more magical:

* **Hire a Professional Princess Performer:** A professional princess can lead activities, sing songs, and create a truly immersive experience for your child and their guests.
* **Capture the Memories:** Set up a dedicated photo area and take plenty of pictures to remember the special day. Consider hiring a photographer for high-quality photos.
* **Send Guests Home with Favors:** Party favors like mini crowns, wands, or princess-themed goodies make for great takeaways.

# Final Thoughts

Hosting a Tampa princess party is a wonderful way to create cherished memories for your child and their friends. Whether you’re planning a royal ball, a garden tea party, or an under-the-sea adventure, Tampa’s versatility and charm provide the perfect setting for a magical celebration.

By combining thoughtful details, engaging activities, and a touch of creativity, your party is sure to be a hit. Let your little one’s fairy-tale dreams come to life with an unforgettable **Tampa princess party** that will leave everyone smiling."
Dear SAD Girlies: Here’s How We’re Getting Through Winter Together,selfimprovement,1i9ukrq,2025-01-25 14:17:23,2,0.63,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1i9ukrq/dear_sad_girlies_heres_how_were_getting_through/,katelsy,Tips and Tricks,"\[delete if not allowed! Thought I'd share this in case it may be of help to anyone\]

**Holy mackerel, January sucks ass.**

If this is your birthday month, you might feel differently, but for the rest of us plebs? Let’s call it like it is: post-holiday and New Year gloom is hitting. Hard. We’ve officially entered the worst months of the year—yes, February included. Let's not kid ourselves that Valentine’s Day will do anything to lift the mood. Winter’s here, and the blues? It doesn't give a fuck if we're single, coupled, or somewhere in between. It's coming, if not, already gotten us.

*Exhale long breath out*. 

From one SAD girlie to another, here’s what we’re going to do, bestie. 

# No.1 Give Yourself Permission to Take Things Slow

As dreadful as it is, winter is *meant* to be a time for deep rest, recovery, and reset. It's kind of masochistic that we keep up the same pace all year round. I get it—capitalism demands our sacrifice—but you don’t have to live by the “work hard, play hard, sleep when you’re dead” mentality 24/7. Especially when your body and mind are screaming that something feels astray.

So, give yourself permission to take these months at your own pace, guilt-free. Yes, easier said than done. That annoying, nagging voice in your head will whine like the little cunt that it is. But here’s the truth: it doesn’t define you, unless you let it. It doesn’t *say anything or mean anything* about you. You hear me?

You’re not lazy. You’re not useless. You’re not a failure for needing or wanting rest. Knowing what you need is a strength, and trusting yourself enough to give it to yourself? That’s brave as hell.

Take things slow, do things imperfectly. Life’s a marathon, not a sprint. Rest now so you can run later, my self-critical, perfectionistic, productivity-maximalist go-getter.

# No.2 Remember: How You’re Feeling Is Temporary

I know the feeling well. Sometimes, it’s a full blast of numbness, like I’m submerged under water where all my senses are dull except for the sobering coldness of how sad, empty, and desperate I feel. Other times, it’s a more subdued feeling, like an ache or inkling of knowing nothing is wrong, but something isn’t right either. It’s hard to believe I’d ever feel differently when I’m in the thick of it, because the future feels so colourless that tomorrow is pointless. 

But HEY. That feeling **doesn’t last forever**. It really, truly doesn’t. Take it from someone who’s been tracking her mood for three years: it *will* pass. The bad news is that it will come back. But the good news is that we will know how to handle it better each time.

Trust that it’s temporary, bestie.

# No.3 Add Movement to Your Routine

Noooooo, don’t roll your eyes. I know you’ve heard it before, and yeah, it’s a cliché, but clichés exist for a reason. Moving your body *works*. It gets you out of your head and shifts your energy.

It doesn’t have to be anything major. Take a walk. Stretch for five minutes. Do a single pushup. It doesn’t have to be perfect. It doesn’t have to be *Instagram-worthy*. Just move, yeah?

Pssst. You don’t need a gym membership. Dancing to one Taylor Swift song counts. No one’s watching.

# No.4 Keep Your Good Routines

You don’t have to tell me twice that when the bad vibes hit it’s like trudging through mud. I *know*. Everything that was exciting is not only suddenly a bore, it’s also a *chore*. But let’s not forget advice no.2, the feeling is temporary.   
Show up for your routines, even when you don’t want to. And if you really can’t? That’s okay too. Circle back to step no.1. Take things slow and do them imperfectly. 

Examples?

* Fold five pieces of laundry.
* Organize one drawer.
* Take out a small bag of trash.
* Wipe down a single surface.
* Read one paragraph of a book.
* Write down one task for tomorrow.
* Write for ten minutes on that novel you’ve been putting off.

Bing Bop Boom Boom Boom Bop BAM. Easy peasy, bestie ;)

When you finally get to the other end of this gloomy tunnel and when that first sliver of light shine through? you’ll look back and wonder, *How the hell did I make it through that?*

But here’s the thing: *you did*. *We did.*  
And you’ll know you can do it again.  
And that? That’s a fucking power move.

We got this!

From one SAD girlie to another, here’s what we’re going to do, bestie. 

# No.1 Give Yourself Permission to Take Things Slow

As dreadful as it is, winter is *meant* to be a time for deep rest, recovery, and reset. It's kind of masochistic that we keep up the same pace all year round. I get it—capitalism demands our sacrifice—but you don’t have to live by the “work hard, play hard, sleep when you’re dead” mentality 24/7. Especially when your body and mind are screaming that something feels astray.

So, give yourself permission to take these months at your own pace, guilt-free. Yes, easier said than done. That annoying, nagging voice in your head will whine like the little cunt that it is. But here’s the truth: it doesn’t define you, unless you let it. It doesn’t *say anything or mean anything* about you. You hear me?

You’re not lazy. You’re not useless. You’re not a failure for needing or wanting rest. Knowing what you need is a strength, and trusting yourself enough to give it to yourself? That’s brave as hell.

Take things slow, do things imperfectly. Life’s a marathon, not a sprint. Rest now so you can run later, my self-critical, perfectionistic, productivity-maximalist go-getter.

# No.2 Remember: How You’re Feeling Is Temporary

I know the feeling well. Sometimes, it’s a full blast of numbness, like I’m submerged under water where all my senses are dull except for the sobering coldness of how sad, empty, and desperate I feel. Other times, it’s a more subdued feeling, like an ache or inkling of knowing nothing is wrong, but something isn’t right either. It’s hard to believe I’d ever feel differently when I’m in the thick of it, because the future feels so colourless that tomorrow is pointless. 

But HEY. That feeling **doesn’t last forever**. It really, truly doesn’t. Take it from someone who’s been tracking her mood for three years: it *will* pass. The bad news is that it will come back. But the good news is that we will know how to handle it better each time.

Trust that it’s temporary, bestie.

# No.3 Add Movement to Your Routine

Noooooo, don’t roll your eyes. I know you’ve heard it before, and yeah, it’s a cliché, but clichés exist for a reason. Moving your body *works*. It gets you out of your head and shifts your energy.

It doesn’t have to be anything major. [Take a walk](https://katelsy.ca/2024/02/14/thank-you-2023-next/#on-walks). Stretch for five minutes. Do a single pushup. It doesn’t have to be perfect. It doesn’t have to be *Instagram-worthy*. Just move, yeah?

Pssst. You don’t need a gym membership. Dancing to one Taylor Swift song counts. No one’s watching.

# No.4 Keep Your Good Routines

You don’t have to tell me twice that when the bad vibes hit it’s like trudging through mud. I *know*. Everything that was exciting is not only suddenly a bore, it’s also a *chore*. But let’s not forget advice no.2, the feeling is temporary.   
Show up for your routines, even when you don’t want to. And if you really can’t? That’s okay too. Circle back to step no.1. Take things slow and do them imperfectly. 

Examples?

* Fold five pieces of laundry.
* Organize one drawer.
* Take out a small bag of trash.
* Wipe down a single surface.
* Read one paragraph of a book.
* Write down one task for tomorrow.
* Write for ten minutes on that novel you’ve been putting off.

Bing Bop Boom Boom Boom Bop BAM. Easy peasy, bestie ;)

When you finally get to the other end of this gloomy tunnel and when that first sliver of light shine through? you’ll look back and wonder, *How the hell did I make it through that?*

But here’s the thing: *you did*. *We did.*  
And you’ll know you can do it again.  
And that? That’s a fucking power move.

We got this!

Basement toilet platform -- Sanity check,HomeImprovement,1i9ueb8,2025-01-25 14:09:43,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1i9ueb8/basement_toilet_platform_sanity_check/,rockjetty,,"**Background:**  
- Seldom used basement bathroom. 
- Lowest drain in house -- overflows if sewer lateral clogs  
- Camera in sewer lateral -- no roots, small compression/break (will replace when budget allows)  
- Overflows about once per year (tampons from guests)  
- Rotted wooden platform, movement causes wax seal to break compounding the moisture/rot issue  
- Ripping it all out & re-doing it with tiling  
  
**Sanity Check:**  
- Part of me wants to pour a concrete platform as a permanent solution to the possibility of the toilet shifting & breaking the wax seal in the future.  Are there any drawbacks or concerns for doing this?  It could be a small platform just under the toilet & the rest framed in wood & cement board under the tiles or just seal everything under concrete.  There are several 4 inch pipes that would be encased in concrete (see link to photos).  Or just re-do everything properly in wood & cement board (previously it was just plywood) and prioritize replacing the sewer lateral?

I don't anticipate me doing anything plumbing related to this bathroom in the future, so I don't see any concerns sealing the pipes under concrete.  If anyone did want to move the toilet or put in a floor drain, it would require cutting the concrete, but that would be someone else's problem (selling house in 5 years).  Doing a smaller concrete platform would leave most pipes exposed so that future owners could see what was under there if they did want to change anything."
My incest story - The Conclusion,DesiMomChat,1i9udev,2025-01-25 14:08:39,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesiMomChat/comments/1i9udev/my_incest_story_the_conclusion/,Potential_Apple_2831,,"This post is in continuation to my last post. Till now, I developed feelings for her, had seen her fully naked, spied on her, sniffed, cummed on and wore her panties and clothes. Now, the difficult or a mere ossible thing remained to achieve was to touch or feel her body. 

To be honest, the first thought came to my mind was to give her sleeping pills and then do with her anything I want but I could not do it. There was lot of risk involved in it. I knew I could not grope her while she's being conscious, so I used to touch her in sleep only whenever I got the opportunity. One such opportunity came around in 2013. It was summers again and our family was dealing with a very serious family issue at that time. There was lot of tension in our house. My father had to go hometown to attend an important family matter for 2-3 weeks. 

During that time, I was sleeping alone with my one bro at my bed, and on the adjacent one my mother slept with my other bro. One night, I woke up to go washroom and I saw my mom was sleeping half naked, there was nothing down below. She was sleeping in a sideways position with her ass towards me. On taking a closer look I realised that she was indeed wearing her thin petticoat but due to its light skin color and darkness, I thought she was naked. My inner animal got awakened that night and I thought that I would take the advantage of these nights. I called for her to check how deep was she sleeping. She did not response. I called her 2-3 times but result was the same. Then I shaked her body by placing my hands on her thighs but she again did not respond. So after returning from washroom I laid down on my side of bed and kept watching the shape of her ass. In between, I used to move my hands all over her thighs and ass and caress them.  I continued doing this every night. I would wait till 12-1 AM to get her to be in deep sleep. Then I would wait and watch and move up her petticoat as much as I can. I think the darkness and stealth atmosphere around the room gave me more confidence to not to be afraid and go for her. After trying it for few nights, I became very brave and now I started caressing her naked legs and thighs with my bare hands. I also had a backup plan in my mind that just in case if she caught my hands on her body or ass I would pretend to be half asleep and act like I was trying to wake her as I had seen a nightmare and very afraid of sleeping alone without father. Knowing this, I could now easily upskirt her till her upper thighs. The feeling was heavenly which I seriously could not describe in words. I became more brave each night. Now, I started taking my face near her legs and also kissed her all over her legs and thighs. Her soft and smooth skin, her body warmth and her mindblowing body smell (Lux soap fragrance - she used to bath at evening with that soap) all felt so good. I really could not believe that my face and tougue are so up her thighs and I was only two inches away from her pussy. But going for her glory hole was way too risky. She would surely get awaken. I had groped her ass from outside but now I also wanted to touch her naked butt and ofcourse her pussy was a priority too. With every passing night I got more and more desparate and I knew that father could return back any day and then my newly found adventure would be over. Then thinking about it one day  I got an idea. My mother is a very kanjoos lady who will not drop or dump something till it is completely worn out or of no use at all. So, it was the same for her with clothes she wore. Untill and unless her dress is totally worn out, she would not throw it and keep wearing it. So I knew the petticoats she wore those nights were very thin and old. I took one of them and made holes on it around the area I assumed her ass would be. They were big enough so that my fingers could slide in through those holes. Our neighbourhood was having a rat problem too, so I know if she get suspicious I know who to blame. I was very excited for the upcoming night. She did not notice those holes and went ahead wearing it. 

I was super excited and finally the moment came.. She was again sleeping side ways with her ass towards me. As I started moving my fingers through the holes, my eyes were towards her face, keeping a vigil to help me step aback if she makes any movement. My body was cold and I my excitement level peaked. Few seconds later all of my fingers were all over her tight round ass. After enjoying it, I decided to slide my fingers in between her ass crack and as I went deeper and deeper it became very hard to control myself. I went numb, the heartbeat, the adrenaline rush was so high and my other hand was holding the bulge in my pants. It kind of felt like my dicking was also beating like heart. I did not know what was happening to me. I was so full of lust and it literally felt I was fucking her. I made the holes larger with my other hands fingers so that I could reach her pussy more comfortable and few moments later I started feeling her pubes. They felt like little thorns in the bush and next moment I felt the wetness of her pussy lips. I cant believe till this date how could she be in that deep a sleep that all of my fingers were clenched between her thighs and were at the doorstep of her heavenly pussy lips and she did not blink an eye. One thing could be maybe she was enjoying it in her dreams thinking it was my father. Btw I could not go more in, I stopped and started feeling the wetness of her pussy juice... My eyes were getting closed of lust, everything felt so high and mighty that it was right then and there my dick could not hold and burst out a big load of cum in my pants.

 For first few seconds, I enjoyed the release but later I realised that I discharged something from my penis which had wet my underwear. I removed my fingers from her pussy and tasted them.. It was wet and sticky but I don't remember the exact taste now. All I know, after the release I felt so relaxed and happy and satisfied. It was a mission accomplished. Then I ran to bathroom and check out that sticky liquid on my pants.. which I got to know months or years later is called cum. So, in a nutshell my mother is the first woman in my life I accidently nutted to and being an incest person I am very proud of it. I think it was so much better than masturbating. I wish I could relieve that night again. After that, I enjoyed her for some more nights and once the return of my father it stopped for good because If I had continued more going by the law of probability, I would have been busted one day. So, that is the last time I remember I had touched her around her private parts. I know out of all the posts I shared before, this one would be the hardest to believe but It really did happen. Yes, the details I shared could be here and there as it happened more than 10 years ago. 


One or two years later, I discovered porn and masturbation. I also remember how good was my imagination power those days that I did not need porn to jerk off. I would think of my teachers, aunts and my mom in my mind and stroke my cock under the blanket and I would cum so much. So, as my found new ways to satisfy my lust I did not ever try to touch her again. Ofcourse It also had to do with me getting more mature and smarter and less desparate. There might have been more events  that happened during my coming of age incest journey but I shared the important ones that I remember. I ticked all the boxes an incest person could think of except for fucking her or seeing her getting nailed by anyone else which I know in my mom's case is impossible. So, there's no sailing down that river. 

I cant say this thing for others, but in my case the reason for me to become incest was it was my mom only whom I had easy access to see naked. Unlike other or today's kids I was exposed to porn and masturbation quite later in my life, so I could not find ways to deal with the hormonal changes and my feelings made my mom the centre of lust as she was the closest thing to porn, sex or masturbation to me. 

Anyways, after my schooling and graduation, things remained normal. The only thing I carried till date is spying on her as it gives a different form of pleasure. I click and record her sometimes too when Iam feeling really horny. Here's a sneaky pic of her naked legs I clicked last summer:

https://i.redgifs.com/i/ecstaticoblongclam.jpg

Just a reminder that I do delete them due to guilt after some days and the cycle keeps on repeating. Thats the current scene for now. 

Finally, this concludes my incest story so far and I hope there's nothing more much left to be achieved. I will try to enjoy this feeling for just a few more years before I will finally decide to settle down and marry and leave these crazy memories behind. Thank you to all for sparing the time to read my shit and for your kind and naughty comments. Also, please don't ask me for her pics. I might or might not share her pics publicly when I feel like it. You can ask whatever you want in comments or DMs. I will try to answer them honestly and would not answer those whom Iam uncomfortable with. 

Peace Out guys and gals (if any). "
Convertible Roof/boot 'Good luck with that' kind of problems...,AskMechanics,1i9ubiu,2025-01-25 14:06:23,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMechanics/comments/1i9ubiu/convertible_roofboot_good_luck_with_that_kind_of/,derseffect66,,"Hello to all and thanks for taking the time to read!

\- I have a Vauxhall/Opel Tigra B and the roof and boot are not working for a few reasons but I am unaware why on some. My inital issue started with the roof and boot movements stopping in the same places occasionally which did get worse over time (switch issues?). This led to it basically not functioning properly so I didn't use it. The motor whirs like it's trying to move but doesn't.

\-  I then found my hydraulic pump leaking so bought a scrap one. I cleaned it all out with wd40 due to old black oil, which also cleaned out the rest of the unit where the hydraulic lines go (damaged?). I filled it up, installed it and tried to clear air out the system by operating it a few times. Didn't really fix anything although it did work fairly well for a few tests. 

\- One time I had to manaually help the roof close, which has misaligned the boot, I can see it raised when the boot is closed. The boot can be lifted open manually inline with the speed that it would normally, and will sort of close on its own very slowly (probably the wieght of it).

Could it be an issue with the pump I got, or the fact I cleaned it all out using wd40? I know there is probably switch issues causing it to stop, but I don't know why it won't move (before it was misaligned).

  
Thanks to anyone who read this far! If you're a mechanic and I bought this to your shop, what would you suggest I do other than drive it off a cliff for the insurance."
Parking Eye Hospital fine advice,CarTalkUK,1i9uaz0,2025-01-25 14:05:45,5,1.0,10,https://i.redd.it/b4wx5ielu6fe1.jpeg,Capital_Ant_1134,Advice,"I've been dropping my mom off at the hospital to visit her mother who was rushed in on new year day. So I've been doing this since the 1st until about the 17th Jan as gran has now been moved back to her care home to basically Die, I just got a letter off parking Eye today showing this saying I had parked almost 21 hours.

The only time I pulled into a car park and I actually got out was the 1st and I made sure to put my reg number in the machine but I was less than the 20min free period so I didn't need to pay.

It's got photos of me arriving on the 15th and then another picture showing departure time on the 16th, there's now way I stopped as I was only dropping off and then picked mom up a few hours later. 

Can I appeal this saying I hadn't parked and obviously your cameras haven't picked me up leaving on the 15th? Surely it would be on camera showing me picking my mom up a few hours later on the 15th. I have Google timeline showing my two journeys on the 15th to drop off and then pick up later and I also have the drivescore app showing my GPS movements so obviously the car wasn't parked in a car park for 20+ hours

I'm more annoyed with there camera systems not picking up properly but is it worth appealing and trying to explain the situation "
"Team-Ups are very, very strong, but some are often overlooked, and difficult to utilize",marvelrivals,1i9u7y2,2025-01-25 14:02:13,0,0.5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1i9u7y2/teamups_are_very_very_strong_but_some_are_often/,youngrower,Discussion,"I have seen a lot of posts discussing the ranking up this season being very hard. I climbed up to Diamond early on, and noticed something in my games I havent heard many people talk about: team up abilities. Very often the winning team has them. I'm not saying you need them for a good team composition, I am just saying I believe they are very overlooked, under-utilized, and rarely mastered. A big one that made me want to make this post is the Hela+Thor Team up. Being that Storm is a very powerful character, it seems Thor has become a more popular pick in ranked games. Their team up simply gives storm another useful chain attack. Pretty simple, another attack, more kills, but people overlook this composition with a Hela+Thor team up. It is very situational and much more difficult to master, but when it is done right it is completely game-changing. It also ties into another point I'd like to make about the game in general.

Let's imagine a scenario: We have a Strange, a Thor, vs a Strange, and a Magneto enemy front line. Two shields? No problem for the thunder God, he knocks Magneto back and creates some space for the Stranges to battle for the point space. But alas, Thor isn't killing Magneto, he has a bubble now and is being healed, time to activate his demon ranged mode, which can now rip healers with his positioning, but he's lost his ability of movement, and the enemies know this. with Magneto, a strategist, and a duelist all now focusing him, he gets bursted down. It's now a 5v6 situation, and the Magneto and strange begin taking space with their tank advantage. Meanwhile Hela has been shouldering an off angle pinging the tanks and trying to snipe a duelist. She sees her younger brother go down, and instead of back up or play for a safer fight (which is the right thing to do in most situations) she takes a wide, bold angle on a duelist she sees moving up. PING, PING, he's ripped. The enemies notice, but hey thats alright, it's an even fight, and we have more space! HUH?? Thor is back?? Our healers are on top of his hammer! Oh no! He killed them both! Now its a 3v6 and the rest of the team crumbles. Again, very situational. very risky, but completely changing the fight when done right.

A few others I believe are under-utilized or rarely mastered are the Magneto+Scarlet Witch, Hulk+Wolverine, Rocket+Groot, Adam Warlock+Mantis+Starlord. Although with Adam I think it is dependant on his skill to be effective mostly, it also relies on his team playing tighter, and often running three healers. Let me know what your experience with these team-ups are and if you agree. I think in the lower ranks players tend to overlook the synergy of their team's abilities in general, and if we assume we all have comparable aim, game sense, and positioning, this aspect of team composition can be the deciding factor that leads to a victory."
"Close Reading Of ""Darkseid""",GrimesAE,1i9u6r1,2025-01-25 14:00:55,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrimesAE/comments/1i9u6r1/close_reading_of_darkseid/,devastation-nation,,"Grimes’s “Darkseid” featuring Pan (formerly Aristophanes) is a haunting, surreal exploration of grief, existential anxiety, and the body as a site of emotional and cosmic unrest. The interplay between Grimes’s ethereal production, Pan’s cryptic, visceral lyrics in Mandarin, and the repeated refrain, “Unrest is in the soul, we don’t move our bodies anymore,” constructs a piece that is both intensely personal and disturbingly universal. This close reading examines the track through Æ’s framework of super-planetary affairs, emotional dynamics, and transformative engagement with grief, sacrifice, and survival.

The Soundscape: A Super-Planetary Aesthetic

The track’s sonic texture is minimalistic yet suffused with tension. The low, rumbling bass evokes a sense of weight and dread, while the ethereal, high-pitched tones create a sense of otherworldliness. These elements mirror the tension in the lyrics: between the body and the soul, the personal and the cosmic, survival and sacrifice.

For Æ, this soundscape reflects a “super-planetary” sensibility, where human emotions and narratives are framed within larger, cosmic contexts. The music evokes the vastness of space and the inexorable pull of planetary forces, grounding the deeply human experience of grief in a universe indifferent to individual suffering. This juxtaposition invites listeners to consider their place within a web of interrelated forces, both physical and emotional.

“Unrest is in the Soul, We Don’t Move Our Bodies Anymore”: The Chorus as a Lament for Stasis

The repeated chorus acts as a mantra, reinforcing the central theme of disconnection. The soul is restless, yet the body remains immobile—a paradox that captures the paralysis of grief and existential dread. The phrase can be interpreted as a critique of modernity, where the body, as a vessel for vitality and movement, is rendered inert by emotional and spiritual unrest.

For Æ, this speaks to the need for emotional flourishing and societal structures that nurture the soul’s dynamism. The paralysis described here is not just personal but systemic, pointing to the ways in which collective grief and disconnection can immobilize entire communities or societies. It’s an invocation to rediscover the body as a site of resilience and transformation.

Pan’s Verse: The Body as a Site of Cosmic Grief

Pan’s lyrics, delivered in Mandarin, are richly layered with visceral imagery that blurs the boundaries between the physical and the metaphysical. The skin “secretes shadow,” and the body becomes a vessel for another’s death. Grief is embodied—transmuted into saliva, tears, and algae-like remnants within the self.
	1.	The Body as a Site of Absorption and Transformation:
The line “My skin opens an invisible wound / Takes your death in / To be part of my existence” portrays the body as a permeable boundary, absorbing external pain and making it intrinsic. This is not a passive process; it’s transformative, as grief and death become inextricably linked to identity. For Æ, this aligns with the idea of emotional labor as a generative force—one that redefines the self through engagement with pain and loss.
	2.	The Symbolism of the “Caves” in the Throat:
Pan describes the throat as containing “stiff and white caves,” a haunting image that suggests spaces within the body where grief and memory calcify. These caves, filled with saliva and transformed by tidal forces, represent a cyclical process of retention and release, mirroring the ebb and flow of emotion. Æ might interpret this as an allegory for the need to confront and process emotional wounds rather than letting them fossilize within.
	3.	Cosmic Grief and the Tide:
The imagery of tides responding to the moon connects the deeply personal experience of grief to celestial rhythms. This reflects a super-planetary perspective: the acknowledgment that human emotions are part of larger, universal patterns. Grief is not isolated but is woven into the fabric of existence.

Sacrifice and Survival: Existential Questions in the Second Verse

The second verse shifts focus to themes of sacrifice and survival. Pan questions the nature of life as “a long-lasting sacrifice” and the arbitrariness of who is chosen to survive and who is left behind. The imagery of “exploded stars” and “burned fire” situates these questions within a cosmic framework, suggesting that individual suffering is mirrored on a universal scale.

For Æ, this evokes the tension between agency and inevitability. The survivor’s guilt expressed here—“Why is it you to sacrifice this time?”—points to the arbitrary nature of existence, challenging listeners to find meaning in a universe that often seems devoid of it. This resonates with Æ’s vision of transformative engagement: embracing life’s uncertainties as opportunities for reflection, adaptation, and connection.

Collaboration Across Language and Culture

Grimes’s decision to collaborate with Pan, allowing her to deliver the verses in Mandarin, adds another layer of complexity to the track. The language barrier itself becomes a metaphor for the ineffability of grief and the universality of its expression. While many listeners may not understand the lyrics directly, the emotive delivery transcends linguistic boundaries, emphasizing the shared human experience of loss and survival.

For Æ, this collaboration exemplifies the potential of cross-cultural exchange to generate new forms of understanding and connection. By integrating Pan’s distinct voice and perspective, Grimes creates a track that is both deeply personal and expansively universal—a hallmark of Æ’s vision for super-planetary affairs.

Conclusion: Toward a New Vision of Survival

The final outro poses the question, “What does it take to be a survivor?” This is not a rhetorical question but an invitation to reflect on the physical, emotional, and cosmic toll of survival. The body retains the “eternal pain” of others’ deaths, making survival itself an act of endurance and transformation.

For Æ, this calls for a reimagining of survival as more than just persistence—it is a process of integration, where grief and loss become catalysts for growth and connection. The track’s layered exploration of these themes—through sound, language, and imagery—offers a powerful example of how art can illuminate the complexities of existence, bridging the personal and the super-planetary.

In “Darkseid,” Grimes and Pan create a work that resonates with Æ’s ethos of emotional dynamism, transformative grief, and the cosmic interconnectedness of all sentient beings. The track is a testament to the generative power of collaboration and the unyielding human capacity to find meaning, even in the face of darkness."
The story of my tendons,systemictendinitis,1i9u65w,2025-01-25 14:00:19,5,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/systemictendinitis/comments/1i9u65w/the_story_of_my_tendons/,BismarkvonBismark,MY EXPERIENCE,"The main takeaway is that my tendons were perfectly fine until they weren't. I'm currently 43. I've got it figured that my tendons have an unusual propensity for overuse pain and injury. I've been pretty fucked since sometime in 2024. My fhl tendons and peroneal tendons in both feet are giving me problems. Every single flexor and extensor tendon in my hands is in constant pain and exhibiting a very low tolerance for physical activity.

First time I ever had tendon pain I was 25 or so. 2006 or 2007. I was in Southeast Asia for 5 months, and sprained an ankle in Laos. I overdid the crutches, and irritated an old ankle sprain in the better foot. So when I got home both feet were off. I did physical therapy, the ligaments healed, but suddenly after that I had nagging tendon pain. In retrospect, it was minor, but I'm a pretty sensitive person and chronic pain was a new thing for me, so I remember being really bothered and careful about this tendon pain for many months until eventually it went away. This tendon pain was in my peroneal tendons on both sides, plus some inner ankle tendon pain which would have been either my fhl or post tib. These tendons have given me low level pain sporadically, maybe for a week, maybe for a couple months, ever since all this first happened. But they still tolerated physically very intense activity.

One thing of note perhaps, is that in Thailand I twice got water poisoning. The first time was because I was naive and stupid; I literally had done zero research, absolutely zero, before heading off to Southeast Asia. Amazes me to think about that now. Anyway, the second time was because I was severely constipated, and I drank the water intentionally. I never received medical treatment for either of these water poisonings, but who knows what kinds of bugs went into my system.

I've also gotten pain on the top of my right foot sporadically. I always assumed this was a tendon, but now I'm not quite sure. This is only significant because I remember it once lasting for a whole summer, so it's clearly part of whatever connective tissue problems I have. Currently this is going on in both feet.

Maybe a year after my initial tendon pain in my ankles, I picked up a cane for fun, because a lot of my friends were into fire spinning and other flow arts, I started practicing twirling this cane in my hand and trying to cultivate fancy dexterity with it. This lasted about 2 weeks until I got a whole bunch of moderate tendon pain in my wrist. This pain lasted some number of months.

The first real bad flare up in my hands was I think in 2017. At the beginning of the summer I went to an ecstatic dance, and did some extremely intense hand movements for maybe half an hour or something. Everything feels fine until about 1 week later, when my wrists and hands and fingers suddenly are all on fire. This one week delay is a curious thing and I do wonder what is happening physiologically. But this fire lasted about 4 months. The only thing I did was avoid repetitive motion activities; for example to type I glued toothbrushes to wrist braces and was able to use a keyboard without using my wrist tendons. However, although I recovered from this, ever since, the tendons in my hands and wrists have exhibited a reduced tolerance for repetitive motion activity. Like maybe 30 minutes a day of typing at most. And a sensation of tendon fatigue would happen more readily.

In 2019 I did a super clean with former roommates. We were moving out of a place, and so we scrub scrub scrub scrubbed away for 9 hours. Lots of repetitive motion. About 1 week later, my fingers and hands and wrists are on fire. This one I remember being not quite as bad as the one a couple years earlier. I was also doing the Paleo Diet, although this did not seem to have any effect. This also lasted about 4 months.

Got the Jab in 2021 and covid in January of 2022, but these didn't seem to have any effect.

I got other orthopedic injuries but my tendons were functionally fine / minimally symptomatic for most of the timeline so far, other than those two major flare-ups in my hands wrists. After I got over my fear I learned I could do upper body work, car maintenance, anything with my hands I wanted provided I avoided repetitive motion activities. I climbed a 6,000 ft Mountain three times and a bunch of other mountains each about four or 5000 ft. So things were good

In February of 2024 some total fucking idiot ran a red light and totaled my car. My left kneecap hit the dash and got a mild fracture. Also got a chest injury from the seat belt. The kneecap took about 5 weeks to heal. During this time my right leg was doing all the work. Within a few days of resuming a relatively normal level of activity, the pain in the top of my right foot and some arch pain were acting up. I haven't mentioned arch pain in my narrative so far, but this is also something I've experienced sporadically throughout the years, so initially I wasn't too concerned because I had been there before and it ended up being nothing overall. But this time it just lasted and lasted and lasted, and was feeling really uncomfortable, not super painful yet, but really fucking awkward, and it wasn't going away. I now know the arch pain is my fhl tendon.

On the summer solstice of 2024 I successfully fuck things up a lot more. I did one monstrous set of calf raises, 60 or 70 of them, emphasizing the eccentric component. The next day everything in my right foot is in horrible pain; the arch pain is extremely bad, other pain in the bottom of my foot has developed, the pain in the top of my foot's really bad, and the fhl on the inner ankle hurts a lot and my peroneal tendons hurt a lot. This calmed down a significant extent after a few days but I have not recovered from this.

My left foot feels perfectly fine until about 1 week after the solstice. Once again, a one week delay. Arch pain in my left foot. My fhl. I feel it on a walk in the forest. Pretty mild, so I'm not too concerned. But now 7 months later it's still there. It got worse around August September. As the arch pain got worse, other things in my left foot began to hurt. My right foot is still worse but they are fairly symmetrical, left and right.

Curious, I can make two observations about how this is different than prior comparable occasions in my life. I attribute it to aging. In the end of 2019 I irritated my achilles tendon in my right leg; I irritated it about as bad as my fhl tendon in my left foot. But my achilles only hurt for about 3 weeks. Minor tendon irritation did not become chronic.

The other observation is from the summer of 2022. Relatively recent. I had some muscle injuries in my legs. They were only grade 1 strains, but I suffered nerve sensitization which lasted for months until I figured out the injury had healed. So the takeaway is that for months I was not very active physically. Some light walking, but a very low level of activity overall. Yet when I resumed a normal level of activity, I did not get any tendon pain. This is in contrast to 2024 when the period of inactivity seemed to trigger renewed tendon pain in my right foot. The only other factor I can think of is that I did physical therapy for my left kneecap fracture and there was some repetitive motion activities the physical therapist had me do. Maybe the repetitive motion activities combined with a low level of activity overall combined with awkward movement because my right leg was doing most of the work getting around, was a trigger.

I wish my story was done, this is a long antidote, but. . .

This summer, experiencing pain in both my feet, I regularly massaged my feet with my hands. Yes, a repetitive motion activity. And lo, combined with some vegetable chopping in August, and I have a full-on flare up of all the tendons in my wrists and hands and fingers. All over again. And this time is worse than ever before. It would be too much work to trace the pattern of symptoms between August and today, but it's definitely worse now overall than it was in August and September, and this has been fucking with my head, to be honest. After a few days of rest originally I could do more with my hands than I can now. And the pain sucks, but the symptom that really bothers me as much as or more than the pain, is this intense feeling of fatigue in my hands, like the least bit of activity and all the tendons in there are just worn out/ tired/ exhausted. It's a miserable feeling.

Been doing some rehab exercises for my feet. Typically about twice a week. Pretty conservative. Haven't gotten past three sets of 10 calf raises. Some balancing exercises and miscellaneous. It feels okay but it's hard to tell. Standing is the worst thing. Walking is pretty much okay. I can walk a mile and the discomfort is not that bad.

Been doing lots of contrast baths for my hands. Some range of motion when immersed in hot water. The contrast baths provide some pain relief.

I meditate and I pray.

One other piece of good news I need to share. I wish I didn't have to share it. But in mid-December I got a serious bacterial eye infection. One doctor at one Clinic prescribed some eye drops. When I got to the pharmacy, the name sounded suspicious, and the pharmacist admitted it was an fq. Ofloxacin. The doctor at the original Clinic was not available, so I went to an urgent care, and the doctor I saw there, just my luck, had worked for an ophthalmologist for 8 years, so he had total conviction in everything he said. I told him that my body has problems with tendons. And he said that the tendon risk for fqs was only for the oral form of these drugs. He also said that I ""need"" an fq, and that the risk to my eyes was a ""million"" times greater than the risk to my tendons. To be fair to his point of view, I did have a serious eye infection, potentially very serious, and in his mind he probably perceived zero risk from eye drops, and perhaps an fq had a higher likelihood of being effective than any alternative. At the time I was reassured and ended up using the eye drops. My system would have been exposed to about 20 mg.

But now, because hindsight is 20/20, I can't help but feel violated, and am haunted by thoughts of how much less bad things might be had I demanded that the doctor give me an alternative antibiotic. Objectively, I can't say for sure if the eye drops have made things worse, but maybe they have. I sure remember my hands being more tolerant to physical activity in December overall. It hasn't helped that I found one person online who experienced widespread tendinopathy from just eye drops, two people who experienced widespread tendinopathy from just ear drops, and several people who experienced severe neurologic damage from eye drops. It further did not help that I found two alternative ophthalmic antibiotic formulations, sodium sulfacetamide and a blend of polymyxin-B/ trimethoprim, that have demonstrated effectiveness against the three most common causes of bacterial conjunctivitis, including the species found to have colonized my eyes. Of course this is all after the fact. I can't travel back in time.

Also been experimenting with my diet. In November and December I did Keto. Perhaps a mistake here was that it was pork based. It was locally sourced pork so chemical free, but pork fat is high in polyunsaturated fat which resembles seed oils and is potentially inflammatory. Since January 1st I've been strict carnivore: ruminant, wild fish, 100% grass-fed beef tallow, locally sourced beef liver, unflavored electrolytes, salt. I plan to reintroduce eggs in about a week. Do this for at least 3 months. See how it goes.

Conceivably I could get stem cell treatment for my feet. It would take over half my savings, which would hurt, but I'm considering it. Unfortunately I cannot imagine treating my hands this way because there is just too many tendons, too many blood vessels, too many nerves for it to be safe or effective.

Maybe some fasting as well. My personal record is 70 hours without calories. I'm sure I can double that."

https://preview.redd.it/43cajplfg6fe1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e9cced82f30240c54d6f4cd220829b6dc0377969

Starting with **Alucard,** he's all I've wanted to see. He's matured, stronger, more composed, and feels like the descendant of Dracula. Strong entrance, great moveset, and his abilities are drawing closer to his father. Enough said.

**Olrox/Mizrak** were great. They didn't have the largest amount of screen-time, but their guilt and conflicting loyalties were great to watch. Olrox having to balance out serving under Erzsebet with his love to Mizrak, and Mizrak's dilemma with serving his creed vs being with Olrox. For the screen-time they had, their relationship was nice to watch.

**Tera**'s story is tragic. Seeing her eventual corruption was heartbreaking, and every time they had her onscreen wit those blank eyes, it gave me the creeps. Seeing her push and pull Maria was such a dance, you really weren't sure if she was going to succumb to her vampire nature at any second. I hope that the show follows up on her and doesn't forget that she exists.

**Maria**'s story was also tragic, but had a good ending at least. Being betrayed by her father, and losing her mother really pushed her off the deep end. Only after summoning a dragon to kill her father did she step back and re-evaluate what to do. Watching her control the dragon at the final fight was a blast, real Shin Godzilla vibes there. But, as anime tropes go, the childhood friend (Maria) lost out to the girl on center stage (Annette). I just wish that we saw more of Maria's role as the Revolutionary, instead of the grieving daughter.

Speaking of **Annette**, it's great to see that Netflix gave her a lot of screen-time. I'm not familiar with her culture and the accuracy of its depiction, so I'll just say that it seems good. She does feel like an anime heroine sometimes, but she's not annoying I guess. It's cool that she fused with Sekhmet, and seeing her in the spirit realm was fun. My only thing is that she was the one to be with Richter, personally I wanted him to be with Maria, but that's just personal preference.

**Richter** was cool, but he felt very passive. I mean, after they're saved by Alucard, Richter then tags along with Alucard and Annette to Paris, killing vampires all the way. They fail to stop Drolta from taking the corpse, then showdown with Erzsebet and Drolta again at the finale. I was hoping that Netflix would allow Richter some breathing room to train with Alucard, or at least allow him to explore his magic more. It made it feel like the finale was slightly unearned, as we see Richter pull some really impressive moves out of nowhere. The final 2 episodes did also drag on with the fights, I fell like most audience members would have grown numb to all the action by the time the final fight with Drolta came around. But, those animations were dope as hell, and it was fun to see Richter wield Alucard's sword for the final moments.

Now, to get to some negative points, I feel like **Juste** was in the background and didn't have enough time to develop him properly. His interactions with Maria to console her were nice, but other than that, he just........was there. The Belmonts this season really felt like they were just along for the ride in their own show. Juste's sudden affinity for magic was really jarring, and it felt like his talent for magic was given to him by the writers so that he could at least participate in the final fight. Maybe Juste could've used the whip, while Richter would rely on magic for the final battle.

**Erzsebet** had a lot of potential, that I feel wasn't explored well enough. What we got to see of her was good, but she kept on being overshadowed by Drolta honestly. I also wished that her combat skills were more than just ""big punch"" and ""energy blast"". Overall, if the series had focused more on her as the Big Bad, things could've been smoother, with her defeat being the final conclusion to the Revolutionary movement.

The **Abbot** was less of a character, and more as someone for Maria to enact her vengeance on.

I personally wasn't interested in **Edouard**. It was nice that they gave him a lot of singing parts, but he never really felt like a key player in the plot, so didn't really care for him. However, there were a lot of scenes with him in it, so there were definitely some points where I kind of checked out of the show. I liked his interactions with the Captain Lady, but other than that, mostly waiting for his scenes to end so that the show can focus on the other characters.

# Now,

I personally wish that **Drolta** would've stayed dead at the beginning of season 2. Her death signed that the MC's were in another level of danger, that the stakes had been raised with the introduction of Alucard at the end of season 1. For her to come back with what is paramount to a zenkai boost, scott free, feels cheap. It's then revealed that she's been master-minding this entire thing for hundreds of years, trying to paint her in a sympathetic light with those flashbacks on the raid on her temple. She's an asshole to Olroxs, always smug and condescending, yet gets her ass beat most of the time. If Mizrak hadn't been mortally wounded, Olrox would've smoked her ass. She's able to go toe-to-toe with Alucard (which makes her death redundant), and kill-steals Erzsebet in the final fight. I'm not a fan of twist villains, and this is no exception. Without her, more screen-time could've been given to Erzsebeth and Juste.

Overall, Castlevania: Nocturne is a good show for most people. Fun, action-packed, it's something great to watch if you don't pay attention to pacing and slight story dissonance. Can't wait for future installments, and the slight chance that the studio might be able to animate Berserk."
How to Tackle Any Type of Anxiety and Protect Yourself from Its Grasp in the Future,anxiety_support,1i9trzi,2025-01-25 13:43:13,5,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/anxiety_support/comments/1i9trzi/how_to_tackle_any_type_of_anxiety_and_protect/,anxiety_support,,"**Hey, you. Yes, YOU. The one who's probably scrolling through Reddit at 2 AM, feeling like anxiety has you in a chokehold. Let me tell you something that might just change the way you see this beast—and how you deal with it forever.**

I get it. Anxiety doesn’t knock on the door politely; it barges in, uninvited, making you question every little thing about your life. It’s sneaky, making your heart race in an empty room, turning normal conversations into rehearsed performances, and convincing you the future is just one big disaster waiting to happen. Sound familiar? It should. Because anxiety speaks to all of us differently, but it always aims to make us feel the same way: powerless.  

But here’s the thing—it’s not invincible. You are. And I’m going to show you how to take back control.  

---

### **Step 1: Understand Anxiety for What It Is—A Liar in Disguise**  
Anxiety thrives on *fear of the unknown*. It whispers worst-case scenarios, convincing you that disaster is inevitable. But let me tell you a secret: anxiety isn’t a fortune teller; it’s a terrible guesser.  

The next time it starts talking, remind yourself of this:  
- “This is just my brain trying to protect me by preparing me for the worst.”  
- “But not everything my brain says is true.”  

Think of anxiety as an overprotective friend who loves you but always assumes the sky is falling. You don’t have to cut them out of your life; you just need to stop taking every word they say as gospel.  

---

### **Step 2: Anchor Yourself in the Present**  
Anxiety loves dragging you into two places:  
- The *past* (Why did I do/say that?)  
- The *future* (What if this happens?)  

But do you know where anxiety can’t touch you? The present.  
Here’s a simple exercise:  
1. Look around you and name 5 things you can see.  
2. Touch 4 things nearby and focus on their texture.  
3. Listen for 3 sounds in your environment.  
4. Take 2 deep breaths, slow and intentional.  
5. Think of 1 thing you’re grateful for right now.  

This isn’t just a “Pinterest” tip—it’s neuroscience. Grounding yourself forces your brain to shift gears from “panic mode” to “observation mode.”

### **Step 3: Challenge the Thought Spiral**  
Ever noticed how one anxious thought breeds another, and another, until it feels like a hurricane in your head? That’s the anxiety spiral. Here’s how you shut it down:  

- Ask yourself: **“What’s the evidence that this thought is true?”**  
  Nine times out of ten, you’ll realize it’s based on “what ifs” rather than facts.  

- Follow up with: **“What’s the worst that could happen?”**  
  Even if the worst happens, odds are you can survive it. (You’ve survived 100% of your bad days so far, haven’t you?)  

- End with: **“What can I do about this?”**  
  Anxiety often makes us feel stuck. Taking even the smallest action can break that feeling of helplessness.  

---

### **Step 4: Build Your Anti-Anxiety Toolkit**  
No, I’m not talking about some expensive app or magical pill. I’m talking about simple, effective habits that act as a safety net when anxiety strikes.  

1. **Breathing Techniques**  
   Your breath is your remote control to your nervous system. Practice this when calm, so it becomes second nature:  
   - Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7, exhale for 8. Repeat.  

2. **Movement**  
   Anxiety is stored in the body, not just the mind. Run, stretch, dance, or even just shake out your limbs. Physical movement signals to your brain that you’re safe.  

3. **Journaling**  
   Write down what’s scaring you. Once it’s out of your head and on paper, it often feels less overwhelming.  

4. **Social Connection**  
   I know—when anxiety hits, the last thing you want to do is talk to someone. But isolation is anxiety’s playground. A quick check-in with a friend, family member, or even an online community (like this one!) can help you feel less alone.  

---

### **Step 5: Future-Proof Yourself Against Anxiety**  
Let’s get real: anxiety will visit again. The goal isn’t to eliminate it (you can’t), but to handle it better every time.  

1. **Know Your Triggers**  
   Anxiety often follows patterns. Start paying attention to what sets it off—work stress, lack of sleep, conflict—and address those triggers proactively.  

2. **Prioritize Your Mental Hygiene**  
   Think of your mental health like physical health. You wouldn’t skip brushing your teeth for months, right? Apply the same consistency to your mental wellness:  
   - Daily mindfulness  
   - Balanced diet and hydration  
   - Regular exercise  

3. **Learn to Say “No”**  
   Overcommitment is a breeding ground for anxiety. Protect your energy by setting boundaries.  

4. **Seek Professional Help When Needed**  
   There’s no shame in therapy or medication. Sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is ask for help.  

---

### **A Letter to the Anxious You**  
If you’ve made it this far, I want you to pause for a second. Breathe. Close your eyes if it helps.  

I want you to picture yourself five years from now. The version of you who has learned to manage anxiety. The one who still feels fear but knows how to move through it. The one who wakes up and doesn’t dread the day ahead.  

That version of you? They’re waiting for you. And everything you’re doing right now—reading this, trying new strategies, fighting through the hard days—is leading you there.  

You are not broken. You are not weak. You are human. And humans are built to endure, adapt, and thrive.  

---

**TL;DR:** Anxiety doesn’t own you—you own it. Challenge it, ground yourself, and build habits that keep you strong. And when it feels like too much, remind yourself: this too shall pass. You’re tougher than you think.  

Now it’s your turn: What’s one thing that helps you tackle anxiety? Share it below. Let’s make this thread a safe space to learn and grow together.  

You’ve got this. And if no one’s told you today—you’re doing great.

So...have we thought about CaC fusion??,dbxv,1i9tk1o,2025-01-25 13:33:35,0,0.4,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dbxv/comments/1i9tk1o/sohave_we_thought_about_cac_fusion/,Worldly_Neat_8540,XV2,"So, *\*claps hands once for dramatics\**, fusion.

A concept that is kind of hard to picture as an in game feature. Soooooo, here is a concept on how I think both types of fusion could work.

# Similarities of Potara and Fusion Dance

The race and gender has to be the same, except for Humans and Saiyans as they have similar features.

**Initiator:** The player who activates the fusion and controls the fusion.  
**Initiated:** The player that accepts the fusion.

Each fusion type works like a **Duel Ultimate** where one player (**Initiator**) activates the skill and then another player (**Initiated**) on their team, who also has the fusion ability, will input the command to join the **Initiator**. Then a little animation will be preformed and temporarily the two players are invulnerable to damage until the animation is over.

Items cannot be used when fusion is active.

Health is what each player both had when they combined into one.

If fusion is defeated, both players are eliminated and split apart, then have to be revived separately. (If players are in trios, or a raid/expert mission. If in duos, the match ends.)

The fusion design would consist of both hairstyle and hair color choices (**Initiator** and **Initiated**) combined along with the face and head design of the **Initiator.** (Eyes, nose, chin, make-up if any.)

Each form also takes the top two **Super Attacks**, except for any **Ki/Stamina/Health Charging Abilities, (Maximum Charge, Hyper Drain, etc).** If one of the top two super attacks is one of those abilities, then one of their other available Super moves will be chosen.

Attributes of each player are also categorized. Each Player's highest stat, (**Health, Ki, Stamina, Basic Attack, Strike Supers, or Ki-Blast Supers**), are implemented into the fusion.   
For Example: (Don't judge my box)  
**|---------------------------------------------------|**  
**|** Player 1                   **|**       Player 2                      **|**  
**|** Health - 70              **|**       Health - 100               **|**  
**|** Ki - 103                    **|**       Ki - 70                        **|**  
**|** Stamina - 80            **|**       Stamina - 100             **|**  
**|** Basic Attack - 43      **|**       Basic Attack - 70        **|**  
**|** Strike Supers - 110  **|**        Strike Supers - 70      **|**  
**|** Ki-Blast Supers - 90 **|**        Ki-Blast Supers - 115 **|**  
**|----------------------------------------------------|**

The two strongest attributes are inputted into the fusion while the other stats are equaled to 100. And if the highest stats are the same the second highest stat of the **Initiated** is selected. (Kind of funky but I'll wait for suggestions.)

# Potara Fusion

The fusion of putting on an earing and getting forcefully dragged towards to your teammate to become a sandwich of power.

The Potara Fusion's special perks are that when both characters are combined, is their clothes get mismatched.  
**Initiator: Upper Body, Gloves, Accessory, and Awoken Skill**  
**Initiated: Lower Body, Boots, and Z Soul**  


**Stats:**  
**Combo Change (Male):** Long Arrogant combos that consist of toying with your enemies. Knocking your opponent away and teleporting behind or in front of them to continue the assault. They can be chained together with Light and Heavy attacks if timed right to stack more damage.  
**Movement Speed Up: M**  
**Stamina Regen: M**  
**Stamina Consumption Reduction: L** (**Boost Dashing, Blocking, etc**)  
  
**Combo Change (Female):** Rapid fire punches and kicks that can rack up damage quickly. Keeping your opponents close and keep yourself right in your opponents face. The combos are much longer if done in the right order, but can't be chained like **Male** fusions.  
**Movement Speed Up: L**  
**Stamina Regen: M**  
**Stamina Consumption Reduction: L** (**Boost Dashing, Blocking, etc**)

**Benefits over Fusion Dance:**  
Can stay in fights longer as Stamina is hard to drain unless misused.

**Drawbacks:**  
This form is reliant on Stamina and close quarters combat and the form lasts for 2 and a half minutes. If Stamina is broken all attacks are reduced by XL.

# Fusion Dance

Congratulations you've taken ballerina classes.

The Fusion Dance special perks are that when both characters are combined, is their clothes get mismatched.  
**Initiator: Metamoran Vest, Boots, Z-Soul, and Awoken Skill**  
**Initiated: Lower Body, Gloves, and Accessory**  


**Stats:**  
**Combo Change (Male):** Rapid kicks while keeping your arms crossed as your opponent has yet to earn your hands. Light attacks are quick and rapid kicks, and Heavy Attacks are slightly slower and more for kicking your opponent away.  
**Movement Speed Up: M**  
**Ki Recovery Up: XL**  
**Ki Drain: L**

  
**Combo Change (Female):** A blur of punches and kicks that deal quick but heavy damage. Timing attacks correctly allows for chained combos.  
**Movement Speed Up: L**  
**Ki Recovery Up: XL**  
**Ki Drain: L**

**Benefits over Potara:**  
Ki blast spam. Better at a range and up close considering Ki is mostly used with Super and Ultimate attacks.

**Drawbacks:**  
Having Ki being the main source of attacks the Ki drain forces players to control the fight rather than mess around. As if Ki runs out Stamina will be broken. The fusion also lasts for 2 minutes.

# Overall of both Potara and Fusion Dance

Granted they seem both very broken, but it comes at the cost of working with your teammates. As when the **Initiator** activates the ability and the **Initiated** player accepts. It comes down to the **Initiator** to do the work. The other player can watch. Potara is stamina based while Fusion Dance is Ki based. (My brain stopped working and that's all I got.)

# Namekian and Majin specific Fusion

These two races do the cool thing called merging. Lets call it ""**Power Merge (TBD)**"". While using the Namekian Race or Majin Race they can fuse their power with another Namekian/Majin on their team to increase their power permanently.

Majins are only a little different as when they get **K.O.d**, they split apart back into the separate characters but come back at half health and can't use healing items temporarily.  
  
""**Power Merge**"" Grants an L power increase for both strike and ki based attacks and increase base defense by L for each Namekian/Majin absorbed. So yes it can stack up to be a very powerful. "
[The Impeccable Adventure of the Reluctant Dungeon] - Book 3 - Chapter 23,redditserials,1i9thpl,2025-01-25 13:30:45,7,0.9,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1i9thpl/the_impeccable_adventure_of_the_reluctant_dungeon/,LiseEclaire,Comedy,"Ice and aether blades clashed against one another as Baron d’Argent and Gregord exchanged blows midair. Both were exceptional when it came to swordsmanship and both had a large number of supporting magic spells. The speed was such that hummingbirds would get busy. Just as the avatar casted a dozen swiftness spells onto himself, so had Gregord.

“Using ice to stop aether,” the archmage said. “Very clever.”

Floating back, the hero performed a double vertical strike using both swords. The weapons were blocked by the ice blades the avatar had created, yet the raw strength proved too much, causing them to shatter.

Ice fragments flew everywhere as the aether blades sank into the avatar’s shoulder. Having lost a large part of their strength, they only penetrated half an inch, but that was enough to cause the dungeon’s energy consumption to spike. Maintaining his avatar was getting more and more difficult.

Taking every opportunity provided to him, Theo used telekinesis to propel the ice fragments straight into Gregord’s face. From this distance, this was no different than a precision blast directed at a single target.

Both flew back, while casting their most potent spells. Two outlines emerged in the spot where they had been. For close to a second, the two overlapping rectangles struggled to remain in reality, then spontaneously disappeared just as fast as they had emerged.

*It actually worked*, Theo thought. It didn’t look like he could rely on the method to counter Gregord’s spells, but it was amusing to see, nonetheless.

“Where did you learn to fight like that?” Gregord asked. The right part of his face was covered in small holes, as were a large part of his clothes. There was no blood to be seen, though.

“It’s a gift,” the avatar replied. “Why don’t your wounds heal? You’ve an avatar.”

“Realism. Wouldn’t be fair to the candidates if I appeared indestructible. Although in your case…” The holes covering Gregord quickly shrank to the point of vanishing altogether. “We’re both avatars, after all. The only difference is that I don’t have to hide it.”

The statement annoyed Theo somewhat, mostly because it was true. Gregord the hero, and all other Gregords for that matter, were merely the result of a spell—an afterthought left by a once great now dead mage. None of them had to hide anything or be ashamed of it. Then again, they didn’t have a horde of heroes ready to leap at the opportunity to destroy them.

“You’re doing better than most of the rest, by the way. There’s a good chance our fight will be over first.”

“You’re surrendering?” the avatar asked. He knew that it was too good to be true, but he couldn’t stop himself from uttering the words.

“No. We just fight faster.” Gregord summoned multiple new aether swords, throwing each one at the baron.

In response, Theo’s avatar cast aether shield after aether shield, blocking the blades before they could reach their target. Hundreds of sphered fireballs were cast in response, creating a series of explosions in a two-hundred-mile radius.

The blast engulfed the dungeon’s avatar as well, causing a certain amount of damage, but that wasn’t of consequence. As long as Theo could come on top, he didn’t care how much energy he’d spend, at least not in the immediate future.

Sending shards of ice in all directions, he then quickly cast an invulnerable aether sphere around his avatar, just in case. No sooner had he done so, than a massive lightning bolt struck the surface of the aether sphere. Unable to destroy the barrier, the bolt split, sending electric charges all over the sphere.

Quickly taking advantage of his indestructibility, the avatar flew forward, straight in the direction where the bolt had come from. There was a sudden sense of propulsion followed by a sudden thump as the sphere slammed into Gregord as both sped out of the cloud of post-explosion smoke.  

Without delay, the avatar cast several hundred entangle spells, wrapping his opponent in a cocoon of aether threads. In normal circumstances, the spell wouldn’t have a chance of success, but the unorthodox way of using an aether bubble had stunned Gregord for a fraction of a second, creating a momentary opening.

 

**ENTANGLE - ULTRA**

**Spend 100 energy to magically bind a creature or object for one minute. The bind may be broken depending on the amount of strength exerted on it.**

 

Another ultra? That was rather handy. It would be a lie if Theo didn’t consider this particular spell useful, although having it reach this level just now was the last thing he expected. It wasn’t that it mattered. At this point, he could freely call the fight won without the fear of jinxing it. Regardless of Gregord’s abilities, even he had to admit defeat. There was literally nothing that he could do to break free from the aether cocoon.

Theo’s mind drifted away, thinking what sort of opponents the rest of the group had faced. Without a doubt, the archmage version had to be the toughest of all. Even with Auggy being a former archmage himself, going against such an opponent was no easy feat. Logically, the best thing to do was to head in the direction of the old mage and help him win his battle. Afterwards, it was all a matter of—

A dot of light emerged on the surface of the aether sphere. Most people would have paid no notice. After all, Gregord was utterly helpless; he didn’t even have the freedom to move his fingers. And even if, by some miracle, he did manage, Theo’s aether sphere had several seconds of invulnerability left. Having been burned more often than not, the dungeon spent a substantial amount of energy to cast a swiftness ultra spell.

Reality froze, right on time for the avatar to notice several rather significant developments. For starters, the dot of light had grown transforming into the tip of a luminous blade. Not the usual purple color of aether weapons, it was glowing in a golden yellow light.

The second important change was that the glowing blade had caused the indestructible aether sphere to crack. According to all magical principles, that was supposed to be impossible. Magic rules superseded those of nature, and were supposed to be absolute. The only thing powerful enough to negate a spell was a more powerful spell.

Suddenly, a cold chill swept through the dungeon. There was one other thing that had the power to achieve the unachievable.

Using the time given to him by his ultra swiftness spell, the avatar quickly knelt down, pressing against the bottom of the aether sphere. No sooner had he done so than time returned to normal.

A golden cyclone of pure force shattered through the sphere, ripping the cocoon of aether threads in the process.

“You used a heroic strike?!” the baron shouted, doubling the distance between himself and Gregord.

“Why not?” the other sounded confused. “I’m a hero. Just because I never used it in the past doesn’t mean I never learned it. I just preferred capturing and subduing the things I was sent to fight rather than outright killing them.”

“So, you used it on me?!”

“I’m fairly sure nothing would have happened to you,” the hero said with a dismissive shrug. “You’d probably have just been cast out.”

“I’m a *dungeon* avatar!”

An uncomfortable moment of silence followed. Neither of the two could be certain what would follow. On the one hand, it was said that all that failed in the tower were cast out. At the same time, it was well documented that accidents were frequent. It wasn’t a rarity that mages emerged dead.

*I bet you don’t even know what’s going on outside your tower*, Theo thought. That sounded just like what some academic would have done—consider every theory to the smallest detail, and completely ignore the practical implications.

Instead of admitting to his oversight, Gregord responded to the awkward situation by immediately going on the offensive again. His aether blades were golden now, as he resorted to more of his heroic skills in the fight. As part of the trial, he knew that he had to be fair to any participants, granting them a possibility of moving onwards. As a hero fighting a dungeon, however, he couldn’t ignore such an obvious advantage.

More ice shields surrounded the baron. Even at reduced efficiency, they remained the best defense he had in the current circumstances. Attempting other spells, even the newly obtained entangle ultra variant proved ineffective. Gregord would simply slice through them, or pull back out of their radius of effect.

This was what it was like fighting a hero. They were powerful, calculating, with powers that far exceeded anything Theo had. Flying to the ground, he made an attempt to create a room. The effort yielded a result, causing the start of a tower to shoot up from the ground. No sooner had it done so, when the upper half was sliced clean off in a single strike.

The dungeon mentally swallowed. If it ever came to fighting Liandra, he had this to look forward to. It was largely thanks to his swiftness that the avatar was even alive.

As the blade passed inches from his face, the avatar cast an arcane identify spell on it.

 

**AETHER BLADE – ULTRA HEROIC**

**An advanced variant of the aether blade that grants heroic qualities to the weapon. As such, it is no longer subject to standard magical limitations and has the ability to purge evil.**

 

“An ultra skill,” the avatar grumbled beneath his breath.

Of course, someone like Gregord would have it. That suggested that he had been either exceptionally lucky while alive, or he had spent a significant amount of time and effort casting that particular spell to reach its pinnacle. Clearly, he hadn’t become a hero for nothing.

Facing an opponent with such an obvious skill advantage, the dungeon had no choice but to rely on the method that had managed him to survive the bureaucratic existence of his previous life—psychological pressure and distractions.

“Why did you leave your mage tower?” he asked, avoiding a series of thrusts and arc strikes. “You were claimed to be a prodigy, so why become a hero?”

The question had the effect that Theo wanted. Although barely visible, Gregord paused for a moment. His next series of attacks didn’t follow until two full seconds later, although when it came it had double the ferocity.

“Didn’t like the way things were run?” the avatar poked further.

“You’ve never lived in a mage tower,” the other said, proving Theo’s point. “It’s different when you’re a valued benefactor.”

“I’ve seen prodigies.” The avatar cast a series of ice shards, sending them straight at his opponent. “They seem to have it easy.”

“That’s true.” Gregord pulled back, shattering each of the ice projectiles with ease. “We’re subjected to a different type of pressure. We’re cursed to follow paths plotted down for us by people who don’t have the skill to tread down them themselves. I was too naïve when I was brought to a tower, too naïve and too skilled. A terrible combination. It made me think that people treated me nice because of who they were. It took me years to see that they were only behaving that way out of fear and want.”

Memoria’s tombs appeared one after the other, each narrowly avoided thanks to the avatar’s use of swiftness ultra spells.

“How did you find out?” he asked.

“The price of excellence.” Gregord allowed himself a sigh. “After I created the memory echoes spell, I kept pushing to see how far back it could go. It was a pointless exercise, and one that even an established mage couldn’t get any practical application of. Being a prodigy, however, came with its indulgences. It took me a month, but I managed to sneak away a hundred advanced mana potions. A mana gem would have been preferable, but there are limitations to even what a prodigy could get.”

Theo could empathize. Even with all the wealth provided to the Feline tower, he had only managed to get two mana gems, one of which was depleted.

“I used them all up, driving the spell past the one-hour barrier,” Gregord continued on his own. “I still remember how excited I felt back then, so eager to go further back. I had chosen to see the past of the feasting table, because I wanted to know what people talked about when I wasn’t there. Well, I got my wish.”

“Let me guess. They hated you.”

“That would have been preferable. They were outright terrified of me. Terrified that I might be distracted by lesser things, terrified that I might have a tantrum. The whole discussion was mages discussing guardrails and methods now to keep me in line and deal with potential issues with the least amount of time and effort. It was as if they were talking about a chained monster.”

*Ouch*, the dungeon thought.

That was definitely one aspect he never experienced. Ever worse, thinking back to his past life, there might have been a few cases when he had participated in similar meetings. No one liked a Primadonna and there were always systems in place to diminish the risk of erratic behavior. Having the ability to turn back time and witness such a discussion would definitely make things awkward, especially for the person discussed.

“All the talk of bettering the world was nothing but manipulation to keep me in check. All the mages knew it was said for my benefit, half of them didn’t even believe in it.”

“That’s why you left?” Theo was already thinking how to take advantage of the chink on Gregord’s mental armor. Memoria’s tomb wasn’t an option, so he had to use something else.

“More or less,” Gregord said. “You know what they say? Too early to know, too late to not care. Adventuring with the hero guild helped me figure out a lot of things. That’s why I left them. After I had learned enough of how the world worked, I went into seclusion to create the perfect magic tower.”

“And then you did.”

“Not quite. I came close, but as long as there are people, there’d always be good and bad opinions. I’m not narcissistic enough to think that all my thoughts are good, but I tend to hope they are. That’s why I created this trial. The perfect tower, containing all the knowledge I never shared with anyone else. Some might say it’s a risk giving it out to anyone who could reach my chambers. Yet, what more could one hope for? Losing the knowledge would be as big a tragedy as giving it to someone to abuse it. This way there’s always a chance that worthy people learn it as well.”

“Sounds a bit idealistic.”

“Doesn’t it?” Gregord laughed. “I’ll tell you a secret. Ever after all this time, I never lost my naiveté. I just grew a thicker skin.”

Casting a multitude of swiftnesses on himself, the hero darted forward straight at the avatar.

Theo didn’t have enough time to form a plan, only bits and pieces of multiple ones. In a split second of desperation, he mangled them altogether.

Once again, time froze to a standstill. This time, inspired by Gregord’s talk, the dungeon cast a future echoes spell on his opponent’s blade.

The spell took effect, showing him the movement of the weapon. Gregord was aiming to execute a series of piercing attacks, then twist the blade and try to slice the avatar in two. There was no way that the attack would be successful, not with Theo’s legendary swashbuckling skill. On the other hand, there was no reason to not let it happen. Knowledge of the future position of the blade provided knowledge of Gregord’s arm, and a good idea of where the rest of the hero’s body would end up. As long as he made sure not to get affected, all was going to be well.

A series of multiple new spells followed, after which time quickly returned to normal.

Gregord followed up with his attacks. His thrusts were easily avoided by the dungeon’s avatar, forcing the hero to take a different approach and slash through the baron’s torso. As the blade did so, it suddenly hit an unbreakable surface. A small unbreakable aether shield had formed precisely in the spot where the golden aether weapon would have cut through the avatar’s body. Simultaneously, a light spiral had been cast just above Gregord’s chest.

Casting another swiftness ultra spell, Theo had his avatar cast a blessed fireball and shove it through the glowing portal of the light spiral.

“You used two of my spells,” Gregord said with a smile. Within him, the fire was already taking effect, devouring the magic that held him together. It had been an insanely risky move. It was a miracle that it had worked at all, but it had. “Well done,” he managed to add, just before being consumed in a burst of fire.

The avatar quickly flew back, surrounding himself with another indestructible aether shield out of necessity. Thankfully, there was no need for it. No other attacks followed; for that matter, Gregord the Hero remained completely gone, as if he’d never been there. The ground and mountains had removed all the scars of the battle that had occurred, returning to their beautifully serene state.

“You’re defeated, right?” the avatar asked.

Cautiously, he created another sphered fireball and sent it to scry in the hero’s guild building. The structure was just as fake as before, revealing nothing but solid rock inside.

“Well, that’s one,” the avatar thought.

The only annoying thing was that it didn’t come with any reward. Theo didn’t expect a floor prize, but he had hoped to receive the equivalent of a monster core. Thinking back, maybe it would have been better if he had allowed himself to get captured by a few more Memoria’s tombs. At least the earth elementals there would have boosted the level of his avatar.

*Crap!* The dungeon suddenly remembered.

The trial on this floor wasn’t a single battle. There were three more people facing entities just as annoying as the one he had defeated. Adding to that, thanks to his experience in the memory prison, a considerable amount of time had passed.

Renewing his flight spell, the avatar darted in the direction of Auggy. If there was anyone who needed help urgently, it had to be the old man. Ellis and Celenia were likely facing lesser versions of Gregord, so even if they were having a difficult time, Theo felt confident that he could win the battles on his own. It was Gregord, the Archmage that he was worried about. One could only imagine in terror what kinds of spells that one would use.

The landscape sped past. The avatar didn’t take notice, focusing only on what was ahead. After a while he saw a small settlement of stone houses with a tower in the middle.

“Spok!” he shouted through the spirit guide’s core pendant. “Is there anything special about mage towers?”

“Sir?” The response came almost instantly, along with a note of alarm. “Is there a particular reason for that question?”

“I’m about to do something and would like to know more on the topic.”

“Well, other than having their own defenses, magic towers are mostly ordinary structures. You could consider them to be similar to your main building, but with a lot more defensive spells.”

That already caused problems. It suggested that the moment Theo got close enough, the tower could start launching fireballs and lightning bolts at him.

“There have been ten cases in which dungeons and mage towers have gone into direct conflict,” Spok continued. “In the majority of the cases, the mage tower won.”

“What do you call a majority?”

“Nine out of ten,” the spirit guide replied. “The only time was when a small mage order erected their tower next to a rather large ancient dungeon without knowing it. The building was consumed within a week.”

“What about the surrounding buildings?”

There was a momentary pause.

“It’s rather unusual to have buildings around the mage tower,” Spok said. “The practice was abandoned centuries ago, mostly because opposing towers, nobles, and others would place spies in the buildings along with the occasional saboteur.”

That made sense. Gregord’s original tower was centuries old. It did post an interesting question, though: in the trial’s version of events, would the buildings be empty, and if not, whose side would their inhabitants take?

“Thank you, Spok.” The dungeon concentrated on his avatar.

Aether spheres preemptively emerged around him. Soon enough, he was well within the settlement around the tower. Nothing happened. There were no attacks, no traps, and—above all—no people. The few sphered fireballs that the avatar had sent out told him what he already suspected—everything was fake. It was all one giant decoration for the fight. On that note, there didn’t seem to be any fighting going on.

“Auggy?” The avatar stopped at the base of the tower.

*Damn it, old man!* Theo grumbled internally. There could only be one reason for a fight to end: one side had been defeated. Either that, or the old man was wandering the inside of a Memoria’s tomb.

Normally, this would be the last thing on the avatar’s mind, but given he had no alternatives, he resorted to one of his less useful skills: tracking.

At first glance, everything seemed completely undisturbed, just as things were before a battle or after it. Soon, though, thanks to his fire scrying skill and the dozens of floating fireballs, he found out that most structures were nothing more than a chunk of stone. Among them, though, there was one which appeared slightly different. For starters, it had a faint trail of blood leading in. For another, once the fireball flew inside, Theo was able to see a fully functional room, with the old mage lying on the floor, his clothes largely covered in blood.

Without delay, the avatar flew in the direction of the man. By the time he arrived, three green aether circles had emerged around the body.

“Auggy?” the avatar began. One of the things Theo hated in his previous life was to ask pointless questions. As it turned out, though, there were times when people were left with no alternative. “Are you alive?”

“Ho, ho, ho.” The old mage managed to laugh. “Still here.” He turned to get a better look at the avatar. “I knew you’d win. You even kept your clothes this time.”

“I’ve had a lot of practice.” The baron approached. It was ironic that of all his spells and abilities, there weren’t any that could be useful right now. Even the arcane identify spells showed nothing.

“Well, I won mine as well,” the old man said. “Just give me a while to rest up. We’ll need to go help the kids. They’re skilled, but young, not yet used to the cruelty of the real world.”

Theo didn’t know how to react. In his experience, mages did seem overly arrogant, especially the tower academic types. At the same time, he could clearly recognize the concern in the old man’s voice.

“Alright, we’ll rest,” he said. “I think I know a minor healing spell, but…”

“Don’t worry. It’s not a good idea to mix spells. The circles will patch me up. It’ll just take me a while.” Auggy closed his eyes, relaxing on the ground. “Any chance you can summon a healing potion of the alcoholic type?”

Theo’s first reaction was disapproval. Looking at things, he decided why not? It wasn’t like things could get tremendously worse from a small sip. Using his room creation skill, he formed a second room within the structure, this one full of any type of alcohol he could think of.

“Here,” he used telekinesis to fetch one from the shelves. “I’ve no idea how you’ll drink it.”

“Don’t worry. I’ll find a way.”

To the avatar’s amazement, the old man managed to reach out, grab the bottle and even remove the cork from it. Moments later, he downed down the entire thing as if it were made of air.

“That hit the spot,” he said, dropping the empty bottle next to his head onto the floor. “It’s been so long since I’ve appreciated the taste. I’ve this condition that doesn’t allow me to enjoy it. Well, unless I gulp down a large enough quantity.” He attempted to laugh, but the sound was closer to a series of coughs.

“What’s your definition of large enough?” The avatar smiled, fetching another bottle.

“Good question,” the old mage half opened an eye. “Maybe leave that for a bit later.” He took a deep breath and exhaled. “I promised to tell you how I know so much about the trial, didn’t I?”

“Yes, there was that.”

“Would you believe if I told you I got my hands on some of Gregord’s secret writings?”

“No,” the avatar replied firmly. “Not while holding Gregord’s battle staff.”

“So, you noticed that? I thought you might have. That’s why I wanted to sacrifice you during the fourth-floor trial. Good thing I didn’t. It would have made things a lot more uncomfortable. Ho, ho, ho.”

The avatar shook his head.

“Well, here’s the truth,” Auggy continued. “Many, many times. I was arrogant and young and made a serious mistake. I’ve been trying to correct it ever since. You could say I’ve been drawn to the tower like a moth to the flame. I always knew it would destroy me, but I just couldn’t keep away. Not after what I did.”

“Wait.” Alarm bells were ringing in the dungeon’s mind. “I thought it was absolute that everything done in the tower remains in the tower,” he said.

“Oh, yes. All memories are locked in tight, except possibly if you reach the final floor. However, they don’t just fade away. Each time I set foot here, I remember everything that’s happened before. In a way, I’m cursed to always remember it as if it was the first time.”

11. “A sophisticated human can become primitive. What this really means is that the human's way of life changes. Old values change, become linked to the landscape with its plants and animals. This new existence requires a working knowledge of those multiplex and cross-linked events usually referred to as nature. It requires a measure of respect for the inertial power within such natural systems. When a human gains this working knowledge and respect, that is called being primitive. The converse, of course, is equally true: the primitive can become sophisticated, but not without accepting dreadful psychological damage”

27. “The assumption that humans exist within an essentially impermanent universe, taken as an operational precept, demands that the intellect become a totally aware balancing instrument, But the intellect cannot react thus without involving the entire organism, Such an organism may be recognized by its burning, driving behavior. And thus it is with a society treated as organism. But here we encounter an old inertia. Societies move to the goading of ancient, reactive impulses. They demand permanence. Any attempt to display the universe of impermanence arouses rejection patterns, fear, anger, and despair, Then how do we explain the acceptance of prescience?

31. “When I am weaker than you, I ask you for freedom because that is according to your principles, when I am stronger than you, I take away your freedom because that is according to my principles”
32. “What a simple step it was, the step from one danger into another!”
33. “You do, indeed, build your own myths, but so do all societies. You I must warn, however. You are behaving as so many other misguided scientists have behaved. Your actions reveal that you wish to take something out of (away from] life. It is time you were reminded of that which you so often profess: One cannot have a single thing without its opposite”
34. “If you focus your awareness only upon your own rightness, then you invite the forces of opposition to overwhelm you”
35. “One uses power by grasping it lightly. To grasp too strongly is to be taken over by power, and thus to become its victim”
36. “The universe is just there; that's the only way a Fedaykin can view it and remain the master of his senses. The universe neither threatens nor promises. It holds things beyond our sway: the fall of a meteor, the eruption of a spiceblow, growing old and dying. These are the realities of this universe and they must be faced regardless of how you feel about them. You cannot fend off such realities with words. They will come at you in their own wordless way and then, then you will understand what is meant by life and death. Understanding this, you will be filled with joy”
37. “Irony often masks the inability to think beyond one’s assumptions”

46. “That which you know in one world, you shall not find in another”
47. “Because of the one-pointed time awareness in which the conventional mind remains immersed, humans tend to think of everything in a sequential, word-oriented framework. This mental trap produces very short-term concepts of effectiveness and consequences, a condition of constant, unplanned response to crises”
48. “To learn patience in the Bene Gesserit Way, you must begin by recognizing the essential, raw instability of our universe we call nature - meaning this totality in all of its manifestations - the Ultimate Non-Absolute. This is the perspective which you create with your own belief, and beliefs can be manipulated by imagination. You've learned only a limited way of looking at the universe. Now you must make the universe your own creation. This will permit you to harness any relative stability to your own uses, to whatever uses you are capable of imagining""

59. “Humankind periodically goes through a speedup of its affairs. thereby experiencing the race between the renewable vitality of the living and the beckoning vitiation of decadence. In this periodic race, any pause becomes luxury. Only then can one reflect that all is permitted; all is possible”

61. “This is a changing universe and we are the strangest change of all. We resonate to many influences. Our futures need constant updating. Now, there's a barrier which we must remove. This requires that we do brutal things, that we go against our most basic, our dearest wishes.... But it must be done”
62. “Natural selection has been described as an environment selectively screening for those who will have progeny. Where humans are concerned, though, this is an extremely limiting viewpoint. Reproduction by sex tends toward experiment and innovation. It raises many questions, including the ancient one about whether environment is a selective agent after the variation occurs, or whether environment plays a pre-selective role in determining the variations which it screens”
63. “Religion is the emulation of the adult by the child. Religion is the encystment of past beliefs: mythology, which is guesswork, the hidden assumptions of trust in the universe, those pronouncements which men have made in search of personal power, all of it mingled with shreds of enlightenment. And always the ultimate unspoken commandment is ""Thou shalt not question!"". But we question. We break that commandment as a matter of course. The work to which we have set ourselves is the liberating of the imagination, the harnessing of imagination to humankind's deepest sense of creativity”
64. “Peace demands solutions, but we never reach living solutions; we only work toward them. A fixed solution is, by definition, a dead solution. The trouble with peace is that it tends to punish mistakes instead of rewarding brilliance”
65. “The future remains uncertain and so it should, for it is the canvas upon which we paint our desires. Thus always the human condition faces a beautifully empty canvas. We possess only this moment in which to dedicate ourselves continuously to the sacred presence which we share and create” 
66. “Men roust want to do things out of their own innermost drives. People, not commercial organizations or chains of command, are what make great civilizations work. Every civilization depends upon the quality of the individuals it produces. If you over-organize humans, over-legalize them, suppress their urge to greatness - they cannot work and their civilization collapses”
67. “Seen from a distance, only the patterns lay revealed and those patterns tempted one to belief in absolutes. In absolutes, we may lose our way. The patterns could guide and they could trap. One had to remember that patterns change”
68. “The surest way to keep a secret is to make people believe they already know the answer. People don't ask questions then”
69. “As animals must move across the land, their existence dependent upon that movement, the soul of humankind, blocked for eons, needed a track upon which it could move”
70. “One condition was the mirror of the other”
71. “Anyone can be a Truthsayer, even you. It's a matter of self-honesty about the nature of your own feelings. It requires that you have an inner agreement with truth which allows ready recognition”
72. “He had achieved harmony simply by accepting it”

75. “Let the future happen of itself. The only rule governing creativity is the act of creation itself”
76. “The assumption that a whole system can be made to work better through an assault on its conscious elements betrays a dangerous ignorance. This has often been the ignorant approach of those who call themselves scientists and technologists”

Proving Jennifer Soto is guilty of neglect and culpable negligence.,jennsoto,1i9t6kv,2025-01-25 13:17:11,6,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/jennsoto/comments/1i9t6kv/proving_jennifer_soto_is_guilty_of_neglect_and/,Impossible-Spray-643,,"What else can we add?



Proving neglect and culpable negligence:

Jennifer Soto willfully and by culpable negligence failed or omitted to provide Madeline Soto with the care, supervision, and services necessary to maintain Madeline Soto’s physical and mental health.

AND 

Jennifer Soto willfully and by culpable negligence failed to make a reasonable effort to protect Madeleine Soto from the foreseeable and actual abuse and exploitation by another person (Stephan Sterns). 

In so doing, Jennifer Soto ultimately contributed to causing great bodily harm and death to Madeline Soto. 

As Madeline Soto’s biological mother and custodial parent, Jennifer Soto met the definition of caregiver for Madeline Soto under Florida law. Further, as Madeline Soto’s custodial parent, Jennifer Soto was Madeline Soto’s primary caregiver and, because the biological father lived in another state, Jennifer Soto was effectively Madeline Soto’s only parental caregiver.

Madeline Soto was under the age of 18 years at the times she was sexually abused by Stephan Sterns (ages 8 to 13), and was under the age of 18 when she was murdered  (age 13) by Stephan Sterns, Jennifer Soto’s on again off again boyfriend.

Jennifer Soto committed neglect of Madeleine Soto based on repeated conduct in which she: 1) allowed Madeline Soto to sleep in the same bed between her and Stephan Sterns; and 2)  directed Madeline Soto to sleep alone in a separate bedroom with Stephan Sterns (an unrelated adult male) in a room with a small bed and two interior locks on the door; and 3) allowed Stephan Sterns to “snuggle or cuddle” in bed with Madeline Soto, often wearing only boxer shorts ; and 4) Allowed Stephan Sterns to assist Madeline Soto  with bathing and dressing - acts that resulted in, and reasonably could have been expected to result in, serious physical or mental injury to a child.

By doing so, Jennifer Soto failed to provide Madeline Soto with the supervision and care that a prudent person would consider essential for the well-being of a child; and further failed to make any reasonable effort to protect Madeline Soto from foreseeable abuse and exploitation by Stephan Sterns.

Jennifer Soto committed culpable negligence by consciously instructing Madeline Soto to sleep alone in a separate locked bedroom with Stephan Sterns, thus following a course of conduct that Jennifer Soto knew, or reasonably should have known, was likely to result in great bodily harm to Madeline Soto. 

“[C]ulpable negligence [means] more than a failure to use ordinary care.... [I]t must be gross and flagrant [and] committed with an utter disregard for the safety of others.” Burns v. State , 132 So.3d 1238, 1240 (Fla. 1st DCA 2014). It is “consciously doing an act or following a course of conduct that the defendant must have known, or reasonably should have known, was likely to cause death or great bodily harm.” Kish v. State , 145 So.3d 225, 228 (Fla. 1st DCA 2014) (quoting Fla. Std. Jury Instr. (Crim.) 16.6). 

In child neglect cases, a caregiver’s “degree of care, neglect, indifference, or callous disregard” is measured against societal norms and expectations under the circumstances. By repeatedly instructing her daughter to sleep alone in a separate locked bedroom with Stephan Sterns, Jennifer Soto was indifferent to and callously disregarded societal norms and expectations, which unquestionably do not support instructing your 8-13 year old daughter to sleep alone in a locked bedroom with an unrelated adult male.

Further, Jennifer Soto did so when she was also home and sleeping in another bedroom in the same home. The home had four actual bedrooms and a makeshift bedroom, with two of those bedrooms and the makeshift bedroom available for Madeleine Soto to sleep either with her mother (Defendant Jennifer Soto) or alone in her own bed. There was zero justification for the defendant to instruct her daughter to sleep with Stephan Sterns. 

There was also both direct and circumstantial evidence that Jennifer Soto knew or should have known the risk that doing so presented to her daughter, victim Madeleine Soto.

1. Both of Jennifer Soto’s roommates, Nathalie Rosero and Angelica Negro, had expressed concern over Madeline Soto being alone in Stephan Stern’s room with the door closed. Jennifer Soto dismissed these concerns. Further, at least two female roommates had felt uncomfortable enough with Stephan Sterns that they refused to share a bathroom with him, a fact that Jennifer Soto was well aware of.

2. Stephan Stern’s mother, Debra Sterns, had also expressed concerns regarding allowing Madeline Soto to sleep in the same bed with Jennifer Soto and Stephan Sterns, concerns which Jennifer Soto also dismissed.

3. Jennifer Soto’s own family disliked Stephan Sterns and did not want him in the home (and further did not allow him to attend family functions or allow him into their homes). Despite this, Jenn Soto continued to allow Stephan Soto to live in and/or regularly visit for days or weeks at a time, and even went to the extent of misleading her family about Stephan Stern’s presence in the home. 

4. Madeline Soto’s school counselor, Madison Brady, expressed concerns over Madeline’s home life and emotional and mental health, concerns which Jennifer Soto also dismissed. One of those concerns was that Madeline had advised Ms. Brady that Stephan made her uncomfortable by “hanging out in the living room”. Notably, the living room is where Madeline Soto’s makeshift bedroom was. 

5. Jennifer Soto admitted that she was aware that Stephan Sterns had previously dated a 14 to 15 year-old when he was aged 19-21. Such knowledge would likely have concerned a reasonable and/or prudent parent of a teenage daughter.

6. Jennifer Soto was aware and present when Stephan Sterns regularly emerged from the bathroom attached to her bedroom,  nude, in front of both Jennifer Soto and her young daughter, Madeline Soto.  A reasonable and prudent parent would have been alarmed by this, and not allowed it to continue. 

7. Jennifer Soto admitted to witnessing Stephan Sterns “cuddle” with Madeline Soto at night, stating that Madeline  would sleep in the “nook” of Stephan Stern’s arm. She further admitted that Stephan Sterns did not own  pajamas, so often wore only boxer shorts when doing so. Any adult knows that boxer shorts do not secure or contain male genitalia. A reasonable and prudent parent would have been alarmed by this, and not allowed it to continue. 

8. Jennifer Soto witnessed Madeline Soto’s underwear and Stephan Stern’s boxer shorts discarded in a dirty laundry basket in Madeline Soto’s makeshift bedroom, indicating that both Sterns and Madeline Soto undressed in Madeline Soto’s bedroom. Finding their boyfriend’s dirty underwear in their young daughter’s bedroom would have alarmed any reasonable or prudent parent.

9. Jennifer Soto admitted to being aware that Stephan Sterns had  previously given too much prescription medication used for sedation to Madeline Soto, and that Stephan Sterns may have given Madeline Soto THC capsules prescribed to Jennifer Soto, yet still allowed him to have unsupervised access to Madeline, including “assisting” Madeline with “nighttime routines,” which included  administering medications. A prudent parent, after discovering a caregiver had overdosed their child and/or given them THC capsules, would not have allowed that party to handle the child’s medications again, least of all administer them to their child.

10. On one of those occasions, when Jennifer Soto reported that Madeline was non-responsive and that she was unable to awaken her in the morning, Jennifer Soto failed to seek appropriate medical care and instead allegedly called poison control. A prudent parent or caregiver, finding their child unresponsive and being told that they had been given too much of a sedating medication, would have called 911 or taken their child to the emergency room. 

11. Jennifer Soto was aware that Madeline Soto had suffered from constipation, rectal pain, rectal bleeding, and possible anal tears, but failed to seek or obtain appropriate medical care, and instead chose to administer an over the counter constipation medication, Miralax.

12. Jennifer Soto admitted to placing Stephan Sterns, an unrelated adult male with no children,  in charge of Madeline Soto’s “nighttime routines,” which included taking sedating medication, undressing, showering, and going to bed. A reasonable and prudent parent would not have allowed an unrelated adult male to “assist” their 8 to 13-year-old daughter with dressing and bathing.

13. Jennifer Soto admitted to allowing Madeline Soto to sleep in Jennifer’s bed  with Jennifer and Stephan Sterns, inexplicably placing Madeline in the middle (between Jennifer and Stephan).  A reasonable and prudent parent would not allow their young daughter to sleep in bed with an unrelated adult male, least of all be placed in the middle between the mother and the mother’s boyfriend.

14. Jennifer Soto also admitted to instructing Madeline Soto to go upstairs to a bedroom known as “Room Number Four” to sleep alone with Stephan Sterns. Notably, that room had two interior locks on the door, a small bed, and sometimes contained a loaded and unsecured 9mm firearm, which was completely accessible to Madeline Soto.

15. Further, Jennifer Soto admitted to knowing that allowing her daughter to sleep alone with Stephan Sterns was inappropriate, and admitted that she did so anyway, “for her own selfish reasons.”

16. Per Jennifer Soto, Stephan Sterns moved from Jennifer’s bedroom to Room Number Four in June of 2023.

17. During the same month, on June 16, 2023, Jennifer Soto texted Stephan Sterns, stating, “Maddie is no longer sleeping with me, I can’t risk it.”  Jennifer Soto later claimed to not remember said  text and further claimed to have no idea why she sent said text or what it meant. This text indicates that Jennifer Soto may have been aware of the sexual abuse. 

18. Jennifer Soto bizarrely stated to law enforcement ““If anything I’ve always told him [Stephan Sterns] my biggest fear was that this would turn into a Woody Allen situation where the stepdaughter falls…[Jen corrects herself] uh, the dad grooms the child and the child then turns 18 and ends up running away with him. I told him that was my biggest fear and I don't ever want that happening, like, you can't do that to me!"", effectively admitting to being aware of an inappropriate relationship between Stephan  Sterns and her young daughter, and even admitting to disapproving of such relationship - yet doing nothing to protect her daughter.

19. Jennifer Soto also took actions which demonstrated that she was well aware of the risks of sexual abuse to female children, including but not limited to sending Madeline Soto’s biological father, Tyler Wallace, the following text on June 16, 2023: “ I hope nobody touches her or tries shit or films her under the door,” as well as allegedly having a discussion with both Stephan Sterns and Madeline Soto about online safety and sexual predators, when Madeleine Soto was ten-years-old, after it was alleged that an older child online had asked Madeline Soto to send nude photos of herself. 

20. Further, Jennifer Soto was provided with materials discussing sexual abuse and ways to help prevent  the same and ensure your child’s safety by Madeline Soto’s school. This occurred annually, beginning in 5th grade, when Madeline Soto was ten-years-old.

21. Jennifer Soto admitted to doing the family’s laundry and taking out the trash, thus would have seen any evidence of sexual abuse, including but not limited to bodily fluids and/or blood/blood stains on clothing, sheets or towels. She also might have seen discarded condom wrappers, used condoms, soiled tissues, or other evidence of sexual activity or abuse in the home.

22. In school notebooks, which Jennifer Soto had access to, Madeline Soto drew explicit drawings depicting oral sex. Further, Jennifer Soto actually wrote an entry in one of Madeline Soto’s notebooks, proving that she had access to and indeed did access said notebooks.

23. Jennifer Soto was aware that Stephan Sterns exhibited almost textbook signs of pedophelia, including but not limited to: 

* Stephan Sterns sought out a relationship with Jennifer Soto after discovering that she was the single parent of a young daughter.

* Stephan Sterns sought out an inappropriate “friendship” with Madeline Soto, a then vulnerable 8-year-old child.

* Stephan Sterns was possessive of Madeline Soto, erroneously claiming to be her “stepfather” and appearing to be jealous of Madeline Soto’s crush on an age appropriate peer.

* Stephan Sterns had a known history of dating a minor while he was of adult age.

* Stephan Sterns was known to view pornography, including CSAM, and had requested that other romantic partners dress as “little girls” and/or call him “daddy”. He had also requested that another partner lay face down on the bed and remain silent during sex. It is likely that, over a period of seven years, Stephan Sterns would have revealed the same sexual fetishes to Jennifer Soto. If he did so, a reasonable and prudent parent would be cautious of allowing him unsupervised access to her young daughter.

* Stephan Sterns showed an unusual and continuous interest in toys , games, and other children’s activities, including playing games, painting small figurines, and collecting toys.

* Stephan Sterns preferred to spend time as if he were a child and with children, rather than choosing activities for adults or spending time with adults.

* Stephan Sterns had a history of mental illness.

* Stephan Sterns had a history of sporadic employment, termination, and long periods of unemployment.

* Stephan Sterns called, texted, and contacted Madeline Soto regularly and sometimes constantly, via various social media, communicating with her both privately and excessively.

* Stephan Sterns appeared to spend more time with and pay more attention to Madeline Soto than with Jennifer Soto.

* Stephan Sterns insisted on “looking after” Madeline Soto, and “babysat” Madeline Soto for free, even when Jennifer Soto was home, and even after Madeline Soto reached an age where she did not need a “babysitter.”

* Stephan Sterns made efforts to be alone with Madeline Soto, including playing games with her in his room (with the door closed) and sleeping alone with her in his bedroom or in Madeline Soto’s makeshift bedroom. 

* Stephan Sterns groomed Madeline Soto by engaging in children’s activities with her, lavishing attention upon her, and giving her gifts.

* Stephan Sterns criticized Jenn Soto’s approach to parenting to Madeline Soto, in an effort to gain Madeline Soto’s trust and to pit mother and daughter against each other.

* Stephan Sterns ignored Madeline Soto’s boundaries, gave Madeline Soto little to no privacy, and made Madeline Soto uncomfortable.

* Stephan Sterns appeared to know too much about Madeline Soto, including things it would not be normal for a mother’s boyfriend to know about the daughter (such as her exact weight, location of moles or beauty marks, and the timing of menstrual cycles). 

* Stephan Sterns showed too much interest in the sexuality of Madeline Soto, including discussing her development, periods, and crushes.

* Stephan Sterns “accidentally” walked into Jennifer Soto’s bedroom nude while Madeline Soto was present, and would “accidentally” walk in on Madeleine Soto when she was in the bathroom, showering, or changing.

* Stephan Sterns advised others (including law enforcement) that Madeleine Soto “needed human contact” and could not sleep without “snuggling” with him.

* Stephan Sterns “cuddled” with Madeline Soto while sleeping with both Jennifer Soto and Madeline Soto.

* Stephan Sterns continued to sleep with both Jennifer Soto and Madeline Soto or alone with Madeline Soto even after “breaking up” with Jenn Soto, while dating and having sexual relations other women, and after allegedly “moving out” of Jenn Soto’s home.

24. Jennifer Soto was aware that Madeline Soto was exhibiting almost textbook signs of sexual abuse, including but not limited to: 

* 		Painful urination or bowel movements.

* Abdominal, pelvic, rectal, or vaginal pain.

* 		Vaginal or rectal bleeding.

* 		Exhibiting adult-like sexual knowledge, behavior or language.

* 		Having nightmares or trouble sleeping.

* 		Depression or withdrawal.

* 		Crying.

* 		Sudden changes in school performance (plummeting grades, skipping school).

* 		Sudden shyness or avoiding dressing/undressing in front of others (such as for PE classes).

* Running away from home or planning/threatening to run away from home.

* 		Sudden or frequent mood changes, emotional lability.

* Expressing discomfort with an adult in their life.

* Daytime sleepiness.

* Being quieter or more distant than usual. 

* Being clingier than usual.

* Unusual or new fears, sometimes around touch, being alone, being with a particular person or in a particular places.

* Difficulty concentrating or with memory, zoning out, seeming distracted or not listening.

* Eating, sleeping or hygiene changes.

* Sexual themes in artwork, stories, play etc.

* ‘Acting out’ behaviours (aggression, destructive behaviours, truanting behaviour).

* ‘Acting in’ behaviours (withdrawal from friends and family, depression).

* Problems with friends and schoolwork/attendance.

* Vague symptoms of illness such as headache or tummy ache.

* Asking vague questions or making vague statements about topics such as secrets, unusual ‘games’, or adult behaviors.

25. Despite the above knowledge, acts, and omissions, Jennifer Soto took NO ACTION to protect her daughter, Madeline Soto, from the foreseeable and actual sexual abuse and exploitation from Stephan Sterns.

26. Jennifer Soto’s knowledge of Madeline Soto’s medical and emotional/mental health conditions and failure to seek or obtain appropriate medical attention for Madeline constitutes sufficient evidence from which a jury could properly infer that her inaction was “knowing and intentional, or done with such wanton or careless indifference to Madeline Soto’s well-being as to be practically intentional.” Arnold v. State , 755 So.2d 796, 799 (Fla. 2d DCA 2000). 

27. Further, Jennifer Soto’s knowledge of all of the above and below, including Jennifer Soto’s own acts and omissions, and her failure to take any action to protect Madeline Soto from foreseeable and/or known abuse or exploitation by Stephan Sterns constitutes sufficient evidence from which a jury could properly infer that her actions and inactions were “knowing and intentional, or done with such wanton or careless indifference to Madeline Soto’s well-being as to be practically intentional.” Arnold v. State , 755 So.2d 796, 799 (Fla. 2d DCA 2000).

28. Jennifer Soto admitted that, on or about February 25th, 2024, Stephan Sterns had an unsecured and loaded semi automatic 9mm handgun and ammunition in Room Number Four.

29. On or about February 25th, 2024, despite her knowledge of the unsecured firearm and all of the above, Jennifer Soto instructed Madeline Soto to go upstairs to sleep alone with Stephan Sterns in Room Number Four.

30. On or about February 25th, 2024, Jennifer Soto specifically instructed Madeline Soto to go upstairs to Room Number Four to sleep alone with Stephan Sterns. Stephan Sterns then sexually assaulted and murdered Madeline Soto.

31. On or about February 27th, 2024, law enforcement discovered photographs and video on Stephan Stern’s cell phone depicting the sexual abuse and rape of Madeline Soto, including approximately 1700 images or video taken over a five year period between June 2019 and December 2023, when Madeline Soto would have been aged eight to twelve. 

32. All of the abuse depicted appeared to have been committed in Jennifer Soto’s home, in either Jennifer Soto’s bedroom, Madeline Soto’s makeshift bedroom, or in Room Number Four, and at times when Jennifer Soto was also present in the home. Jennifer Soto did not work during this time, thus was present in the home almost 24-7.

33. Again, the abuse depicted appeared to have been committed while Jennifer Soto was also in the home. 

34. After being shown some of these photos (photos clearly depicting Stephan Stern’s sexual abuse and rape of her daughter), as well as being advised that her daughter was likely deceased (and being shown photos of her daughter’s body in the passenger seat of Stephan Stern’s vehicle), Jennifer Soto responded by:  

* Immediately seeking an attorney for Stephan Sterns. 

* Implying that the sexual abuse had not hurt Madeline, was “not evil,” was “fine,” was “a side thing,” and was not related to Madeline’s disappearance or murder. 

* After being told by law enforcement that Stephan Sterns has been sexually abusing Madeline Soto for years, when asked by a detective, “Do you think he would ever hurt her?” Jennifer Soto responded, “I don’t think he would.”

* Again, after being told by by law enforcement that Stephan Sterns has been sexually abusing Madeline Soto for years, and that they believed that Stephan Sterns had killed Madeline Soto, Jennifer Soto stated, “I believe you when you talk about those  images. Those images might be real, or they happened, but I don’t believe they’re related to this case.” 

* Again, after being told by by law enforcement that Stephan Sterns has been sexually abusing Madeline Soto for years, and that they believed that Stephan Sterns had killed Madeline Soto, Jennifer Soto stated, “I didn’t see the rape. I didn’t know she was getting raped until yesterday. I saw the picture of the oral sex happening, and I knew that that was true, right? That was evidence. That’s for real. That’s (expletive) happening. But I kept thinking, going — I don’t know why, I, I can’t tell you why my brain kept thinking, ‘No, he didn’t kill her...’ I felt in my body she was still alive. She was still out there. I told (Sterns’ father) to get him a lawyer because I felt like you guys were chasing the wrong person.”

* Again, after being told by by law enforcement that Stephan Sterns has been sexually abusing Madeline Soto for years, and that they believed that Stephan Sterns had killed Madeline Soto, Jennifer Soto stated, “When you guys showed me the picture of her, I believed the sexual stuff, but I didn’t want to believe that he had done anything evil to her. I’m like what if he did this stuff, fine, but what if she’s still missing out there? What if somebody took her?” 

* Again, after being told by by law enforcement that Stephan Sterns has been sexually abusing Madeline Soto for years, and that they believed that Stephan Sterns had killed Madeline Soto, Jennifer Soto stated, “Let’s say all the sexual stuff happened, or uh we know it did happen, but what if he’s telling the truth about dropping her off and driving in circles and ? Is there video evidence of him, cause I know there’s banks in that plaza and an AM Stop. There must be video of him pulling into that plaza and leaving… if you guys have found evidence of him being in front of the store like he said he was, like, it’s possible that his story might be true and somebody else may have taken her.”  

* Again, after being told by by law enforcement that Stephan Sterns has been sexually abusing Madeline Soto for years, and that they believed that Stephan Sterns had killed Madeline Soto, Jennifer Soto stated   “Okay, like, the sex things happened, right? But what if that’s completely like a side thing and not having to do with this … like her being missing? I mean …” 

* Again, after being told by by law enforcement that Stephan Sterns has been sexually abusing Madeline Soto for years, and that they believed that Stephan Sterns had killed Madeline Soto, Jennifer Soto stated, “Can I choose not to press charges now and change my mind later?”

35. Further, during the course of the investigation into the abuse and murder of her missing daughter, Madeline Soto, Jennifer Soto repeatedly lied to and/or attempted to mislead law enforcement, in an apparent attempt to protect Stephan Sterns. 

36. These false statements included but were not limited to stating that she saw Madeline Soto getting ready for school at 8:00am on Monday, February 26, 2024 (when Madeline Soto was already deceased and her body was strapped into Stephan Stern’s passenger seat).

37. In light of all of the above, it was more than reasonably foreseeable that Jennifer Soto’s acts and omissions would result or was resulting in sexual abuse and/or exploitation by Stephan Sterns of Jennifer Soto’s young daughter, Madeline Soto. 

38. Jennifer Soto was not dependent on Stephan Soto for housing, transportation, food, medical care, income, or childcare. Jennifer Soto received child support, disability income, financial assistance from family, and income from intermittent work. Jennifer Soto lived rent free  (or at a reduced rental rate)  in the condo she resided in, which was owned by her father, Juan Soto. Jennifer Soto likely received additional benefits, including but not limited to SNAP and Medicaid. Jennifer Soto also owned a 2022 car, thus providing her a reliable form of transportation. 

39. Further, Jennifer Soto had multiple family members who resided within 5-30 minutes of her home who were willing to (and in fact did) assist with Madeline Soto’s care and transportation as needed - as well as two female roommates.

40. Stephan Sterns was unemployed, had no reliable transportation, and relied on Jennifer Soto and his parents for housing, transportation, food, and medications. Further, per Jennifer Soto’s own admissions, Stephan Sterns stayed up all night, slept all day, and spent his waking hours window shopping and/or shopping for toys and games, as well as playing video games and board games and painting “war hammer” figurines. Per Jennifer Soto, Stephan Sterns did not contribute to the household in any way.

41. Jennifer Soto could have easily removed Stephan Sterns from the home, forbidden him from returning, or, alternatively, removed Madeline Soto to one of her family’s homes (or to Madeline  Soto’s biological father).

42. At the minimum, Jennifer Soto could have easily provided Madeline with a safe and secure bedroom in her home and not allowed Stephan Sterns unsupervised access to her daughter or allowed him to sleep with her daughter.

43. Instead, Jennifer Soto did absolutely nothing to protect her daughter, Madeline Soto, from Stephan Sterns.

44. Instead , Jennifer Soto allowed Stephan Sterns unfettered access to her daughter, Madeline Soto, instructed Stephan Sterns to “babysit” her, instructed Stephan Sterns to assist with her medications, bathing, and getting ready for bed, and further inexplicably instructed Madeline Soto to sleep alone with Stephan Sterns, in a room with only one bed and with two interior locks on the door. 

44. In light of the direct and circumstantial evidence of Jennifer Soto’s actions and inactions in the face of ostensibly glaring signs of sexual abuse of Madeline Soto by Stephan Sterns clearly demonstrates “an entire want of care raising the presumption of indifference to consequences” and is sufficient to support a finding that  1) Jennifer Soto’s failure to seek appropriate medical  and mental health attention for Madeline Soto; and 2) Jennifer Soto’s failure to take any action to protect her daughter, Madeline Soto, from the foreseeable or known sexual abuse and/or exploitation by Stephen Sterns constituted culpable negligence.

Disrupting ICE: A Field Guide,behindthebastards,1i9t0r0,2025-01-25 13:10:02,32,0.96,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/behindthebastards/comments/1i9t0r0/disrupting_ice_a_field_guide/,TildenOak,,"Stopping ICE from abducting civilians without resorting to violence is a deeply challenging and dangerous scenario. It is difficult to imagine toppling the power of the American state, but resistance, delay, and communication are never futile. Strategic nonviolent actions can disrupt these operations and protect those targeted, even if only temporarily. Depending on the specific circumstances, resources, and risks, here are potential approaches:

**Alert Allies and Mobilize the Community**

* Spread alerts through text chains and secure channels. Share location, time, and details.
* Use secure text chains or local community networks to quickly rally nearby residents to gather peacefully.
* Encourage the group to meet at a visible but safe location near the site of the detentions, creating a nonviolent show of solidarity.
* Equip the crowd with signs, flashlights, or noise-making devices to emphasize peaceful intentions while drawing attention to the situation.
* Strength in numbers can create a protective barrier around civilians, making it more difficult for unlawful actions to continue.
* Maintain calm and coordinated communication to ensure the group remains unified and non-confrontational, focusing on deterrence rather than escalation.

**Nonviolent Interposition**

* Appeals to the humanity of an ICE officer will never work because they have none. However, it can serve as a delaying strategy.
* Form a calm, unified line or group between the ICE agents and their captives, maintaining a peaceful but firm presence to impede their actions.
* Use deliberate but non-aggressive body language to assert your position, signaling that your intent is nonviolent but resolute.
* Engage the agents in dialogue, asking procedural questions, requesting justification for their actions, or expressing “concern for misunderstanding.”
* Use the conversation to delay their movements, emphasizing logistical or legal confusion while avoiding emotional appeals.
* Coordinate with allies to use the time gained for evacuation, documentation, or legal intervention.

**Use Psychological Tactics**

* Present yourself confidently as someone with authority (e.g., a lawyer, journalist, or government official) to challenge the officers’ actions.
* Demand identification, explanations, or proof of their authority while speaking loudly and clearly to attract attention.
* Provide incorrect but plausible-sounding information, such as claiming higher authorities are on their way or that their actions are being live-streamed.
* Use legal or procedural jargon to confuse or stall them, creating doubt about the legitimacy of their operation.
* Maintain a calm and assertive demeanor, leveraging perceived privilege or status to undermine their confidence and buy time for civilians to escape or receive help.

**Signal the Civilians**

* Pass small tools like wire cutters or phone chargers covertly if the opportunity arises, ensuring they remain hidden.
* Identify moments when the detaining agents are distracted and subtly signal civilians to move.
* Ensure escape routes are clear and safe, using trusted community members to guide them to secure locations if needed.

**Employ Distraction**

* Create distractions using loud sounds like car alarms, firecrackers, or banging on metal surfaces to draw attention away from civilians.
* Use bright lights, such as flashlights or strobe effects to disorient and confuse the agents.
* Block or obstruct streets with vehicles, trash bins, or other movable objects to slow down their movements.
* Coordinate small, controlled disturbances (e.g., smoke from fire extinguishers or setting off sprinkler systems) to create confusion and buy civilians time to escape.
* Use the urban environment—alleys, rooftops, and hidden pathways—to guide civilians away from danger while staying out of sight.

**Create a Roadblock or Diversion**

* Position parked vehicles, dumpsters, or heavy objects across the convoy’s path to create an impassable roadblock.
* Use hazard markers or construction signs to make the roadblock appear legitimate and buy more time.
* Spread false warnings of a nearby threat, such as a gas leak or road hazard to force the convoy to change direction or halt.
* Deploy timed distractions like flashing lights, firecrackers, or noise from another area to redirect attention away from the civilians.

**Document and Publicize**

* Use your phone or a discreet recording device to document the ICE agents’ actions, focusing on badges, vehicles, and interactions with civilians.
* Record from a safe distance to avoid escalating the situation or putting yourself at risk.
* Securely back up the recordings immediately using encrypted cloud storage or by sharing with trusted allies.
* Share the evidence with reputable immigrant rights organizations, journalists, or legal teams to ensure the actions are publicized responsibly.
* Avoid live streaming if it risks exposing the location or identities of civilians but prepare to release the footage strategically to maximize impact and accountability.

Each of these strategies comes with risks, and their success depends on the environment, the resources available, and the disposition of the ICE agents. Nonviolence in such extreme situations demands immense courage, creativity, and a willingness to accept potential personal harm to protect others. However, resistance is never futile. Even small, determined acts can disrupt fascist systems, safeguard lives, and inspire further solidarity."
Deadbelt Solo RPG - Question about gas and spacewalk mechanic,Solo_Roleplaying,1i9sydw,2025-01-25 13:07:08,6,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Solo_Roleplaying/comments/1i9sydw/deadbelt_solo_rpg_question_about_gas_and/,Spitfisher,Solo Games,"Since i need to ask permission to post a question on deadbelt reddit itself, i also want to ask here while i wait for my permission to post a question.



1. Do you need to check Gas every time you move from one module to the next.

The booklet states: 

""Every time you enter a new ship Module or are otherwise prompted, the first thing you’ll do is check your Gas level. Your Gas number always starts at 1 of 6 and works on a decrementing d6 range that represents cascading failure.""

It states ""new module"" making me think if i trace back my steps, its not a new module since ive been there before so i dont need to check gas.

However i see people on the deadbelt reddit state that its every time you enter a new module meaning if you trace back your steps, you need to check again cause every module you enter is a ""new"" one.

I have played 2 games now and cant imagine exploring one of the big ships if i need to check gas every module movement. I barely survived the small ships while doing a check every module old or new or am i approaching it wrong in the sense that its the intention of the game for short small explorations in birds and then to back off and you never realy explore the ship.



2. I dont understand the spacewalk card mechanic.

The booklet states:

When you Spacewalk: Roll d6 

On a 6 you cross the gap with minimal fuss.   
On a 4/5 draw 1 Card from the unused portion of your deck.   
On a 1-3 draw 2 Cards.

So i rolled a 4 and needed to draw 1 card from the unused portion.



Then for the effect the booklet states:

If you draw a red card or 2...

If you draw a red card or a red and a black...

If you draw 3 blakc cards before 3 red...



My question: I drawed one black card. What do i do now?

While writing this question i realize that i might need to add the card i land on to the card i draw but that doenst seem to be mentioned in the booklet that i need to add the new module card with the newly drawn card.

Is this the correct way?



Thanks in advance!

**Memory Transcription Subject: Leasha, flustered owner of Twilight Pupcare** 

**Date \[Standardized Human Time\] October 28, 2136** 

*Stars above, give me strength for I have not thought this through.*  

How did I ever think I could survive this? Trapped in an enclosed room with him, and overnight as well! My mind invariably went to all the most inappropriate places as our proximity to one another stirred a warmth within my body. Even sitting down, he was much taller than me, and I couldn’t help but imagine him simply leaning over my way, pinning me beneath his perfectly sculpted body.  

More and more the desire to feel the firm musculature of his body grew in me. Sure, I may have received a very intimate hug from him after the shadestalker attack, but I was too much of an emotional wreck at the time to really savor the sensation and commit it to memory. The best I had was a foggy recollection of what it felt like, and I wanted more than that. 

I couldn’t work up the nerve to come out and request it, or even just do it, though. George had been extremely focused as he scrolled through page after page of information on his personal device for nearly the last claw, looking for some way to get back at the exterminators and convince them it was better to just let the pups go. This was not the time for my wild and untamed thoughts to be left rampant. I had to restrain them and focus on the task at hand. 

While I turned my attention back to my own personal device, George let out a frustrated sigh bordering on a growl. “I can only understand like half of this shit that I’m reading right now and the rest of it is just a bunch legal jargon that seems to be there entirely for bureaucratic bloat! How is it that on an alien world the legal system is still a tangled mess of knots?” 

“Maybe it’s because society itself is complicated? We can’t give up hope just yet, though. There has to be some way we can take action against the exterminators without giving them the opportunity to arrest us for it.” 

George considered for a second, his face doing all sorts of weird movements that I had yet to get used to. It struck me just how expressive a human’s face is. All those tiny muscles twitching and moving in subtle ways that were impossible for me to decipher.  

*Is this what humans feel when they look at our tail signs?*  

Bizarre methods of communication aside, eventually George just shook his head and chuckled. “You know, it’s funny. I spent my whole life following the rules, trying not to cause problems for other people, just being your average run of the mill Joe. Now, I’m actively trying start trouble and looking for ways to get away with it. Weird how things turn out.” 

That was a feeling I could relate to. “You’re telling me. I never imagined my life would become so chaotic. I thought I’d spend my days taking care of the pups in the peace and quiet of the herd. Being forced out of the herd, labeled an outcast and looked at like I’m some kind of PD case after losing all the pups...”  

The more I talked, the more it hurt until eventually I couldn’t say another word. Never have I felt so alone before as the very people who once greeted me with a happy tail wave now sneered at me with revulsion. It was as if I was no different than an Arxur, or perhaps closer to a human, in their eyes. 

I didn’t even realize that there were tears in my eyes until George put an arm around my shoulder to comfort me, dragging me back to reality from my spiraling thoughts. “Hey, Leasha, it will be alright. We’ll get the kids back, get your business back up and running, and eventually everything will go back to normal. The thing about irrational fears is that the more you’re exposed to it, the more you realize that there was nothing to be worried about to begin with.” 

Lately it felt like he was reassuring me more often than I was him, despite the fact he had nearly the whole galaxy against him and his species. A scoff escaped me. “You know, I never thought the day would come when I would consider a predator species to have more empathy than my own. It’s laughable, really.” 

George looked concerned, if I was reading his expression right, and contemplative for a few moments. Eventually I saw a grin spread across his face. “You know what helps chase away those dark clouds?” He reached over and snatched a bowl of food from the table. “Snack foods!” 

It was so ridiculous and out of nowhere that I could help but laugh at it. George’s smile grew a bit as the dark clouds were chased away by the shining soul within this colossal man. I took the offered snack, a thin, wavy flake that I hadn’t tried yet, and popped it into my mouth. It was deliciously salty and crunchy, the combination doing wonders for my mood. 

“Well, I can’t deny it, you were right.” 

He laughed and ate one of the flakes himself. “Potato chips are a dangerously comfortable food. You immediately feel better after eating them, but they’ll bloat you like crazy if you’re not careful.” 

“All the best things carry a cost, don’t they?” 

“True enough,” he stated simply as we both munched on the snacks. He put the bowl down and let out a short huff. “I know we’re on an important mission right now and the kids need our help, but frankly my brain is feeling like mush after reading all that legal jargon and you seem like you need an emotional break as well. What say you to watching a movie before getting back to it?” 

“A movie?” He wanted to watch a movie with me, we are eating snacks, and we were in his apartment together, alone... 

*Is this a date!?*  

My mind leapt at the thought, practically doing a flip of joy as I tried to reign myself in. This was a very serious situation and the pups needed our help. I am their caretaker, and I couldn’t be sitting around watching movies with a muscular human no matter how much it made my tail wag with joy. Speaking of which, I forced my tail down against the seat to still it. 

“Are you sure now’s the best time for that?” 

He shrugged. “I honestly can’t tell you for certain. The only thing I know is that forcing yourself to do something beyond the tolerance of your mind can do more harm than good. You might miss a crucial detail, an obvious solution, or just plain demoralize yourself before you can even act. We’ll do one movie and then get back to work once we’re refreshed and ready to look at things with a clean slate.” 

*Just do it you coward! You have to take this chance; don’t let it slip away!*  

That fire deep within me was being stirred again, prompting me to action with its burning heat that pulsed deep within my chest. It almost felt like I wasn’t even in control of myself anymore as a force beyond me guided my actions. 

“Well, if you think that it’s alright for us to take a break right now, then I guess I have no reason to object.” 

He gave me a smile and a nod as he got up from his seat, collecting the controller for his room’s entertainment system. When he turned on the system, a screen was displayed with a large collection of unfamiliar titles featuring humans on the cover. I never had any need for a visual translator, so I didn’t have that functionality and could not read any of the names being presented before me. George seemed to have an idea of the type of movie he wanted to play, however. 

“Well, knowing you and your taste of media, I’d say a romcom would be a good pick.” 

Despite me knowing better at this point, I still felt a small bit of nervousness at the hence unheard-of category of movie he decided on. He said it would suit my tastes, but even so a part of me was worried that there was a significant cultural rift present. 

“Uhm, what exactly is a romcom?” 

“Oh, it’s shorthand for romantic comedy. The plots for these types of movies usually boil down to budding romantic interest interjected with a few hijinks and jokes that usually slow down or get in the way of the love interest.” 

That... sounded pretty fun, actually. He messed around with the settings on the list, mumbling a bit to himself about filters and a few complaints about user friendliness before he finally got his selections listed. I was quite surprised to see how extensive the list actually was with dozens of movies being available. It almost seemed like humans had just as many movies about romance as we did. I’m sure the exterminators would have just labeled it all as predatory deception and declared that they were all just empty titles with no actual content or perhaps vicious predatory concepts of love like sharing fresh kills with a mate... 

*Humans don’t do that, right?*  

Finally, he decided on one, clicking the controller to start it as he sat back down next to me. While it was sweet that he chose this genre for me, it was well known that he was not nearly as much of a fan of it as I was. 

“Are you really sure you want to watch this kind of movie with me? I mean, it’s nice of you to consider my preferences, but if you don’t like them, then we could watch something else.” 

He waved a hand in front of his face. “Nah, it’s fine. Romcoms aren't bad or anything, and they’re fun every once and a while, it’s just the plot gets predictable after so many times.” 

Well, I guess he had a bit of a point. In the back of your mind, you always do know what will happen to the protagonists of those stories. It’s not like they would just end a story without the emotional payoff of the characters finally getting together. Even so, it’s always romantic and tickles that part of me that longs for a mate as loyal and caring as that. 

*You mean like the one in front of you?* 

*Shut up! Not now!*  

Despite the ever-present voice in my head that was constantly goading me on, I controlled myself and focused on the movie as it went through the opening sequence. It was interesting. I got a glimpse of life on the human home world and a variety of the half-predators wandered about in a town not too dissimilar to that of shady hills. They came in all shapes, sizes, and even pigmentations as they did decidedly normal activities such as shopping, driving, playing in the park with their pups, and working. Sure, the many binocular eyes on display were slightly unsettling, but none of them looked directly into the camera so the quantity wasn’t overwhelming in the slightest, unlike when I first entered the shelter and every human we passed couldn’t take their eyes off me. 

The two apparent protagonists were introduced separately, though evidently working in the same location as one another if I was picking up the correct context clues as they rushed about, busy as a laysi in flower field. These two humans eventually collided with one another in the halls of their business, both of them dropping some items in the process. They knew each other in passing and had a professional relationship it seemed as they talked while picking things up. I wasn’t familiar with human signs of attraction, but there may have already been a little spark between them from what I was picking up.  

I will readily admit that I was quickly getting invested in their relationship. For some reason the plot felt a little familiar to me as well. It was also interesting to see how humans went about establishing a relationship with one another, even when the depth of said relationship is strained due to outside circumstances.  

There was one particular argument scene near the midpoint of the movie that was scary as it was fascinating to witness. The two protagonists were yelling at each other for a few minutes, airing their grievances and problems in a frightening manner. I had thought that maybe it would be the end of the couple, but by the time they finished shouting, the pair became calm, almost tranquil as they fell into a deep contemplation over their circumstances and budding feelings. It was unlike anything I had ever seen before, and I was enraptured by it. 

George, on the other paw, wasn’t as invested as I was. During the quieter scenes I caught him scrolling through his personal device again, looking through more of the legal notes for a few minutes until something else in the movie managed to capture his attention once more. It was a little disappointing that he wasn’t more engaged with the story and watching it with me. I wanted this to be a more personal moment between us. 

*You could give him a little hint.*  

The voice was back, feeding wondrously troublesome ideas into my head once more. Just the thought of doing something suggestive made my heart start racing and my face feel like it was burning. Thankfully, and frustratingly, George wasn’t paying much attention to me at the moment, so my embarrassment went unnoticed.  

Looking up at the big man as he so obliviously altered between watching the movie and scrolling through his device filled me with such agonizing vexation. It was eating away at me like a predator, running amok inside my mind and my body as I felt my tail twitch with the need to act. The burden of desire grew too great for me, and I caved under the pressure as slowly my tail shifted over the surface of the couch until it brushed against his thigh.  

I was so embarrassed by my actions and fearful of the response they would elicit that I couldn’t even bring myself to look at him for the first few seconds as I gently shifted the tip of my tail back and forth across his well-toned thigh. After a moment, though, when nothing happened or no words of protest came from him, I ventured to sneak a peek at his face. What I saw confused me. 

His face was neutral, not a single expression and hardly even a twitch happened across his face, and that was saying a lot after all the emotions I had seen that humans could go through. At first, I thought that maybe he just didn’t feel it, so I brushed my tail on his leg again. This time, however, I felt something as his leg twitched and tensed a bit. There was no change in his face, though, which led me to observing the rest of his body.  

He was stiff, and if it wasn’t for his need to breathe, one might have mistaken him for a statue. This made it clear that he did feel my tail, but the reaction itself was still a mystery to me. Was it a rejection? Did he not like it? Was this going too far? I just wish that I knew more about human reactions to romantic advances. One movie was not going to cut it right now! 

I was committed, though; too far in to simply stop and pretend that nothing was happening. This was getting his attention, and that in and of itself was a victory. All I needed to do was continue to test his reaction and see what came of it while hopefully not overstepping any boundaries. 

My gentle teasing of his thigh continued, and all the while George acted as if the movie had suddenly become the most interesting thing in the world to him. During all this time I had been attempting to puzzle out if his reaction was positive or negative. It would have been easy to figure out if I asked him, but I wasn’t nearly brave enough to attempt such a thing as even this was stretching the limits of my determination. I felt that I was orange enough that I could probably glow in the dark.  

Things weren’t moving very fast, and the impatient flame in my chest was roaring for me to make another move. The most I could do to appease it was to move just a little closer to him as slowly and subtly as possible. I thought I saw his eye flick toward me, but the movement was so fast I could not tell for sure. My tail found its way behind him this time, not so close as to be considered hugging him, but close enough where it could touch his hip on the opposite side from me. This finally got a tangible reaction from him that I could see as his ears noticeably bloomed, though his face was as stony as ever. 

*Blooming is positive, right? It has to be! Yes! Yes, I can work with this. I just hope that George understands what I’m doing, and that I keep the drive to continue.*

Trading Stocks Based on Market Momentum: Strategies for Success
---------------------------------------------------------------

Trading stocks based on market momentum can be a powerful strategy for investors seeking to optimize their returns. Momentum trading hinges on the idea that stocks which have performed well in the recent past are likely to continue performing well in the near future. Conversely, those that have underperformed are expected to continue their downward trend. Implementing this strategy involves a few essential principles that every investor should understand.

### Understanding Market Momentum

Market momentum reflects the velocity of price movements. In simple terms, when the price of a stock moves sharply upwards, it is said to have positive momentum. Conversely, a stock trending downwards exhibits negative momentum. Recognizing these trends allows you to identify profitable trading opportunities.

### Key Indicators to Analyze

For effective momentum trading, utilize the following indicators:

- **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** This measures the speed and change of price movements. An RSI above 70 indicates that a stock may be overbought (positive momentum), while below 30 suggests it may be oversold (negative momentum).
- **Moving Averages:** The 50-day and 200-day moving averages help smooth out price data to highlight longer-term trends. A stock crossing above its moving average can signal strong momentum.
- **Volume Analysis:** Increased trading volume often accompanies price changes, confirming momentum. A price rise along with higher volume suggests strength in the move.

### Developing Your Trading Strategy

Your approach to trading stocks should be structured yet flexible. Here are steps to help you create an effective momentum-based trading strategy:

1. **Screen for Potential Stocks:** Use stock screening tools to filter stocks that have demonstrated significant price movements over a defined time frame, such as the last three or six months.
2. **Analyze Indicator Signals:** After identifying stocks, apply your technical indicators (like RSI and moving averages) to assess whether the stock is in a strong uptrend or downtrend.
3. **Set Entry and Exit Points:** Plan your entry point, ideally when the stock shows strong momentum. Determine exit points based on profit targets or stop-loss levels to manage your risk.

### The Role of Risk Management

No trading strategy is complete without a solid risk management plan. It’s crucial to protect your capital while trading stocks based on market momentum. Here are important practices:

- **Diversification:** Spread your investments across different stocks or sectors to minimize the impact of a downturn in any single stock.
- **Limit Orders:** Use limit orders to control the price at which your trades execute, helping you avoid unfavorable price movements.
- **Position Sizing:** Determine how much of your total capital you are willing to risk on a single trade. This helps manage potential losses without jeopardizing your entire portfolio.

### Monitoring Market News and Events

Market sentiment can impact momentum significantly. Stay updated on news related to the stocks you are trading. Earnings announcements, partnerships, and macroeconomic news can either bolster or hinder momentum. Always consider how external factors may influence the prices of the stocks you are assessing.

### The Importance of Patience

Momentum trading requires both skill and patience. It’s essential to avoid reacting impulsively to every price movement. Sometimes, taking a step back can provide clarity. Trust your analysis and the strategies you’ve put in place.

The principles of trading stocks based on market momentum into your investment strategy can significantly enhance your potential for success. By understanding the indicators, developing a solid strategy, practicing sound risk management, staying informed, and maintaining patience, you set yourself up for a rewarding trading experience. As always, consider starting small and gradually scaling up your trades as you gain more confidence and understanding in this trading approach.

Understanding How Market Trends Influence Stock Trading Decisions
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Understanding market trends is essential for anyone looking to trade stocks. Investors often seek patterns to guide their trading decisions. Market trends provide insights into where prices may move in the future. By focusing on these trends, you can make more informed choices in your stock trading strategy.

### What Are Market Trends?

Market trends are the general direction in which prices move over a certain period. These trends can be classified into three main categories:

- **Uptrends:** Characterized by rising prices, indicating increasing investor confidence.
- **Downtrends:** Marked by falling prices, suggesting that investors may be losing confidence.
- **Sideways Trends:** Occur when prices move within a range, indicating market indecision.

Each of these trends can significantly impact your trading decisions, helping you determine when to buy or sell stocks based on market momentum.

### The Role of Momentum in Trading

Momentum refers to the tendency of a stock's price to continue moving in the same direction. This principle can be easy to understand. If a stock has been increasing in price, it may continue to do so for a period due to investor enthusiasm. Conversely, if it has been declining, it may keep falling as others sell off their shares.

Traders often look for stocks with strong momentum to capitalize on quick price movements. Here are some strategies to consider:

- **Identify key indicators:** Use momentum indicators like the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) or the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to gauge strength.
- **Follow volume changes:** Increasing trading volume can confirm a price trend. If stock prices rise with higher volume, it often indicates strong buying interest.
- **Set clear entry and exit points:** Define your entry and exit strategies before making trades. This helps you avoid emotional decision-making.

### How Trends Influence Your Trading Decisions

Market trends not only impact individual stocks but also influence overall trading strategies. Understanding how to read these trends can enhance your trading effectiveness significantly. Here’s how you can use trends to your advantage:

- **Trend following:** Many traders use trend-following strategies, buying stocks in an uptrend and selling those in a downtrend. This method can be effective during strong market movements.
- **Pivot points:** Identifying pivot points—where price trends may reverse—can offer excellent buying or selling opportunities.
- **Market sentiment:** Pay attention to the news and market sentiment. A positive outlook on the economy can boost momentum, while negative news can quickly change a trend.

### Managing Risk with Trend Analysis

Trading based on momentum and market trends carries risks. Here are some ways to manage these risks effectively:

- **Stop-loss orders:** Use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Setting a stop-loss order helps protect your investment if a trend suddenly reverses.
- **Diversification:** Spread your investments across different sectors or asset classes. This reduces risk, as not all assets will be impacted by market trends in the same way.
- **Stay updated:** Regularly review market conditions and adjust your trading strategies accordingly. Being proactive can help you react swiftly to unexpected changes.

Understanding market trends and their influence on stock movements is crucial for traders. By focusing on momentum and analyzing key indicators, you can make more informed trading decisions. Just remember to manage your risks, stay disciplined, and keep learning as you go. Trading stocks based on market momentum can be rewarding when approached with the right knowledge and strategies.

### Conclusion

Trading stocks based on market momentum can be a game-changer for many investors. By mastering the art of recognizing trends and their influence on stock prices, you can make informed trading decisions that maximize your potential for profit. Embracing strategies such as identifying momentum stocks, utilizing technical indicators, and understanding the psychology behind market movements are all keys to unlocking the power of momentum trading.

It's important to keep a close eye on the broader market trends and the factors that drive them, including economic news, earnings reports, and geopolitical events. By staying updated on these influences, you can adapt your trading approach and improve your timing in the market. Remember, successful trading is not just about making quick gains; it’s about developing a strategy that works for you over the long run.

Engaging with other traders, studying market patterns, and continuously honing your skills will only enhance your ability to trade stocks based on market momentum effectively. While the stock market can sometimes be unpredictable, those who understand and leverage momentum can turn challenges into opportunities. Embrace the insights shared in this article to navigate your trading journey with confidence. You have the tools and knowledge to succeed, so start applying them and watch your trading efforts thrive.

The Æ Phenomenon And Its Contextual Influences On Public Perception,GrimesAE,1i9sdcp,2025-01-25 12:41:56,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrimesAE/comments/1i9sdcp/the_æ_phenomenon_and_its_contextual_influences_on/,devastation-nation,,"White Paper: The Æ Phenomenon and Its Contextual Influences on Public Perception

Executive Summary

This white paper explores the complex controversy surrounding the public figure Grimes, focusing on her engagement with individuals, movements, and ideologies associated with far-right, racist, and technophilic beliefs. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the implications of these associations, offering context to the accusations made against Grimes, and examining the broader societal and political dynamics at play. Grimes has faced accusations of being involved in or supporting problematic ideologies, including white supremacy, eugenics, and other forms of discriminatory rhetoric. This white paper seeks to understand these accusations by detailing key connections, dog whistles, and actions associated with her public persona.

1. Introduction: Understanding the Divide

Grimes, a musician and artist, has recently been the subject of intense scrutiny regarding her social media interactions, public statements, and affiliations with controversial figures. The debate surrounding whether Grimes is merely tone-deaf or intentionally engaging with problematic individuals is central to this controversy. A deeper understanding of the ideologies she has interacted with reveals disturbing patterns of behavior that go beyond simple miscommunication.

Many individuals—especially those within neurodivergent communities—may dismiss these issues as misunderstandings or incidents of tone-deafness. However, closer inspection reveals that Grimes has consistently interacted with and supported figures who are outspoken proponents of racist, sexist, and supremacist ideologies. This raises the question: is Grimes unintentionally complicit, or is she deliberately aligning herself with these movements?

2. Key Individuals and Movements in Grimes’ Social Circle

Grimes’ affiliations with certain individuals and organizations have become a focal point of the controversy. These connections include far-right extremists, white nationalists, and eugenicists, whose views directly contradict Grimes’ public persona as a progressive artist.

2.1 Spergler Acolyte

Grimes’ connection to the account of Spergler, a notorious figure in far-right circles, is a pivotal aspect of the debate. Spergler’s account is infamous for promoting misogynistic, pedophilic, and racist rhetoric. Grimes’ decision to follow Spergler, and later re-follow him after accusations surfaced, indicates a disturbing lack of awareness or intentional engagement with this ideology.

2.2 Razib Khan

Razib Khan, a controversial figure known for his racial science beliefs, has been another point of contention. Khan has publicly espoused views that dehumanize non-white individuals, and his association with Grimes raises questions about her awareness of his problematic views. Khan’s history of working with known white nationalist Richard Spencer further complicates Grimes’ relationships with figures advocating for racial hierarchies.

2.3 Curtis Yarvin and Technophilic Eugenics

Grimes’ admiration for Curtis Yarvin, a proponent of white supremacy and eugenics, is particularly troubling. Yarvin has expressed beliefs in racial superiority, and his writings advocate for governance by AI, with Elon Musk positioned as a central figure. Grimes’ participation in Yarvin’s circles, including attending his birthday party, signals her endorsement of his extremist views. The song “We Appreciate Power,” often interpreted as a nod to AI-driven technocracy, is seen by critics as a thinly veiled propaganda piece promoting these dangerous ideologies.

3. The Role of Eugenics and Technophilic Movements

Grimes’ involvement with eugenics and pro-natalist movements further exacerbates her ties to problematic ideologies. The collaboration between Grimes and figures like Elon Musk and the Collinses—who advocate for a genetically “superior” race—reflects a broader cultural trend toward technophilic and accelerationist thinking.

3.1 The Mission and Mars Colonization

At the heart of these movements is the so-called “Mission” to colonize Mars with genetically selected individuals. Grimes’ public endorsement of this initiative, coupled with her increasing involvement with Musk’s pro-natalist rhetoric, suggests that she is complicit in promoting these exclusionary ideologies. Her desire to be a central figure in this movement, as evidenced by her comparison to Lady Jessica from “Dune,” reflects a disturbing vision of elite reproduction and control over future generations.

3.2 White Supremacist Narratives

The “Great Replacement” conspiracy theory, which posits that white people are being displaced by non-white populations, is another key element of Grimes’ associations. This theory is heavily promoted by far-right extremists, and Grimes’ comments on race, coupled with her support for individuals advocating these views, align her with these dangerous narratives.

4. Dog Whistles and Far-Right Lexicon

Grimes’ use of language, both in her social media posts and music, has raised alarms among those familiar with far-right dog whistles. Phrases such as “men and females” instead of “men and women” and references to “Lebensraum” (living space) are clear indicators of her engagement with far-right ideologies. These linguistic choices, often dismissed by the uninitiated, are deeply embedded in the lexicon of white supremacy and serve as subtle signals to those in the know.

5. The Impact of Grimes’ Actions and Public Persona

Grimes’ public persona, once associated with progressive and creative expression, has become increasingly entwined with controversial and extremist ideologies. The significance of her actions cannot be understated, as her platform provides her with the ability to influence her large and impressionable fanbase.

5.1 Normalizing Extremist Views

By aligning herself with individuals who espouse racist, misogynistic, and supremacist ideologies, Grimes risks normalizing these views for her followers. Her participation in events such as the Palladium party, which was organized by neo-Nazi activist Jonah Bennett, signals a tacit endorsement of his beliefs. Additionally, her support for eugenics and technophilic pronatalism positions her as a central figure in the growing movement of accelerationism and AI-driven governance.

6. Conclusion: The Importance of Context in Public Scrutiny

Grimes’ actions and affiliations cannot be viewed in isolation. Context is crucial when evaluating her public behavior and statements. While some may argue that Grimes is merely a product of her associations, the repeated and deliberate nature of her actions suggests that she is complicit in promoting harmful ideologies.

The controversy surrounding Grimes serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilance in public discourse. In an age where online interactions and affiliations are easily manipulated, understanding the underlying ideologies at play is crucial. The Æ phenomenon, in this context, serves as a case study in how public figures navigate and sometimes inadvertently contribute to the normalization of extremist beliefs.

By examining the connections, language, and ideologies associated with Grimes, we gain a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding her public image and the potential consequences of her associations. Moving forward, it is imperative that we engage in critical discussions about the influence of public figures on societal narratives and the potential risks posed by the normalization of extremist ideologies."

Does anyone use a combat tug?,Cosmoteer,1i9s980,2025-01-25 12:36:50,6,0.88,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmoteer/comments/1i9s980/does_anyone_use_a_combat_tug/,CycleZestyclose1907,,"So this idea was inspired by the rumor that we might get docking ports in the future. Basically, I was imagining being able to build modular ships that could reconfigure itself based  on what enemy the player was facing. Like switching from a ""hugging"" strategy to a kiting strategy just by being able to turn the main engines around.

And then I realized that this could theoretically be done in the current game using tractor beams.  Basically, built a tug that's almost all MRTs and Tractor beams (maybe with some PD too) and have them move the main combat ship a round. With movement outsourced to one or more support ships, the main combat ship can devote more tonnage and space to weapons and armor/shields with the only thrusters it needs are to turn in place.

The problem is that  my experience  with Sundivers is that tractor beams have a limit on how fast they can move things, and you'll need a lot to move a max sized combat ship. And since you need 5 diamonds per tractor beam, carrying too many  could result the tug being more expensive (and thus a higher target priority for enemies) than the combat ship.

Anyone have thoughts on using combat tugs?

Edit: I have since designed a combat tug and tested it out.

I finally isolated the issue down to the Y stepper motor.  If the machine is turned off I can move the bed back and forth with no issues.  If the machine is turned on the stepper motor wants to lock in place if i try to move the bed and when you tell the machine to move it you get the awful grinding noise.  I tried to start a print and got horrible layer shift as the bed struggled to move. What sort of things can i try, or am i looking at a replacement motor?"
[REQUEST][STEAM] Neon White (50% off)($12.49),GiftofGames,1i9s5g3,2025-01-25 12:32:20,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/1i9s5g3/requeststeam_neon_white_50_off1249/,Xengal4,REQUEST,"Hello everybody, I am here today requesting a game called Neon White. It is a fast action fps game that has many movement and parkour mechanics. I am a major fan of these types of games. I really enjoy playing ULTRAKILL because of those reasons. I am also a fan of Machine Girl, which the game just so happens to feature their music. 

The game has a speedrun like feel to it with you trying to get through a level quickly while also exterminating demons from heaven. It has a story that although fans are split on, I have a feeling I will enjoy. The game makes you strategize with what cards/weapons/moves you're gonna use and when you're gonna use them since the uses for each one is limited.

People that have played ULTRAKILL also recommend the game because of the similarities however the games are also very different. The movement is different with ULTRAKILL giving you mechanics and letting you figure out different combos with them. Neon White however, gives you a lot of other ways to move around with many moves being limited to what cards you're holding and what is around you.

The game also doesn't use up that many resources meaning that a laptop like mine can run it without issues. The game is also 50% off making this a great opportunity to get it. I would really appreciate if someone would be able to get it for me. Even if you don't get it for me I would like to say thank you for reading this and have a great day.

I've been intentionally moving and doing mild aerobic exercise for a bit again now, but when I go to look at free tools and wikis to plan something more in-depth involving strength training they all hammer on about having a weight loss goal. I am overweight (5'6"", 220lbs) but overall comfortable with my body and don't really care about losing weight. I just want to be more active, have more endurance, and gain the mental health benefits.

How integral are your black-and-white goals like weight loss in lbs to your fitness routines? What small ways did you add more movement to your life?

A Vintage Gamer's Retrospective,retrogaming,1i9s0xn,2025-01-25 12:27:03,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1i9s0xn/a_vintage_gamers_retrospective/,Bad_Edit,[Article],"This is actually a celebration of the limitations of a bygone era of video games. 
A reminder to never take your next video game or console for granted and demonstrate healthy criticism when things arent perfect.
Pretty much everything you know as a video game today is different to how it was in the beginning besides the single fact a video game is entertaining you.

Consoles or computers were bought to compliment the TV you already owned but now someone will buy a new TV to get the best out of a console.

When i say 'the beginning' i can only talk about my own experiences with video gaming. At 45 years old, and one of a dying breed (almost quite literally) i think I'm somewhat an advocate of the past when it comes to our beloved hobby.

Our interest was born in the mid/late 80s, parents were being drilled with the prospect and eventuality that computers were going to be a staple in their kids lives but along with this came a hefty pricetag that my folks couldn't afford, however we had a family friend who was willing to trade a Commodore 64 (breadbin) for all of our now unwanted Lego.
My bro and i had moved onto G.I Joes and Transformers and now our eyes were set on gaming even though the Commodores purpose as far as our parents were concerned was a tool for learning.

Ofcourse without guidance nor the time it took to teach 'code' without any experience themselves, long story short, our parents conceded to us the use of our new gadget as a means of entertainment, which i think benefited them equally in the end, especially when being grounded was no longer a threat, they knew to throw in the ""no computer"" stipulation so if we wasn't going to be good, we had to be good at it!

By my previous paragraph, if it wasnt already obvious my bro and i fell in love with this new device, and so began our new hobby and all the things that came with it.
Whether that be conversation with like minded friends, the lending and sharing of games and gaming sessions in general or even sometimes tell tale signs of a competitive nature that would later be coined as the ""Console Wars"".
Yes they were a thing even before consoles were the dominant force here in the UK, but that could be a story for another time.

We had just moved to a bigger house and while my brother and i were still young enough to share the same bedroom we set the box room up to play our computer games there, we never had a lot of money as a family so we felt extremely privileged to take advantage of the fact a new colour TV downstairs meant we could keep the 12"" black and white one upstairs for our computer games. 
Mystically, we saw all the colours of the rainbow.
 

PRESS PLAY_

The games were predominantly on cassette tapes, so you would be required to enter a command using the keyboard before pressing ""PLAY"" on the cassette player, I've recently found that a harder thing to explain to people than it once was, as the younger generation have no comprehension of what playing music from a cassette tape is like.
It wasnt automatic like it is the modern age, cartridges and CD's or digital software is ready to go, plug and play if you like but back then we had to tell the C64 what we were doing, almost like asking for permission to use it which sounds ridiculous but less so if you're familiar with the term ""SYNTAX ERROR"".
That was basically you being told you're not allowed to play until you've done your chores, it seemed.

Regardless of this, just because you've pressed 'PLAY' that didnt mean you were ready for any such thing.


NOW LOADING_

Yeh this one has made a comeback, many will be familiar with waiting a few short moments before they can carry on where they left off (we'll get to that later) but when i was a kid? Loading times seemed to last an eternity, even more so for a child whose perception of time was stretched.
A 'quick blast while you wait' didn't exist, more like 'wait a while for a quick blast' as games were considerably shorter many moons ago. (More on that later too)
I think a special mention needs to go out to all the games out there that decided not to load afterall, but there wasn't always a sign the load sequence had failed, the TV told you it was loading, the cassette counter would carry on ticking over and although the noises coming from the TV would worry you now, it was a good sign in those days!
The game could fail like this multiple times before deciding you were finally worthy of it.
Maybe it was sick of you literally winding it up, so now it was our turn to be wound up!
At times you may have a larger game, more recently some may remember having to swap out discs to continue playing, in a scenario like this we would have to turn over the cassette tape, rewind it and press play on the analogue tape deck while another portion of the game loaded.
As long as the game appeared to be loading ok, this wasn't a big deal, you were just happy it was working.

However we were blessed in these 'simpler' more complicated times..


PRESS STOP!_

Quite often as your game was loading you would be serenaded with the somewhat sophisticated sound of 'basic' chip tunes, accompanying an image slowly generated akin to a printer creating an picture on your TV usually of the title card while you waited.
If you were lucky there was sometimes a mini game to play thrown in to keep the boredom at bay, i believe it was Ghostbusters that had Space Invaders available during the loading sequence, it didn't take an 80's child genius to know this minigame was better than the title game and upon pressing 'STOP' you would discover that this little gem was still completely playable while abruptly aborting the title game with no remorse. 
It's MY hobby..
These little gameplay 'demos' were few and far between though, and im not sure there was ever any mention of them in the manual, just a free surprise game, no hype.

Additionally, as great as the music could be from these machines we also had to endure quite crass sound effects, not to mention a thing called 'digitised speech' which were very short bursts of a sampled voice effect that probably used up way too much data than it was worth and sounded a lot like a plastic bag being turned inside out, if you could 'see' digitised speech, television static would be the visual equivalent.
But somehow we still understood it, and the implications of hearing any kind of human voice in a video game was mind-blowing having the capability of raising a review score on the basis of technical prowess alone.
All of this was very much of its time and carried the weight of belonging to a single generation in an era that would only have been accepted by the 80's child.
Our immediate ancestors were the living stereotype this industry was once synonymous with and now ashamed of.
We were neither nerds nor jocks, neither were we noobs or hardcore gamers, we were the center of attention and so was our hobby, we adopted eachother and built the very foundation that would go on to rule the entertainment world, and even as 7 year old kids, we knew it would.
The fine line between complex technical wizardry and a child's play thing had truly been blurred.


ALWAYS READ THE MANUAL_

Stuff that! As a 7 year old boy I've waited a good fraction of my life waiting for this game to load so i can play it, and also as a 7 year old boy i think i already know it all!
But we're all well aware about the lack of manuals in video game boxes these days and some of us being fonder of them than others.
As an older kid, buying a brand new video game or even renting one from the stores would have you poring over the manual on the walk back home, we'll never forget the smell of a fresh instruction booklet and we'll forever be thankful to the universe for never raining on this journey home, like, ever.


HIT FIRE!_

Yes, 'hit fire' indeed.
Translated from Ye Olde Book of Bytes this simply means 'Press Start'.
Ofcourse there were no 'start' buttons on your joystick, just a single button replicated numerous times across your means of control with sometimes one of the buttons being a dummy for aesthetic purposes but usually all placed in symmetry meaning whether you were left or right handed you had a fair crack of the whip, was this a thoughtful inclusion? We will never know, there is a modern day equivalent in the Wiimote, but again im thinking this benefit was purely by default.

Anyway! Finally, this is the first chance to use the controller as up until this point it has been redundant and i swear pratting about with it any sooner sometimes interferred with the loading and could cause the game to crash (a paranoid fantasy that has stuck with me to this day) once this was suspected, we would stick the joystick waaay over there until it was necessary to hold it.
When your game was ready to play you'd sit holding your joystick at the base or stuck it to the table via its four suction caps on the underside, gripping the stick and trigger buttons like an ace fighter pilot.
In practice it was always more comfortable to use the base buttons as opposed to pulling the trigger button, but boy how i so wished that was different back then.
We couldn't enjoy ourselves too much however, i lost count the amount of times my dad would have to disassemble the joystick and solder together the little metal pins or connectors that maintained movement of your sprite.
At some point we did discover that the controller ports on the C64 were the same as Sega consoles and those pads worked fine, yes this was a day and age where proprietary compatibility was only a problem when somebody made it one!


THE GAMES_

We were peers. The industry was around the same age as its demographic and just like a kid seeking acceptance our games strived for validation.
The technology was in its infancy by todays standards but the understanding of what could be considered cool or adult orientated was always there, so we were lured in the same as anyone would be today. 

Robocop by Ocean hit the mark for us as we had seen the movie before we hit double digits and it blew our minds, the game resembled it as best as it could and we wasn't naive to the facts but its all we had, hell it was all there was! 
If only it was as good as the Data East arcade game, but once again i suppose that's a story for another time.
It was one of the games that could've done with a modern day patch or update as a later level was so buggy it was practically impossible to beat, thanks to Youtube i was pleasantly surprised to discover later on in life that every single copy of the game was broken. 
And thats the way it was, no patches, no dlc, no tweets and no means of immediate action to complain about it, an old-fashioned case of 'shut up n put up'.

There was no such thing as saving your progress, granted the games were considerably shorter but the idea of playing a game to progress was a different task all together as each time you turned on your system you would start from scratch, turning off your system may aswell have been a factory reset.
This meant that you would get good, a common phrase thrown about to cheaply now but bares no comparison to titles of yesteryear that required a perfect run start to finish to complete a game.
The predetermined algorithm in which enemies attack, levels scroll and items appeared left little margin for error as you remembered more patterns than your grandma could knit.
I'm not sure exactly when passwords became a thing but the idea of using a 34 digit code to jump to the last level always felt uninspired to me.


'POKES' AND CHEATS_

As old as gaming itself discovering a way to enter a cheat code while the game was paused or during a specific point at the title screen would allow you make the game easier.
I don't recall any 'options' in earlier games, no easy setting or a way to increase your lives but you may have been lucky enough to hear of a 'poke' that would help drastically change your performance ingame. 
To be honest, to see the game bend to your will with these newly found powers was something to behold, it felt like you were breaking the law with zero repercussions, you could be invincible, invisible or float over entire levels, i think the modern day equivalent to these would be considered mods, something the PC community would know all about.
At a later stage a way to cheat became a commodity as various companies would produce peripherals designed to aid you do this very thing, but paying to cheat at the cost of a game wasn't an option for me, nor did i care to spoil the design of the games i loved so much, i suppose in essence there is similarities with these devices and today's format of 'pay to win'.


PHYSICAL INTERNET MONTHLY = 75P_

The games weren't the only thing our hobby was built on. 
Each month various magazines were published dedicated to computer games with various features still covered today by other means whether they be reviews, tips, game maps, interviews, a letters page, computer game related artwork and ofcourse, adverts...
This was our way of gathering information, you wasn't drip fed news on a daily basis on command, we had to anticipate the next issue of our chosen magazine released monthly but if you couldn't afford to you'd borrow your friends copy. 
To put this in perspective, imagine only being able to check the Internet for limited gaming news 12 time's per year, no matter how cheap.
Sometimes there were demo cassettes on the front cover at no extra cost, they just wanted you to buy their publication.
At times like these you would've thought there were no such thing as leaks, but i can think of one example where somebody messed up big time! On the 'B side' of a demo cassette freebie somebody had released an entire copy of their next AAA release without realising, i wish i could remember the game and magazine in question (I'm going to say Indiana Jones?) I think that may have even sank the studio but my memory fails me this time. 
There was nothing quite like the news of an upgrade splashed across the cover of your newest issue, once again the rain holding fire as we made that trek home.

I glad we had the rawness of imperfection, there was so much room for improvement, the Atari ST and Amiga were living proof of it. 
That was to be our next step...


PRESS START!_

But it was never to be, as the dawn of the console had crept upon us. 
A machine created soley for the purpose of playing video games, there was no keyboard, no budget games, no freebies, no loading times, more power, more expense, more quality, more action!

We knew it was coming but it happened so fast...
Even when our perception of time was so stretched...
One evening we turned off our computer not realising it was for the last time. 
We were so busy saying hello to a new wave of fun we didnt even look back to wave goodbye. 
We literally traded our past lives for a new one, ignorant to the fact it was the end of an era. 
Unfortunately, unlike the counter on that hearing aid beige tape deck bless it, you can't just press 'REWIND' and watch the numbers dial back.

I liken this to all the new residential estates being put up around our once rural area, we'd play on the building sites and praise having something to do other than hiking through cowpat ridden fields, playing 'kick the can' or 'Run-outs' and picking wild blackberries for Mum. 
Was it all a dream?


GAMEOVER_

There would eventually come a time when our games wouldn't get chewed up (another saying some younger people wouldn't understand) and the blowing into a cartridge ceased.
But will we one day sooner than we'd like to, perhaps be reminiscing of wiping the smears from a disc or checkin for scratches to reassure ourselves the game was fine only to realise that the simplest and most logical explanation must be that the universe has come to collect the dues it saved all those years ago for a rainy day?

Trump signs anti-abortion policies after speaking to March for Life,centrist,1i9rzlc,2025-01-25 12:25:22,23,0.81,18,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/24/trump-issues-executive-orders-reviving-anti-abortion-policies-00200212,therosx,US News,"President Donald Trump’s campaign-trail promise to leave abortion regulation to the states lasted just a few days into his presidency.

https://www.politico.com/newsletters/west-wing-playbook/2025/01/15/trump-cant-leave-abortion-to-the-states-00198487

He issued executive orders on Friday that revive some anti-abortion policies from his first administration — including restrictions on federal funding for family planning and other health programs abroad that discuss abortion as an option or provide referrals for the procedure.

The president signed the executive orders hours after addressing the annual anti-abortion March for Life in a prerecorded video that included no mention that the policies were coming, provoking frustration from some of his supporters who feared the issue would not be a priority to the new administration. Vice President JD Vance, who spoke at the march in person, similarly did not mention them or other policy promises, but assured the crowd that Trump would be “the most pro-family, most pro-life American president of our lifetimes.”

The orders will likely go a long way to calm fears in the anti-abortion movement about Trump’s commitment to their cause — fears he recently fanned by not taking these actions in his first couple days in office and by nominating Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a onetime supporter of abortion rights, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.

Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, called the executive orders “a big win for babies and mothers.”

“With this action the president is getting American taxpayers out of the abortion business and restoring sanity to the federal government,” she said.

The programs impacted by the executive orders — which were first reported by RealClearPolitics — include overseas health organizations that distribute contraception and help combat HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Grantees were already barred from using any U.S. taxpayer money for abortions, but sometimes used separate funding to provide them.

One of the executive orders repeals a pair of Biden administration orders from the last few years that encouraged government agencies to look for ways “to protect and expand access to abortion care, including medication abortion” as well as “the full range of reproductive healthcare services,” including birth control and emergency contraception. The order argues that it will ensure enforcement of the Hyde amendment — a decades-old budget rider that bars any federal funding of abortion.

The other executive order Trump signed Friday reinstates the so-called Mexico City Policy — named for the city where it was first announced — restricting foreign organizations receiving U.S. global health funding from providing and promoting abortion with other sources of financing.

In doing so, Trump is following a tradition for Republican presidents Ronald Reagan started in 1984. Democratic presidents have rescinded the policy.

The Trump administration renamed it “Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance” during his first term.

A 2022 study by The National Academy of Sciences estimated that Trump’s anti-abortion restrictions on foreign aid led to 108,000 deaths of women and children in poor countries over the four years of his first administration. That’s because it slashed funding for groups like the nonprofit MSI Reproductive Choices, which operates clinics that provide contraception and testing for sexually transmitted infections with U.S. funds and uses separate revenue streams to provide abortions.

MSI said ahead of the policy being reinstated that it wouldn’t abide by it. This will lead to the organization losing $14 million in U.S. Agency for International Development funding, an MSI spokesperson said. The organization estimates the financial loss could result in an additional 2.4 million unintended pregnancies because it would have to stop providing contraception in several countries.

Another study by Stanford University researchers found that the narrower version of the Mexico City policy that several GOP presidents enacted prior to Trump caused the number of abortions to increase across sub-Saharan Africa because so many women lost access to contraception.

Abortion-rights advocates have also argued that the policy is overbroad because it imposes restrictions in countries where abortion is legal.

“The imposition of the U.S. policy is really driven by an anti-abortion ideology that is designed to both disrupt and coerce other countries’ health systems and civil societies into restricting the health and rights of people around the world,” said Elizabeth Sully, principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research and advocacy group.

International abortion-rights advocates worried that Trump would further extend the policy to organizations receiving any type of U.S. foreign assistance, including humanitarian aid — a policy the Heritage Foundation recommended in its Project 2025 blueprint for a second Trump term. Trump’s executive order does not do that.

The order also directs the secretary of State “to take all necessary actions, to the extent permitted by law, to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars do not fund organizations or programs that support or participate in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.”

The order came on the same day that Secretary of State Marco Rubio directed the U.S. Mission to the United Nations to rejoin the Geneva Consensus Declaration, an international anti-abortion pact signed during Trump’s first term.

One day earlier, in another move that thrilled abortion opponents, Trump issued pardons for roughly two dozen people convicted of forcibly entering and blocking access to abortion clinics.

Still, the anti-abortion groups that helped Trump win reelection are looking beyond these actions and are pushing for more from the new administration, including a ban on telehealth prescription and mail delivery of abortion pills, rules forcing states to provide more detailed information on all abortions within their borders, and the repeal of Biden administration rules that expanded abortion access for some military members and veterans.

Kristi Hamrick, the vice president of media and policy with Students for Life of America, called the Mexico City policy “low-hanging fruit.”

“I don’t feel like we should have to beg the administration to do things which are in line with their stated goal of cutting back on federal engagement,” she said, adding that both policies got the government out of abortion. “We’re really looking for newer things, bigger things.”"
