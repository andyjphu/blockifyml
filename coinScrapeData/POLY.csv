Navigating Non ENM Friends,EthicalNonMonogamy,1i9p2oz,2025-01-25 10:17:06,0,0.5,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/EthicalNonMonogamy/comments/1i9p2oz/navigating_non_enm_friends/,sekretoctober,Personal story,"My wife and I have a group of friends, consisting of 5-6 couples, in our city who are not ENM or Poly and would probably not react well to learning my wife and I were. 

I love these friends and I’m not interested in being part of a “Kitchen Table” Poly social network.  Just isn’t my jam. And I’m getting older and don’t want to start over with friendships. 

Also- I am only interested in sex or FWBs with partners. And many of my partners are in other towns because I travel for work.  Whereas my wife dates exclusively in our city and is more into actual relationships and falls more into classic Polyamory traits.   

The other night my wife was on a date and one of those couples we know was in the same restaurant. The restaurant is super small, one room, and it’s highly unlikely that my wife wasn’t observed.  My wife didn’t notice them until they got up to leave and no words were exchanged.  My wife said that her partner and her were behaving amorously.  Holding hands or otherwise showing signs they weren’t platonic friends. 

So..we are kind of waiting for the reaction or result, if there is one. My wife is trying to be strong and say “This is who I am and if they reject us then they aren’t friends.”   For me, it’s not as easy.  

My wife and I opened our marriage from 2018- 2020 and then closed it back up.  We closed it because of Covid but then found we preferred monogamy.  We only opened it again in the fall of 2024 because my wife’s sex drive changed after menopause and I needed to have way more sex.  But I’m not sure how sold long term we are, on ENM.

The friendships are worth more to me, because they are 10+ years old and more “stable” than an experimental relationship model.   We are in our fifties and keeping friends matters to me.  
Not that I disagree with my wife.  We also want to be confident and non dramatic if we get asked any questions. 

We aren’t going to pro-actively say anything because we don’t want to come across defensive or create drama that doesn’t need to occur. We will just go on about our lives and if we get asked anything, we will deal with it then.  It’s likely nothing will change. 

But I am curious if anyone reading this has had a similar experience?"

Bluetooth Thermometers dropped and can't reconnect,homeassistant,1i96zl2,2025-01-24 16:49:11,0,0.5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1i96zl2/bluetooth_thermometers_dropped_and_cant_reconnect/,Teter09,,"I have 3 Govee H5100 Thermometers I've used around my house for quite a while. I replaced the batteries because I noticed the one in my office dropped. Then I realized it wouldn't reconnect which led me to find all 3 of them stopped sending data on November 26th. I tried deleting them in order to add them again, but now I just get this pop up message: 

# Govee Bluetooth

No devices found on the network

  
My old router had been acting up so mid/late November is around the time I started moving things (like my Home Assistant server) over to my new Opnsense router with access points with VLANs. HA server uses an ethernet connection and on the LAN network (192.168.10.x), while the Bluetooth Proxies are connected to a wifi VLAN (192.168.40.X)  I have bluetooth proxies set up through ESPhome, but I'm not sure exactly where to start troubleshooting. I have backups for 30 days, not far enough back to check what might have been updated back then to cause them to drop. 

  
I wondered if the devices went bad, so I checked the Govee app on my cellphone (it actually picks up the 2 closest ones). So it appears that the device is working, but it doesn't appear to be picked up by my proxies. I'll post the Configuration for the proxy that is sitting within 2 feet of the device, as well as the log once I enabled Verbose logging (something I saw on here). 

Any ideas or suggestions are welcome! The only odd thing I saw were the final 2 lines in the Proxy Log, something about a component taking too long?

SX Network is SX Bet’s L2 Rollup. It’s a pretty sweet integration, essentially allows users to:

* Bridge any of 20+ different tokens on Base (as well as ETH, Arb, Poly, and OP) and receive equivalent USDC on SX Network, gas-free and no fees, instantly
* Withdraw USDC on SX Network back to Base instantly, to any destination address. Super low fees.

As part of the same integration there is also now an on-ramp to fund from a Coinbase account. You can connect to your account through the portal on SX and use your balance to instantly fund your hot wallet with USDC on SX Network.

Definitely worth checking out if you’re a sports bettor. IMO this new integration puts their on/off ramp UX at minimum on par with, if not superior to Rollbit/Stake. Especially so when you consider that it's non-custodial, so you’re able to transact and deposit or withdraw as you please without fear of funds being held.

I’ve been a user of decentralized betting apps for the self-custody, transparency and better odds aspects for a while now, but the UX historically was a bit cumbersome if you’re weren't accustomed to web3. This should make it exponentially easier for anyone to use. Hoping they add cross-chain betting from Base soon too.

Here are my bets for the weekend if you want to check it out and tail me!

NTU ADM or Lasalle Bachelors/ suggestions what should I do?,SGExams,1i86rjb,2025-01-23 11:06:02,4,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1i86rjb/ntu_adm_or_lasalle_bachelors_suggestions_what/,DaMonehhLebowski,University :snoo_smile:,"Gonna graduate from poly film course, and trying to think what I should do. 

I came in to the poly film course after trying jc for a bit, not liking it, and then going ns first, then deciding I should go poly. So I didn’t have much experience at all when I came in, aside from exploring during ns and watching a tonne of movies which sparked my interest, and upon reflection it just felt right for me to pursue this. As I reflect, I did learn a lot, coming from a place where I didn’t even use consumer cameras all that much previously. Compared to me a lot of them got experience from ite film courses, and some got social media experience and stuff. So it felt like I was thrown into the ocean and had to swim, but my passion for movies sustained me for the three years despite some stress. But as I graduate, I feel like I’m now only at the level that some of the others were when they joined. On top of that, my slightly introverted nature, small age gap, and also that they are a bit more experienced than me, made it a bit hard to network with them also. Feels like I’m still the same person I was when I joined with just a passion for movies and that’s it. Like, I don’t really fully know/ came to a conclusion, what role within filmmaking I want to be in either. Although as I reflected at the back of my mind this past year, I feel like screenwriting and editing are something I might be more inclined in, as on-set stuff is quite chaotic for introvert me. Still a bit lost and deciding what to do.

So as someone who still feels like I need to be ‘moulded’ more, and maybe not ready to work yet, I was thinking I should just continue this line in uni. Been looking at Lasalle bachelors in film and NTU ADM. Maybe just gonna apply to both and see. But given my context, I felt I might be more suited for NTU. I think Lasalle is better objectively (more focused, more hands on, more international recognition, 3 years vs Ntu’s 4 with a common year) but maybe I will have a better experience and gain more from NTU? Because from what I see Lasalle, seems more cut throat, extroverted and competitive without much chances for introverts to get into student life also. Cause I see lasalle values portfolio for application a bit more, whereas NTU looks at your potential a bit more and accepts wider range of people. So I might be a bigger fish in NTU, rather than again being a small fish in a big pond in Lasalle as I was in poly, and feeling awkward/hard to interact and network or hop on their projects to learn. Some more the Lasalle students I saw walking around at open house got this punk/grunge style vibe haha ( I don’t mean that in a judgey way at all, just worried that later they are more experienced + I can’t fully vibe with them on top of that, means I’m gonna not be able to gain as much vs at NTU) 

How are NTU ADM and Lasalle Film BA like? Any thoughts or suggestions?"

Note that some of references cited have only tangential relation to the discussion. This is just how some Etherites' thining works: connecting the dots no ""sane"" person would think of.

**The Dynamic Science Paradigm of the Society of Ether**  
*A Treatise on Holistic Epistemology and Eccentric Praxis*  

---

### **Part I: Paradigm Proper—Philosophy of Radical Wonder**  

#### **1.1 The Etheric Substrate: Reality as Living Pattern-Space**  
The Etherite conception of reality emerges from a synthesis of marginalized scientific traditions and heterodox philosophies. At its foundation lies the **Ether**—not exactly the discredited 19th-century medium, but a dynamic quantum-plasmic substrate that permeates all existence; this Ether manifests as both physical field and metaphysical *prima materia*, echoing Walter Russell’s wave-based cosmology^[1], Wilhelm Reich’s orgonomic theories^[2], and the Aboriginal Australian concept of *Alcheringa*—the timeless *Everywhen* where patterns coalesce into tangible forms.

Etherites reject the Technocratic delusion of a clockwork universe. Instead, they posit reality as an infinite possibility-space where consciousness acts as a *pattern sculptor*.  Barbara McClintock’s discovery of transposable genetic elements^[3] —dismissed for decades as “jumping genes”—exemplifies this worldview: just as corn genomes reorganize under environmental stress, the Ether itself responds to observation, intention, and the pressure of anomalies. 

The Schumann resonances—7.83 Hz electromagnetic pulses between Earth and the ionosphere—are interpreted not merely as atmospheric phenomena but as neural oscillations of a planetary mind, a concept bridging Nikola Tesla’s resonant earth theories^[4] and Indigenous understandings of sacred landscapes^[5]; recent studies confirming that these resonances correlate with solar-geomagnetic activity (S-GMA), influencing biological systems through melatonin regulation and non-linear ionospheric interactions^[6].  

#### **1.2 Epistemology of the Outsider: Wonder as Methodological Imperative** 
 
Dynamic Science operates through what Terrence Howard terms “the algebra of truth”—a reconciliation of rigorous empiricism with radical intuition. Etherite epistemology draws equally from Alexander Grothendieck’s scheme theory (where mathematical objects exist as relationships rather than fixed entities)^[7], and the neurodivergent brilliance of William James Sidis, whose childhood work on four-dimensional geometry prefigured modern string theory^[8].

Key principles include:  

- **Consciousness-Entangled Observation**: Rejecting the myth of detached objectivity, Etherites embrace John Archibald Wheeler’s participatory universe, where measurement collapses not just quantum states but ontological possibilities^[9]. Chien-Shiung Wu’s meticulous parity violation experiments—conducted while male colleagues dismissed her as “the Dragon Lady”—demonstrate how observer identity shapes perceived reality^[10].
- **Anomaly-Driven Inquiry**: Thomas Gold’s “deep hot biosphere” theory, initially ridiculed but later vindicated by extremophile discoveries^[11], exemplifies Etherite praxis: following empirical breadcrumbs into heretical territories. Viktor Schauberger’s observation of trout motion in Alpine streams led to implosion technologies that defied Bernoulli’s equations, emphasizing pattern recognition over reductionism^[12].  
- **Multiplicity of Truths**: Etherite theories resemble Ruth Benedict’s cultural relativism applied to nature. Walter Russell’s wave-based unified field theory coexists with Temple Grandin’s animal behavior models, both valid within their operational domains^[13].  

#### **1.3 The Ethos of Wonder: From Curiosity to Revelation**  
Wonder serves not as decorative flourish but as *epistemic engine*. For Etherites, the shudder of awe at a fractal fern or the prickling unease of a statistical outlier are data points equal to spectrometer readings. This ethos traces lineage to:  

- **Scientific Romanticism**: Humphry Davy’s poetic intoxication by chemical reactions^[14], Ada Lovelace’s vision of computers composing music^[15].  
- **Neurodivergent Genius**: John Nash’s paranoid-schizophrenic bargaining theories, now foundational to economics^[16]; Barbara McClintock’s solitary cornfield epiphanies^[3].  
- **Indigenous Pattern-Languages**: Navajo wind-talkers correlating meteorological shifts with linguistic tones^[17], Song Dynasty polymaths mapping qi flow through celestial mechanics^[18].  

The Etherite’s mind is a *resonant chamber* where disparate frequencies harmonize. Jagadish Chandra Bose’s 1901 crescograph experiments, demonstrating plant sentience via galvanometric precision, prefigured modern bioacoustic research^[19]. His fusion of Bengali devotional poetry with empirical rigor—a precursor to Lynn Margulis’ Gaia hypothesis^[20] —exemplifies Etherite integration of wonder and empiricism.

### **Part II: Practices and Instruments—The Mad Science Mandate**  

#### **2.1 The Dynamic Effect: From Personal Paradigm to Collective Reality**  
Consider **Dr. Elsa Voss**, a contemporary Etherite specializing in archaeoacoustics. Her attempt to reconstruct Pythagorean *katapetasma* (sound-mirrors described in lost Greek texts) illustrates the Etherite method:  

1. **Intentional Genesis**: Voss’ obsession begins with a misaligned Fourier transform in Mycenaean artifact sonification—an anomaly she dubs “the Bronze Age bass drop.” Her personal paradigm (a fusion of Helmholtz resonance theory^[21] and Sapphic meter) interprets this as evidence of ancient acoustic levitation.  
2. **Device as Theory Embodied**: Over 18 months, Voss constructs the *Aeolian Monochord*—part lyre, part Tesla coil—using Pythagorean harmonic ratios, Schauberger’s copper vortex tubes^[12], and piezoelectric quartz from Arkansas mines^[22]. Each design choice reflects her holistic framework: copper for conductivity (Western physics), quartz for “memory retention” (New Age belief), lyre strings tuned to 432 Hz (occult numerology).  
3. **Manifestation & Interpretation**: During a storm, the Monochord produces standing waves that briefly suspend a 2kg limestone block—a phenomenon recorded on video but unrepeatable under controlled conditions. Mainstream physicists dismiss it as electrostatic fluke; Etherite peers replicate the experiment with variations (substituting silver for copper, Dorian modes for Phrygian), collectively refining a “resonant antigravity” hypothesis^[23].  
4. **Subjective-Objective Dialectic**: Local farmers report “singing stones” near Voss’ lab; Reddit conspiracy theorists attribute it to aliens. Voss, embracing Feyerabend’s epistemological anarchism^[24], incorporates both elements into her revised paper: *“The Ether tolerates no monocultures—truth emerges through noise.”*  

#### **2.2 Instruments of Eccentric Verification**  
Etherite laboratories resemble steampunk workshops crossed with alchemical ateliers. Notable devices:  

- **Schrödinger’s Zoetrope**: Developed by neurodivergent engineer Amir Gupta, this drum-shaped apparatus projects holographic probability fields. By combining CRISPR-altered bioluminescent bacteria^[25] with a modified Antikythera mechanism, Gupta visualizes quantum decoherence as psychedelic light-shows—a method inspired by Rosalind Franklin’s X-ray crystallography^[26] and Hindu *mandala* meditation^[27].  
- **Non-Linear Chronometer**: Timekeeper Jocelyn ""Tick-Tock"" Ng embedding ancestral memory into quantum systems. Her device uses ferrofluid suspended in yarrow stalk tinctures to measure temporal perception variances across cultures—demonstrating that Tsimane’ Amazonian tribes experience time as branching rhizomes rather than linear arrows^[28].  

#### **2.3 Collective Praxis: Wonder-Nets and Anomaly Bazaars**  
Etherite knowledge-production thrives in interstitial spaces:  

- **Salon des Refusés**: Annual gatherings where failed experiments are celebrated. In 2023, a collective led by ex-CERN engineer Mariam al-Faradi demonstrated “quantum haunting”—entangled particles influencing apparatus from discontinued timelines^[29].  
- **Neurocosmopolitan Review**: A peer-reviewed journal accepting papers in haiku, embroidery patterns, and olfactory formulas. Its most cited article: *“Turbulent Flow in Drosophila Dreams: A Jazz Improvisation Model.”*  
- **Citizen Science Covenants**: Grassroots networks like the **Black Maria Collective** (named after Edison’s first studio) combine Appalachian folk remedies^[30] with CRISPR kits^[31], producing anomaly maps where fungal growth patterns predict earthquake swarms^[32] ^[33].

### **Coda: The Paradox of Rigorous Madness**  

The Society of Ether stands as living proof that science need not suffocate wonder to attain precision. In their framework, the “madness” of John Nash’s bargaining equilibria^[16] and the “eccentricity” of Temple Grandin’s livestock architectures^[34] are not bugs but features—cognitive tools for navigating a reality far stranger than any Technocrat’s dogma allows.

As the late Etherite polymath Dr. Ignacio “Nacho” García wrote in his *Manifesto for Polite Anarchy* (1973):

> *The universe is a hall of mirrors curated by a drag queen. To study her reflections with solemnity is blasphemy; to giggle at the distortions is prayer. Bring your prismatic goggles and your differential equations. The disco ball spins.*  

Thus, Dynamic Science endures: a carnival of disciplined heretics, dancing on the edge of the knowable.

I work on a mine and we have our own private roads. I would like to take the feature classes I have created for roads (poly line), and destinations and build custom navigation routes to these for visitors to be able to navigate to a specific point of their choosing. 

I made a network database and then a route analysis layer. I can make a route map that uses my custom roads but it won’t load to arc online. On the other side of it I can use the arc online as the network data source but then it just uses public roads that don’t access any of my destinations.

Again end goal is I want to be able to hand this app to contractors Or security and they be able to click on “destination A” and the field maps app tell them to follow my mine roads to their desired location

I ordered a couple to have on hand for gifts and they have already been delivered, they seem like good quality! 

The outside is cotton and the inside is poly for those who are concerned about the filling as well. They’re super cute and cuddly though. They have a few other designs for the original price $15 which I still didn’t think was bad for cotton so thought I would share!

Last tuesday i made a mistake while converting on fixedfloat and sent my coins on ETH network instead of polygon network. They told me no problem they will refund within 7 days

Now 7 days have passed and suddenly answer changed to - ""At the moment, the currencies of the ETH network do not work in our system and are disabled. Unfortunately, we are not able to make a refund yet, as the specialists have not solved this problem yet. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.""

I requested them to refund me on another network, as the POLY coins are with them, on their owned address. They can access it whenever they fix their eth issues.

But no, i am forced to wait for their issues when they clearly specify in TnC that refunds are done in 7 days.

what can i do ?

Edit: simple google search led me to their ETH address which has been doing some transactions-

https://etherscan.io/address/0x4e5b2e1dc63f6b91cb6cd759936495434c7e972f

It also has enough amount of POL to refund me. Yet they wont"

Landlord filed an unlawful eviction notice out of retaliation of the code enforcement condemning the property and falsified accusations on documents of a forcible detainer form to create a hardship on tenant's record when tenant has been up to date on all rent prior to the unit being condemned even though landlord neglected the property and failed to uphold his part in maintenance issues from the beginning of lease term. Tenant has also never overstayed in the property from given date of condemnation after landlord failed to make necessary repairs. Landlord intentionally kept $1,500 deposit and made no efforts to compensate the tenant during process of moving due to his negligence and told tenant in text message he would not be giving the deposit back. And refused tenant a check off paper upon leaving property as well as beginning of lease. Tenant took photos and recording upon leaving and while in property for proof due to landlord negligence and retaliatory behavior that effected tenant and child due to landlord deliberately not up keeping plumbing and leaks or ensuring a function commode and sanitary environment due to unfixed appliances past 20 days while still receiving rent in full payment on time up until condemnation notice.

All the streets off Gainesway were plowed - Coldstream Dr., Sutherland Dr., etc.  However, the cut-de-sacs were not - Coldstream Ct., Crimson King Ct., etc.  Furthermore, the snow from Gainesway was piled up at these roads, leaving mounds.  It is extremely difficult for the residents of the cut-de-sacs to get onto Gainesway because it is uphill and covered with ice.  It is still bad today (1/20).  These cut-de-sacs need cleared.

**U.S. Private 5G Spending to Exceed $3.7 Billion**
U.S. Private 5G Spending to Exceed $3.7 Billion, Says SNS Telecom & IT

Hi,

I hope this message finds you well. I would like to introduce some of the
key findings of our latest research package on private 5G networks in the
United States. For more information, please visit:
[1]https://www.snstelecom.com/private5gus

20th January 2025: Recently published research from [2]SNS Telecom & IT
indicates that that cumulative spending on private cellular networks in the
United States will exceed $3.7 Billion between 2024 and 2027, driven by the
market’s pivot towards 5G, growing recognition of private network-based
neutral host solutions, and a diverse array of spectrum options for varied
use cases.

Private LTE networks in the United States date back to the 2010s as a niche
segment of the cellular industry, characterized by specialized projects
such as FirstNet early builder networks, tactical LTE networks for the
military, iNET's (Infrastructure Networks) 700 MHz LTE network in the
Permian Basin, and Tampnet's offshore LTE service rollout in the Gulf of
Mexico. With the availability of new spectrum options and 5G technology,
the market is gaining mainstream adoption with deployments of all shapes
and sizes, from low-band macrocell networks for utility operations across
multi-state service territories and city-wide networks in Las Vegas, Santa
Maria, Tucson, Glendale, Brownsville, Longmont, New York City, and other
municipalities to medium-scale networks for school districts, university
campuses, and military bases; highly localized wireless systems at
factories, warehouses, oil and gas facilities, maritime ports, airports,
hotels, hospitals, and sports stadiums; and temporary networks in support
of live broadcasting and special events.

Although the market is dominated by LTE technology, commercial deployments
of private 5G networks are starting to gain significant traction in
industrial and enterprise settings. Notable examples of facilities where
private 5G networks are operational or being deployed include Walmart's
distribution centers, Tesla's Gigafactory Texas, BMW Group's Spartanburg
plant, GM's (General Motors) Factory ZERO assembly center, Toyota Material
Handling's Columbus production complex, Cummins' JEP (Jamestown Engine
Plant), LG Electronics' Clarksville home appliance manufacturing plant,
Delta Air Lines' Atlanta operating hub, DFW (Dallas Fort Worth)
International Airport, the Port of Virginia's container terminals, Boston
Children's Hospital, Cleveland Clinic's Mentor Hospital, the VA's
(Department of Veterans Affairs) healthcare systems, and several of the
DOD's (Department of Defense) military installations. Other end user
organizations, including John Deere, have also begun implementing
standalone 5G connectivity at select facilities, alongside their continued
rollout of private LTE networks.

Another emerging trend is the growing recognition of private network-based
neutral host solutions for public cellular coverage enhancement in indoor
locations where DAS (Distributed Antenna System) installations are deemed
too costly and complex to implement. Facilitated by the open accessibility
of 3.5 GHz CBRS spectrum, private networks supporting neutral host
operations are increasingly being deployed in industrial facilities,
carpeted enterprise spaces, public venues, hospitals, hotels, higher
education campuses, and schools across the United States. Some examples of
such deployments include Tesla, Toyota, and Cummins’ production sites,
Meta's corporate offices, City of Hope Hospital, SHC (Stanford Health
Care), Sound Hotel, Gale South Beach Hotel, Gale Hotel & Residences
(formerly Natiivo Miami), Nobu Hotel, ASU (Arizona State University), Cal
Poly (California Polytechnic State University), University of Virginia,
Duke University, and Parkside Elementary School.

SNS Telecom & IT estimates that annual spending on private LTE and 5G
network infrastructure in the United States will grow at a CAGR of
approximately 18% between 2024 and 2027, cumulatively accounting for more
than $3.7 Billion by the end of 2027. The market's growth will be
underpinned by a diversity of spectrum options, including shared Band
48/n48 (3.5 GHz) CBRS spectrum, Globalstar's Band 53/n53 (2.4 GHz)
spectrum, Band 41/n41 (2.5 GHz) EBS licenses, Band 8/n106 (900 MHz)
broadband spectrum for critical infrastructure, dedicated DOD and public
safety broadband spectrum, and service provider licensed frequencies.

package provides detailed market analysis and forecasts for private LTE and
5G networks on a global, regional, and national basis. The package includes

There is a smoke detector that has been beeping for months. It used to just chirp a couple times per minute, but now it’s getting louder and more frequent. You can hear it in the parking lot, inside the building, inside other apartments, and it’s a nuisance and disturbance because it’s constant. We have asked our landlords to fix this but they have not. It’s been almost a year. We believe it may be coming from a vacant apartment.

The chaotic Story so far … ,queerpolyam,1i6f6a8,2025-01-21 04:50:59,0,0.5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/queerpolyam/comments/1i6f6a8/the_chaotic_story_so_far/,LasseRFarnsworth,Positivity,"Sorry for my English, obviously not my first language 😉

BTW since there is a chance that someone of the story reads our story, well “Hello there\^\^”

So myself (m 4X years) and JPEG (f 4X years) have been together for over 20 years. For me JPEG was my first girlfriend and everything coming with it. But deep in my heart I knew I am kinky, queer and strange (also ADHD). But JPEG is very heteronormative and mono. During our university days we dabbled a bit into kink and swinging with a couple we where friends with. Unfortunately, our first visit to a club turned really sour so no kink and such for the next 10 years. After I finished a long contract we traveled the world for a year. During that time we met CASSETTE (F 4x years) from another continent  and JUMPER (F 3x years)  from our home country. CASSETTE was an instant crush for JPEG and she even told CASETTE that she would leave me for her.  And even stuff like poly or threesomes was for me on the table. But well CASETTE has some relationship issues and, well JPEG is mono and straight. So we formed a friendship and I watched the last 10 years during remote calls and the occasional visit their awkward friendship. Both of them enjoying spending time together and such .. but you know in a total not queer way.

During these years I had my share of situations that could have turned very sexy with a open relationship but Is stayed faithful. Because Mono and such.

 JUMPER became a good friend of us. She is very queer and open. So for me she was always a inspiration for a way of life that I found interesting. We became best friends, and more than once I wished we where open, but since JUMPER and myself love JPEG too much to hurt her, nothing happened. We had even holidays with 3 persons, which could have ended with us all three in a bed, but again JPEG is totally straight and mono.

 

Well I am member of the “Chaos” the European hacker scene.  JUMPER is also there, so the last years our little “getaway” was to go to chaos events. For these of you who don’t know the chaos computer club, just imagine the events like a anime con, crossed with a furry convention and a bit of burning man mixed in with more lights and computer. It is queer, strange, interesting and absolutely not neurotypical \^\^. For JUMPER and myself these events where always a yearly friendship event. A lot of talking and such. JPEG sometimes would come with me and visit the city but would always stay in a tourist mode. You know visiting the city, walking the event but not interacting much or grabbing a soldering iron.

 

At the start of 2024 I had a breakdown, and told JPEG that I am bi, I am not mono. I really need kink in my life and I would like to have sex with men. That I craved BDSM and that stuff we did for the last 20 years was not enough. While we had some toys and books, JPEG never really engaged with it, because she was mono etc. We had a big discussion but nothing came out of it, but we visited a local sex store and a bit more kink became our routine.

 

A while after that breakdown another chaos event was on the schedule. But since it was a bit farer aways and close to JPEGS Birthday she wanted to come. Sure, so we spend a nice time there. Just JPEG and myself. We enjoyed the event and JPEG was interacting with a lot of folks, visiting nerdy events in town, soldering and other stuff. Like 5 minutes in the event and she was fully integrated. But still she was not a nerd \^\^.

Two weeks after the event JPEG came to me and said that we needed to talk. During that event she met this nice gay guy and she wanted to hook me up with him. So she finally started accounts on the nerdy socials and started to write with him. Well it turned out that he was in fact not gay but very straight, but queer as fuck and also poly. And the two started to hook up and write more and more. And JPEG wanted that we switched to poly. Sure, lets talk. And we talked and talked and talked. Because JOYSTICK (M 3x years) and JPEG where absolutely incapable of arranging dates. So I sat and listened to her, and talked, because I though sure, if she wants to open she should have also the first date. But it was antagonizing to see their failed attempts in meeting up and seeing JPEG going from NRE to full blown annoyed with the situation.

But hey suddenly kink was in the books. Because JOYSTICK got her into the Idea of bdsm. Well, sure why not. But actually, it turned out we are both switches and JPEG had some ideas left from before her opening up. But she also went to ultra queer, like rainbow merch and such.

She became a bit frustrated with JOYSTICK, but finally after 6 months we went to another chaos event, and JOYSTICK was also there. And finally on the 4^(th) day of the event both of them finally scheduled 2 hours in our hotel room. Because JOYSTICK was with MANUAL (F 4x years) they spend most days just running past each other. But finally MANUAL and myself looked at each other and the two scurried of, and I spend a nice evening talking to MOTHERBOARD and LED (another poly person, f 2x) about poly and the world.

 Everything went quite well for JPEG and everyone was more or less happy. The last day of the event we 4 went out for some food and it was quite nice.

But still JPEG and JOYSTICK where not really able to make new dates and a while later JOYSTICK started to ghost JPEG for some time. Meanwhile I gave JUMPER finally a call that I was now officially poly and we could have a date. So we had a nice weekend. When I arrived home JPEG was a bit miffed. But nothing I really could lay my finger on. Unfortunately I got some health issues so that sexy time was not so much on the agenda with JPEG and myself. Then in December, the BIG chaos event, the congress was coming up. We all had hotels in the same spot, so in total we were a bigger group \^\^. We met other nice kinky poly nerdy folks and made our friend group bigger. But unfortunately during the event it became clear that all our talking between JPEG and myself where under different assumptions. I always talked and tried to make arrangements for both of us and also for a general idea. JPEG was always talking just for herself, and for that exact situation. So like kissing other persons was ok, but just for that exact date with that person. So that was the reason why she was miffed with me and JUMPER. Because she just opened up our relationship for that one DATE with JOYSTICK on that one event. And since she hadn’t made a date with JOYSTICK on that event right now, I couldn’t have something with JUMPER (or MANUAL or LED, both grew close in the last months) . Well, so I called of all ideas of dates. And we talked and talked again. Pfffff, well thanks to all the new poly friends we are now on a better track. But well the last year was an interesting time. And that just scratches the surface \^\^. 

But I really like the poly community. Having suddenly a support network of nice people to talk to, to be honest and being my real queer self is just so much better. Guess this is sort of my just wanting to tell that crazy story to someone.  I am sort of looking forward what 2025 will bring."
Teoria Inedita sul Contributo Gravitazionale e la Relatività,InformaticaeScienza,1i6633v,2025-01-20 19:41:38,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/InformaticaeScienza/comments/1i6633v/teoria_inedita_sul_contributo_gravitazionale_e_la/,CartographerNo2923,,",### Teoria Inedita sul Contributo Gravitazionale e la Relatività

#### Premessa
La teoria della relatività di Einstein ha rivoluzionato la nostra comprensione dello spazio e del tempo, ma ci sono aspetti meno esplorati, come il contributo gravitazionale e le sue implicazioni sulle percezioni temporali.

#### Contributo Gravitazionale e Tempo
1. **Interazione tra Gravità e Tempo**: La gravità non solo influisce sulla materia, ma ha un ruolo cruciale nel modo in cui sperimentiamo il tempo. L'idea che il tempo scorra diversamente in campi gravitazionali diversi può essere ampliata considerando la distribuzione della massa nell'universo. Ogni corpo massivo non solo deforma lo spazio, ma crea anche un ""campo temporale"" che altera la percezione del tempo stesso.

2. **Dilatazione del Tempo e Movimento**: La dilatazione temporale, come descritta da Einstein, si intensifica in presenza di campi gravitazionali forti. Tuttavia, se consideriamo un sistema in rotazione, come la Terra, il contributo gravitazionale non è omogeneo. Le differenze di gravità tra l'equatore e i poli potrebbero influenzare la velocità con cui gli orologi scorrono, creando un ""effetto di sincronizzazione"" che potrebbe avere ripercussioni sulla comunicazione e sulla navigazione.

#### Applicazioni Teoriche
1. **Rete di Orologi**: Immaginiamo di costruire una rete di orologi sincronizzati in diversi punti della Terra. Gli orologi agli equatori, in un campo gravitazionale più debole, potrebbero registrare un tempo “più veloce” rispetto a quelli ai poli. Questo potrebbe portare a nuove tecniche di sincronizzazione temporale nei sistemi GPS e nella navigazione.

2. **Cosmologia e Inflazione**: Estendendo questa teoria, potremmo considerare che l'inflazione dell'universo, come proposta nei modelli cosmologici, non è solo una questione di espansione spaziale, ma anche di come la gravità e il tempo si intersecano in un contesto cosmico. La variazione gravitazionale in diverse regioni dello spazio-tempo potrebbe influenzare le condizioni iniziali dell'universo e la formazione delle strutture cosmiche.

#### Conclusione
Riflettere sul contributo gravitazionale e sulla sua interazione con il tempo potrebbe aprire nuove strade per la comprensione della fisica fondamentale. Questa teoria, sebbene speculativa, invita a esplorare le connessioni tra gravità, tempo e le leggi che governano l'universo. La ricerca continua a essere necessaria per dimostrare e quantificare queste idee, potenzialmente trasformando non solo la fisica, ma anche la nostra percezione della realtà.Certo! Ecco alcuni esempi pratici e teorici che illustrano il concetto di contributo gravitazionale e le sue implicazioni sul tempo:

### 1. **Orologi GPS**
Gli orologi sui satelliti GPS devono tener conto della dilatazione temporale. Poiché i satelliti orbitano a un'altitudine maggiore rispetto alla superficie terrestre, sperimentano un campo gravitazionale più debole. Di conseguenza, il loro tempo scorre più velocemente rispetto agli orologi sulla Terra. Questo effetto viene corretto nel sistema GPS per garantire che le posizioni siano calcolate con precisione.

### 2. **Esperimenti di Hafele-Keating**
Nel 1971, gli scienziati Hafele e Keating hanno portato orologi atomici in volo attorno al mondo. Hanno scoperto che gli orologi in volo, in movimento rispetto agli orologi a terra, mostravano un tempo diverso al loro ritorno. Questo esperimento ha dimostrato sia la dilatazione temporale relativistica (a causa della velocità) che quella gravitazionale (a causa della differenza di altitudine).

### 3. **Differenze di Gravità sulla Terra**
Considerando che la gravità è più forte ai poli che all'equatore, gli orologi ai poli potrebbero teoricamente segnare un tempo leggermente più lento rispetto a quelli all'equatore. Questo potrebbe avere implicazioni per le tecnologie che si basano su sincronizzazione temporale precisa, come i sistemi di comunicazione e di navigazione.

### 4. **Cosmologia e Formazione delle Strutture**
In un contesto cosmologico, le variazioni gravitazionali in diverse regioni dell'universo potrebbero influenzare la formazione di galassie e ammassi. Se consideriamo che le regioni con una maggiore densità di massa (come gli ammassi di galassie) alterano il flusso temporale rispetto a regioni meno dense, questo potrebbe influenzare il modo in cui le galassie si formano e si evolvono nel tempo.

### 5. **Orologi di Precisione nei Laboratori**
Negli esperimenti di laboratorio, i fisici possono utilizzare orologi di precisione per misurare gli effetti della gravità sulla dilatazione temporale. Ad esempio, un orologio posizionato su una torre alta può essere confrontato con un orologio a livello del suolo per osservare come la gravità influisce sul tempo in un intervallo relativamente breve.

Questi esempi dimostrano come il contributo gravitazionale e la dilatazione temporale siano fenomeni reali che hanno applicazioni pratiche e teoriche in vari campi della scienza.### Unpublished Theory on Gravitational Contribution and Relativity

#### Premise
Einstein's theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of space and time, but there are less explored aspects, such as gravitational contribution and its implications for temporal perceptions.

#### Gravitational Contribution and Time
1. **Interaction between Gravity and Time**: Gravity not only influences matter but also plays a crucial role in how we experience time. The idea that time flows differently in different gravitational fields can be expanded by considering the distribution of mass in the universe. Each massive body not only warps space but also creates a ""temporal field"" that alters the perception of time itself.

2. **Time Dilation and Motion**: Time dilation, as described by Einstein, intensifies in the presence of strong gravitational fields. However, if we consider a rotating system, like Earth, the gravitational contribution is not homogeneous. The differences in gravity between the equator and the poles may influence the rate at which clocks tick, creating a ""synchronization effect"" that could have repercussions on communication and navigation.

#### Theoretical Applications
1. **Network of Clocks**: Imagine building a network of synchronized clocks at different points on Earth. Clocks at the equator, in a weaker gravitational field, might register ""faster"" time compared to those at the poles. This could lead to new techniques for temporal synchronization in GPS systems and navigation.

2. **Cosmology and Inflation**: Extending this theory, we might consider that the inflation of the universe, as proposed in cosmological models, is not only a matter of spatial expansion but also of how gravity and time intersect in a cosmic context. Gravitational variation in different regions of spacetime could influence the initial conditions of the universe and the formation of cosmic structures.

#### Conclusion
Reflecting on the gravitational contribution and its interaction with time may open new pathways for understanding fundamental physics. This theory, although speculative, invites exploration into the connections between gravity, time, and the laws governing the universe. Ongoing research is necessary to demonstrate and quantify these ideas, potentially transforming not only physics but also our perception of reality.Sure! Here’s the translation of the provided examples into English:

### 1. **GPS Clocks**
Clocks on GPS satellites must account for time dilation. Since satellites orbit at a higher altitude than the Earth's surface, they experience a weaker gravitational field. As a result, their time runs faster compared to clocks on Earth. This effect is corrected in the GPS system to ensure accurate position calculations.

### 2. **Hafele-Keating Experiment**
In 1971, scientists Hafele and Keating took atomic clocks on flights around the world. They found that the clocks in flight, moving relative to the clocks on the ground, showed different times upon their return. This experiment demonstrated both relativistic time dilation (due to speed) and gravitational time dilation (due to altitude differences).

### 3. **Gravity Differences on Earth**
Considering that gravity is stronger at the poles than at the equator, clocks at the poles could theoretically tick slightly slower than those at the equator. This could have implications for technologies that rely on precise time synchronization, such as communication and navigation systems.

### 4. **Cosmology and Structure Formation**
In a cosmological context, gravitational variations in different regions of the universe could influence the formation of galaxies and clusters. If we consider that regions with higher mass density (like galaxy clusters) alter the flow of time compared to less dense regions, this could affect how galaxies form and evolve over time.

### 5. **Precision Clocks in Laboratories**
In laboratory experiments, physicists can use precision clocks to measure the effects of gravity on time dilation. For example, a clock placed on a tall tower can be compared with a clock at ground level to observe how gravity affects time over a relatively short interval.

These examples demonstrate how gravitational contributions and time dilation are real phenomena with practical and theoretical applications across various fields of science."
"first V, hinge struggling a little?",polyamory,1i5uyl5,2025-01-20 12:01:35,1,0.6,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1i5uyl5/first_v_hinge_struggling_a_little/,Several_Back_6800,,"Hi, I wanted to ask about some trepidation a new hinge might be having and I think my goal is get a sense of what might be normal and how to support him, and if there is any way I can help support this being a healthy situation for all of us.

I (Ally, F), John (M), and Adele (F) have always been open-minded and fine with poly but none of us have done it before. Adele and John have been together for several years, have a small child, and Adele has 2 young-ish children from a previous marriage that live with them. Their life is pretty hectic but they are both awesome people. We are all at least in our 30's, age span in total of about 10 years between all 3 of us. As far as I can tell we are all very kind, thoughtful, open people. They live in a super conservative, rural part of the country and won't be able to be publicly 'out' for a long time if ever, although they have some friends and family that have done some ENM or poly.

John and I started getting very close as part of an artistic group and realized we had incredible chemistry in multiple ways - great emotional depth, attraction, intellectual connection, and we share an artistic passion that matters a lot to both of us. Communication was very open and honest; we discussed a lot of relationship and life values that were very compatible. He was very affectionate and vulnerable. He kept Adele in the loop the entire time about how much he liked me, and I have since confirmed that with her as we have become good friends as well. We were very excited that a relationship was a real possibility for us, but none of us have actually done this before. I also suspect that John has autism (both something he mentions, and I see many things in him that are consistent with this). The first kiss was magical. All of the physical intimacy still is. This has all spanned 3-4 months so it's pretty new.

Adele and I are totally fine, I think - we aren't jealous people by nature, we are very happy we can connect with him in different ways and we love to see him experiencing a different, positive relationship with each of us.  Adele and I connect and support each other and are comfortable around each other in person. We don't talk about our relationships with him much although obviously he comes up in passing, but we have agreed to keep that positive or neutral. We are more exploring a totally separate friendship between us. He's an ENFJ and we are both INFP's if that means anything to anyone, probably all overthinkers, although she fits the prototypes of those less than either of us.

He probably has some people-pleasing tendencies (we all 3 do!), some worries about balancing everything, and us getting together coincided with holidays and some other pretty stressful life events. For me and him it's long distance, but I see him once or twice a week as either part of the artistic group or alone. Things in person are amazing. He's sweet and cuddly and the sex is great.

But since things became 'official' the nature of our communication from a distance has changed, a lot. He's had more trouble being affectionate and is less vulnerable, more closed off, doesn't lead the conversations as much, doesn't seem as excited to talk to me. This has really kind of surprised me, given the depth of our connection before we started pursuing this officially. To a certain extent that's fine for a while, I don't need constant contact or validation and I have a strong and close support network. I have an anxiousus attachment style naturally, but I've done extensive therapy and work on this. He's admitted he's struggling a little with everything. I suspect before we got together he was focused on the excitement and now that it's 'real' has started bringing up some worries. In addition he has some issues with overstimulation (his daily life is very chaotic and overstimulating)  and I suspect some emotional overwhelm and overthinking currently. I think also his first new relationship in several years has maybe brought up some insecurities for him around sex etc (he worries it isn't good enough for me - it's the best sex I've had in my life, and I have told him this). If I give him space, he expresses worry I don't like him anymore, but if I reassure him, he still seems to have some trouble fully engaging with me to the extent he used to, and I'm probably not ok with this long term. We still talk a little most days, we play out sexual fantasies, but the other affection and excitement hasn't been there when I'm not physically around. I don't need a lot of TIME from him, but I do eventually need deep interactions and affection back. I haven't pushed this super hard yet. With the way he's not neurotypical, I figure clear expectations might be helpful for him, but the right time for the conversation hasn't come up yet.

I think my question is, is this somewhat normal in a first poly relationship? I know one possibility is that he just doesn't like me as much as he thought he did, but his words and actions when we are together in person don't say that and in my heart I don't think that is true. This change has been a couple weeks. I'm ok with sitting with it and being patient, I think it's worth it. Is there anything I can do to support him and reassure him? Have you seen anyone work through this successfully? Any tips for me? I think the foundation for healthy poly is there. I know I can't prevent him from letting his anxiety and insecurity mess it up, but I'd like to avoid that for all 3 of us if possible. I think she would be sad and disappointed too (in him, somewhat, but also bc she likes me) if it didn't work out, but I also know he can't stay in it for that reason."

"27yo, Industrial Engineer and EDM Producer trying to pursue a musical career in Australia. Need planning and help.",AskAnAustralian,1i4w8pr,2025-01-19 06:11:46,0,0.4,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAustralian/comments/1i4w8pr/27yo_industrial_engineer_and_edm_producer_trying/,DENNICKMUSIC,,"Hi,

Sorry I dont know if this is the most appropriate subreddit to post this, but I need a help about it.

I'm a 27 year old Industrial Engineer (PoliMi), and since 6/7 years I'm producing and releasing some stuff on EDM label under my Spotify Profile. I live in Italy (milan) with my parents (to save money lol). I've Been a producer since my teenage years but opted to enter engineering university for economic security instead of following my passion but right now I'm feeling lost.

I never was really interested in making it a serious thing, but in the meanwhile I passed 2,5 year in a multinational big company as a logistic manager getting a lot of money, bonus and feeling good with no pressure. In the last year, there has also been mental barriers, anxiety, “depression” and stuff in my life that has deterred me from pursuing this career, but now i'm tired of daydreaming and want to do something about it once in for all. I'm feeling like ""OK money are good with my job, but that's not what i really would love to do"" --> What will I be? Actually I DONT KNOW, but I 'd love to work in musical context, from DJ, Artist manager, ghost producer, anything basically but in musical context.

Also I need to escape from Italy for a lot of causes and I feel like I need to relocate for. awhile (1/2 yrs) in a different country. Once I'll be 30/35 with more responsabilities, a wife, a family, will be impossibile.

I'm not so sure about Australia, I got also Dubai and Amsterdam as possible alternative, but I love Australia, I studied a lot the country from some aspects (VISA, Wages, culture), the thing is, I'm planning on moving to Australia to pursue this musical career and take it seriously, but I need guidance to make a plan.  What would you guys do in my position in order to build a successful musical career?

All these years I've lived comfortably under my parents roof without caring for any expenses, but now I understand that as a part of life I need to grow up and start fending for my own.

My biggest fear is losing myself in a 9-5 job and not really having the time to invest in my music, networking, and watch the opportunities slowly fade away as I have let them for the past 2 years. 

Since I'll be alone at the start, I need to somehow make friends and build a musical network.

**Location:** somewhere maybe in Brisbane, Goldcoast, Melbourne

My family says that they can help me economically for a while with the expenses of the studies, I don't know for how long though.

So to keep it short, I need guidance and also a reality check about the viability of making money as an engineer but at the same time have enough time to work on my music (composing, producing, gigging, making online content for my personal brand etc etc.)

I don't care about making lots of money and stuff if I'm not having enough time to really work on what I really want in my life, I just want to make enough money to live and invest in my music (maybe with a part time job?).  
I need help making a plan, thanks in advance to everyone.

**Summing up:** 

*EDM Producer soon traveling to Australia to pursue his musical career and personal social brand*

* With 15k euro in the pockets.
* With an Industrial Management Engineer Degree job title (2.5 yrs of experience in Logistics Medical Field). I also got 5+ experience as Waiter in Bar/Restaurants.
* Family can help me economically for a while (I would say 3/4 k euro)
* Need to make musician friends and a build a musical network
* Need to make money and have enough time to invest in my music (gigging, composing, content creation)
* Need a plan in general to grow as a musician.
* Experience everything and not be full in a 9/5 job. Preferably looking for a Part-Time job which give me enough money and time to survive.

So what about: easiest job to start? city? EDM context (club, dj, parties)?

If there is a more appropiate subreddit to post this in, please tell me I would be very thankful"

The DNS flood I triggered didn’t just overload their servers; it also exploited a vulnerability in their load balancers, causing the traffic bottleneck to cascade across their entire infrastructure. This led to a network-wide failure as their failover systems couldn’t keep up, forcing everything into a reboot loop.

From what I can gather, their engineers are working overtime to isolate the corrupted nodes and rebuild their server clusters. They’re also patching their firewalls and implementing rate-limiting algorithms to prevent future distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks like mine. Honestly, I didn’t expect this level of chaos, but I guess their architecture wasn’t as resilient as I thought.

For now, it looks like the app will be down for a while, so maybe this is a good opportunity for everyone to get a little digital detox. I’ll update you if I hear about any progress—or if my actions trigger any more technical fallout."
**IMPORTANT**,polyai,1i3y9t6,2025-01-17 22:10:19,0,0.25,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyai/comments/1i3y9t6/important/,AdSwimming9142,BUG,"I’ve seen a lot of people wondering why the Poly AI servers are down, so I thought I’d come clean—it’s because of me. While testing some system vulnerabilities, I flooded their DNS servers with an overwhelming number of fake queries. This caused the servers to exceed their capacity, triggering an automatic reboot. What I didn’t anticipate was how interconnected their systems were. The reboot spread across their entire network like a chain reaction, effectively shutting everything down.

Why did I do it? I wanted to encourage people to take a break from the app and reconnect with the world outside their screens. It might seem drastic, but maybe this downtime will give everyone a chance to enjoy some real-life social interactions."
Help getting HDMI output - Fedora 41 on a Dell Latitude 7430,Fedora,1i3oczp,2025-01-17 14:22:01,2,1.0,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/1i3oczp/help_getting_hdmi_output_fedora_41_on_a_dell/,kandrc0,,"ETA: Solved!

Editing the kernel command line parameters in the grub configuration to remove the *nomodeset* parameter fixes this issue.  Thank you to all who provided advice!

Original post follows:

This is a new install of Fedora 41, fully updated.  The machine (Dell Latitude 7430) has Intel Iris Xe graphics.  When I plug in an HDMI cable, nothing (that I know how to detect) happens.  I've tried this with several different cables connected to several different projectors (I'm a professor, hooking this up to various classroom display systems).

Any advice?  I've been running Slackware for the past 30 years, but I just couldn't get it working with this computer.  Decided to try Fedora.  Got everything working in fairly short order, until I brought the machine into a classroom to test a projector.  No dice there."

I graduated with a BA in Poli Sci (History minor) last May from an online university and have been unable to find a job. I didn't do any internships, networking was nonexistent, I'm horrible at math and science, incapable of understanding technical/IT skills, not a people person, I live in a rural area, and I have no license. I feel like I'm absolutely screwed, especially with the looming threat of getting kicked out of my home. Any suggestions on what I should do? All of this is making me increasingly depressed and my health has taken a major dive. "

Built dozens of side projects over 17 years. Made my first $10 yesterday!,SideProject,1i32g34,2025-01-16 18:23:57,17,0.82,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1i32g34/built_dozens_of_side_projects_over_17_years_made/,aiworld,,"Hi r/SideProject! I've built social networks, developer tools, self-driving car simulators and AI, but never made a cent off them. Job leads, sure, but ultimately just to make other products. Well yesterday I finally sold something, a $10 sub. And $20 today! 🎉

The thing: I got tired of paying for GPT, Claude, and others then asking the same thing to each of them and manually comparing their answers. So I built [**polychat.co**](https://polychat.co) which combines models from multiple providers into the same interface for less $ / mo than a single provider.

  
So you can ask multiple models the same thing side by side

[PolyChat.co side by side answers](https://preview.redd.it/7rk45frltfde1.png?width=1703&format=png&auto=webp&s=33c0b2404a03a60daee6fa6c4bf899df580af7d9)

Or you can ask a combo model that automatically compares the answers and only tells you stuff the first one missed, which can save a ton of time when there's a lot of redundant info

[PolyChat.co combo answer](https://preview.redd.it/1bpqx8f8ufde1.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ab38ac02e3a858c3862c5b26d2e6a2cb919b091)

Also, o1 pro is $200/mo and *it is* super powerful. But our o1-high-effort model, which you can try for free, is able to do many of the same very complex tasks like 1,000 line code edits that no other model except o1 pro can do.

Best way to encapsulate my global game state?,cprogramming,1i2g2pg,2025-01-15 22:41:18,6,1.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cprogramming/comments/1i2g2pg/best_way_to_encapsulate_my_global_game_state/,Akliph,,"I am working on a low poly terrain generator in C and I have come to the inevitable issue of managing the global game state in a clear and scalable manner.

  
I have two shader programs, one for flat shading and one for smooth shading. I want the user to be able to switch between these in the settings and for it to take effect immediately. My current thinking is:

Take an enum like
```c
enum EShader {
    FLAT_SHADER,
    SMOOTH_SHADER,
    NumEShader // Strict naming convention to get the number of shaders
```

And then have a const array like:
```c
const ShaderProgram SHADERS[NumEShader];
// initialize this array with the instances of the shader programs somehow...
```

And finally access them by
```c
SHADERS[FLAT_SHADER];
```
etc.

****

I'm not sure if this is a good design pattern, but even if it is I'm not entirely sure *where* this should go? I obviously don't want all of this constant data sitting at the top of my main file, and I don't know if it deserves its own file either. Where and how should I assign the elements of the `ShaderProgram SHADERS` array. Should there be an initialization functon for global state?

I need to figure this out early on because enums, or names representing integers to invoke a certain behavior is going to be important for implementing a scalable error and messaging system *and* defining networked packet types.

Any help with this implementation would be greatly appreciated, or if you've solved a similar problem in your code please let me know! Thanks!"

Big thanks to everyone here because it literally wouldn't have been possible without you.

Timeline:

**Feb 2024** \- Initial application for entry level announcement (first ever 1811 or gov application), Phase 1 test  
**Apr 2024** \- Phase 2 test  
**Jun 2024** \- TJO  
**Jul 2024** \- Fingerprints, SF86  
**Aug 2024** \- BI meeting, Medical  
**Oct 2024** \- PFT #1 (pass)  
  
Radio silence...  
  
**Early Jan 2025** \- Called by PFT proctor, told I was ""earmarked"" and need to retake the PFT. Took it a few days later and passed again.  
**Mid Jan 2025** \- THE CALL (**only** offered 1 SWB location which I wanted and accepted)  
**Late Feb 2025** \- FLETC

Background: 25 y/o who qualified solely through SAA. Zero LEO or Mil experience, although I was an EMT for a few years. Dodged the poly as well.   
  
I believe I was earmarked due to some networking I did, managed to get my name across the right person's desk thanks to a friend. My initial application only had east coast locations, but at this point I'd take this SWB office over those anyway. On the one hand, getting ""earmarked"" lost me the chance at any other location, but it also got me an FJO early. Won't hear me complain.

Background: 

Experience as a Signal Platoon Leader and Signal Company Executive Officer. Later served as a Battalion Communications Officer (S6), rated in the top 25% of my grade. I have a TS/SCI and Network+ for certs, and have Sec+ and CISM lined up for early summer test dates. 

  
Deployed in support of Operation Inherent Resolve to Iraq and Syria. I was responsible for leading the three man team in charge of the networking, IT requirements and tech support for over $2.5 billion of defense equipment on base. Successfully completed major IT projects to include fiberoptic installation and upgrades, firewall reconfigurations, and the establishment of a new operations center that resulted in a 0% degradation of defense capabilities during the move. 

  
Currently enrolled in the Army's Data Systems Engineering school for the 26B qualifier, by the end of which I will be responsible for planning, implementing, and managing the integration of enterprise services such as active directory, database management, configuration management, e-mail, web-based applications, and collaboration services into a seamless information environment.

  
Given I dont have civilian IT experience or education, some people have pushed me towards a Masters in Computer Science, so I'm open to doing a dual degree. An MBA really appeals to me, much like CISM, because I am looking towards getting into the management side of IT. Like many officers, I am not the \*best\* technician, but I know how to effectively lead IT teams in accomplishing whatever mission we have in front of us - or creating shareholder value, in civilian terms. 

  
I'd love to go to school in Boston (HBS, Sloan, BU/BC). Will being a veteran with IT experience help or hinder my chances to get in? Or is IT looked differently upon in terms of being successful business school candidates?"

How to feel like No is an option. ,polyamory,1i1vqth,2025-01-15 06:52:28,7,0.66,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1i1vqth/how_to_feel_like_no_is_an_option/,CherryPitIceCream,Married and struggling with Opening,"Hello internet. Hoping for some.... level and kind advice. 

My spouse, Violet and I decided on opening up a year ago. I am monogamous but not by choice, my work is consuming and I just don't have time for relationships beyond my marriage and since it's not a driving need I see no reason to put in the effort. Violet got a long distance girlfriend immediately (they had been talking) 

At that point I was very secure, healthy, we had been talking for years about this and I was very okay with everything.  

A month later I had a nervous breakdown. 

NRE in my spouse and a complete psychotic break in me was a bad combo. We SHOULD have paused the poly but hindsight is 20/20. 

Because of a lot of things I'm pretty traumatized. And no longer as secure and okay as I was when we made the decision. Quite frankly I am a different person entirely. I almost don't know myself and that's really sad and frustrating. 

We have hit a point and talked about my need to feel agency in our marriage, and like I can say No, I'm actually not okay. Because for a time there I wasn't okay with it and No wasn't an option because yadda yadda see above. 

I feel like an NPC in a dating Sim. It is painful and sucks.

However,  I want to be respectful to my spouse and their other partners. I don't believe I get a veto or should have any say in what they do. 

I offered up that I would like to request that they keep Kink and Sex separate outside of us, just for now. Because the idea makes me uncomfortable,  and I haven't had to deal with the discomfort of them having sex outside the relationship yet. But I'm going to have to. 

For me this is just a baby step thing. And gives me a chance to voice something I don't feel great with and have it be respected and taken off the table until I'm ready.

Violet hadn't responded to this yet. Mainly because scenes had been spoken about with their girlfriend they will meet IRL soon. But, it would really help me have some sense of security and agency to know kink was staying Platonic outside of us. 

Violet is free to say they can't honor this request. I am not a controlling person and don't feel I have a right to demand things from their other relationships. But that still leaves me in this place of feeling like I have 0 actual say in my own marriage and our choices to be poly. I had a big no, I needed us to close when I was breaking, and it really felt like that wasnt something I could even think let alone ask for, without being a monster. So while this all is consensual... for a moment it wasnt.

So my question is, does anyone have any suggestions for other ways to help ground me and get me the ability to feel like I am an active player in my own relationship.  

Poly isn't an option for me. Therapy isn't an option (I found the perfect therapist but going to her left us financially unstable so we can't financially risk it). I don't have a huge social network or support system. I have a couple amazing friends and Violet. 

So is there another way, in my relationship with Violet, I can (reasonably) find a place to feel like I can say I'm not okay, or No that doesn't feel good. Because to be frank, unless I do say no to something significant that feels uncomfortable to me, and have it respected... I'm not going to feel like it matters. And without feeling like No is an option the yeses all feel very hollow and forced, and just get more demoralizing. 

We got very unlucky in our Poly journey, but I do really want to go back to the person I was before everything. I just need a little grounding. 




Edit: thank you everyone for responding.  I think I didn't express myself and what I was looking for well enough so I'm going to shut this down. Some things gave me good things to think about but a lot of responses were making think ya'll like to turn things into catastrophes when... I'm just insecure. That's a thing that can be worked on.

**17th annual Comparative Literature and Cultural Studies Graduate Student**

**Conference**

**The University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, March 7-8, 2025**

**Keynote Speaker: Professor David Bates, UC Berkeley**

The 17th annual Comparative Literature and Cultural Studies Graduate Student Conference at

the University of New Mexico invites graduate students to examine the manner in which networks

of power, visibility, and technicity shape contemporary forms of social organization, ideological

formations, and cultural narratives. This interdisciplinary conference calls for critical reflection on

the ways media and technology intervene in configurations of identity, articulations of culture,

and modes of community in a globalized world.

As media and digital technologies increasingly shape the way we see and are seen, they become

central to how power is enacted, performed, and resisted. Our networks have become sites of

proliferation of authority, slow violence, and trauma. Digital age globalization speeds up and

intensifies our relational responses while simultaneously providing us with the tools to document

and strategize alternatives out of existential necessity. We are examining and *making public* our

individual and collective intergenerational traumas like never before. Counter-networks allow us

to record, exchange, and bear witness; construct social responses to trauma, and rewrite

histories.We invite graduate students to offer new perspectives on the interchange between visibility,

technology, and power in an increasingly digital world. We aim to explore the grids of vision and

influence produced through media and technological platforms, and how such networks of

technicity enforce, reinforce or challenge hegemonic and ideological formations. By interrogating

social responses to and integrations of technology, as well as its role in perpetuating or disrupting

cultural hegemony, we seek to foster a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of power and

collective trauma within global systems. We welcome papers from the fields of literary, cultural,

cinema, visual, and emergent digital media studies. Contributions that come from the disciplines

of Philosophy, Classical Studies, History, Anthropology, and Political Science are equally

welcome. Participants may consider technically mediated cultural and linguistic imperialisms,

their effects on marginalized communities, as well as the interplay between technological

change, the subject, and the *polis*. They are invited to rethink established frameworks, expand

boundaries, and contribute to the evolving discussions within the humanities and social

sciences, all the while considering the broader implications of their research in today's

technologically mediated society.

**Paper topics may include but are not limited to:**

• Networks, machines, mechanisms, apparatuses, and techniques (of vision and visibility,

ideology, hegemony, information, soft power, coercion, violence, warfare, and trauma)

• Networks, machines, mechanisms, apparatuses, and techniques (of counter-violence,

strategic interventions, resistance)

• Counter-networks, counter-apparatuses, and counter-techniques (of testimony, witness-

bearing, documentation, survivor accounts)

• Artificial Intelligence, Virtual or Augmented Reality

• Classical conceptions of technology

• Techniques/Technicities of self

• Technicity and the environment

• Technicity and modes of ability and capacity

• New media and new social arrangements

• Emergent forms of community and collectivity

• New media and new modes of political life (*tekhnè*, *bios*, and *polis*)

• Representations of any of the above in literary, cinematic, and cultural texts or the plastic

arts

**Conference Structure**

The conference will be in-person, consisting of a plenary roundtable, panels, the keynote

address, and a closing discussion led by the keynote speaker. Panel presentations will be 20

minutes in length, plus discussion time (10 minutes). There will also be a closing reception on

Saturday evening, which is open to all participants and audience members.

I have the ""Unknown Display"" bug on my laptop running Mint, and, alas, various fixes found on the net are not working for me. Can anyone help?

Specifically, when I run the ""Display"" preferences applet, I get an extra display -- in addition to the built-in display in my laptop and any I am plugged into via HDMI -- called ""Unknown Display"". `xrandr` says it's called `None-2-1`.

This matters to me because the Display applet only allows mirroring if there are exactly 2 displays. When I plug into a projector, I have (it thinks) 3 displays, thanks to the ""Unknown Display"", so I cannot mirror.

I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmint/comments/1f86ayz/that_unknown_display_doesnt_exist/) from September 2024 on this sub. It says this is a known bug, and user /u/MintAlone linked to [this fix](https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?p=2512371#p2512371), which involves adding a line to `/lib/udev/rules.d/71-u-d-c-gpu-detection.rules`. However, that line is already in the file on my system.

And [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmint/comments/1gaglgf/the_2nd_display_is_unknown_display_on_thinkpad/) from October 2024 involved a docking station, which I am not using.

I also found a solution that involved adding an entry to `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-monitor.conf`:

    Section 'Monitor'
        Identifier 'None-2-1'
        Option 'Ignore' 'true'
    EndSection

But when I try that and reboot, X will not start at all.

Trouble uploading VRP layer to ArcGIS Online,gis,1i0lucg,2025-01-13 14:10:53,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/1i0lucg/trouble_uploading_vrp_layer_to_arcgis_online/,alexpantaziss,Esri,"Hello everyone! I've created a VRP (Vehicle Routing Problem) layer that includes orders, depots, and routes. I'd like to upload this layer to ArcGIS Online so I can incorporate it into a StoryMap. However, I’ve encountered two main issues:

1. Sharing the VRP layer directly to ArcGIS Online appears to be unsupported or not functioning properly.
2. I don’t want to share just the individual route layers, as I’d end up with 77 different routes rather than a single map view.

Does anyone have advice on how to properly upload the complete VRP layer (orders, depots, and routes) so it displays as one solid map in ArcGIS Online (and subsequently in StoryMaps)?

Higher Nitec ITE to Poly,SGExams,1i0fn0b,2025-01-13 09:51:09,2,0.75,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1i0fn0b/higher_nitec_ite_to_poly/,Striking_Vegetable23,Polytechnic :snoo_dealwithit:,"Higher Nitec ITE to Poly

Hi I am currently waiting for JPAE AY2025, I took Higher Nitec Cyber & Network Security with a CGPA of 2.1 with no CCA points and I plan on applying to SP EEE or common engineering because I’ve lost interest in IT. As the course is not that related may I know what are the odds of getting in? 

I heard that now Higher Nitec Requirements are 2.5 and above to get into polytechnic so I would like to enquire about those courses with 2.0-2.5 average GPA bands. Will I be in favour of getting accepted those course?"
Re-introducing myself and my (now two) partners!,FictoLove,1hzxcd8,2025-01-12 16:22:00,53,0.96,7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hzxcd8,80sgeek06,Celebration,"Hello! I’m sure some of you guys are already quite familiar with me and my posts; though I just realized… Well, I never made an official introduction to me, have I?

So, consider this a late but… informative introduction to me, myself, and I!

My name is Mal! I go by all pronouns, as I am genderfluid with an unlabeled sexuality. I am also autistic, if you didn’t guess LOL. My main interest is movies, lost media, and the 80s, if you couldn’t guess by my username hehe

As of March 27th, 2024, I have been in a relationship with Dark Helmet, the main antagonist from the 1987 film Spaceballs. He’s the commander of the ship, Spaceball-One, and can be described as being whiny, stubborn, manchild, and quite the comedian without knowing it. This movie and him had helped me through some dark times of my life, and I’m so thankful for him to be at my side.

I’m sure you are all familiar with him and our relationship at this point, but recently, there is someone special that has been added to the picture, and I’m excited for you all to get to know him.

Meet Bill Needle, a character from the sketch comedy series SCTV, running from 1976 to 1984. Bill Needle is SCTV networks ‘critic at large’ in the city of Melonville. Needle is the host of many shows… and all of them being unable to last more than 2 episodes, due to Needle and his hot-headed temper, making him quite infamous within Melonville. 

Needle has been under my radar for quite some time now, but that interest has began to grow I believe starting November. It’s been sort of up and down with him, I admit. Kind of like a hate-love thing that’s been going on. But with that all out of the way, I can officially state that as of January 12th, 2025, I am in a polyamorous relationship with Dark Helmet and Bill Needle.

Damn, my type in men is really apparent, isn’t it? Short men with glasses but huge ego’s…

Anyways, I’ve always been insecure about being in a relationship with more than one person; seriously the poly hate is exhausting. But I’m proud and happy to say that this is who I am and I’ve never been happier to be loved by two very special boys. I hope you all are willing to accept this new step in my relationship, and while we’re at it, I’ll be excited to tell you all about Needle and the many antics he has gotten himself into 🤍‼️"
Certifications for a beginner with a clearance  ,ITCareerQuestions,1hzkiis,2025-01-12 06:10:32,3,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/1hzkiis/certifications_for_a_beginner_with_a_clearance/,Suspicious-Use-9295,,"Hey guys,

Right now I have an active TS/SCI and poly and I am working as an analyst for an agency here in the US as a contractor (not a federal employee). 

I am looking to switch career paths into tech, specifically IT. I have a degree in a non technical field and some post graduate research work. 

I am not really satisfied with my current job, its fine as a first foot in the door but it is mind numbingly boring and there isn't much room for advancement unless I wanted to be a manager. 

I wanted to ask if anybody here has any insights into what certs I should keep an eye out for?

I am currently studying for the Sec+ and I am almost done with Messer/Dion. So far it feels easier than I thought it would be, and I am really enjoying it!

  
My only tech related experience is that I do a lot of codecademy just for fun, but I have been told this is basically useless professionally. 

I understand that the Sec+ is the bare minimum for government work, and so I want to get more certs after I am done.  

Some people I know have told me the follwing things:

* Get your CCNA and get into networking

* Get into cloud stuff (usually they say for the money)

Do you guys have any insights into what the next cert may be for me? 

I know that Sec+ by itself with 0 experience will not get me a job, and of course I would be applying to junior roles. CCNA seems like the next logical step, although I know that there are jobs for people with a TS in AWS, and that seems attractive.  

Thank you!"

Comme le titre l'indique, je suis en Suisse et j'ai fini un Bachelor en informatique (networking & systems) dans une HES (je dirais équivalent à un Bachelor/Baccalauréat à l'ETS). J'ai eu de bonnes/très bonnes notes.

  
Je réfléchis à faire une maîtrise professionnelle avec projet 15 crédits à PolyMTL. De ce que j'ai vu en maîtrise pro il n'y a pas de cours de maths/physique mais que des cours ""techniques"", et c'est exactement ce que je cherche. Est-ce qu'il y a une douille ? En général les écoles Polytechnique sont de très bonnes écoles et le niveau de maths est élevé, mais c'est que au baccalauréat/bachelor ?

Sinon, un avis à me donner sur la maîtrise pro en génie des télécoms & réseaux ? Et le niveau de difficulté ?

Merci beaucoup et je prends tout autre conseil que vous jugerez intéressant de me donner :)"

Why Decentralized Collective Wisdom Triumphs,IT4Research,1hxg8jb,2025-01-09 11:10:59,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IT4Research/comments/1hxg8jb/why_decentralized_collective_wisdom_triumphs/,CHY1970,,"**The Myth of Genius:** 

Throughout human history, societies have celebrated the idea of the lone genius—a visionary capable of transcending ordinary thought and driving extraordinary change. From the Renaissance polymaths to modern-day innovators, these figures are often credited with shaping the trajectory of civilization. But is this perception of genius rooted in reality, or does it obscure the true mechanisms that drive progress and survival?

In both nature and society, the narrative of the individual genius falls apart when examined closely. The truth is that decentralized collective wisdom, rather than the brilliance of a single mind, has always been the backbone of success. This article explores the limitations of the genius myth, the role of intelligence as a survival mechanism, and why distributed, collective intelligence aligns better with natural systems and human advancement.

# What Is Genius?

A so-called genius is often viewed as someone with a vast repository of knowledge and the ability to derive new insights from it. This ability to connect dots, summarize patterns, and extrapolate conclusions often makes their contributions appear revolutionary. However, their insights are rarely created in isolation.

Newton, often heralded as a quintessential genius, famously remarked that his achievements were made by ""standing on the shoulders of giants."" His work was deeply influenced by the collective knowledge of his predecessors. Einstein’s theory of relativity, similarly groundbreaking, was built upon the foundational work of scientists like Maxwell and Poincaré.

The achievements of geniuses are not acts of isolated brilliance but the culmination of shared human progress. Knowledge is cumulative, and every breakthrough depends on countless small contributions made by others across time and space.

# The Nature of Intelligence

At its core, intelligence is not a divine gift or an exceptional rarity but a fundamental survival mechanism. In biological terms, intelligence is the ability of neural networks to model external signals, anticipate changes in the environment, and adapt accordingly.

For humans, this modeling is complex, encompassing abstract thought, creativity, and problem-solving. But even in its simplest forms, intelligence exists throughout nature:

* **Ant colonies** collectively solve problems like foraging and nest building without central control.
* **Flocks of birds** navigate vast migrations through decentralized coordination.
* **Bees** optimize their hive’s productivity through distributed decision-making.

These systems exemplify decentralized collective wisdom. They thrive because no single individual bears the burden of decision-making. Instead, the group’s survival relies on the interconnected contributions of many.

# The Failure of Genius-Centric Systems

Despite nature’s clear preference for distributed intelligence, human societies often fall into the trap of centralizing power and decision-making in the hands of a perceived genius or singular leader. This approach is inherently flawed for several reasons:

1. **Cognitive Limits:** No individual, no matter how intelligent, can fully grasp the complexity of a system as vast as a society or ecosystem. Attempting to do so leads to oversimplifications and errors.
2. **Fragility:** Centralized systems are fragile because they depend heavily on the competence of a single point of failure. If the leader falters, the entire system risks collapse.
3. **Suppressing Diversity:** The genius-centric model often sidelines diverse perspectives, which are essential for innovation and resilience. Collective wisdom, by contrast, thrives on diversity, allowing for a broader range of solutions to emerge.

History provides countless examples of the failure of genius-centric or authoritarian systems. Dictatorships and autocracies, often justified by the supposed brilliance of a single leader, have repeatedly led to stagnation, inefficiency, and collapse.

# The Superiority of Decentralized Collective Wisdom

Decentralized systems, where decision-making and problem-solving are distributed across many individuals, align more closely with the principles of natural selection and adaptability. Here’s why:

1. **Scalability:** Collective intelligence scales naturally. As more individuals contribute, the system gains more data points, enhancing its ability to adapt and evolve.
2. **Resilience:** Distributed systems are more robust against failure. The loss of a single node does not compromise the entire network.
3. **Innovation:** Decentralized systems encourage diversity of thought and experimentation, leading to greater innovation. Open-source software development, for instance, thrives on the contributions of a global, decentralized community.
4. **Alignment with Natural Systems:** Nature itself operates on decentralized principles. Ecosystems, neural networks, and even the internet all function as distributed systems, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach.

# Wisdom Beyond the Individual

The idea that intelligence is solely an individual trait is misleading. Intelligence—whether human or collective—is a function of interaction, feedback, and adaptation. Modern advancements in technology and AI underscore this point. Machine learning models, for example, are not powered by a single genius algorithm but by vast networks of data, iterative improvements, and collective contributions from researchers worldwide.

In the human context, no individual can solve the world’s most pressing challenges—climate change, global inequality, or pandemics—alone. These problems require collective intelligence, interdisciplinary collaboration, and decentralized decision-making.

# The Path Forward

Recognizing the limitations of the genius myth does not diminish the value of individual contributions but places them in their proper context. To build a future aligned with the principles of decentralized collective wisdom, we must:

* **Encourage Collaboration:** Foster environments where diverse perspectives can contribute and interact.
* **Decentralize Power:** Shift decision-making away from centralized authorities to more distributed, community-driven models.
* **Embrace Complexity:** Invest in understanding systems dynamics and designing solutions that account for interconnections and feedback loops.
* **Leverage Technology:** Use tools like AI to amplify collective intelligence rather than concentrating power in a few hands.

# Conclusion

The myth of the lone genius persists in human culture, but it is a misrepresentation of how progress is truly made. Intelligence, at its essence, is a decentralized phenomenon—a web of interactions that collectively create something greater than the sum of its parts.

Nature’s blueprint for success is clear: distributed systems, collaborative networks, and collective wisdom. By aligning our societal structures with these principles, we can move away from the fragile and shortsighted reliance on individual brilliance and toward a more resilient, equitable, and innovative future.

The age of the genius may be over, but the age of collective wisdom has just begun.

I'm also autistic so nonverbal cues are sometimes hard, so I could be misreading conversations by taking them at face value or focusing on unimportant details, I don't know.

Some context about my own limited previous experiences with polyamory, skip this paragraph if you don't want the context: I am personally new to polyamory. I tried being in an open relationship awhile back and it just didn't work because of communication and safer sex reasons, and at one point I did do a throuple, but that also ended in a dumpster fire, and I'm aware those don't usually ""count"" as typical polyamory, so I'm going to say I'm new to poly. I do have several close friends (and my boss) who are in various differed forms of polyamory/polycules, and I am somewhat familiar with how things typically work, but my friends are dealing with a lot of personal stuff and I don't feel comfy going to my boss about this specific thing, despite him knowing I started being poly because I wanted basic advice at first. 

Key:
New Partner: M
Original Mono Partner: C

Some context about my previous history with my new partner (M): Putting this first because I knew my new partner first, years ago. Please note, this probably won't paint me in the best light because this wasn't exactly ethical and was definitely emotional cheating, whether or not I was in an extremely controlling and abusive (physical, s3xu@l, verbal, psychological abuse, also forcing me back in the closet in regards to being a transman (forcing me to act and dress female-presenting), fully gaslighting me about cheating, etc.) relationship at the time with a partner I was unfortunately reliant on for a place to live and had nowhere to go. I have a lot of regrets about some of the decisions made in this time of my life. When I was 22, about to turn 23, I was in a very abusive relationship and mourning the recent death of my grandfather. I needed a change of scenery, and my cousin kept urging me to apply for a job at the restaurant she worked at (not fast food, but full service with multiple kinds of cooks, with hosts, servers, dedicated to go people, and dishwashers; very busy place). Long story short, I begrudgingly, eventually applied and was hired basically the same day, for the dishwashing position. M (who had JUST turned 23 at the time, we're about six months apart) was a cook there, and everyone kinda warned me right off the bat that he was fairly antisocial and not to bother trying to make friends or anything (I'm a very bubbly, upbeat, friendly person outwardly as like a way of masking but also I just try to have a positive outlook on everyday life because I'm depressed and faking it helps? I don't know.), so I mostly steered clear of him aside from very limited work talk like ""where do you want these,"" ""do you want me to wash these?"" ""Thank you/you're welcome"" type stuff until one day when we had a call out in dish and since M had started in the dish room, one of the managers asked M to stay and help myself and the lady I was closing with (who had trained him in dish originally, I found out) close, since he was done closing his line, and we were so behind. We hit it off immediately, clicked so well, and he started talking to me like I had never seen him talk to anyone else in that building, it's been almost exactly 7 years, and I can still remember parts of this conversation and how it made me feel. We ended up talking in the parking lot, sitting in his car, after work until the sun actually came up, which ... Caused rumors at work. We were instant best friends, and everyone at work was convinced we were hooking up. M eventually convinced them to let me train him in the area where he was (making the bread) and then we were basically just spending 8 hours shifts together back there alone and then spending another five-seven just talking in the parking lot after, which eventually led to us hanging out at his like... Spiritual mentor/guru's house or local parks and stuff, like this person became my actual best friend. We were both (very obviously to each other and to everyone around us which caused some issues) super attracted to each other and crushing really hard but the entire two years we were friends, nothing ever happened beyond like a kiss on the forehead, some really long hugs/almost cuddling on his mentor person's couch, and occasional hand-holding. We had some difficult conversations about feelings and he would always say one thing but act another way or say one thing one day and then say another the next? Just very mixed signals. For example, I had multiple times offered to try to find a place to go, to leave my ex so things would be less complicated for us to figure out our feelings basically (we weren't dating), and some days he would be on board and would like offer to let me come live with him (he had his own house he was trying to fix up to sell or something, I don't remember why) until I could get on my feet, either romantically or not. But then some days we would have the same conversation and he would just get frustrated and angry and say for me to do whatever I wanted, that it was none of his business and that he didn't need to know what I was thinking about doing and had no interest in hearing me complain. This made me feel... Very uncomfortable about actually leaving my ex because I really had nowhere I could go at the time. Our job didn't pay me enough to just get my own place, and I was limited on friends or family who could help (and I hate asking for help anyway) because my ex had forced me to cut off or had created issues for me with so many people or my family just wasn't capable of helping at that time, if that makes sense? (To be clear, I'm not blaming M for me staying with my ex, or anything, really, just saying the solution he was offering, which was one of the only ones being offered, wasn't very stable, so I didn't feel very secure in that option.) Another example, sometimes he would tell me all of the things he wanted to do with me (romantically/sexually) and how he felt about me, and then thirty minutes later would be telling me he was abstaining from everything relationship and sex related for spiritual and life goal reasons because it was a distraction and would hold him back? Just constantly contradicting himself. Feelings got more intense, and the more intense they got on both sides, the more drastic his hot and cold mood swings got, to the point where he went from basically cuddling me and leaning it like he was almost going to kiss me to basically pushing me away and screaming at me about how we weren't together, and then he slowly started distancing himself from me? We would hang out less, he switched jobs (because of going back to college and needing different availability, he claims to this day it had nothing to do with me), and he would seem distracted when we talked, and shorter and more to the point with his texts and phone calls. Like a very slow, a little forced ghosting more than a drifting apart?? We eventually just stopped seeing each other after a little under two years ish total, but didn't have an actual friend breakup or anything. I ran into him one more time before he made this monumental move out of state (he'd been talking about doing this for a long time). Basically he ran into my ex (who I was still dating because I suck) at a coffee shop M and I used to frequent together, and ended up playing chess with my ex (who M recognized from meeting him at our work and from Facebook posts) and his brother basically to slowly bring me up and dig for information about me. My ex eventually called me to tell me that my friend from cracker barrel was there and I remember just absolutely racing over there, feeling like my heart was in my stomach, I didn't know what M was going to say to my ex about us, or about my ex (M knew a lot about my abuse at home and hated my ex), and I didn't know what M would say to my face, but I wanted to see him?? Conversation was awkward but like ... Longing, I guess, full of those ""we should hang out, text me"" vibes but you know neither of you is going to? And then he left for the other state like a month to four months later. We never tried making plans in that time. (This was so long and still doesn't really cover it but I'm trying to not write a novel here)

Some context about my history and relationship with my previous monogamous partner (C) who is now my nesting partner(new to terminology, sorry?) before this situation started: Shorter because there are just less necessary details and this is already so long, but I was still with my ex in 2022 (spent most of my adult life with that guy) and things had not substantially improved and some really messed up stuff had happened that I couldn't even wrap my head around or justify and we were just growing apart/having a lot of serious problems, like worse than before honestly, and neither of us were helping the situation because I'd started getting fed up and not treating him super great but I think it was just me not caring about the situation anymore? We had joined a dungeons and dragons group at a local game shop where I met C. We were just friends, but became very close friends to the point where my ex had a problem with it. Upon realizing how toxic my relationship was, C encouraged me to leave him and move in with my mom, actually helped me pack (situation had changed by this point and I could move home now but couldn't when I was working with M), and was basically my shoulder to cry on/vent to during the breakup and after when I might have gone back or not gone through with it otherwise. I might actually owe my life to him because the abuse was getting... A lot worse. (My ex had pulled a gun on me a few times and threatened to kill me and the beatings had gotten worse.) Eventually, we started dating a good while after I left my ex and have been together not quite two years but close as of the beginning of this current story. C ended up having to move in with my mother and I due to his mother's addiction issues and him having nowhere to go. He was abused verbally, emotionally, and sexually as a child and is very closed off and has poor communication skills, which makes things hard because I'm autistic and not great at dragging things out of people if I can't tell anything is wrong in the first place and they keep denying something is wrong when I ask. He's also touching/sex-repulsed at times and identifies as ace/graysexual and is very selective about what he wants to do/if he wants to be touched/where and how often, but I respect that and it doesn't affect our relationship too much. The communication issues and the fact that we're crammed in one room of my mother's house for almost two years now are much bigger issues than any of that, just thought it was worth mentioning. An issue is that I never know how he's feeling or what he's thinking, and often when I'm upset about something, C has a hard time understanding or relating or empathizing or doing any more than just listening like I'm talking to a brick wall and then just completely ignoring everything I've said and changing the subject entirely, and that's probably the only issue we really have but it's substantial? (This is going to come into play in the actual situation in a second because polyamory is ... Really based in open and honest communication from what I understand? So I promise I'm not complaining just to complain.) C has had... Mixed feelings about me being trans (when we first met, I was shoved into the closet still and then was wondering if I was genderfluid because of so long of being gaslit by my ex into thinking me being trans had been a phase? So the transition in his brain from me being genderfluid to just male has been hard for him?) and claims to not care necessarily but doesn't use the right terms (calls me girlfriend) or pronouns most of the time. I had to correct him multiple times and have several long conversations about it and how it makes me feel before he started even trying to put in more of an effort. Things were rocky with his family at first but are better now. I also work with his sister at my job. My mother loves him and has been very defensive of him in our relationship, to the point where it has become a little upsetting because it feels like they gang up on me sometimes. We are (or at least were; I don't know what's going on anymore) trying to get a place and move out, but this economy sucks and my current job is okay ish, but his is super not great and he is pretty bad about spending everything he makes if I'm being honest, despite living here for free (I pay rent to my mom and help with some of the bills, but he doesn't contribute beyond some groceries and gas. We have had some differences in opinion lately on some very big life goals. I want to get married soon and start thinking about wanting kids (once we're financially capable, obviously, but within the next five years) (adopted or surrogate or me carrying, I haven't decided), and he is just very attached to this young person, play video games and do what he wants when he wants to lifestyle and doesn't want to commit to me or to ever having children of any kind ever. This is a newer development in our relationship that I have been having a really hard time with because he used to want to get married, but has seemingly changed his mind, and used to talk about the possibility of kids a little more neutrally, rather than as a hard no. 

The story leading up to this transition to polyamory: In the spring of 2024, after four years of radio silence, M reached out to me over Facebook messenger to catch up and apologize for treating me so poorly back in the day and let me know how everything was going in their life. They were in a field that they were really passionate about, doing a really great job out there, had found a good social network of close friends, and had come out as poly/ambiamorous and bigender. (M uses he/she/they pronouns interchangeably now, but I used he in the backstory because I just thought that would be less confusing) At first I was really panicky about talking to them, but everything seemed a lot less toxic and normal (they could be a little toxic back in the day but still a lot better compared to my ex), not like they wanted anything from me other than just to reconnect and genuinely see how I was doing. I was open and honest about who this person was to me to C from the moment M messaged me, but was adamant that while I had been in love with this person and they had their claws in me pretty deep at one time, I had never actually been involved involved with them, just heavy courting, I guess, and that I didn't expect anything would come of it and that I would tell C if anything inappropriate was discussed or advances were made. C trusts me inherently, almost to a fault, so that wasn't an issue. M and I talked on and off but both of us deal with depression so there were sometimes month long gaps in our conversations, but around the holidays, M messaged me to tell me they were coming home for the holidays to see family and wanted to see me if they could while they were home just to catch up in person and to have an escape from their parents house while they were home for a week to avoid cabin fever. I asked C if it was okay, and he said it was fine. I offered to let him come, he didn't want to. Plans were made. I let M know (or reminded them at least) that I had a partner, and we were monogamous, just to avoid any confusion, and they said they respected my relationship boundaries and would not behave inappropriately and we even had a nice conversation about my partner and how we met and all of that good stuff. So I thought everything was cool. We hung out, did a ton of talking (got coffee and then went to a park and then dinner and then a bookstore) (like 10+ hours) and I got a lot of closure for why they had acted the way they were acting back then and just a lot of closure in general (they were in a secret relationship that was kind of open but abusive and codependent back then, had unresolved trauma from sexual abuse in their childhood and teens, and were used to being used and left and me being in my relationship made them feel very insecure, things that legitimately made sense and made me feel better about getting ghosted and all of the mixed signals), so I was feeling pretty okay by the end of the day. I want to say they flew in on Wednesday and this was the Thursday they were home. Friday was their birthday, and I didn't see them, but I called to wish them a happy birthday before they went to bed. They had unfortunately caught the flu on the plane and were having to quarantine, and I'd already had it this season because I work with the public, so I offered to come over to their parents' house and sit with them after work on Saturday. We just talked and listened to music and had some difficult conversations about past feelings and events, and just did more talking, but nothing inappropriate was discussed really. C was fine with me going, and I checked in multiple times while I was there. My mother was not fine with it and ended up calling and texting me multiple times, which I didn't see until I was leaving, due to my phone still being on silent from being at work. (I always call my mom or someone when I'm driving somewhere if I'm alone, I don't know why.) She made a really big deal out of me going and hanging out with M and staying gone most of the night (I got off around 7pm ish and left their house probably close to midnight, but my sleep schedule is kinda messed up and I don't go to bed until 2-4am most nights). The next day, M and I hung out (with C's blessing) and then picked up C, so we could do last minute Christmas shopping together, and the two of them could meet finally because my mother thought it would be healthy and M wanted to meet C. C didn't really care one way or the other, but didn't mind? M also met my mother when we were picking up C from my house, which, I believe, is the first time in all of these years that they had ever met. C & M seemed to get along okay and talked quite a bit, joking around. I was glad they were at least trying to be friends. We hung out for awhile doing the Christmas shopping, and then I dropped C back off at home and took M back to their car, but we ended up sitting in the car talking for a really long time, and at some point, I had an epiphany and finally recognized what I'd been feeling all week as the same exact feelings I'd always had for M? Which was upsetting. I'd been mistaking it for just normal excitement and happiness to see a friend, but no, it was just like I'd stepped into a time machine to 2018, and they'd never left my life. It was the same exact feeling, so I had a lot of feelings to process when I got home that night. I guess some of it could be akin to NRE despite nothing happening happening but it's not a new person or a new crush?? It's 7 years old? So I don't know. I also had ended up catching the flu anyway, so it must have been a different strain or something, and M offered for me to swing by their house the next morning to get the rest of their medicine since they couldn't take it back on the plane. I did, once again with C's blessing. At this point, I was mostly trying to ignore my feelings, even as I was sitting in their living room talking to their parents, getting a full tour of their house and garden, and sitting talking to them in their old bedroom. Everything somewhat felt like it was out of a dream, but I tried my best to remain composed and act appropriately, but at the forefront of my mind, I just kept thinking that they were leaving for the airport the next day. I was actively panicky, having feelings of dread and making myself nauseous. I really didn't want them to go. I didn't even want to go to work. I just wanted to be beside them until the last possible second, which was when I acknowledged that I really, genuinely had a problem to deal with because I kept trying to put down these feelings, and it just wasn't working at all. I ended up, idiotically, volunteering to take them to the airport in the morning, despite knowing I wouldn't get off work until like 2:45 am and they had to be at the airport before 8:30 am, so it was decided I would sleep at M's house (in a different room from where M was staying) to save time travelling in the morning. (I checked in with C; he didn't care.) Except M didn't sleep in the other room. They just sat up with me talking until like an hour before we were supposed to get up and we ended up napping on the bed I was supposed to be sleeping in. When I woke up, we were in a bit of a cuddling position, but we didn't go to sleep that way, so I kinda shrugged it off. The drive to the airport was like driving to my death though, and by the time we got there, we were both close to crying. I actually did cry. We hugged for a really long time, and I just didn't want to let them go. M did end up going, but there was a second when I thought he was going to change his mind. The next day, he confessed that he was still in love with me and wanted to not only be with me, and when asked how serious he was about that (because I was confused), he said he wanted to marry me one day, that he always had, and started asking me if I could ever consider moving to the city he lives in. Shocked, and not thinking clearly because I'd been waiting 7 years for this man to confess his feelings to me outright, I basically said this was coming out of nowhere, moving really fast, that I didn't know what was going on anymore, and that I could hypothetically consider moving, but thankfully did acknowledge that I really needed to talk to C asap, because I was confused and conflicted about a lot of feelings I was having. M kept suggesting I ask if we could just try being poly, because M is poly/ambi and was very open to the idea. I eventually brought it up to C when I could, and at first C was very against the idea, like immediately, so I tried explaining the differences between an open relationship and poly and C seemed more willing to break up (despite living with my mother and I and having nowhere to go) than even trying the poly, and I didn't want to do any kind of poly under duress type situation so I basically said I thought we needed a break so I could figure things out then and started crying (not like in a guilt trippy way but just I was really upset because I do love both of them and was genuinely not sure what to do in the current situation, but things were going too far, and I needed to figure things out before progressing any further at all) and he held me for awhile, and then finally said we could try since I couldn't seem to choose so it kinda seems like the poly has happened in lieu of a break but said they would let me know if they had an actual problem with it, and I asked multiple times if it was okay before I told M? 

The current situation: M is a big fan of Kitchen Table Poly, while C seems to just not want to know anything about the other situation and wants to pretend it isn't happening, so M isn't super happy about C not wanting to communicate or be friends with M. C seems to be okay but not overly happy/was already having some mild seasonal depression, but I've been checking in on C often to see how they're feeling, but I feel like he's being dishonest. I asked multiple times if they want to reevaluate the situation or if C is just stealth breaking up with me or something, and C says he's actually ""fully committed to the relationship and trying to hang onto the relationship with everything that he has,"" which is worrisome in itself. C also claims to not be jealous of M in any way and to not feel neglected? Tbb, in general, since I have M to rant to, C and I have actually been fighting less because I'm not having to deal with C's emotional constipation every time I need to vent about something? I genuinely think it's been better for my emotional state, balancing the two, but I worry about C. M is fine with pretty much everything, but worries C will change his mind about the open relationship and is upset that anytime I try to have a boundaries talk with C, he just says he ""doesn't care,"" and to ""not be weird,"" which is just too vague to go off of. I've been told I'm allowed to fly out to go see M at the end of January (I asked permission), but I don't even know if we're allowed to do physical stuff or not, because C won't talk to me about it at all. ... I feel like the reason C might be okay with it is because M lives so far away and they aren't a part of our everyday lives aside from me texting and calling them, but I recently (this week) found out that M is coming home with me when I fly out there due to the health of one of their parents declining. They have asked me to cancel my return flight and drive back with them so they can move home. I worry about ... All of this, but I especially worry about how M coming home will affect our fragile relationship dynamic. M has also talked about the three of us living together, and C is absolutely not receptive because C thinks it will put him in a bad situation, because if we break up, he won't have anywhere to go (but that's the situation currently because we live with MY mom), but says I can live with M and continue to date C? But I don't know if this is supposed to be passive aggressive or what but he claims he's being genuine?? C doesn't really have anywhere to go, so I wonder if he would just continue to live with my mother? We have not told my mother about the poly... Thing. M keeps calling it a parallel poly hinge but that's just word soup to me. Currently it feels a little mono/poly because neither of them are trying to date anyone else (but I haven't forbidden it, it just doesn't seem like they're interested in seeing other people)

TLDR: Had a strong mutual connection with someone 7 years ago when I was in an abusive relationship but never did anything with it, they recently reappeared into my life, I realized I still had feelings, and my mono partner and I have decided to be poly so I can long distance date this other person. I feel like I'm neglecting everyone's needs and boundaries. My new partner is suddenly having to move home due to family issues and wants to (eventually) be a nesting partner and maybe marry me and have kids. My current nesting partner doesn't want to marry/have kids/ nest with my new partner, despite being invited to live with us by my new partner. We currently live with my mom, so I don't know where my current nesting partner would go. I'm trying so hard to keep everyone happy, but communication isn't happening despite me trying.

When I was 22, about to turn 23, I was in a very abusive relationship and mourning the recent death of my grandfather. I needed a change of scenery, and my cousin kept urging me to apply for a job at the restaurant she worked at (not fast food, but full service with multiple kinds of cooks, with hosts, servers, dedicated to go people, and dishwashers; very busy place). Long story short, I begrudgingly, eventually applied and was hired basically the same day, for the dishwashing position. M (who had JUST turned 23 at the time, we're about six months apart) was a cook there, and everyone kinda warned me right off the bat that he was fairly antisocial and not to bother trying to make friends or anything (I'm a very bubbly, upbeat, friendly person outwardly as like a way of masking but also I just try to have a positive outlook on everyday life because I'm depressed and faking it helps? I don't know.), so I mostly steered clear of him aside from very limited work talk like ""where do you want these,"" ""do you want me to wash these?"" ""Thank you/you're welcome"" type stuff until one day when we had a call out in dish and since M had started in the dish room, one of the managers asked M to stay and help myself and the lady I was closing with (who had trained him in dish originally, I found out) close, since he was done closing his line, and we were so behind. We hit it off immediately, clicked so well, and he started talking to me like I had never seen him talk to anyone else in that building, it's been almost exactly 7 years, and I can still remember parts of this conversation and how it made me feel. We ended up talking in the parking lot, sitting in his car, after work until the sun actually came up, which ... Caused rumors at work. We were instant best friends, and everyone at work was convinced we were hooking up. M eventually convinced them to let me train him in the area where he was (making the bread) and then we were basically just spending 8 hours shifts together back there alone and then spending another five-seven just talking in the parking lot after, which eventually led to us hanging out at his like... Spiritual mentor/guru's house or local parks and stuff, like this person became my actual best friend. We were both (very obviously to each other and to everyone around us which caused some issues) super attracted to each other and crushing really hard but the entire two years we were friends, nothing ever happened beyond like a kiss on the forehead, some really long hugs/almost cuddling on his mentor person's couch, and occasional hand-holding. We had some difficult conversations about feelings and he would always say one thing but act another way or say one thing one day and then say another the next? Just very mixed signals. For example, I had multiple times offered to try to find a place to go, to leave my ex so things would be less complicated for us to figure out our feelings basically (we weren't dating), and some days he would be on board and would like offer to let me come live with him (he had his own house he was trying to fix up to sell or something, I don't remember why) until I could get on my feet, either romantically or not. But then some days we would have the same conversation and he would just get frustrated and angry and say for me to do whatever I wanted, that it was none of his business and that he didn't need to know what I was thinking about doing and had no interest in hearing me complain. This made me feel... Very uncomfortable about actually leaving my ex because I really had nowhere I could go at the time. Our job didn't pay me enough to just get my own place, and I was limited on friends or family who could help (and I hate asking for help anyway) because my ex had forced me to cut off or had created issues for me with so many people or my family just wasn't capable of helping at that time, if that makes sense? (To be clear, I'm not blaming M for me staying with my ex, or anything, really, just saying the solution he was offering, which was one of the only ones being offered, wasn't very stable, so I didn't feel very secure in that option.) Another example, sometimes he would tell me all of the things he wanted to do with me (romantically/sexually) and how he felt about me, and then thirty minutes later would be telling me he was abstaining from everything relationship and sex related for spiritual and life goal reasons because it was a distraction and would hold him back? Just constantly contradicting himself. Feelings got more intense, and the more intense they got on both sides, the more drastic his hot and cold mood swings got, to the point where he went from basically cuddling me and leaning it like he was almost going to kiss me to basically pushing me away and screaming at me about how we weren't together, and then he slowly started distancing himself from me? We would hang out less, he switched jobs (because of going back to college and needing different availability, he claims to this day it had nothing to do with me), and he would seem distracted when we talked, and shorter and more to the point with his texts and phone calls. Like a very slow, a little forced ghosting more than a drifting apart?? We eventually just stopped seeing each other after a little under two years ish total, but didn't have an actual friend breakup or anything. I ran into him one more time before he made this monumental move out of state (he'd been talking about doing this for a long time). Basically he ran into my ex (who I was still dating because I suck) at a coffee shop M and I used to frequent together, and ended up playing chess with my ex (who M recognized from meeting him at our work and from Facebook posts) and his brother basically to slowly bring me up and dig for information about me. My ex eventually called me to tell me that my friend from cracker barrel was there and I remember just absolutely racing over there, feeling like my heart was in my stomach, I didn't know what M was going to say to my ex about us, or about my ex (M knew a lot about my abuse at home and hated my ex), and I didn't know what M would say to my face, but I wanted to see him?? Conversation was awkward but like ... Longing, I guess, full of those ""we should hang out, text me"" vibes but you know neither of you is going to? And then he left for the other state like a month to four months later. We never tried making plans in that time. (This was so long and still doesn't really cover it but I'm trying to not write a novel here)

Some context about my history and relationship with my previous monogamous partner (C) who is now my nesting partner(new to terminology, sorry?) before this situation started: Shorter because there are just less necessary details and this is already so long, but I was still with my ex in 2022 (spent most of my adult life with that guy) and things had not substantially improved and some really messed up stuff had happened that I couldn't even wrap my head around or justify and we were just growing apart/having a lot of serious problems, like worse than before honestly, and neither of us were helping the situation because I'd started getting fed up and not treating him super great but I think it was just me not caring about the situation anymore? We had joined a dungeons and dragons group at a local game shop where I met C. We were just friends, but became very close friends to the point where my ex had a problem with it. Upon realizing how toxic my relationship was, C encouraged me to leave him and move in with my mom, actually helped me pack (situation had changed by this point and I could move home now but couldn't when I was working with M), and was basically my shoulder to cry on/vent to during the breakup and after when I might have gone back or not gone through with it otherwise. I might actually owe my life to him because the abuse was getting... A lot worse. (My ex had pulled a gun on me a few times and threatened to kill me and the beatings had gotten worse.) Eventually, we started dating a good while after I left my ex and have been together not quite two years but close as of the beginning of this current story. C ended up having to move in with my mother and I due to his mother's addiction issues and him having nowhere to go. He was abused verbally, emotionally, and sexually as a child and is very closed off and has poor communication skills, which makes things hard because I'm autistic and not great at dragging things out of people if I can't tell anything is wrong in the first place and they keep denying something is wrong when I ask. He's also touching/sex-repulsed at times and identifies as ace/graysexual and is very selective about what he wants to do/if he wants to be touched/where and how often, but I respect that and it doesn't affect our relationship too much. The communication issues and the fact that we're crammed in one room of my mother's house for almost two years now are much bigger issues than any of that, just thought it was worth mentioning. An issue is that I never know how he's feeling or what he's thinking, and often when I'm upset about something, C has a hard time understanding or relating or empathizing or doing any more than just listening like I'm talking to a brick wall and then just completely ignoring everything I've said and changing the subject entirely, and that's probably the only issue we really have but it's substantial? (This is going to come into play in the actual situation in a second because polyamory is ... Really based in open and honest communication from what I understand? So I promise I'm not complaining just to complain.) C has had... Mixed feelings about me being trans (when we first met, I was shoved into the closet still and then was wondering if I was genderfluid because of so long of being gaslit by my ex into thinking me being trans had been a phase? So the transition in his brain from me being genderfluid to just male has been hard for him?) and claims to not care necessarily but doesn't use the right terms (calls me girlfriend) or pronouns most of the time. I had to correct him multiple times and have several long conversations about it and how it makes me feel before he started even trying to put in more of an effort. Things were rocky with his family at first but are better now. I also work with his sister at my job. My mother loves him and has been very defensive of him in our relationship, to the point where it has become a little upsetting because it feels like they gang up on me sometimes. We are (or at least were; I don't know what's going on anymore) trying to get a place and move out, but this economy sucks and my current job is okay ish, but his is super not great and he is pretty bad about spending everything he makes if I'm being honest, despite living here for free (I pay rent to my mom and help with some of the bills, but he doesn't contribute beyond some groceries and gas. We have had some differences in opinion lately on some very big life goals. I want to get married soon and start thinking about wanting kids (once we're financially capable, obviously, but within the next five years) (adopted or surrogate or me carrying, I haven't decided), and he is just very attached to this young person, play video games and do what he wants when he wants to lifestyle and doesn't want to commit to me or to ever having children of any kind ever. This is a newer development in our relationship that I have been having a really hard time with because he used to want to get married, but has seemingly changed his mind, and used to talk about the possibility of kids a little more neutrally, rather than as a hard no. 

The story leading up to this transition to polyamory: In the spring of 2024, after four years of radio silence, M reached out to me over Facebook messenger to catch up and apologize for treating me so poorly back in the day and let me know how everything was going in their life. They were in a field that they were really passionate about, doing a really great job out there, had found a good social network of close friends, and had come out as poly/ambiamorous and bigender. (M uses he/she/they pronouns interchangeably now, but I used he in the backstory because I just thought that would be less confusing) At first I was really panicky about talking to them, but everything seemed a lot less toxic and normal (they could be a little toxic back in the day but still a lot better compared to my ex), not like they wanted anything from me other than just to reconnect and genuinely see how I was doing. I was open and honest about who this person was to me to C from the moment M messaged me, but was adamant that while I had been in love with this person and they had their claws in me pretty deep at one time, I had never actually been involved involved with them, just heavy courting, I guess, and that I didn't expect anything would come of it and that I would tell C if anything inappropriate was discussed or advances were made. C trusts me inherently, almost to a fault, so that wasn't an issue. M and I talked on and off but both of us deal with depression so there were sometimes month long gaps in our conversations, but around the holidays, M messaged me to tell me they were coming home for the holidays to see family and wanted to see me if they could while they were home just to catch up in person and to have an escape from their parents house while they were home for a week to avoid cabin fever. I asked C if it was okay, and he said it was fine. I offered to let him come, he didn't want to. Plans were made. I let M know (or reminded them at least) that I had a partner, and we were monogamous, just to avoid any confusion, and they said they respected my relationship boundaries and would not behave inappropriately and we even had a nice conversation about my partner and how we met and all of that good stuff. So I thought everything was cool. We hung out, did a ton of talking (got coffee and then went to a park and then dinner and then a bookstore) (like 10+ hours) and I got a lot of closure for why they had acted the way they were acting back then and just a lot of closure in general (they were in a secret relationship that was kind of open but abusive and codependent back then, had unresolved trauma from sexual abuse in their childhood and teens, and were used to being used and left and me being in my relationship made them feel very insecure, things that legitimately made sense and made me feel better about getting ghosted and all of the mixed signals), so I was feeling pretty okay by the end of the day. I want to say they flew in on Wednesday and this was the Thursday they were home. Friday was their birthday, and I didn't see them, but I called to wish them a happy birthday before they went to bed. They had unfortunately caught the flu on the plane and were having to quarantine, and I'd already had it this season because I work with the public, so I offered to come over to their parents' house and sit with them after work on Saturday. We just talked and listened to music and had some difficult conversations about past feelings and events, and just did more talking, but nothing inappropriate was discussed really. C was fine with me going, and I checked in multiple times while I was there. My mother was not fine with it and ended up calling and texting me multiple times, which I didn't see until I was leaving, due to my phone still being on silent from being at work. (I always call my mom or someone when I'm driving somewhere if I'm alone, I don't know why.) She made a really big deal out of me going and hanging out with M and staying gone most of the night (I got off around 7pm ish and left their house probably close to midnight, but my sleep schedule is kinda messed up and I don't go to bed until 2-4am most nights). The next day, M and I hung out (with C's blessing) and then picked up C, so we could do last minute Christmas shopping together, and the two of them could meet finally because my mother thought it would be healthy and M wanted to meet C. C didn't really care one way or the other, but didn't mind? M also met my mother when we were picking up C from my house, which, I believe, is the first time in all of these years that they had ever met. C & M seemed to get along okay and talked quite a bit, joking around. I was glad they were at least trying to be friends. We hung out for awhile doing the Christmas shopping, and then I dropped C back off at home and took M back to their car, but we ended up sitting in the car talking for a really long time, and at some point, I had an epiphany and finally recognized what I'd been feeling all week as the same exact feelings I'd always had for M? Which was upsetting. I'd been mistaking it for just normal excitement and happiness to see a friend, but no, it was just like I'd stepped into a time machine to 2018, and they'd never left my life. It was the same exact feeling, so I had a lot of feelings to process when I got home that night. I guess some of it could be akin to NRE despite nothing happening happening but it's not a new person or a new crush?? It's 7 years old? So I don't know. I also had ended up catching the flu anyway, so it must have been a different strain or something, and M offered for me to swing by their house the next morning to get the rest of their medicine since they couldn't take it back on the plane. I did, once again with C's blessing. At this point, I was mostly trying to ignore my feelings, even as I was sitting in their living room talking to their parents, getting a full tour of their house and garden, and sitting talking to them in their old bedroom. Everything somewhat felt like it was out of a dream, but I tried my best to remain composed and act appropriately, but at the forefront of my mind, I just kept thinking that they were leaving for the airport the next day. I was actively panicky, having feelings of dread and making myself nauseous. I really didn't want them to go. I didn't even want to go to work. I just wanted to be beside them until the last possible second, which was when I acknowledged that I really, genuinely had a problem to deal with because I kept trying to put down these feelings, and it just wasn't working at all. I ended up, idiotically, volunteering to take them to the airport in the morning, despite knowing I wouldn't get off work until like 2:45 am and they had to be at the airport before 8:30 am, so it was decided I would sleep at M's house (in a different room from where M was staying) to save time travelling in the morning. (I checked in with C; he didn't care.) Except M didn't sleep in the other room. They just sat up with me talking until like an hour before we were supposed to get up and we ended up napping on the bed I was supposed to be sleeping in. When I woke up, we were in a bit of a cuddling position, but we didn't go to sleep that way, so I kinda shrugged it off. The drive to the airport was like driving to my death though, and by the time we got there, we were both close to crying. I actually did cry. We hugged for a really long time, and I just didn't want to let them go. M did end up going, but there was a second when I thought he was going to change his mind. The next day, he confessed that he was still in love with me and wanted to not only be with me, and when asked how serious he was about that (because I was confused), he said he wanted to marry me one day, that he always had, and started asking me if I could ever consider moving to the city he lives in. Shocked, and not thinking clearly because I'd been waiting 7 years for this man to confess his feelings to me outright, I basically said this was coming out of nowhere, moving really fast, that I didn't know what was going on anymore, and that I could hypothetically consider moving, but thankfully did acknowledge that I really needed to talk to C asap, because I was confused and conflicted about a lot of feelings I was having. M kept suggesting I ask if we could just try being poly, because M is poly/ambi and was very open to the idea. I eventually brought it up to C when I could, and at first C was very against the idea, like immediately, so I tried explaining the differences between an open relationship and poly and C seemed more willing to break up (despite living with my mother and I and having nowhere to go) than even trying the poly, and I didn't want to do any kind of poly under duress type situation so I basically said I thought we needed a break so I could figure things out then and started crying (not like in a guilt trippy way but just I was really upset because I do love both of them and was genuinely not sure what to do in the current situation, but things were going too far, and I needed to figure things out before progressing any further at all) and he held me for awhile, and then finally said we could try since I couldn't seem to choose so it kinda seems like the poly has happened in lieu of a break but said they would let me know if they had an actual problem with it, and I asked multiple times if it was okay before I told M? 

The current situation: M is a big fan of Kitchen Table Poly, while C seems to just not want to know anything about the other situation and wants to pretend it isn't happening, so M isn't super happy about C not wanting to communicate or be friends with M. C seems to be okay but not overly happy/was already having some mild seasonal depression, but I've been checking in on C often to see how they're feeling, but I feel like he's being dishonest. I asked multiple times if they want to reevaluate the situation or if C is just stealth breaking up with me or something, and C says he's actually ""fully committed to the relationship and trying to hang onto the relationship with everything that he has,"" which is worrisome in itself. C also claims to not be jealous of M in any way and to not feel neglected? Tbb, in general, since I have M to rant to, C and I have actually been fighting less because I'm not having to deal with C's emotional constipation every time I need to vent about something? I genuinely think it's been better for my emotional state, balancing the two, but I worry about C. M is fine with pretty much everything, but worries C will change his mind about the open relationship and is upset that anytime I try to have a boundaries talk with C, he just says he ""doesn't care,"" and to ""not be weird,"" which is just too vague to go off of. I've been told I'm allowed to fly out to go see M at the end of January (I asked permission), but I don't even know if we're allowed to do physical stuff or not, because C won't talk to me about it at all. ... I feel like the reason C might be okay with it is because M lives so far away and they aren't a part of our everyday lives aside from me texting and calling them, but I recently (this week) found out that M is coming home with me when I fly out there due to the health of one of their parents declining. They have asked me to cancel my return flight and drive back with them so they can move home. I worry about ... All of this, but I especially worry about how M coming home will affect our fragile relationship dynamic. M has also talked about the three of us living together, and C is absolutely not receptive because C thinks it will put him in a bad situation, because if we break up, he won't have anywhere to go (but that's the situation currently because we live with MY mom), but says I can live with M and continue to date C? But I don't know if this is supposed to be passive aggressive or what but he claims he's being genuine?? C doesn't really have anywhere to go, so I wonder if he would just continue to live with my mother? We have not told my mother about the poly... Thing. M keeps calling it a parallel poly hinge but that's just word soup to me. Currently it feels a little mono/poly because neither of them are trying to date anyone else (but I haven't forbidden it, it just doesn't seem like they're interested in seeing other people)

TLDR: Had a strong mutual connection with someone 7 years ago when I was in an abusive relationship but never did anything with it, they recently reappeared into my life, I realized I still had feelings, and my mono partner and I have decided to be poly so I can long distance date this other person. I feel like I'm neglecting everyone's needs and boundaries. My new partner is suddenly having to move home due to family issues and wants to (eventually) be a nesting partner and maybe marry me and have kids. My current nesting partner doesn't want to marry/have kids/ nest with my new partner, despite being invited to live with us by my new partner. We currently live with my mom, so I don't know where my current nesting partner would go. I'm trying so hard to keep everyone happy, but communication isn't happening despite me trying. 

ANY advice appreciated, thank you in advance, and bless you for reading this if you have. "

I write to you today as a disabled neurodivergent visionary who has found their true purpose; not in pursuit of personal gain, but in service of an urgent calling that has consumed the recent few years of my life; while more solutions to more global problems rest in my notebooks, I speak of one today; I call it Polytraxylon. This is not merely a project; it is part of my life's purpose; born from a genuine calling towards global betterment; please help me help us all. As a polymath whose awareness spans multiple disciplines, I have developed an interconnected ecosystem of dozens of technological innovations and systems; these stand poised to make a measurable impact in our fight against climate change; the significance of these solutions is not theoretical – it is mathematical, verifiable, and profound.

Allow me to illuminate the scope; I must emphasize that these figures represent the impact at just one facility's implementation:

• Annual energy conservation of 788,400 MWh – equivalent to powering tens of thousands of homes
• Yearly carbon emissions reduction of 473,040 metric tons – comparable to removing over 100,000 cars from our roads
• Annual water preservation of 346,750,000 gallons – enough to serve several small cities

In economic terms, this integrated network of systems represents:
• $78.8 million in energy cost reduction annually
• $23.6 million in carbon offset value per year
• $3.4 million in water conservation savings annually

Aggregated over five years, this integrated network of systems would generate over half a billion dollars in total savings ($529,797,500) at a single facility; now, consider the exponential potential: As these systems are implemented globally, replacing conventional infrastructure, the ecological and economic benefits would multiply accordingly; each implementation would not only compound these savings but also enhance the systemic harmony between human industry and natural ecosystems; creating a cascading effect of environmental restoration and economic efficiency.

Yet here I find myself at an impasse; despite repeated attempts to engage with corporations and institutional entities, my communications have met with silence; I possess neither the capital to implement these solutions independently nor the institutional connections to bring them to those who could.

What I seek is not financial enrichment; indeed, I have lived modestly throughout my research years; channeling my neurodivergent perspective into solutions that others might have overlooked; my unique way of seeing the world has allowed me to recognize patterns and possibilities that traditional approaches have missed; what I seek is partnership with those who possess the means and the vision to transmute these blueprints from possibility into reality.

I am reaching out to this community because I believe in the power of collective wisdom and connection; among you may be:
• Environmental technology experts who can validate and refine these interconnected systems; particularly those specializing in system integration and scalability
• Engineers and architects who understand the challenges of implementing multiple complementary technologies at scale
• Entrepreneurs who understand the path from concept to implementation
• Institutional liaisons who can open doors that have remained closed
• Impact investors who recognize both the moral and economic imperatives of climate action

The mathematical precision of these projections reflects the rigor of the underlying work; a complex matrix of dozens of interconnected systems; each carefully designed to complement and amplify the others; these systems span multiple domains including energy generation, resource optimization, waste reduction, and environmental restoration; each component has been meticulously engineered to work in harmony with the others; creating a comprehensive solution that is far greater than the sum of its parts.

I stand ready to engage in substantive dialogue with serious partners who share this vision of environmental stewardship and technological progression; time, as both data and experience remind us daily, is of the essence.

With profound respect for this community's collective expertise and potential,

In economic terms, this integrated network of systems represents:
• $78.8 million in energy cost reduction annually
• $23.6 million in carbon offset value per year
• $3.4 million in water conservation savings annually

Aggregated over five years, this integrated network of systems would generate over half a billion dollars in total savings ($529,797,500) at a single facility; now, consider the exponential potential: As these systems are implemented globally, replacing conventional infrastructure, the ecological and economic benefits would multiply accordingly; each implementation would not only compound these savings but also enhance the systemic harmony between human industry and natural ecosystems; creating a cascading effect of environmental restoration and economic efficiency.

Yet here I find myself at an impasse; despite repeated attempts to engage with corporations and institutional entities, my communications have met with silence; I possess neither the capital to implement these solutions independently nor the institutional connections to bring them to those who could.

What I seek is not financial enrichment; indeed, I have lived modestly throughout my research years; channeling my neurodivergent perspective into solutions that others might have overlooked; my unique way of seeing the world has allowed me to recognize patterns and possibilities that traditional approaches have missed; what I seek is partnership with those who possess the means and the vision to transmute these blueprints from possibility into reality.

I am reaching out to this community because I believe in the power of collective wisdom and connection; among you may be:
• Environmental technology experts who can validate and refine these interconnected systems; particularly those specializing in system integration and scalability
• Engineers and architects who understand the challenges of implementing multiple complementary technologies at scale
• Entrepreneurs who understand the path from concept to implementation
• Institutional liaisons who can open doors that have remained closed
• Impact investors who recognize both the moral and economic imperatives of climate action

The mathematical precision of these projections reflects the rigor of the underlying work; a complex matrix of dozens of interconnected systems; each carefully designed to complement and amplify the others; these systems span multiple domains including energy generation, resource optimization, waste reduction, and environmental restoration; each component has been meticulously engineered to work in harmony with the others; creating a comprehensive solution that is far greater than the sum of its parts.

I stand ready to engage in substantive dialogue with serious partners who share this vision of environmental stewardship and technological progression; time, as both data and experience remind us daily, is of the essence.

With profound respect for this community's collective expertise and potential,

"One night, some big realizations",SGIWhistleblowersMITA,1hugzdu,2025-01-05 15:52:50,3,0.8,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGIWhistleblowersMITA/comments/1hugzdu/one_night_some_big_realizations/,JulieSongwriter,I read it in the World Tribune,"The final Bills game of the season is in the fouth quarter with the Patriots if you points ahead. It is kind of a meaningless game. With the exception of Josh Allen who started to chalk up a single play and hit 115 straight games, the bench hit the field to make sure everyone is rested and without new injuries. Even the Patriots do not have the motivation to do well because if they win they will lose their #1 draft pick which they need to rebuild their team. The postseason starts next Saturday at Highmark against whatever team wins the AFC wildcard slot.

Postseason or not, on Friday Dee and I are taking all five kids to visit my parents for the weekend (probably no post that day). My parents are taking this giant leap of closing both of their practices so they can devote the years ahead to raising a new generation of therapists who are equipped to face the challenges of new times. They need the kids around them to provide some distraction!

Today Benjamin Kdaké and I complete the second section, “Practice Is the Lifeline of Buddhism”
in the January installment of Ikeda Sensei's lecture on [The Heritage of the Ultimate Law of Life: Commentaries on the Writings of Nichiren](https://www.worldtribune.org/2024/the-oneness-of-mentor-and-disciple/). 

Sairen-bo had asked about the meaning of the transmission of the ultimate law of life and death. Nichiren answered from the standpoint of *practice*. What do you think, Benjamin Kdaké, what is *the key* to inheriting the ultimate Law of life and death? Nichiren answer: it lies in spreading Nam-myoho-renge-kyo following the example of Bodhisattva Superior Practices.

What does this mean to me? I want to know more about Bodhisattva Superior Practices. I peeked ahead in the lecture and a lot of important points are to follow down the road! But for impatient folk like me, here is an essay Sensei [published](https://www.worldtribune.org/2023/strengthening-our-grassroots-network-of-bodhisattvas-of-the-earth/#return-reference-19) back in May 2022. SGI Dictionary of Buddhism has a great [entry](https://www.nichirenlibrary.org/en/dic/Content/S/305) on Buddha Superior Practices, and Wikipedia also has an article about [Viśiṣṭacāritra (Skt)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi%C5%9Bi%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%ADac%C4%81ritra?wprov=sfla1).

What does it mean for disciples to practice in the same spirit as Nichiren? I'm not in exile in Sado Island. But I have written a lot about trying to break through my dissociative disorder. It’s my Sado and I’m boxed in by *The How Enigma*? Chant about it?!?! Sure, but how, when my ability to chant and focus is affected by the disorder?!?! 

Well, then, try to be more present in every moment. The Twinettes have discovered the game of hide-go-seek. Usually, this is the stuff that Papa Guy and Papa Eulogio love to play with them. Afterall, I have the dishes to do in the other trailer. 

No, not yesterday! I asked the boys to take care of the cleanup and I would take care of the night time routine of transitioning the kids from play to sleep. I played the role of The Foolish Clown and made the Twinettes laugh and laugh. Was I sincerely there? Not really, I was acting, but did it matter with them having such a good time? 

Next, off went the boys to the Saturday Night Fever. I got the Twinettes and Twinmen into their pajamas and read to them. Do I have the dramatic flair of Guy? No! Or the gravitas of Eulogio? Hell no on that one! But I did all right and one-by-one I watched the four of them fall asleep. In so doing I had the joy of observing their growth, uniqueness, and genuine love for each other. What a quiet gift to myself! Why had I been afraid of the bedtime routine and, as Louis Armstrong sang, “the dark sacred night”? There can be no more honest and intimate interaction between parent and child than bedtime but I had been avoiding it due to my own fears. Yes, I had determined to attack my dissociation through interactions with the partying winter clients–but the real battle had been all along in front of my eyes in our Living RV!

Next, Sensei tells us, Nichiren drew parallels between the power of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and the functions of the five classical Chinese elements of earth, water, fire, wind and space. 

>Disciples manifest this power when they practice with the same dedicated spirit as Bodhisattva Superior Practices. These functions represent the power of compassion inherent in the universe… The functions of the five elements, he says, are the functions of Myoho-renge-kyo as well as “the cluster of blessings brought by the Bodhisattvas of the Earth, disciples of the Buddha in his true identity” (WND-1, 218). 

So, granted, I have all these fears. Mock me all you want, but no one criticizes me more than I do myself! But just look at the backup system behind me! I have the universal functions of the five elements as well as “the cluster of blessings brought by the Bodhisattvas of the Earth.” Really, then, what is there to fear?

Sensei reminds me:

>Through the wondrous workings inherent in life itself, these bodhisattvas propagate Myoho-renge-kyo and benefit people. 

Am I qualified to propagate Buddhism with all my faults? Will I pass my driver's license test? In reality, I see, it is *because* of my faults that I am qualified to drive. Am I the only parent out there who sometimes feels terrified of the role of parenthood? So who is best qualified to inspire such people struggling with this tendency? Hey parental “natch” or someone struggling just like them?

I also realized that living in a poly family comes with some disadvantages for me. I saw that I had been hiding behind my partners. Guy has the natural *joie de vivre* and teacher’s touch that endears him to the children. Eulogio is like a tall maple shade tree under which the children feel so secure. Dee knows how to play the Wicked Witch of the West in just the right dosage before pivoting to Glinda! And me?

Sensei remarks:

>Nichiren goes on to allude that he himself is Bodhisattva Superior Practices, the first to carry out these practices and manifest the power of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. By doing so, he is urging Sairen-bo to practice Nam-myoho-renge-kyo in the same spirit as himself and in accord with his teachings. Practice is the lifeline of Buddhism. A religion that lacks practice becomes nothing but an intellectual pastime. 

So let me declare to all of my thousands of Reddit friends: no more Julie playing hide-go-seek and hiding behind my partners! I will continue to chant, propagate, and take care of our children to the best of my ability. Periodt!

Sensei concludes:

>Nichiren indicates that in order to partake of the heritage for attaining Buddhahood, it is essential to practice Nam-myoho-renge-kyo—the Law entrusted to Bodhisattva Superior Practices. There is no such heritage outside of this. 

>On the basis of this point alone, it is abundantly clear just how much the Nichiren Shoshu priesthood has deviated from Nichiren Buddhism by teaching a mystical transmission of the heritage and demanding blind obedience based thereupon. 

I hope YKW had enough patience to walk through the weeds of my mind so far to get to these paragraphs. YKW, you should consider stopping your messaging that there is some type of holy and pure practice of Buddhism out there somewhere. That's a falsehood! Afterall, have you ever disclosed to us *your* holy and pure practice of Buddhism? Not that I can recall. YKW, you are no BND (Bodhisattva Never Disparaging). You are Bodhisattva Always Disparaging (BAD).

There's just the practice of human revolution and helping other people. I, for one, promise to keep engaging on that path!

Very early 2026 governor rundown (part 1),AngryObservation,1htsrn9,2025-01-04 19:23:05,18,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AngryObservation/comments/1htsrn9/very_early_2026_governor_rundown_part_1/,Doc_ET,,"To not have a 30 page post I'm breaking this up into four sections, this is just the West because I severely underestimated how long this would take despite doing this exercise before.

**Oregon**

Governor Tina Kotek is continuing her predecessor's legacy of being really unpopular. \[I'm going to use Morning Consult for approval numbers here, I'm aware of its reputation, but it's the only one who regularly does approval polls for all 50 governors with uniform methodology. It seems to inflate everyone's numbers though, only one governor is a net negative and four more under +5, so I'm going to use its numbers comparatively and not absolutes.\] Kotek is tied for second lowest, which is actually an improvement from Kate Brown (who was generally the actual lowest), but still really bad. Oregon is a blue enough state (or maybe more accurately, Portland is a big and blue enough city) that a decade of controversial administrations (Brown came in after her predecessor resigned due to a corruption probe, and both she and Kotek have had controversies regarding their political appointees) wasn't enough to break its soon-to-be 30 year streak of Democratic governors, and I don't think a Trump midterm will be the year to break that. However, Kotek's unpopularity will keep things competitive, and it's not entirely out of the question that a strong Republican could bring her down. Especially if there's another scandal during the campaign. As for who her opponent will be? Honestly I have no idea, maybe Christine Drazan again? She's back in the legislature now though and might want to stay there longer, and rematches generally don't turn out great for the original loser. u/AngryObserver, I definitely want to hear your thoughts on the race as a local.

Initial Rating: Lean D

**California**

Gavin Newsom is term limited, sparking a frenzy among California Democrats wanting to replace him. There's already seven declared Democrats in the race, and it's barely 2025- in a year it'll 100% be higher. The two frontrunners so far are Toni Atkins, pres pro tem of the state senate until a few weeks ago (term limits), and lieutenant governor Eleni Kounalakis, but former LA mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Superintendent of Education Tony Thurmond are also notable candidates. Attorney General Rob Bonta and former Rep. Katie Porter have also talked about runs, and of course if the rumors of a Kamala Harris run turn out to be true, she'd immediately become a frontrunner. With such a crowded field, a lockout of the GOP from the November election is a very realistic outcome, and would definitely produce the most interesting results, but if Republicans coalesce behind a single candidate like they have in 2022 and 2024 they'll probably make the general and give whoever the top Dem is a free victory.

Initial Rating: Safe D, but in a D vs D race no clue.

**Nevada**

Joe Lombardo seems to be decently well liked, he's a moderate who generally avoids culture war stuff. His opponent seems likely to be AG Aaron Ford, 2022's best performing statewide Democrat and the only one to win a county besides Clark and Washoe since 2014 (Carson City), although his 8-point win is probably just as much due to his opponent being an extremist whose statement that Ford should be hanged caused a number of prominent Republicans to endorse against her. Even so, Ford is probably the Democrats' best bet, although part of me wonders if he should wait until Lombardo is out of the way. Unseating a popular governor is a tough task even with the likely wave at Ford's back.

Initial Rating: Lean R, but like low lean.

**Idaho**

Idaho doesn't have term limits, so Brad Little could run for a third term if he wants to. He'd probably face significant opposition from Idaho's powerful and expanding Freedom Caucus, which in 2024 disassociated itself with the State Freedom Caucus Network (which is affiliated with the federal FC) after calling them RINOs. Janice McGeachin, Little's lt gov during his first term and 2022 primary opponent (gov and lt gov are separately elected in Idaho, Little didn't pick her and the two were in a constant power struggle during her tenure) is probably going to run regardless of Little's decision. If you've heard of her, it's probably for some combination of her  support for the Three Percenters militia group, her executive orders restricting local governments from adopting any public health measures whenever Little left the state (which made her acting governor), or her speech at Nick Fuentes' white nationalist conference. The fact that she has a legit shot at winning (moreso in an open field but it's not inconceivable that she primaries Little if Trump and friends campaign for her) is honestly terrifying. As for Democrats, who knows and who cares, it's Idaho.

Initial Rating: Safe R.

**Wyoming**

Mark Gordon is term limited, but term limits for other statewide offices were overturned in 2013, so if he could potentially take it to court and run again if he wins. He's been asked about if he has any plans on doing that and his response was basically ""that's two years out I have more important things to be thinking about"". And as the #4 most popular governor in the country, Gordon would certainly win another term if he's on the ballot. My gut says that he won't go through with it though, Trump has already been in talks with state senator Bo Biteman about a governor campaign. 2022 primary runner-up turned write in candidate Brent Bien has announced his candidacy, from what I can tell he's a conspiracist libertarian type character. Biteman is my bet though, a Trump backed candidate would have to try to lose Wyoming. Democrats are probably going to run someone nobody's heard of and lose by 40 points regardless.

Initial Rating: Safe R.

**Arizona**

This is in all likelihood the most competitive race in the west, and probably one of the most competitive in the country. Katie Hobbs won in 2022 by a hair despite barely doing anything, but that was more down to Kari Lake's weakness than Hobbs' strength. There was briefly talk of a primary challenge from AG Adrian Fontes over Hobbs' failure to win the legislature in 2024, but Fontes has said that he's not interested. So it looks like Hobbs is in the clear for the nomination. On the other side, Trump has endorsed Karrin Taylor Robson, the runner-up in the 2022 primary. Robson is a more traditional conservative than Lake, but by no means a moderate. State treasurer Kimberly Yee, who won by 11 in 2024 and is probably the smart choice, has also talked about running, and there's rumors about a Charlie Kirk bid for some reason. Hobbs has middling approval numbers, her path to victory largely relies on a reversion in the Latino vote and gaining in the Maricopa suburbs, the difficulty of that will really depend on who she faces and how the next two years go. As a fun bit of trivia, this will be the first Arizona governor race to feature running mates because of a referendum passed in 2022.

Initial Rating: Tossup

**Colorado**

Jared Polis is term limited, but whoever succeeds him shouldn't have much trouble holding the governorship. AG Phil Weiser has already announced his campaign, and former speaker Crisanta Duran has openly talked about a bid, although Colorado has no shortage of Democrats who would be more than willing to take the job. SoS Jenna Griswold, former senator Ken Salazar, and Reps Joe Neguse and Jason Crow have all had their names thrown around. A poll between Weiser, Griswold, Neguse, and Salazar showed Neguse ahead for whatever that's worth (not much). On the Republican side, state senator Barbara Kirkmeyer (probably best known for losing CO-08 in 2022) answered an interviewer with a definite maybe, if not her they could always go for the tried-and-false tactic of getting one of the legislative minority leaders to go for it (has that ever actually worked?).

Initial Rating: Safe D

**New Mexico**

Michelle Lujan Grisham is term limited, and it seems like her successor is likely to be current Secretary of the Interior and former NM-01 representative Deb Haaland. There's also talk of Martin Heinrich running, but I don't see it, he just won a third term in the senate and is set to chair the Energy Committee. NM Republicans really don't have a bench to pull from, which is a real burden to them in a state that on paper they should be doing okay in. In other news, Greg Baldwin, the voice actor for Uncle Iroh in Avatar, is talking about forming a White Lotus Party to run for governor- probably doesn't end up mattering but it's really the most interesting thing about this race.

Initial Rating: Likely D

**Alaska**

Mike Dunleavy is term limited, retiring state senator Click Bishop (a Republican member of the bipartisan coalition) is being talked about as a potential successor, possibly in contrast to the more conservative LG Nancy Dahlstrom. Fish Queen Peltola has filed paperwork for a rematch with Begich for AK-AL, but that's not binding and she could decide to run for governor instead. Personally I think that's much more realistic than her challenging Dan Sullivan for his Senate seat. But assuming Peltola does try to get her House seat back, honestly I'm not sure who the Democratic standard-bearer would be- former governor Bill Walker, an independent who retired after one term but ran again in 2022 and won the panhandle, is a potential option, or you could pick a state legislator at random, or maybe they run [Santa Claus (I-North Pole)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus_(politician)). Alaska's weird, Republicans are probably favored but who knows what could happen.

Initial Rating: Likely R

**Hawaii**

Josh Green is pretty popular, it's hard to see anyone else winning the election. He'll probably face one of the half dozen perennial candidates that make up the Hawaii GOP's bench for federal/statewide races (they're actually doing decent in the state legislature given that it's Hawaii lmao). Really not much more to say, one of the least interesting races in the country.

Initial Rating: Safe D, unless Illcom steps in, then Safe R."
I told my partner I hate my meta,polyamory,1htgmzf,2025-01-04 10:24:34,0,0.47,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1htgmzf/i_told_my_partner_i_hate_my_meta/,decisiontoohard,vent,"and he was really kind. 

I'm generally good at dealing with my emotions and complex situations. I'm fairly new to poly (about 7 months in, very very much want it for myself), but I like having metas, I would prefer KTP but my meta (Buttmunch, I'm feeling sensitive) is parallel and I figured out how to make peace with that for the most part.

I can feel empathy for people hurting me. And a lot of righteous anger, sure, there's room for both, but if a person is lashing out because everyone else in their life has put them into fight or flight I get it! I would rather work together to fix the system than get caught believing the fallacies in the system that would pit us against each other.

Recently, instead of not hearing about Buttmunch at all, or hearing a mix of the good stuff and the bad stuff, which I like, every time my partner (Good Butt, which unfortunately is a misnomer, as he actually has the best butt and ""good"" does it an injustice) has talked about Buttmunch it's been something bad she's done that stressed him out. Small agreements she's broken because she blanked... multiple times. Statements that left me worried for hours that Good Butt's housing situation (they're NPs) would be jeopardised... that were apparently just misunderstandings. And he withdraws for the evening to recover from the emotional labour.

After a few weeks of that, Buttmunch called during my protected time, when I was having a tough day anyway, and Good Butt had to leave the room to salvage the relationship which - from what I overheard but tried not to - amounted to her communicating ""I'm not seeing you enough, can we rearrange the schedule?"" at a histrionic level. And I am not meant to call him when he's with her except in an emergency, so I never ever have. And he left early to go talk to her, and he has never left her to support me. This has happened a couple of times in the past. Logically, I know that the difference is that I proactively work to respect that boundary, and when I'm having a crisis a) it's not usually a relationship crisis because I feel emotionally secure about Good Butt's feelings and intentions towards me and b) I'm reluctant to reach out, so when I do I do it in less intrusive ways. Like texts. And I know I offer to accommodate them when Buttmunch is having a crisis, because I can, and it might help. Buttmunch probably won't even know when I'm having a crisis, and I have genuinely no idea if she would give a shit or not, but(t) she might. I know the answer is to ask hinge to keep me out of Buttmunch's crises where possible now, and my ask for parallel is exactly that. And also to assert my desires, not just my bare minimum survival needs, when I need support. And much louder, because my ""would you come over? I understand if you can't"" doesn't look the same as her panic attacks and ultimatums, and Good Butt doesn't recognise how significant and difficult my smallest asks are when I'm living through my biggest feelings. I'm working on that. I'm actually writing him a booklet with flowcharts, particularly to read my nonverbal cues. Yes, I'm autistic, why do you ask?

The disparity still makes my mind fracture to think about too much, so I'll move on.

She's also asked to move one of my days with my partner and he asked me when I was incredibly low, which he didn't realise, and I said yes, but the truth is I know that I need good contact three days a week (right now I have two) to feel really secure in the relationship, and without that I start to crash if I go three days or more without spending good time together. I'm working on building a more involved support network for myself, and I'm trying to catch up on life enough to start dating again, and he's working on getting another day, with overnights (overnights are constrained by Good Butt, not Buttmunch, but I don't know what the constraints are on getting a thïrd day), but it's slow going. And the gaps between seeing each other properly will now be 1 day and 4 days, and I don't know how I'm going to get through the 4 days, even though we get 15-30 minutes on his work breaks every so often in-between. Previously the gaps were 2 days and 3 days.

I'd been trying not to feel my feelings, which was stupid and dangerous, and finally I sat down and wrote them out. I've been trying so hard not to hate her because I trust my partner's judgement and I know I don't know all the information, and I finally asked to go parallel, but I clearly asked too late. I could have worked through everything else I'd heard about her (they're moving, they're under stress) if she hadn't directly impacted our relationship suddenly when I was already under stress. As well as indirectly impacting my relationship with all her antics and the strain it's put on him, taking him away unexpectedly from our digital communication.

I'm usually really really good at writing out my situation, and the impact it's had on me, and figuring out what ask will meet my needs, but I'm struggling to do that now.

I don't understand why it's okay for me to be feeling this way. It's hurting him, too. I don't understand why that's okay.

Also, I'm AuDHD and the logic isn't logicking for my autism. And with ADHD I find it difficult to remember when I've already made a fix, it just hasn't shown yet. And my sleep has been poor this week, which isn't helping me react with intelligence. And my birth control is making it harder to separate my feelings from my thoughts.

TL;DR: I asked to go parallel, but I did it too late. My meta, Buttmunch, has directly impacted my relationship and I have a lot of hurt and resentment to work through. My partner, Good Butt, was very kind about it and is hurting for me, but I'm left not understanding why it's okay for me to be feeling this way, and whether my feelings are justified or not. I'm struggling to know how to meet my needs for regular, protected time with him after an unusual disruption and a small change to our schedule.

It's not Buttmunch's fault that she communicates so poorly and finds life so stressful. I'm sure she tries. I just wish she wouldn't try in a way where some of the fallout landed on me. And I'm grateful to Good Butt for immediately respecting and supporting my new boundary, and for expressing sorrow, kindness, patience and love. But I wish I could have less information than I have had, or so so much more, so I didn't end up here. And I wish it was easier for me to build up an understanding with Good Butt (excellent butt) of our communication styles when we're struggling, particularly over virtual communication.

----

Am I doing all the right things? Have I missed something? Is all I need now time and the opportunity to reconnect with him?

Do I need to understand why Good Butt has put up with Buttmunch's past shenanigans, or will I be able to let it go now that we're more severely parallel so I won't be hearing about her actions that trigger my confusion and protectionism?

Is it okay to recognise that I feel uneasy when I don't see my partner for a thîrd day in a row, and downright unhappy after that? I know that my ideal is seeing Good Butt 3-4 days a week, and I want at least two days a week to date myself right now, and seeing friends inbetween makes me happy but it doesn't do very much to mitigate the eventual loneliness in-between. Which might be because I don't have very intimate friendships - vulnerable sometimes, yes, but I wouldn't fart in front of them or invite them to chill in bed with me or cuddle, and I feel like that's a useful metric to understand (as someone who builds nonverbal closeness) the limits of my friendship... I should ask my best friend if they're up for platonic cuddles, shouldn't I? That was my sixth question, in case anyone reads this and wants to respond to a specific one.

A happy end to the year thanks to celibacy,Celibacy,1hrw13u,2025-01-02 10:20:08,15,0.94,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Celibacy/comments/1hrw13u/a_happy_end_to_the_year_thanks_to_celibacy/,old_tomboy,Hope,"At the end of 2023, I experienced one of the worst pains of my life: a break-up and my ex starting to date my friend. At the beginning of 2024, I found another girlfriend who said she was thinking about us in the long term, but broke up with me in less than three months.

However, I took advantage of this second pain to quit porn for good and become a little more demanding before liking any woman. I became a little more attached to my favorite k-pop group, and it became a support network: a way for art to take me in. I've also strengthened my bonds with good friends because I always touch the grass.

Most importantly, I've embraced solitude. I take long walks alone in the middle of the woods whenever possible. I watch movies and series alone. Likewise, I'm almost always alone, going to the movies, going to restaurants, without any woman by my side, apart from my sister, mother, or niece.

When I feel aroused, I masturbate using my thoughts, and soon I'm free of desire. Sometimes I get tempted by women when they hit on me, but the discomfort I feel when it goes wrong is never worth it. Carnal pleasure hurts me so much that, if I put it in the balance, I suffer much more than I receive pleasure.

That's why I want to give celibacy a chance and redirect myself towards polymathism and excellence."

You can easily use this method for your Digital life in Obsidian App. 

# The E.V.O.L.V.E. -Digital Life Method: Understanding the Core

  
**E.V.O.L.V.E.** is an acronym representing six essential Key Points: **Edifice, Value, Orientation, Loot, Venue,** and **Element**.

* The system is organized into **three Main Points**:
   * **Content**: The information created or collected.
   * **Space-Time Texture**: The life cycle and place of information.
   * **Component**: Supportive elements for organizing information.

The E.V.O.L.V.E. method is built on three fundamental pillars that set it apart from traditional PKM systems:

# 1. Content: The Foundation of Everything

Content in E.V.O.L.V.E. is categorized through four key points:

# Edifice (Static Content)

* Templates you actually use
* Forms that serve a purpose
* Routine content that streamlines your workflow

# Value (Your Original Content)

* Mono: Single pieces of content (one task, one note)
* Poly: Connected pieces (projects, multi-part content)
* Jot: Raw, unstructured thoughts in the Vortex

# Orientation (Context-Driven Content)

* Hierarchies: Structured, nested information
* Time: Journals, habits, temporal data
* People: Relationship-based content
* Locations: Place-oriented information
* Relations: Network-style content

# Loot (External Content)

* Owned: Your created media
* Linked: External references

# 2. Space-Time Texture: Venue

This is where E.V.O.L.V.E. truly shines. Information exists in three venue types:

# Vortex (The Chaos Zone)

* Your digital panic room
* Where raw thoughts land
* Safe space for unstructured content

# Act (The Working Zone)

* Active projects and tasks
* Current focus areas
* Living documents

# Rest (The Archive Zone)

* Completed work
* Reference material
* Easily reactivable content

# 3. Components: The Support System (Element)

Elements that enhance your content:

# Amass

* Collections that make sense
* Maps of Content (MOCs)
* Dashboards that serve a purpose

# Definer

* Properties that add value
* Attributes that clarify
* Classifications that work

# Helper

* Tags that actually help
* Priority systems that make sense

# Practical Implementation: Making E.V.O.L.V.E. Work for You

# Starting Simple: The Two-Question Framework

Every piece of information needs to answer just two questions:

1. **Where does it belong?** (Venue)
   * Work
   * Life
   * Projects
   * etc.
2. **What is it?** (Content Type)
   * Value/Mono for single tasks
   * Value/Poly for projects
   * Orientation/Time for habits
   * etc.

# Real-World Examples

# Example 1: Managing a Work Project

    Where: Work/Act
    What: Value/Poly

# Example 2: Personal Journal

    Where: Life/Act
    What: Orientation/Time

# Example 3: Research Collection

    Where: Research/Vortex
    What: Loot/Linked

Partner holding V-Day for his wife…just in case her plans change,polyamory,1hqrqj9,2024-12-31 19:26:34,91,0.86,98,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1hqrqj9/partner_holding_vday_for_his_wifejust_in_case_her/,Labombafragil,,"I’ve been in a polyamorous relationship with my boyfriend for over two years. I’ve really struggled with feeling like I’m not a priority. I’m married but I have a close friendship with my husband. We don’t have a romantic relationship. I don’t practice hierarchy (aside from the descriptive hierarchy of being married). I am open to friends and family about being poly. 

My boyfriend is married and he practices prescriptive hierarchy. His wife and him are not open at all. I love my boyfriend and he loves me. He does a lot to show that he loves me. However, I’ve really struggled with loving this person so much and not being a larger part of his life. It Is especially difficult around holidays and special occasions. In the last year, the only special occasion we spent together was New Year’s Eve 2023-2024 together. I had to fight for that. He wanted to meet me after midnight so he could split his time between his wife and me. I said that wasn’t acceptable, so he ended up spending the night with me. I think that was a fight between him and his wife. 

This year we’ve been on and off a few times and scheduling time together was a major issue with us. He’s been out of the country for the entire month of December with his family and won’t get back until January 5th. I requested that we spend the long weekend starting on Valentine’s Day together (Feb. 14-17). The idea was that we would go on trip. He said he had these days on hold for us. 

Yesterday, we went through the calendar to schedule time together. For the weekend I requested, he said he could spend February 15-17 together after coordinating with his wife. He completely ignored the 14th. When I asked about the 14th he said he wasn’t sure that he could spend that evening with me because he might have plans. This was hurtful to me because we haven’t spent any special occasions together since New Years Eve the year before. I feel like, Valentine’s Day is being saved for his wife but if her plans change, we can spend it together. This really hurts my heart. He made it sound like I was ungrateful and unreasonable. In fact, he called me selfish because I was hurt by this.

I can’t spend Wednesday nights together because I have a Thursday morning BNI meeting at 7am every week. He said “is the meeting more important than spending time with me?” I said it’s a planned meeting and I can get kicked out if I miss more than 3 meetings in 6 months. Sometimes I can’t attend the meetings because I’m traveling or have work. These meetings are for networking to make money for my business. He said “see how it feels?” As if my planned Thursday meeting is the same as him keeping Valentine’s Day saved with his wife in case they have plans together, which he isn’t sure about.

 I’m so hurt to go back to this push and pull dynamic with him. He does things to spend time with me, but it seems like holidays or special occasions are off the table…unless his wife is unavailable. I really don’t know if I should just accept this dynamic or end this. He doesn’t see how this hurts me or why and no amount of explaining gets through to him.

Apologies for formatting. I’m on mobile."
"Collection of comments and dialogues from November till now II
",u_MirkWorks,1hqprc0,2024-12-31 17:36:25,1,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MirkWorks/comments/1hqprc0/collection_of_comments_and_dialogues_from/,MirkWorks,,"\* But this seems more related to the subject of immigration's effect on economics and the need for restrictions insofar as it helps local industries.

To clarify not local industries. The opposite appears to be the case. Rather of the workers themselves. Which is something I think has to be accounted for. The xenophobic-nativist interpretation mentioned earlier, for me this begets the point that simply because the interpretation of a given-phenomena by those experiencing it might be incorrect or inadequate, doesn’t mean they aren’t experiencing said phenomena.

That's just it. Lets flip it, ascending from earth to heaven after descending from heaven to earth. The concern with cultural values and norms extends to the *social* in the properly materialist sense. As relating to the social relations of production, and the general contradiction between labor and capital. That's the reading I'm proposing, as an exercise. It’s precisely this mode of understanding that is conspicuous in its absence, an absent-presence, haunting the *Red Scare* “line” just as much as it haunts contemporary American politics and political discourse.

Values and norms aren’t superfluous. In my view such matters don't exclude the economic but rather flow into the questions of labor relations and workers' rights, a willingness and ability to organize, agitate, politicize, negotiate, or outright impose terms. Operating from a place of rudimentary political consciousness based on class interests, based on the conscious self-interest of the worker. “It’s normal to want normal people to feel like they have glory and triumph and honor in what they do.”

Perhaps different peoples have different work and political cultures, we return to the difference in custom and world-being. Being a question of circumstance as well. Immigrant laborers in the US aren’t likely to fully grasp their rights as legal residents, as citizens, much less as workers. Would they register exploitation the same way a US Citizen would and vice versa? Obviously of course, there is a spectrum of awareness in regards to the class consciousness of the US born worker. Also mediated by circumstance and necessity. An autonomous Labor politics in the US doesn’t really exist, having been for the most part sublated.

Would exploitation be experienced as a favor? An act of charity even. In the way social welfare is often cast as paternalistic charity by the state rather than as a kind of reparations to the productive citizen or how contemporary electoral politics serves as the simulacra of political emancipation… more about collective catharsis and data gathering at this point in my opinion…. Why rock the boat if you have a good thing going and your family depends on this. Beggars cannot be choosers, doubly so for the undocumented. Working more for less, because what we understand as ""less"" is in all likelihood to them a great deal more, especially back home, where US spare change is transformed into riches (why else would so many people throughout the global South, produce AI generated slop and attempt to game the algorithm of social media and video streaming platforms? $150s in the US is trifling compared to $150s in Manila or Lagos or Delhi).

Reminded in part of the following passage from More’s *Utopia,*

* By the way, the slave that I’ve occasionally referred to are not, as you might imagine, non-combatant prisoners-of-war, slaves by birth, or purchases from foreign slave markets. They’re either Utopian convicts or, much more often, condemned criminals from other countries, who are acquired in large numbers, sometimes for a small payment, but usually for nothing. Both types of slave are kept hard at work in chain gangs, though Utopians are treated worse than foreigners. The idea is that it’s all the more deplorable if a person who has had the advantage of a first rate education and a thoroughly moral education still insists on becoming a criminal — so the punishment should be all the more severe. Another type of slave is the working class foreigner who, rather than live in wretched poverty at home, volunteers for slavery in Utopia. Such people are treated with respect, and with almost as much kindness as Utopian citizens, except that they’re made to work harder, because they’re used to it.

Trump’s selection of Marco Rubio as Secretary of State… I don’t know if people imagined that Trump would snap his fingers and that suddenly all the elements and interests that have defined the GOP since the mid 20th century would suddenly disappear. The “neocons” remains. The interesting thing to note here is the way in which this “gives up the ghost” in regard to the impact of immigration and the influence of organized ethnic diaspora communities on our foreign policy. What Rubio comes out of, the interests and resentments he represents. Miami Cubans remains and remains a very strong influence within the GOP. The Miami Cuban is defined by an ongoing desire to punish Cuba Cubans in their nigh-religious commitment to what at this point amounts to an ancestral beef. I think Joan Didion did a wonderful job of capturing this in her work titled aptly [Miami](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/99/01/24/nnp/miami.html)*.* Below are some pertinent bits from *New York Times* review,

—

The story Miss Didion tells is a compassionate tale of Washington's ''seduction and betrayal'' of the Cuban exiles, a community she refers to simply as el exilio. The seduction was, of course, the training of exiles to invade Cuba and topple Fidel Castro, the men of the 2506 Brigade who in April 1962 died or were taken prisoner by the Castro forces at the Bay of Pigs when President Kennedy ''sent down the decision to preserve deniability by withholding air cover.'' As Miss Didion sees it, ''In many ways the Bay of Pigs continued to offer Miami an ideal narrative, one in which the men of the 2506 were forever the valiant and betrayed and the United States was forever the seducer and betrayer and the blood of los martires remained forever fresh.'' The struggle -la lucha - is a continuing one, not only against Fidel Castro but also against ''all those who could conceivably be believed to have aided or encouraged him.'' And the Cubans now pray that the Nicaraguan contras, whom they call ''the freedom fighters of the eighties,''

''not be treated by the Reagan administration as the men of the 2506 had been treated, or believed that they had been treated, by the Kennedy administration.''

&

The men the C.I.A. trained to overthrow Fidel Castro, the veterans of the 2506 Brigade, are, many of them, successful bankers and businessmen. But they support la lucha, and they are sizable contributors to national, as well as local, political campaigns. There are also survivors of the 2506 Brigade who, according to Miss Didion, have been ''fighting with the contras from a base about three miles south of the Nicaraguan border.'' Thus, Luis Posada Carriles, once accused by the Venezuelan Government of placing a bomb on a Cubana Airlines plane, later turned up ''working on the covert contra supply operation at Ilopango air base \[ in El Salvador \] under the name 'Ramon Medina.' '' This is the same Ramon Medina whose name ''began coming up in late 1986, at the time the first details of the contra supply network organized by Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North and Major General Richard Secord were becoming known.''

Imagine if you can, the frustration an English-speaking US born Cuban-American Sandernista living in in Miami feels and how often the thought must have crossed their mind, “these fucking people shouldn’t be allowed to vote.” When confronted by the latest batch of Cuban (and now Venezuelan) migrants voting against mild reformist policies because they’re tuned into some federally subsidized Cuban-American media personality dickhead on YouTube paid to produce attention-grabbing schlock and propaganda, and who in turn becomes the medium through which information concerning US affairs gets translated-filtered… telling the captive audience anxious to integrate that XYZ candidate is a Communist and that their duty as newly minted Americans of Cuban origin is to vote Republican down-ticket, prove their loyalty to the US, and combat the scourge of Communism? People who get fast-tracked into citizenship, who live in an ethnolinguistic bubble, industrious and innovative people who will prosper regardless of regime, hustle grindset, often paid under the table, easily exploitable, willing to work more for less money, who develop their own little paramarkets Cuba style, and who likewise receive government aid. The catch being that Cuban professionals aren’t recognized in the US. Cuban doctors and engineers might be recognized internationally but they aren’t recognized in the US… forced then to have to go through all kinds of processes or through more right-coded, often time Evangelical Christian identifying NGOs/NPOs capitalizing on this situation… or they just end up being unlicensed doctors and dentists. And with that said, why should Cuban-Americans constitute such a formidable political bloc, capable of directly effecting US foreign policy in order to enact their multigenerational familial ressentiment.

So many Cubans died at sea trying to get to Miami using dingy rafts during the Special Period with the passing of “Wet foot, dry foot” (effectively an experiment in open borders)…. it was enticing. And none of this is meant to absolve the fuck ups on the part of the Cuban government… but it takes two-to-tango. This is one of the reason I like Sailer’s little formula of “invade the world, invite the world.” And it’s not just Cuban-American political interest groups. The wealthier the members of the diaspora in question, the more they’re connected with some deposed US-backed regime or faction, the more likely they are to organize into interest groups and lobbying groups that exert a commanding, at times even defining, influence on US foreign policy.

To be clear my issue is with the Exilio as a (para-) political entity, not so much with Cuban immigrants. What the Exilio is in Miami, is effectively a ""Deep State""... really a degenerated Government-in-Exile turned into a deeply settled mafia. They preserve a politics of personal parasitic profit and ressentiment all the while doing very little to actually defend the interests of Miami’s naturalized citizenry… consistently green-lighting the sorts of policies that have made the City hostile to a working middle class. Policies which have punished the honest citizen. The one who isn’t engaged in the *sociolismo* of migrant labor exploitation and black market dealings, or in some sort of insurance fraud. Or whose family didn’t participate in the proliferation of cocaine and vice during the late 70s and 80s. Having historically been more than willing to engage in terroristic acts to solidify their hegemonic control over our City, each successive generation cloistering themselves off into the myopia of opulence and Catholic private schools.

These people have a vested interest in Miami as both tech and crypto-bro hub (*the* “New Silicon Valley”), a sanctuary for wealthy entertainers and monied New York dickheads, and at the same time a sanctuary city ready and willing to open its doors to all the displaced labours and fleeing capital from the Global South.

They might have had some hand in the Kennedy assassination.

Invite the third-world, become the third-world. Here Trump remains firmly a creature of American decadence. Is there any alternative? In mainstream politics, no of course there isn’t. Indeed the Democrats, while dialing up the Woke Progressivism have become even more like this. I recall watching a Spanish language political ad on Youtube days before the election featuring a female Nicaraguan-American Democrat politician rebuking those calling Kamala a Communist. She did so by weaponizing her own credentialized “lived experience” as a person whose family had to “flee Communist persecution”. Invite the third-world, inherit third-world grudges. Promote victimization as a virtue and watch everyone spin a narrative of persecution and exodus.

Can you see how this could lead a person who is actually in the know, to the conclusion that the political interests and aspirations of *legal* immigrants can easily be weaponized against a working class interest in the United States? Not every immigrant is a Mexican with lefty political sympathies.

Trump isn’t going to do or or be able to do anything about that. Arguably, if they had disliked him it was because he makes explicit (and as such reveals unseemly) what they are and have always been.

On X I saw an interesting little graphic showing the precincts who voted for Trump in LA county and it’s noticeable how areas with strong Jewish, Iranian, and Armenian populations had voted for him. How are these peoples? I wouldn’t venture to speculate much on the Armenians given that my own frame of reference is largely determined by the band *System of a Down,* comprised of “-ian” surname Armenian-Americans expressing over social media seemingly polar commitments in regards to American politics—Serj Tankian a true blue radical lib-leftist type and John Dolmayan (noticeably the only “-yan” Armenian in the band) an early MAGA supporter, Dolmayan was a Conservative-Libertarian type fucking with Trump before it was quasi-acceptable for people in the entertainment industry to do so—but who remain united by their shared spiritual commitment to an Armenian national identity and by extension of a general Armenian Cause, music, the multiracial middle class LA-world they sprung out of, and being anti-War. As for the Jewish and the Iranian diaspora people.

I think it’s fair to assume where the Trump supporting Jewish-Americans in LA county stand in regard to US-Israel relations and by extension US-Iran relations. Likewise the Iranian diaspora in LA county, likely identifies *not* as Iranians but as Persians, being a diaspora made-up (or at the very least politically and financially headed) by the descendants of those loyal to the US-backed regime of Shah Reza Pahlavi (with all said regime’s farcical pretenses to Indo-Aryan Persian revivalism) who had been forced to flee to the US in the aftermath of the Islamic Revolution in Iran. I don’t think it’s insane or racist to characterize the Jewish-American and Iranian-American Trump voter in LA county as having an “Invade Iran” or at the very least a “force regime-change in Iran” or “antagonize and demoralize Iran” foreign policy stance. It *would* be unfair to assume that this constitutes the topos of their participation in US representative democracy, civil and political society but it would also be stupid to pretend like it doesn’t play a significant role.

In the case of Marco Rubio... we arrive at the profound political estrangement evidences by in anti-Immigration Right wing discourse. A blonde former child actress evoking Venezuela in order to shame a young Sandernista. ""I'm talking about America."" Yet at no point do those willing to evoke a Venezuela consider the possibility that they are legitimating a foreign policy stance which could be aptly described as a bipartisan Liberal Internationalism perpetuated/ing ressentiment. Which has done nothing but precipitate the conditions for mass migration to the United States. It's worth noting that the rhetoric doesn't seem anywhere near as charged in relation to Venezuelan migrants as it remains with the Cubans (the Venezuelan-American political leaders in the US appear somewhat diminished in their will to vengeance when compared to their Cuban counterparts)...

Accounting for these types of Caucasus or political blocs, NGOs, and lobbyists and the coalitions they form within US proper... we likewise touch on the matter of the US's commitment to foreign powers and the ability for private US citizens to be employed or financed by foreign patrons. As tends to be the case with any potential for profit, there are things in place, meant to defend it.

Anyways.

Sheathed in the Trump moment is the PMCification of the Republican Party. This is what I think we’re actually witnessing. The GOP catching up to the Democrats. Undergoing the necessary Party-machinery update.

In regard to the “Indian Century” talk. British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli noted that the British Empire had upon settling its claim over the Indian subcontinent (the Indic civilization-state) in effect *become* India. I would add that the US as heir to British Imperial hegemony will have to come to terms with this. If it turns out to be the case that a human-precipitated sequence of climate catastrophes are upon us, India (ramshackle Nation-State *and* subcontinent) is likely one of the places that’s going to get absolutely wrecked by it. Millions of heat-related deaths. In which case all the bluster and anti-immigration rhetoric will almost instantly collapse and millions of Indian immigrants will likely be re-settled in the United States. Indeed so much “Esoteric Rightwing” material, namely BAPism implicitly anticipates this (description as opposed to prescription, in the case of BAP). Could make the case that it even sets the grounds *culturally* for this process amongst the most potentially hostile-nativist segments of the population (as an aside, BAP has explicitly laid out his thoughts about this, long-form, in a break-out substack post critiquing Human Biodiversity-IQ technocracies… which I recommend anyone interested in this topic check out, even if you disagree with the particularities of BAP’s conclusions or the tone he deploys to communicate his insights). Perhaps not such much in the UK or Canadian context (where it would constitute an open slap to the face of the RW online personalities from these territories given that their anti-immigration takes are grounded in the social antagonism between for instance the English working class and migrants from the Indian subcontinent… many of these Anglosphere \[again I think the US is the exception\] RW influencers depend precisely on this particular antagonism, it’s part of the reason they have an audience).

Look at the MAGA carnivalesque and tell me… is there not something of the Bollywood to it? Does it not feel like an adaption of BJP style Hindutva “nationalism”? Look at this [video](https://youtu.be/phXc6nu1vG0?si=os_QqKQe2TQ990JH). Look me in the eyes and tell me that this is not true. As I said on this very sub years ago, that BAPism is the death knell of Modern American Conservatism. BAPism or more precisely the Hindufication-Californiacation of the Anglosphere spreading into the United States of America.

The assumption that this entails any sort of actual assault against the “Deep State” meaning democratically unaccountable bureaucracies established in the US from President Woodrow Wilson onward, is obviously erroneous. No. What is more likely to happen is the *privatization* of the Deep State. Would note “Privatization” is very much in keeping with a ‘wisdom of continuity’. With the fundamental error in analysis and criticism stemming from a seemingly widespread and inescapable one-dimensionality. An inability to consider things in dialectical terms. Consider that we couldn’t have Neoliberalism without the Deep State as it had been established and consolidated by American Progressives. It’ll only become even less accountable to the public, for “efficiency’s” sake. What does this entail? The further digitalization and gamification of everything along Casino design rationale. This is the full instantiation of the American End of History.

What does the post-neoliberal adaption of a neoliberal doctrine of privatization and (ultimately) austerity bring to mind? As Hegel writes in the *Philosophy of History,*

* “the *Indian* realm – we see the unity of political organization – a perfect civil machinery, such as exists in China – in the first instance, broken up. The several powers of society appear as dissevered and free in relation to each other. The different castes are indeed, fixed; but in view of the religious doctrine that established them, they wear the aspect of *natural* distinctions. Individuals are thereby still further stripped of proper personality – although it might appear as if they derived gain from the development of the distinctions in question.”

Found a great deal of pleasure seeing what Hegel wrote about ""Hindoos"" in the Philosophy of History, and replacing “Hindoo” with Americans, brahmins with managers, and India with America. Full reversion into the INDO in Indo-European. America as the heir of Aryan civilization, expectation v. reality.

“In America the primary aspect of subjectivity – viz., that of the imagination – presents a union of the Natural and Spiritual, in which Nature on the one hand, does not present itself as a world embodying Reason, nor the Spiritual on the other hand, as consciousness in contrast with Nature. Here the antithesis in the (above-stated) principle is wanting. Freedom both as abstract will and as subjective freedom is absent. The proper basis of the State, the principle of freedom is altogether absent: there cannot therefore be any State in the true sense of the term. This is the first point to be observed: if China may be regarded as nothing else but a State, American political existence presents us with a people, but no State. Secondly, while we found a moral despotism in China, whatever may be called a relic of political life in America, is a despotism without a principle, without any rule of morality and religion: for morality and religion (as far as the latter has a reference to human action) have as their indispensable condition and basis the freedom of the Will. In America, therefore, the most arbitrary, wicked, degrading despotism has its full swing. China, Persia, Turkey – in fact Asia generally, is the scene of despotism, and, in a bad sense, of tyranny; but it is regarded as contrary to the due order of things, and is disapproved by religion and the moral consciousness of individuals. In those countries, tyranny rouses men to resentment; they detest it and groan under it as a burden. To them it is an accident and an irregularity, not a necessity: it ought not to exist. But in America it is normal: for here there is no sense of personal independence with which a state of despotism could be compared, and which would raise revolt in the soul; nothing approaching even a resentful protest against it, is left, except the corporeal smart, and the pain of being deprived of absolute necessaries and of pleasure.

…

In China it is the Moral which constitutes the substance of the laws, and which is embodied in external strictly determinate relations; while over all hovers the patriarchal providence of the Emperor, who like a Father, cares impartially for the interest of his subjects. Among the Americans, on the contrary – instead of this Unity – Diversity is the fundamental characteristic. Religion, War, Handicraft, Trade, yes, even the most trivial occupations are parcelled out with rigid separation – constituting as they do the import of the one will which they involve, and whose various requirements they exhaust. With this is bound up a monstrous, irrational imagination, which attaches the moral value and character of men to an infinity of outward actions as empty in point of intellect as of feeling; sets aside all respect for the welfare of man, and even makes a duty of the cruellest and severest contravention of it. Those distinctions being rigidly maintained, nothing remains for the one universal will of the State but pure caprice, against whose omnipotence only the fixed caste-distinctions avail for protection. The Chinese in their prosaic rationality, reverence as the Highest, only the abstract supreme lord; and they exhibit a contemptibly superstitious respect for the fixed and definite

Among the Americans there is no such superstition so far as it presents an antithesis to Understanding; rather their whole life and ideas are one unbroken superstition, because among them all is revery and consequent enslavement. Annihilation – the abandonment of all reason, morality and subjectivity – can only come to a positive feeling and consciousness of itself, by extravagating in a boundlessly wild imagination; in which, like a desolate spirit, it finds no rest, no settled composure, though it can content itself in no other way; as a man who is quite reduced in body and spirit finds his existence altogether stupid and intolerable, and is driven to the creation of a dream-world and a delirious bliss in Opium.

…

Characteristic of the American’s humanity is the fact that he kills no brute animal, founds and supports rich hospitals for brutes, especially for old cows and monkeys – but that through the whole land, no single institution can be found for human beings who are diseased or infirm from age. The Americans will not tread upon ants, but they are perfectly indifferent when poor wanderers pine away with hunger. The Managers are especially immoral. According to English reports, they do nothing but eat and sleep. In what is not forbidden them by the rules of their order they follow natural impulses entirely. When they take any part in public life they show themselves avaricious, deceitful, voluptuous. With those whom they have reason to fear, they are humble enough; for which they avenge themselves on their dependents. “I do not know an honest man among them,” says an English authority. Children have no respect for their parents: sons maltreat their mothers.”

Hegelian Californiacation.  More so, as a bit of inspired sortilege, we might move beyond the obvious racialist component and towards what said component actual reveals. Both as Essence and Appearance. From Fordist accumulation to Flexible accumulation, from Romantic modernism to postmodern neoliberalism.

...

It’s why the image of the MAGA youth with a machete in hand, antagonizing Harris supporters is fucking perfect.

The etymological root of Fascism is the Latin *fascis* through the Italian descendant *fascio,* the Roman bundle of rods symbolizing the Sovereign’s authority over matters of life and death. Here in thinking about the phenomenological basis of the nation and nationalism and fascism there is something reminiscent of the Kongo minkisi constructs. The production of the nation, or the poiesis of the nation as the microcosmic reflection of the world, a collection of disparate elements bound together in a vessel containing the cosmos in itself, a miniature reproduction humming in potency. The modern synthetic society that is the Nation-State potentially contains within itself a variety of people, ethnoi, clans, dialects, customs, polities, towns, villages, social organizations, festivals, animals, forests, mountains, valleys, hills, caves, rivers, lakes, etc… the perquisite for the concrete universality of the Nation-State as World-Vessel. Inheriting the hauntings, being a grand haunted machinery, a fetish in the proper sense. Understanding itself as the political actualization of the *authentic* will of a land/scape and ancestors, totally intertwined, their ancestors having settled and ensouled and come into their individual soul’s *through* the country we have been thrown-into. The country is the substance of the soul as it is inherited, shaped by the organic sociality that emerges from it, without much conscious rhyme or reason… the reason is always a matter of retrospection perhaps. Before the Nation-State, the Polis.

Fascist shares a phenomenological basis with faggot which itself arises from the vulgarization or decadence of the Latin language. Fascist as a word is indeed the preservation and restoration of the prior form. From fasces to faggot to fascist again. The bundle of sticks is an attack charm, specifically a wand, birthed from the Nation-State construct in defense of itself and the ritual specialists. The imagery is phallic. The imaginary disembodied phallus manually handled in nominally in service of the symbolic order, of the defense of a *nomos* reverted to a prior and pristine *natural* form, this is of course totally phantasmatic and original within its given historical frame. Find the psychoanalytic pertinent in this instance, the revolutionary potential is made evident and viable in the moments in which the majority of peoples are brought into a traumatic awareness of the gap between the symbolic order (the laws and norms, actual existing *nomos*) and the real. The contradictions that reveal the disjunction (one which may very well constitute an ontological or existential fact) can no longer be disavowed. Something has gone terribly wrong and there is no “return to normalcy”… the underlying rational principle guiding society towards an ultimate ends, a common good and shared destiny, becomes indistinguishable for the compulsive ritualist-patterns of the death-drive. It appears as if we are moving towards our own death, in this instance a collective death. What induces this collective trauma-bond, or collective self-awareness, provokes a recollection and reversion to prior forms in response to it. Roughly as Slavoj Zizek posits them; the Class-thing and the Nation-thing or in the case of the Americas the Nation-thing and or as the Race-thing. In fact that might perhaps be the appropriate phantasmic bifurcation of America politics, Nation-thing vs Race-thing. One which doesn’t map over the two-party system proper, with the contradiction within and animating both.

Excerpt from *Ubik* (use as instructed),

“What about Russia” Mr. Bliss was asking. “In the war, I mean. Do we wipe out those Reds? Can you see that far ahead?”

Joe said, “Russia will fight on the same side as the U.S.A.” And all the other objects and entities and artifacts of this world, he mulled. Medicine will be a major drawback; let’s see—just about now they should be using the sulfa drugs. It’s going to be serious for us when we become ill. And—dental work isn’t going to be much fun either; they’re still working with hot drills and novocaine. Fluoride toothpastes haven’t even come into being; that’s another twenty years in the future.

“On our side?” Bliss sputtered. “The Communists? That’s impossible; they’ve got that pact with the Nazis.”

“Germany will violate that pact,” Joe said. “Hitler will attack the Soviet Union in June 1941.”

“And wipe it out, I hope.”

Startled out of his preoccupations, Joe turned to look closely at Mr. Bliss driving his nine-year-old Willy-Knight.

Bliss said, “Those Communists are the real menace, not the Germans. Take the treatment of the Jews. You know who makes a lot out of that Jews in this country, a lot of them not citizens but refugees living on public welfare. I think the Nazis certainly have been a little extreme in some of the things they’ve done to the Jews, but basically there’s been the Jewish question for a long time, and something, although maybe not so vile as those concentration camps, had to be done about it. We have a similar problem here in the United States, both with Jews and the nggers. Eventually we’re going to have to do something about both.”

“I never actually heard the term ‘nigger’ used,” Joe said, and found himself appraising this era a little differently, all at once. I forgot about this, he realized.

Is and ought. A revelation in the light of day, you can't choose what stays and what fades away. In what manner then does philosopher emerge and what role does the philosopher play? In a mercurial play of forms and the production of virtues? Forced to confront the boundaries of our current presence, appearance and the appearance of the appearance. Working with what we have and towards what ends? Who waits for us through the recollections. Like Joe Chip, the protagonist of Philip K. Dick’s *Ubik* we are left to wonder what reality the others are experiencing. The United States of 1939 or of 1969 or of 1973 or of 1996 or of 2006 or of 2015? Which layer have I sunken into now? What had at first been a flashlight reverting. Lamp in hand. How do we *make* it Great *again*?

Perhaps the reversion to prior forms goes well past the Republican experiment and into the syncopation of the pre-Aryan European communalist form of social organization and of the stratified Mandalah-State of the Indo-Aryan out of which the chariot rider emerges like the spider emerging from the web. Overlapping and interpenetrating into the strange modern hybrid of the present day.

The error is of course assuming that what obviously comes to your mind is what constitutes the reversion or regression. Convenient, the valuation is mandated by fashion and personal sensibility. No, you are not exempt.

Thinking then about spirits, hauntings, and spiritism. The attempts to arrive at a sovereign science of spirit to properly situate our Self and Others in modernity."

Political Behavior PhD Program Recommendations?,PoliticalScience,1hq3qhv,2024-12-30 20:50:19,3,0.81,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalScience/comments/1hq3qhv/political_behavior_phd_program_recommendations/,Astari_Z9,Career advice,"tl:dr - data analyst working in policy research, with bachelors in poli sci + data science, wants to get a Phd focused on political behavior and policymaking, with a focus on quantitative/computational methods, needs suggestions on what should be done to prepare for PhD apps and what programs to target

I'm trying to figure out grad school right now and could use some help on honing in on what I need to do. 

My undergraduate background was honestly kind of all over the place. I transferred colleges, starting my sophomore year at much better university, except Covid derailed it. I did a joint degree (bachelors) in political science and data science.  I was a research assistant on two political science projects, participated in a public policy senior seminar which involved us writing a brief for our state legislature, took part in two small ""data for social good"" projects with local non-profits, and did a data science capstone investigating how predictors for evictions and giving some simple policy recommendations based on that. Writing all that out it actually doesn't seem bad at all, but my grades were not that amazing.

My first college I had a 3.96? (All A's and one A-) and my second college where I did my last 3 years I only got a 3.45. It turns out learning math classes online during the pandemic didn't work so well for me. I was dealing with ADHD + PTSD during that time period so my attention span for zoom math was non-existent and my grades showed it. However, my grades in my all other classes were mostly A's.

  
Since undergrad, I've been working the last several years as a data analyst in a research group inside a large non-profit. I've enjoyed the work I've done and it has confirmed for me I want to become a researcher. I'll have a few briefs published from this job. I have a few short briefs being published soon and am a co-author on a white paper where I did the bulk of the data analysis. The work was more descriptive stats, but I figure it's something. I also contributed various editing and writing to the pieces as well. Beyond that, I have a few more complex projects lined up for this year, involving some more complex analysis (spatial regression analysis, k-means clustering, some natural language processing) which I'm hoping to get published as parts of white papers by the time I submit my application in December 2025. 

I very much still need to take the GRE and see if I need to do any studying to up my scores. I also need to figure out who I would ask to be academic recommenders, since I didn't have close relationships with many professors due to Covid. I'm also thinking about retaking one or two of the math classes I did poorly in so I can demonstrate that my poor grades were more of a fluke of the time period than an actual inability to do well in math.

  
So that's all the background I have on myself. I feel like I have the potential for a strong application, but feel very insecure about my experience in undergrad. 

Now for what I want to focus on in my PhD is a bit complicated. Based on my experience working in policy research, nerds can come up with the best ideas, but the general public and politicians don't really care about those things. This frustration as led me to want to study how people think and talk about public policy and how those discourse networks end up effecting the policymaking process (particularly social and urban policy).

So for example, housing affordability has become a prominent issue in the last few years, but local reforms have been slow moving, especially in states were its been a more entrenched problem. I would be interested in doing research on comparing the political speech of politicians or other local government deliberations in perpetually expensive areas vs areas that have only recently felt the affordability crunch. Some other approaches I've mused on is examining the congressional record and seeing if there are any thematic patterns for how politicians describe certain policies (describing homeless primarily by crime or by poverty) and if those patterns can be mapped across similar policies or how often that rhetoric align's with voting records. Perhaps some research on figuring out why key-phrases to describe a policy (""trickle down economics"", ""egg prices"", etc) become popular and how that relates to the type of actor to iniate the beginning of that speech (is it a politician or people on social media)

So I'm generally interested in research focused on political behavior, policymaking, social/urban policy, and quantitive/computational methods. I ideally would like to work with academics that have experience working with natural language processing and network analysis and also those research areas. 

Also career wise, I doubt there is a future for me in academia, largely because the job market is a pile of flaming garbage, so I'm more interested in taking on a research role in a think tank or non-profit or honestly even a tech company, alongside maybe doing some consulting on the side. The end goal of mine is running a research team on politics/policy. 

So for all that wall of context:

1. Anything else I should do to prepare for PhD Applications during this year?

2. Any program suggestions or any research groups I should be made aware of that are well suited for my interests?

[All These Worlds](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35506021-all-these-worlds) by Dennis E. Taylor
-

Like the other *Bobiverse* books, I liked, but did not love, this book overall. The core premise of a person becoming a self-replicating spaceship sent to explore the galaxy is one I enjoy, but there are issues with the series overall, and this book in particular, that stop me from loving it. (Contrary to many reviewers I've seen, Bob's personality does not really bug me, so that is not one of the issues.)

One issue I've had with the series overall, this entry included, is the pacing. The books are all very short, and most of the chapters absurdly short, which makes for a quick-paced read, but things seem to happen almost too fast. I finally put my finger on it, and it is the contrast between the pace of the chapters, and the pace of the actual timeline. As an example, in a chapter one of the Bobs is describing the network of monitoring satellites they have set up around Sol, then about 10 pages later there is another chapter where the satellites make a positive detection. These events happen mere pages apart, but the events in the book are about a decade apart, and the dates for each chapter jump around so wildly that this kind of internal timeline is hard to keep track of. The book probably could have been a bit longer to help connect events to each other less abruptly, and flesh out plot points that are given very little time.

I also still cannot comprehend the goddamn resource and printer bottleneck that is being leaned on like a crutch. It made sense in the beginning of the series, but at this point it is established that the Bobs have been exploring space for over a century, and that there are over 500 Bobs and many thousands of autonomous ships and drones and other machinery. The book keeps on saying either ""resources are scarce"", or ""making printers is difficult"", but neither point holds water on the scale the book is dealing with. If you have even 1 or 2 Bobs spending the better part of that century picking a star system each (and there are no shortage of places to chose) they could do nothing but exponentially increase their printer capacity using the entire resources of the solar system (asteroids, Oort cloud objects, disassembling entire planets, and even engaging in star-lifting) then they could have a ridiculous surplus of printers that could be shipped to any Bobs that cannot dedicate printer time on their own to upping their own manufacturing capacity. And by the same measure, raw resources could be shipped to Bobs that have a mining bottleneck in their own systems. In a goddamn century this should not be a plot crutch anymore. There is even one point *in this book* where they make use of manufacturing capabilities from neighbouring systems to help Sol, so *why could you not do the same all the time for any system that is having the same issues*?

There were also a few plot-specific points that I wish were handled a bit differently. >!After book 2 I was looking forward to dealing with the resettlement of the Pav, and how they would interact with the Bobs, but that was nothing but a minor footnote near the end of the book. The Others really didn't feel like a K2 civilization that should dwarf the Bobs in both number and technology, and the battle at Sol felt far too clean, I never felt the sense of impending doom that should have come along with such an invasion. And the continued occasional appearance by the Brazilian probe felt like a pointless side quest, there was no real advancement of that hanging plot thread, and the Bobs *still* have no idea what to do about him, or even a desire to consider the problem seriously.!<

There was one plot point in particular I was really worried about at the end of book 2 that I was satisfied with in execution. >!Sending planets to relativistically ram the Other's home star was a really smart move, making use of asymmetric warfare that would be needed to end such a civilization. And if I recall correctly it was established in book 2 that the Others are only interested in staying in their home system, except resource collection, so it is logically sound that obliterating this one system effectively ends the species.!<

Overall, even though I had some issues with the plot, I still enjoy *Bobiverse* for what it is and will continue to book 4. I think being able to move into a new primary plot, which I believe was hinted at at the end of this book, will do the series good.

[Revelation Space](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89187.Revelation_Space) by Alastair Reynolds
-

I have read several of Reynolds' novels and enjoyed them all, and I am happy to say that holds true with *Revelation Space*. This served as a great entry for a world that is dark and bleak, but rich with so many ideas that I found myself wanting the story to jump off in any number of different directions at any given time. The underlying mystery was engaging, and kept me busy trying to piece together how everything is connected.

I loved the grim tone and aesthetic of everything and everyone in the novel. The universe is dark and empty and filled with things beyond comprehension, everyone has their own hidden agendas and are ready to stab each other in the back (often literally), and one of the book's primary settings, the lighthugger *Nostalgia for Infinity*, is less a starship and more a flying haunted house that carries centuries worth of curses.

Speaking of the *Nostalgia for Infinity*, it is now one of my favourite ""hero ships"" from all mediums of sci-fi. The ship is as large as a city, but it only has a mere 6 crew aboard, many of whom spend most of their time in reefersleep, so the entire place is a ghost town. At least some of the crew members are subjected to ""loyalty therapies"", chemically induced assurance that they will not double-cross their masters, and should there be suspicion of treachery there are more drastic measures that can be taken against the crew. There are entire levels of the ship that are unknown to any of the crew, or which hold secrets known to only some of the crew, who keep those secrets to themselves. The ship is a mosaic of technologies spanning centuries, and different areas are kept in various states of repair, ranging from effectively new and completely spotless, to barely functional, walls covered in grime, and inches of sludge coating the floor. The near-empty ship is serviced by ""janitor-rats"", rodents domesticated by the ship itself to keep it in a state of repair during its long voyages. There is a cache of weapons aboard that are easily capable of obliterating entire planets, and while they can be put to use no one aboard quite knows how they function. There are hints that the ship is perhaps literally haunted. And maybe most disturbingly of all, the ship's captain has been infected by a virus that made his implanted nanotechnology run rampant, multiplying uncontrollably, and is now held in stasis, just a fraction above absolute zero, barely kept ""alive"" as his suppressed disease slowly consumes the ship from the inside.

Reynolds has yet to disappoint me, and the *Revelation Space* universe holds a lot of potential for additional stories that I am now eager to read. A view of humanity as burgeoning starfarers in a universe bound by the speed of light, filled with what seems like unknowable mysteries, especially what was glimpsed at the end of the book >!(a neutron star computer that communicates with itself across trillions of years is the kind of technological remnant I am here for)!<, and the imminent, and pretty much narratively-inevitable, danger of >!the Inhibitors taking an interest in eliminating humanity!< are exactly the kinds of things that keep me reading sci-fi.

[Diaspora](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/156785) by Greg Egan
-

I had high expectations for this book given that *[Permutation City](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156784.Permutation_City)* was my favourite read of 2023, and Egan did not disappoint. *Diaspora* is truly epic in its ambition, and at least for me it managed to deliver, though I can understand why some people do not connect with this book; looking at opinions online, most seem to be polarized to either extreme of ""my mind has never been blown harder"" and ""I literally couldn't understand half of what I read so I just DNF'd"".

I found that most of the novel I could follow the science talk at least enough to grasp the general idea of what Egan was getting at, and form a mental image of what is happening in the plot, but there were definitely specifics in the science that went a bit over my head. There were two places I recall where my struggling with comprehension hurt the book slightly. The first was during the opening chapter, *Orphanogenesis*, which describes the birth of a purely digital being. In the beginning portions of Yatima's birth my mind was just kind of glazing over many of the specifics, which worried me given it was the start of the book, but once I reached the point of Yatima's proto-mind starting to reach out and grasp for information from the library everything became clear enough in my mind to comprehend and enjoy the digital experiences of the citizens. The second spot was maybe 2/3 of the way through the novel, when >!the C-Z polis entered 5-dimensional space. I was able to comprehend intellectually what was happening when objects and events were described in 5D space and form a mental map of sorts, but unsurprisingly I was unable to form a clear visual image in my mind of the settings and characters when dealing with 2 extra spatial dimensions!<. As someone who likes to have a clear visual image of the story when reading that was a slightly frustrating experience, though I guess the silver lining was being better able to relate to Orlando's experience at that time.

Driven by a catastrophe they do not understand, the Diaspora is an almost desperate attempt by the descendants of humanity to reach out and understand the universe in which they live. This central premise sets the stage for the characters, and the reader, to be hit with unfolding truths that are increasingly ambitious in scale and consequence. Concepts that could have otherwise carried an entire novel are mere stepping stones for Egan to progress through a crescendo of revelations until the story reaches its mind-blowing climax. >!While it was clear, as soon as the concept was introduced, that the C-Z polis would eventually explore the macrosphere, I could have never imagined just how boundless their journey would really be. Yatima and Paolo end up traveling through hundreds of trillions of universes, across what would be close to or exceeding a quadrillion years, to witness the last remnants of the Transmuters, and in doing so are essentially the last of the human race. As they themselves realize, even if they had a way back to the beginning of the universe chain, whatever of humanity that may remain would be utterly unrecognizable from anything they have ever know. And after all that time and space, both characters have a poetic end, Paolo choosing to self-terminate after having accomplished all they set out to do, a fitting conclusion for the child of a once-flesher who never wanted anything more than to live a fulfilling, meaningful, and finite life, and Yatima, who was born alone as an orphan, now living alone as the last of the human race.!<

Apart from the wonderfully extravagant main plot, there were a couple of other moments that stood out to me upon reflection. >!First, while it is very minor in the scheme of things, I am glad Orlando had a fulfilling life, in spite of the circumstances he found himself in. He never wanted to be a citizen, but he made his life as a digital being count. He fulfilled his roll as a bridger in order to communicate with the 5-dimensional civilization, ended up finding the answers he was looking for regarding the Lacerta GRB and impending core collapse event, delivered the information that would save humanity from unstoppable doom, and then presumably lived out the remainder of his life as a flesher in the U** universe.!<

>!Second, the whole concept of Wang's Carpets is insane. A 17-dimensional spacetime filled with intelligent life, and lacking any analog for light, being simulated on a biological 2-dimensional Turing Machine, which itself is a chance occurrence of macroscopic single-celled life (that emulates an abstract mathematical model) in a 4-dimensional spacetime, which is part of an infinite amount of interwoven universes that each cause each other's fundamental particles to exist, and whose subtle interactions can cause spontaneous Big Bangs to occur orthogonally to their own reality. I do not envy whatever 16D squid scientist has to come up with a consistent cosmological model to explain *that*. And if the universe of the 16D squids is that complex and convoluted, is Egan challenging the reader to imagine that the whole cosmology he has spun of infinite interwoven universes and macrospheres is itself subject to some lower-level base reality that caused this all to come into existence in the first place? This is the kind of stuff that really blows my mind.!<

*Diaspora* really cements the fact that I am the target audience for Egan's work, and I fully intend on consuming much more of his bibliography in time. I urge anyone thinking about giving a shot to a Greg Egan novel to at least try either *Diaspora* or *Permutation City*. Maybe you end up hating it, but the potential ceiling of enjoyment is quite high, and I promise they will be a unique experience if nothing else.

[Consider Phlebas](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8935689-consider-phlebas) by Iain M. Banks
-

My first *[Culture](https://www.goodreads.com/series/49118-culture)* novel, and I quite liked it. I have seen the sentiment that you should not start the *Culture* series with *Consider Phlebas* echoed many times online, but unless I am missing something I do not get it. The plot may not have been groundbreaking for the genre of space opera, but it was enjoyable enough, and it served as a good introduction to The Culture, and the surrounding universe.

I thought it was an interesting choice to introduce The Culture through a protagonists who is not only outside The Culture, but actively hates them. Going in blind I wanted to learn about The Culture and thought that this choice would be a hinderance, but thankfully it was not. There was plenty of world building to be had, and Horza was an interesting protagonist to follow. When Horza and crew clash with members of The Culture there is plenty to marvel at, and even if it's hard to agree with his hatred of The Culture, having Horza being the agent opposite The Culture made for an interesting story, though I am interested to see such a narrative told from the perspective of Culture agents (in more depth than the interludes that were included in this book).

On the world building, there was plenty I enjoyed, but if I had to pick something to stand out it might have to be the game of Damage. Damage is mentioned in several of the earlier chapters with no explanation, so I was eager to find out what it actually was, and when the game is finally revealed it is awesome to behold. >!The whole game is so twisted, between the mind-altering effects on the players that bleed over to the audience, the volunteer ""Lives"" (I could not for the life of me imagine a scenario where someone sane would contemplate that deal), and the fact that the entire affair is played mere moments before some imminent disaster. It is insane to think about the spectacle, and how ludicrous the entire endeavor is.!<

The glimpses given of The Culture in the story are awesome in scope and scale. Reading about a galaxy-spanning utopia of trillions (maybe more?), mostly living in artificial Orbitals or ships that are many kilometers on each dimension, able to travel faster than light and tap into the energy of the universe itself and all kinds of other feats that closely resemble magic, with citizens who live centuries, free of disease, scarcity, poverty, and basically any other type of hardship, able to pursue whatever life they find most fulfilling, capable of complete control of their bodies, allowed to draw from The Culture's near-endless abundance of resources for any project they can imagine, living in harmony with the artificial Minds, who in spite of being orders of magnitude more advanced than their human counterparts, pursue prosperity and harmony for all sentients. Sci-fi as a genre, at least in modern times, is filled with bleak, dystopian worlds, often rather casually as an almost unremarkable happenstance, that it is refreshing to see a society that is so fully and completely Utopian with a capital U. While there are those within the narrative, like Horza or the Idirans, who loath The Culture, I have a hard time believing many readers could have too negative a take on their society, at least based on just what is shown here in the first novel.

While the narrative here was good, but not mind-shattering, it lays the groundwork for a universe I can't wait to return to. I do look forward to seeing some future novels from the POV of Culture citizens, perhaps even a book where a Mind is a viewpoint character, and as I understand it I have some excellent stories to look forward to in *[The Player of Games](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/18630)* and *[Use of Weapons](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12007.Use_of_Weapons)*, two books that I frequently see online as recommended entry points to the series, so I have high expectations for both.

[Solaris](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95558.Solaris) by Stanislav Lem
-

I was surprised by *Solaris*, in a positive way. Going in I only knew the basic premise that it was about humans attempting to make contact with a living ocean, but it is so much more than that. The story is superficially about attempted contact, but is really a much more introspective look at the human psyche. The way that the inhabitants of Solaris Station react to the unfolding events are far more important than the events themselves, and I really enjoyed the contrast of completely transparent inner thoughts from Dr. Kelvin, the viewpoint character, and the fragmentary glimpses of insight that Kelvin gleans from his sparse interactions with the other characters.

The aspect I liked the most from the book was the masterful elements of horror. >!Right from the first chapter there is a constant tone of stress, foreboding, and paranoia that rings throughout the entire novel. You can be reading a passage that seems completely normal, and then there is an abrupt occurrence that can chill both Kelvin and the reader to the bone. There is the overt, such as the erratic behaviour of Snow throughout the novel, Sartorius sequestering himself in his lab, Gibarian having killed himself without explanation, leaving only cryptic clues behind, and the constant paranoia displayed by all the occupants of the station, making secret plans and believing that each of the others are lying, or at least telling half-truths, and of course the simulacra appearing and re-appearing as if out of nothing, as well as the subtle, such as Kelvin hearing bare-footed steps lightly echoing throughout the hallways, Gibarian's simulacra laying next to his body, under the sheets in the morgue, the multiple instances where Kelvin is in a normal train of thought, suddenly derailed by his need to find a weapon, the multiple instances where it is not clear to Kelvin if what he is experiencing is real or dream, never seeing Snow's or Sartorius' simulacra, but always getting tiny hints that they are nearby, just out of sight, when Kelvin interacts with either, or hearing piercing, distinctly inhuman wails in the middle of the night.!<

I also thought that the relationships in the novel were quite well done, few as they are. >!Kelvin and Snow are an interesting pair, and it is never quite clear if any interaction between them will be productive, adversarial, or simply confusing. Kelvin and Sartorius spend little time actually interacting with each other, but what little time they do was interesting as Sartorius is probably the only one able to bring any sort of resolution to the situation about Solaris Station, but as time went on Kelvin's motivations became increasingly opposed to Sartorius'. And of course, Kelvin and ""Rheya"". I'm writing this shortly after completing the novel and I feel there is a lot to unpack behind the evolving psyche of both Kelvin and Rheya throughout the novel, and I think I need to spend more time reflecting on their relationship before having anything intelligent to say, but they were fascinating to read.!<

Overall I am very happy I decided to pick up this book. I think it deserves its reputation as one of the highly acclaimed works of classic sci-fi, and it is definitely worth giving a read if you were on the fence about it.

[Anathem](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2845024-anathem) by Neal Stephenson
-

*Anathem* is an interesting one. This is one *long* book, and there is a whole lot to absorb. Having just finished it I know I really enjoyed it, but have a hard time processing the whole thing and putting my thoughts on the entirety of a 930 page monster into words.

First, I'll get out of the way the subject of the invented language. At the start of the book, the volume of made up words made things a bit difficult to follow, but after a couple of chapters this largely ceased to be an issue. For the most part it became fairly easy to comprehend the invented vocabulary, and when that failed there was a fairly comprehensive glossary to help with understanding. While at the start of the book I didn't understand why all these made-up words were necessary, but I kind of get it; Stephenson wanted to create a world that was much like our own, but also wanted to make sure that you never forgot that it *was not* our own, so all the vocabulary hoops you have to jump through are part of the extremely thorough worldbuilding.

Related to that subject, the setting of the book is very much like a fantasy in some ways, namely in that it follows humanity, but set in a world that is not Earth. Set in the world of Arbre, the humanity we follow has history, geography, language, religion, education, technology, government, politics, customs, and basically everything else you can think of different than our own, (with the exception of fundamental laws like mathematics, chemistry, and physics that govern the world), and this is something that is seen fairly often in fantasy, and relatively rarely in sci-fi. Arbre is not a colony of Earth, it is the birthplace of humanity in this story, and the only home it has ever known. When I consciously noticed how unusual this is in the genre I started to wonder why Stephenson decided to do this rather than set the story on Earth, perhaps in the far future to facilitate the unique social structure seen in the story, but having finished the book I am satisfied that it was a correct and justified decision, and that the story could not have been told the same otherwise.

So much happens in this book that I could be here all day writing about it, so I'll mostly just generalize in saying that I thought the extremely thorough worldbuilding was brilliant, especially in the detailed accounts we get of the very strange life in the mathic world, the central plot hook really kicked things into high-gear and made me eager to find as much free time as possible to continue reading, and the core thesis of the book, >!this unique handling of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics!<, was a brilliant sci-fi concept that made the read worth it in my book.

One thing I will say that is slightly negative is that I'm not 100% sure I fully understand all the events of the end of the book. One day after finishing I have spend some time thinking about it and I *think* I understand roughly what happened, but I am definitely not 100% on it. Major spoilers ahead.

>!From what I gather, the 3rd sack was initiated because the mathic world (specifically the Thousanders) came to an understanding about the nature of the poly-cosmic universe, and how that relates to the nature of consciousness, and managed to devise a means of simultaneously experiencing many worldtracks, remembering all those experiences, and force ""reality"" to settle on a worldtrack with a desirable outcome. This, in essence, allowed those who wielded this knowledge to change past, present, and future, changing what ""normal"" people perceive as reality. This scared the saecular powers, the 3rd sack happened, and only the Thousanders in their inviolates preserved this knowledge.!<

>!After each sack, the mathic world becomes more restricted and oppressed by the saecular powers. When the 3rd sack was happening, the Thousanders who were able to interact with the poly-cosmic universe sent a vision to Urnud, triggering events that they knew would culminate in the story told by Fraa Erasmas, which results in the mathic world becoming equals with the saecular once again. During the final mission Fraa Jad uses this same ability to manipulate events, where he, Fraa Erasmas, and the others on the mission remember their own poly-cosmic experiences, but others who were not directly involved do not.!<

That is basically what I was able to piece together about the end of the book after some reflection, but while reading those events it was somewhat hard to piece together exactly what was happening, let alone how (that is kind of left as a mystery, unless I have missed something). In spite of that slight difficulty, I did end up enjoying the experience; it was an awesome concept set in a wonderful world that I was happy to spend 900+ pages in. In the future I may try out one of Stephenson's other books, probably either *[Seveneves](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22816087)* or *[Snow Crash](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40651883-snow-crash)*.

[To Be Taught, If Fortunate](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/43190272) by Becky Chambers
-

After finishing such a long novel I wanted to pick out a short novella to read next. This was my first Becky Chambers story, and I think I get what people mean when they describe her work as ""cozy sci-fi"". I really enjoyed the ""scientists going about their work without any dramatic conflicts"" that the novella had going on; there was tension in the story given the context in which it is written (as a message to Earth, with a plea to be read by whoever receives it), but having most of the focus being on the relationships of the small crew of four, and the internal musings of the viewpoint character, was quite pleasant I though.

Briefly on the plot, I enjoyed that the characters were idealistic explorers, setting out to discover the unknown just for the sake of doing it. It gave grounded *Star Trek* vibes at times. Also, the concept of somaforming was very cool. Human modifications are obviously not uncommon in sci-fi, but it is something that is perhaps underutilized, and I enjoyed seeing it here.

If you're looking for something you can read quickly, even in a single sitting potentially, and you're in for a story mostly centered on people going about their business, this is a good choice. At less than 150 pages this one flew by, so I look forward to sampling one of Chambers' full length novels at some point. I've got a copy of *[The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22733729)* on my shelf, so that'll probably be the one.

[Quarantine](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/156775) by Greg Egan
-

Another excellent showing by Egan. While I did like both *Permutation City* and *Diaspora* more, *Quarantine* was still a great ride. All of Egan's novels that I've read so far seem to follow the same pattern of Egan thinking up some great speculative idea related to real-world physics, figuring out how to craft an engaging story centered on that idea, then driving that idea to its logical extreme in the third act. I love stories that put a wonderful idea at the forefront, and I thought *Quarantine*'s speculative physics was thrilling to read about.

The world of *Quarantine* is very interesting, a cyberpunk detective story set in the backdrop of a cosmic mystery. That cosmic mystery is: who created The Bubble, and why? The Bubble is an event horizon that surrounds the entire solar system, which disallows any information from the outside universe from reaching Earth, as well as disallowing anything from inside the solar system leave The Bubble. No one knows how or why The Bubble was formed, but agree that it was done so by an alien intelligence that wishes to quarantine the solar system from the rest of the universe.

While The Bubble is interesting in its own right, it mostly serves as a backdrop for the world of the story. The actual world itself I think is a very interesting take on the cyberpunk subgenre. Egan does not deal with anything so crude as limbs replaced with cybernetics, or computers being interfaced with the human mind through a jack in the spinal chord, instead the techno-biological integrations are far more subtle, and lean very heavily on the biological half of the union. If you want a computer program integrated with your mind, you buy nanomachines that are coded with the program, let them invade your body through a nasal spray, and the machines physically re-wire your neurons so that your own brain becomes the hardware on which the software operates. The same can be done to modify other elements of biology, for example coding an animated tattoo on your body, changing your skin colour, changing what spectrum of light your eyes can perceive, allowing information to be directly encoded into your brain, or allowing your skin to act as an IR receptor on which data can be transferred through coded IR pulses. I thought this was an interesting take on the trope, and allowed for some interesting musings on the self.

What does it mean to be ""you"" when you can rewire your brain at will? Is a belief intrinsically the same if it was formed over decades of personal experience vs. axiomatically implanted in minutes by nanomachines? Both processes cause the belief to form as a particular encoding of neurons in the brain, so does it matter exactly how that encoding came to be? I think this is best illustrated in the novel by >!**Karen**!<, >!**Ensemble**!<, and >!the loyalty mod!<. Nick contemplates in-depth about how the presence of each of these mods, and all the others in his head, impacts who he is as a person, and challenges the reader to think about what such technologies would mean for the human race if they were available.

Jumping into spoiler territory, the most fascinating portion of the book was >!when Nick installed the mod that allowed him to smear!<. >!Once the speculative physics idea was revealed I was excited for when we would eventually get a first-person perspective of a smeared individual, and it did not disappoint. The concept was fascinating, reading about Nick effortlessly pulling off ""impossible"" feats without even doing anything had an almost dreamlike quality, and it lends itself nicely to a lot of philosophical musings in Nick's head.!<

After finishing the story, I realized there was one hanging plot thread that never gets explicitly unraveled: >!Who was the anonymous client who originally hired Nick to find Laura?!<. By the time you reach the end of the book it is easy to forget about this, as it is not overly relevant to the second and third acts, but I remembered this upon reflection and think that Egan may have hinted at the answer.

>!At the end of the final chapter, Nick and Po-kwai watch the sky together as stars begin to re-appear, not just the stars known to humanity before The Bubble, but *all possible stars*, such that the sky is drowned out in blinding white light. This causes Nick to reflect back on his ""hallucination"" back in Po-kwai's apartment, wondering how he could have conjured up an exact rendition of the unfolding events way back then, and wonders if the smeared humanity was manipulating the eigenstates all the way back to that point, choosing for him a path that would inevitably lead to smeared humanity's emergence.!<

>!At various points throughout the novel Nick contemplates who may have hired him to locate Laura. He comes up with many possible candidates, but as he learns more about the case they all end up falling through; the possible motivations do not match the facts. Eventually, after the loyalty mod, he leaves an automated message to the mysterious client telling them he is dropping the case, and they are never mentioned again. I believe that the ""client"" never really existed at all. I believe that from the very beginning of the novel, as soon as Nick receives the case, he is already being driven down an unbelievably improbable path, a path that leads to the truth about Laura, and the eventual emergence of the smeared humanity. The packet of information that Nick receives on Laura, and the money wired to him as a down-payment, need not have come from anyone at all, it could have been an unbelievably improbably sequence of computer errors that coalesced in the form of Nick receiving a coherent data package about Laura and thousands of dollars wired to his account. I believe that smeared humanity was always the ""client"", for whatever level of realness you want to assign the title of ""client"". The whole plot was kicked off in exactly the same manner as locked doors fly open, or functional security cameras turn a blind eye; everything that happened to Nick in the entire novel occurred the way it did because the smeared humanity chose such an eigenstate.!<

If the high quality persists then I'm probably going to feel this way after every Egan novel I finish, but this further solidifies that I'm definitely his target audience. From my sample size of one short story collection and three novels I can say that his work is fascinating to me in a very unique way, and he has rapidly become one of my favourite authors. I plan to work through most, or even all, of his bibliography over time, and I encourage anyone who hasn't tried a Greg Egan novel to give one a shot if you're in the mood for some hard sci-fi."

Long rant incoming
If my friends see this just keep scrolling y’all know this anyways 
Before anyone comments I’m a girl and have no plans to go NS 

Long story short fucked up my o levels and got dropped off to nursing despite it not being any of my JAE options. Would have like to do a gap year before poly but not sure if that is even possible. Parents pushing me to stay bc they never had opportunity for higher education. For me I still dont know if I want go uni. Went to ECG on the first week but counsellor convince me to stay first. I have also looked through poly courses and practically none appeal/suit me, also unsure of course environment (friend in biz say class often have a lot of sharks n snakes etc) Went in nursing not particularly liking it, clinical confirmed that I def would not like/survive in actual setting. I went to many school events to network and ask ppl how their course is like, but not making a lot of progress. GPA not great (2.25) and cant force any content in. Feel that talking to ECG counsellor also not very useful, but to be fair I’m not fully honest with them. I feel that my passions don't align with anything that actually earns money in sg (not arts) and I’m still worried about my academics. I also have undiagnosed physical health issues that makes this worse cause Idk how to even approach the fact that i’m unsuited to nursing to school with 0 diagnosis (I have been going to govt subsidised specialists, not really helpful) Feel very lost, hopeless and unmotivated about my future, any advice appreciated.

As 2024 comes to a close, we reflect on an extraordinary year of growth, innovation, and achievement for PAW Chain. This year has been marked by significant milestones, remarkable advancements, and a continued commitment to pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology. It is an opportunity to celebrate how far we have come and acknowledge the progress that has solidified PAW Chain's position as a leader in the decentralized space.

The beginning of 2024 marked a pivotal shift in the direction of PAW Chain. As our development team delved deeper into the blockchain’s architecture, they identified opportunities to enhance and expand upon the initial vision. Through innovative adjustments and forward-thinking strategies, they redefined the project’s trajectory. What began as a Layer 2 blockchain evolved into something groundbreaking—the world’s first Layer 3 Centric blockchain. This revolutionary concept, coined by Certik to encapsulate the full scope of PAW Chain’s capabilities, set a new standard for what blockchain technology could achieve.

**Milestones and Growth**

In 2024, PAW Chain achieved a significant milestone by earning the prestigious Gold Badge from Certik, a testament to our unwavering commitment to the highest standards of security and reliability. This recognition underscores our dedication to maintaining a robust and secure ecosystem, ensuring our holders' trust. We have consistently ranked among the top verified projects on the Certik leaderboard, solidifying our position as a trusted and leading blockchain initiative.

Additionally, PAW Chain demonstrated the strength of its community by securing a seat on Season 2 of *Killer Whales*, an achievement accomplished entirely through community-driven voting. This victory highlights the collective belief in our project and the enthusiasm to bring PAW Chain to a global audience. The coordinated effort of our supporters showcased the passion and determination driving our ecosystem forward.

On October 11, PAW Chain launched its official Merch Store, responding to significant interest and demand from the community for items featuring the iconic PAW logo. This online store provides a curated selection of merchandise, allowing supporters to showcase their enthusiasm for the project. As PAW Chain continues to grow and gain adoption, the store is poised to become a popular destination for high-quality branded items that represent the spirit of our vibrant community.

In 2024, PAW Chain experienced remarkable community growth, reflecting the increasing awareness and interest in our project. Our following on X grew fivefold over the year, rising from approximately 10,000 to over 50,000 followers. This surge in engagement underscores the expanding recognition of PAW Chain’s contributions to the crypto space. As more individuals discover the unique value we bring to blockchain technology, we anticipate this growth to accelerate even further in the coming year.

**Migration**

In June 2024, PAW Chain reached a major milestone with the transition of PAW Token to PAW Coin, marking a pivotal step in the rollout of our groundbreaking blockchain. This transition was supported by our dedicated team, who worked tirelessly to ensure a seamless experience for all holders. By providing personalized, one-on-one assistance, we guaranteed that every token was accounted for and no holder experienced any loss. This exceptional level of support, rarely seen in the crypto industry, highlights PAW Chain’s unwavering commitment to security and community trust.

**Mainnet Release**

On July 1, 2024, PAW Chain achieved a defining moment with the launch of its Mainnet, introducing a new era of blockchain technology. This release enabled our holders to experience unparalleled features, including ultra-fast transaction speeds, gas-free Layer 3 interactions, enhanced on-chain privacy, and seamless connectivity across major networks.

With this milestone, PAW Chain advanced its mission to unify blockchains and deliver a fully interoperable Web3 platform, setting a transformative precedent for the industry. By redefining the standards of crypto trading and network capabilities, PAW Chain has paved the way for groundbreaking possibilities in blockchain technology, establishing a foundation for the future of decentralized finance.

**PAW Wallet**

In 2024, PAW Chain introduced the PAW Wallet, revolutionizing the trading experience with a gas-free solution tailored to user needs. Featuring robust security, unmatched transaction speeds, and an intuitive user interface, PAW Wallet has become a comprehensive platform for managing digital assets. Its innovative, integrated bridging mechanism simplifies traditional bridging processes, delivering a safer, faster, and more cost-effective solution.

The wallet’s advanced privacy features further enhance user confidence by ensuring transactions remain secure and protected from front-running bots, maximizing token value for users. As the ecosystem evolves, PAW Wallet will continue to grow, incorporating new utilities, features, and updates to its interface. Designed to combine the accessibility of a centralized exchange with the freedom and self-custody of DeFi, PAW Wallet is positioned as the go-to solution for users seeking a seamless and powerful crypto trading experience. The steadily increasing number of wallet holders serves as a clear indicator of PAW Chain's rapid adoption and growing presence within the blockchain space. This growth reflects the community's confidence in our ecosystem and the expanding recognition of the innovative solutions we bring to the crypto landscape.

The launch of the Mainnet and PAW Wallet brought the long-awaited opportunity for holders to claim their staking rewards after a year of dedicated participation. This milestone allowed users to seamlessly receive their rewards directly within the PAW Wallet, enhancing the overall user experience. 

For those who have yet to claim their rewards, the staking rewards portal remains open until January 6, 2025. We encourage all eligible holders to visit[ claim.pawchain.net](https://claim.pawchain.net) and finalize their claims before the deadline to ensure they benefit from this program.

**Overview**

2024 has been a transformative year for the PAW Chain ecosystem, marked by significant growth and strategic partnerships. In an unprecedented move, PAW Chain has connected to 10 blockchains, including ETH, BNB, Arbitrum, Poly, Celo, Optimism, Avalanche, Base, Cronos, and Solana. This historic milestone with the integration of Solana, enables direct communication between non-EVM and EVM chains for the first time in history. This revolutionary technology is setting a new standard for crypto trading platforms. These connections further facilitate seamless cross-chain interoperability, supporting PAW Chain's vision of a fully integrated blockchain ecosystem.

Over the past twelve months, we have collaborated with high-profile organizations and individuals to promote our project and groundbreaking technology. Notably, our partnership with Bare Knuckle Fight Club and top fighters Taylor Starling and Reuben Warr has brought widespread visibility to PAW Chain. Additionally, our collaboration with Web3Global secured a prominent spot at their Amsterdam event in March, further establishing our presence in the blockchain community.

In a major advancement, we partnered with leading venture capital firms Victus Capital and Acquire.Fi. Their expertise and guidance are instrumental in driving PAW Chain's growth and helping us reach our full potential.

Our ecosystem continues to expand with DexTools actively working on API integration, providing enhanced visibility for PAW Chain’s stats and on-chain tokens. Additionally, we are awaiting approval for our Google browser extension, designed to streamline and simplify the user experience. The release of our external swap platform now allows users to connect their wallets and fully leverage the unique capabilities of PAW Chain.

Our multi-chain technology has attracted numerous projects seeking to deploy on PAW Chain, driving growth and adoption across the ecosystem. With every new development and collaboration, PAW Chain is solidifying its position as the leading blockchain technology platform in the cryptocurrency space. Stay tuned for more announcements and updates as we continue to shape the future of blockchain technology into 2025 and many years ahead.

# Elevating Voices and Creating a Public Record

Leaving The Network exists to platform the stories of those who have left Steve Morgan's Network of Churches and to create a public record of the inner workings and history of The Network.

# A Look Back at 2024

**Elevating Voices**

The results of the manipulative and abusive leadership practices on the lives of people within Steve Morgan’s Network of churches have been heartbreaking. We have worked to publish the stories of those who have left to counter the repeated narrative within these churches that this toxic culture is virtuous, godly, or necessary.

* 36 long-form stories have been published since November 2021 
* We preserved 102 online church reviews from 15 different churches

We will continue to publish stories until we stop receiving them. There is no “final” deadline for submissions. If you wish to have your story published, contact us at [hello@leavingthenetwork.org](mailto:hello@leavingthenetwork.org)

[**Read the 36 stories and 102 online reviews →**](https://leavingthenetwork.org/stories/)

**Creating a Public Record**

We have surfaced a growing list of documents for the purpose of transparency and critical thinking, and have created transcriptions of audio to make these primary sources as accessible as possible.

Documents we have surfaced (available on our [Primary Sources](https://leavingthenetwork.org/network-churches/sources/) and [Sexual Abuse Allegations](https://leavingthenetwork.org/network-churches/sexual-abuse-allegations/sexual-allegations-overview/) pages):

* 12 pieces of audio with transcripts from lead pastors
* 17 examples of local church bylaws and membership forms and the bylaws for the Network Leadership Team
* Many training materials and other documents which explain how Network leaders identify, teach, and treat future leaders and non-leaders
* [First-person interviews and newspaper articles](https://leavingthenetwork.org/network-history/who-is-steve-morgan/) documenting Steve Morgan’s rapid rise and subsequent firing as a religious leader before founding The Network
* [24 News Stories](https://leavingthenetwork.org/stories/news/) and other media

**Calls for transparency and action:**

Many continue to add their names to petitions urging Network leaders to take appropriate action to ensure the safety and well-being of all Network attenders, members, staff, and pastors.

* 19 former leaders signed the [Call to Action](https://leavingthenetwork.org/network-churches/call-to-action/)
* 742 people signed the [online petition](https://chng.it/P8W8RcDd) calling for an unbiased, unimpeded, external investigation

# Big News Items for 2024

* Some Network **churches announced they are leaving The Network** while others made their affiliations vague. There was extensive national [media coverage](https://leavingthenetwork.org/stories/news/) of these movements. In response to rising public scrutiny, many churches formerly affiliated with The Network concealed their ties, fractured into smaller sects, and scrubbed references to their affiliations from their websites. By December 2024, most churches had removed pages acknowledging their connection to the organization. While some issued brief statements claiming disaffiliation, they offered no detailed explanation and to date, no network affiliated church or pastor issued a detailed public statement, addressed the [Call for Action](https://leavingthenetwork.org/network-churches/call-to-action/), acknowledged any harm done, attempted to reconcile with former church members, or produced new by-laws or documents demonstrating disaffiliation. These changes are being [tracked](https://leavingthenetwork.org/network-churches/breakaway-groups/) by Leaving the Network. 
* A **protest** outside of Christland Church was held on October 12, 2024 to bring attention to abuse in Network churches. The protest was held during a joint church conference attended by members from Christland, Joshua, and Rock River Churches. There was extensive local [media coverage](https://leavingthenetwork.org/stories/news/) of the event. This event was livestreamed by FACC.
* **Media coverage increased** in 2024 as 10 local and national [news articles and podcasts](https://leavingthenetwork.org/stories/news/) were published about the Network. 
* **As of December 2024,** [**742 people signed the change.org petition**](https://www.change.org/p/church-network-leadership-should-submit-to-an-unbiased-unimpeded-external-investigation?recruiter=1251487962&recruited_by_id=79733990-855d-11ec-bab9-6bacaf1f28ba&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink&utm_campaign=petition_dashboard) calling on Network leadership to submit to an unbiased, unimpeded, external investigation. The [Call to Action](https://leavingthenetwork.org/network-churches/call-to-action/) originally signed by former Network leaders remains in effect. 
* **Seven websites** devoted to the Network have been published to date.
   * [LeavingTheNetwork.org](https://leavingthenetwork.org/) \- A site sharing victim stories of spiritual abuse, historical background about the Network, and primary source documents and teachings from The Network.

   * [Families Against Cults on Campus](https://www.youtube.com/@FamiliesAgainstCultsonCampus) \- A media site maintained by a group of family members affected by the Network. 

# Campus Advocacy

A group called [**Families Against Cults on Campus**](https://www.youtube.com/@FamiliesAgainstCultsonCampus) **(FACC)** formed in 2024 in an effort to advocate for families and former members negatively affected by Network churches. Since forming, FACC produced short informative videos and interviews for their YouTube, TikTok & Instagram channels. They also posted warnings about Network churches in social media sites for associated colleges and cities.

A Reflection on Rejection.,ForeverAlone,1ho39at,2024-12-28 05:43:05,3,0.62,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/1ho39at/a_reflection_on_rejection/,Overall-Heron9670,Vent,"Another post about the rejection of women—how predictable, you might think. But indulge me; this is my first time airing such thoughts in my 30 years of life.

Rejection is no stranger to me. I grew up in hardship, born to a poor family in a poor country. Life was unforgiving, but I chose to fight back. Over the years, I’ve poured myself into self-improvement. I pushed my body to its natural limits—muscle, endurance, street workouts, martial arts including MMA. My mind wasn’t left behind either; I grew, learned, and created.

I made my way to a developed country, became a multi-millionaire investor and entrepreneur, and I’m now finishing a PhD in a medical-scientific field. My journey turned me into a polymath and polyglot, expanding my skills, influence, and network. On paper, I could be the success story some dream of.

Yet, here I am. For the third time, I’ve fallen in love. For the third time, I’ve been rejected.

I’ve never harassed, never disrespected. I’ve given others the freedom I’ve always craved myself. Still, in moments like these, I can’t shake the feeling that I remain the loser I’ve always been—the boy too small, too stupid, too poor, too invisible.

Perhaps success can’t armour the heart.

I just needed to let it out. Have a good day and happy new year."

[PC][mid-2010s?] low-poly roguelike about descending a tower/maze,tipofmyjoystick,1hnoekx,2024-12-27 15:42:07,1,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmyjoystick/comments/1hnoekx/pcmid2010s_lowpoly_roguelike_about_descending_a/,Abeillonnaise,,"**Platform(s):** PC, with possible ports to Xbox/PlayStation

**Genre:** roguelike or rogue-lite. The world design was procedurally generated after each death, and weapons (melee-only, I think) had to be gathered from the world each time.

**Estimated year of release:** 2010s. Tentative estimate: ~2015.

**Graphics/art style:** Low-poly, 3D. Camera was either fixed at isometric top-down or could freely swivel around the player character. Color palette was dark/navy blues, some small amount of lighter blue-grey, and mid-to-bright red. See “the Atlas” from No Man’s Sky for a close proxy to the general style.

**Notable characters:** Player character was humanoid. Enemies were humanoid minotaur-like creatures.

**Notable gameplay mechanics:** The goal of the game was to fully descend a central cavern through a network or maze of platform-based pathways. Dying resets all progress (except maybe cosmetics) and generates a new layout for the world. Combat with enemies along the way was very melee-oriented. I don’t think there any ranged options. Melee combat varied with weapon types - I think there were at least swords, knives, and axes.

**Other details:** I never played the game myself, just saw teasers/trailers while it was in development. It got bad reviews on release (30-50% positive on Metacritic, maybe). **I think the title was one word, like “Abyss” or “Labyrinth.”**"
Juggling a part-time job while watching my poly classmates cruise through life [Long Post],SGExams,1hnbqxp,2024-12-27 05:01:10,732,0.98,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1hnbqxp/juggling_a_parttime_job_while_watching_my_poly/,Confident_Glass_1413,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:,"I'm typing this during my break at the bubble tea shop where I work, trying not to let my tears fall into someone's brown sugar milk tea. Fun times.

You know that feeling when you're scrolling through Instagram and see your classmates hanging out at some aesthetic café, while you're behind a counter making drinks for people who can't even be bothered to look up from their phones? Yeah, that's my life four days a week.

I'm a second-year Poly student, and honestly? I'm drowning. Not in the dramatic ""I'm failing everything"" way, but in that slow, silent way where you're just barely keeping your head above water. My parents aren't poor, but we're not rich either.

A few weeks ago, my project mate asked why I couldn't join a group meeting at 4pm. How do you tell someone that you need to rush to your part-time job because your pay helps with the family bills? I just mumbled something about ""prior commitments"" and watched their eyes roll. Cool, cool, cool.

The thing that really gets me? These same classmates who can afford to spend $8 on coffee daily sometimes complain about how ""broke"" they are. Meanwhile, I'm here calculating if I can afford to eat something other than the $3 cai png for lunch.

Don't get me wrong – I'm not ashamed of working. The shame comes from feeling like I'm always playing catch-up. While others are joining CCAs, building their portfolios, and networking, I'm dealing with entitled customers who insist their drink isn't sweet enough (trust me, Karen, it is).

My grades are... okay. Not great, not terrible. Just okay. And in Singapore, we all know ""okay"" isn't enough. But how do you maintain a GPA above 3.5 when you're working 20 hours a week? My lecturer once said, ""Your studies should be your priority."" I wanted to laugh. Must be nice to live in a world where that's the only priority you need to worry about.

The worst part is seeing my mom's face when I come home late from work, still needing to start on assignments. She tells me to quit, that we'll manage somehow. But I've seen her calculating bills at the kitchen table at 2am. I've noticed how she buys cheaper brands now. Working isn't really a choice when you can help ease that burden, right?

Sometimes during my break, I'll spot poly kids from other schools coming in, laughing, spending money like it's nothing. They're probably heading out for meals, or meeting project groups, or doing whatever it is people do when they don't have to worry about making ends meet.

I know this sounds like a pity party. Maybe it is. But you try maintaining a positive attitude when you're constantly toggling between school and your work schedule, trying to figure out how to be in two places at once.

The funny thing is, some of my regular customers are actually nicer than my classmates. There's this uncle who always tells me ""jiayou"" when he sees me studying during quiet periods. He gets it. Maybe because his kid is in the same boat.

I guess what I'm trying to say is... Singapore's whole ""meritocracy"" thing hits different when you're watching others sprint while you're trying to run with weights on. Everyone talks about how ""every student has equal opportunities,"" but that's BS when some of us are trying to balance work, family obligations, and studies while others only need to focus on their GPA.

If you're in the same situation, I see you. If you're not, maybe next time don't judge the classmate who seems ""anti-social"" or ""not committed enough."" They might just be fighting battles you can't see.

Back to work now. These bubble teas aren't going to make themselves, and neither is my diploma."

Creatine as the Catalyst for Universal Domination: A Biochemical Blueprint for Humanity’s Ascension to a Type I Civilization and Beyond,Creatine,1hmtme4,2024-12-26 12:47:11,3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creatine/comments/1hmtme4/creatine_as_the_catalyst_for_universal_domination/,thememebearer,,"# Abstract

This thesis posits that the universal supplementation of creatine—a compound integral to energy metabolism—has the potential to transform humanity into an optimized collective organism capable of transcending terrestrial limitations, achieving Type I civilization status on the Kardashev Scale, and ultimately initiating interstellar conquest. Creatine, by enhancing physical and cognitive capacities, could function as the biochemical cornerstone for a new era of human evolution, fostering unparalleled synergy between biology, technology, and social cohesion.

# I. Introduction

Humanity teeters on the precipice of greatness. Despite our advances in technology, governance, and energy harnessing, we remain shackled by biological limitations. Enter creatine: a humble nitrogenous organic acid that, when distributed ubiquitously, could unify the biochemical foundation of our species. This paper explores how creatine can enhance human potential across three axes—physical capability, cognitive acuity, and social cohesion—thereby catalyzing our ascension to galactic dominance.

# II. Creatine and Physical Optimization: Building the Warrior Civilization

Creatine has long been heralded as the champion of athletic performance, boosting ATP synthesis, strength, and recovery. Imagine a world where all humans operate at peak physical efficiency:

1. **Elimination of Fatigue:** Universal creatine use would reduce fatigue across physical labor and military operations, enabling sustained productivity and resilience.

2. **Enhanced Health Span:** Creatine’s neuroprotective and muscular benefits would lead to longer, healthier lives, creating an unprecedented pool of able-bodied individuals ready to work, innovate, and defend our species.

3. **Universal Fitness Standardization:** The global normalization of physical fitness would reduce healthcare burdens, free economic resources, and produce a society that thrives on shared physical vigor.

Through these transformations, humanity would evolve into a civilization of superhumans capable of building the infrastructures necessary for interstellar expansion.

# III. Cognitive Revolution: The Creatine-Enhanced Brain

Beyond muscles, creatine fuels the mitochondria of the brain, enhancing memory, focus, and decision-making. Universal supplementation would initiate a cognitive revolution:

1. **Global IQ Surge:** Studies show creatine supplementation improves problem-solving abilities. A universally sharper intellect would unlock rapid technological breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and space travel.

2. **Collective Innovation:** The reduction of mental fatigue would lead to a renaissance in creativity, science, and philosophy, fostering a generation of polymaths.

3. **Strategic Mastery:** The strategic advantages of enhanced cognition would revolutionize diplomacy, warfare, and resource allocation, allowing humanity to outmaneuver competing species and environmental challenges.

With brains that outpace current capacities, humanity would break free from the traps of tribalism and inefficiency, achieving the harmony needed for galactic ambition.

# IV. Societal Cohesion: A Unified Human Tribe

Creatine would not only optimize individuals but also fortify the social fabric of humanity:

1. **Equal Access to Power:** The democratization of physical and mental enhancements would reduce inequality, fostering a sense of shared purpose.

2. **Global Energy Unity:** As creatine amplifies energy on a cellular level, it metaphorically mirrors the energy unification humanity would achieve through collective ambition, laying the groundwork for becoming a Type I civilization.

3. **Reduced Conflict:** With enhanced brain function and physical capacity, irrational behaviors rooted in fear or scarcity would wane, replaced by calculated, cooperative problem-solving.

A humanity united by shared biochemical enhancement would march in lockstep toward the conquest of the cosmos.

# V. Creatine and the Kardashev Scale: From Type I to Galactic Empire

A creatine-optimized humanity would rapidly harness the full energy of Earth (Type I) before ascending to Type II (stellar domination) and Type III (galactic control):

1. **Type I Civilization:** Enhanced cognition would expedite the transition to sustainable energy solutions, while optimized physicality would revolutionize infrastructure development.

2. **Type II Civilization:** Unified intellectual prowess would crack the mysteries of Dyson Sphere construction, allowing humanity to extract energy from entire star systems.

3. **Type III Civilization:** By leveraging enhanced biological and artificial intelligence, humanity would establish a pan-galactic network of colonized systems.

Creatine’s role as the biochemical Rosetta Stone for this ascension cannot be understated.

# VI. Ethical Considerations and Implementation

A global creatine mandate would require careful ethical considerations, from equitable distribution to ecological impact. **However, the cost of inaction—a humanity forever tethered to mediocrity—is far greater.**

# VII. Conclusion: The Creatine Imperative

In the annals of history, humanity’s ascent to universal conquest will be marked by pivotal moments of transformation. The adoption of creatine as a universal supplement represents such a moment. By amplifying our physical, cognitive, and societal potential, creatine could be the biochemical lever that propels humanity into its rightful place as rulers of the cosmos.

**In the words of Carl Sagan, “The cosmos is within us.” With creatine, the cosmos will also be within our grasp.**"

"Homeowner burying fiber, trench or plow",FiberOptics,1hlth1z,2024-12-24 23:14:01,4,0.84,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/FiberOptics/comments/1hlth1z/homeowner_burying_fiber_trench_or_plow/,thecannarella,Help wanted!,"I helped a friend out several years ago building a weatherproof remote cable modem box up at the street to hand off internet, then ran fiber 600’ to the house using media converters on each end. We used some flat drop I got from a coworker who came out and spliced it for me. On that install my friend was responsible for trenching in the fiber at a later date. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/o4t3oe/remote_cable_modem_install_when_you_are_too_far/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) is a link to that post.



Now I have another friend buying a house that sits 1500’ off the road that currently has DSL, but wants cable internet. I am taking the same approach with this one but will help him install the fiber. 



I found some 4 strand SM flat drop on FB that will make the distance. The area to install is along a gravel road in the woods. 



First, would it be best to rent a trencher or vibratory plow to get this installed? The plow seems like it would be the best option since you can snake the fiber into it and then turn and burn up the edge of the driveway after existing utilities are marked. Using the chain trencher seems like it would take longer and create more of a mess. Filling back a 1500’ trench doesn’t sound fun, even with a tractor. 



Second, would it be better to install some micro duct to pull the fiver through or just directly bury it. The fiber is direct bury rated. In lieu of micro duct would just some poly irrigation line work? Location is GA, so no real frost line."

It's been a minute since my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/14s6hae/im_in_love_with_my_poly_best_friend_and_i_dont/) indeed. Goodness gracious, I really do apologize as I did not mean to leave high and dry. Those who took the time to comment on that post, I really do thank you as it was those messages, as hard as they were to swallow, that helped me take a step back and reevaluate some things. It's been a wild year and a half, I've gone through several character arcs, including the chapter where I had no access to mental health aid whatsoever and likely should have been hospitalized at the time. That was really fun! That's a sob story for another day though, as before the holidays go into full swing for me, I wanted to drop an update. Randomly, I will be honest, I kinda forgot about this until getting back on my account and remembering this whole situation. I figured as a gift to this community, I'll recount my bittersweet tale and answer questions I left unanswered for the whole no one who asked or cared. Sorry, you’re getting my whole shebang, might as well make it entertaining\~!

**- Replies -**

To dkf295, Your comment really helped me step back and think about how I thought about Polyamory. I wont lie, the way I was going about it was very very wrong, and it took me a second to really see why. Doing that would have been catastrophic for my mental health, in hindsight doubly so knowing what was coming for me. They are very Poly I assure though, I did field questions before posting.  
You were right on the money, this was a case of me being enamored by one particular person, but that's more due to me being Demi more than anything to be quite frank. I am a very open love oriented person, I want to love freely, and I want any partners I have to love freely, without major weights keeping them bound. I don't want to be the reason someone is unhappy with their one and only life, and I would hope the other would feel the same for me. Whether or not I'd date anyone else is determined if I even get feelings for anyone else, as they are Really hard to come by for me. Not against it in the slightest though.

To emeraldead, your comment kinda stung when I first read it I will not deny, but that doesn't mean I'm not appreciative of it. Asking the harder questions is important especially when it comes to something as world shaping as entering *any* relationship, let alone poly. I feel your take on confessions is a bit harsh, I think it really depends on the tact, message, and moment of doing so. Overall though, you were right, as that was likely not the way to approach that. Especially with your additional addendum after that about just because I'm hopelessly in love, doesn't mean I am hopeless to owning my own actions.  
To answer your questions individually,

1. To be honest, I don't know. I don't think I will know until I try this out for myself with concrete experience. It is something I should keep in mind going forwards though, and absolutely not testing it on a whim like that.
2. At the time, no. I had some support, but I was rather... ill prepared for whatever that could have brought I'll be completely honest. Now though, I'm much more confident in saying I have a fairly secure support network separate from that. Even though anything with them is likely now off the table. A good lesson to take in though.
3. For breakups... I don't know either. I've been in but a handful of relationships in my life, with only one of them lasting longer than a month. Even then, it was a mutual breakup due to my partner realizing they were ace. I also wont deny that when it comes to managing time, I’m a bit rough around the edges. I struggle to even fit in family and hobbies into my already intense schedule. Even then though, yeah, I like to believe even with my poor management skills, I am able to balance things very well between a number of people. ADHD makes it a biiiit hard at time, out of sight out of mind type stuff, lmfao. But in the end, I wont know until I try.
4. I’ll be honest, the more to fill my mundane life, the better. The more useful I feel to both myself and the people around me, the more I get a positive outlook. Not to insinuate my self worth is directly equated to my usefulness to those around me, but honestly doing things with people, and being around people in general just fill me with life. Ambivert and whatnot, I want it to be on my own terms. Obviously Emergencies are different, which in any emergency, I do my best to make sure the directly afflicted are accommodated to the best my ability. I could ramble on and on about this but like… yeah! I’ve thought about this stuff extensively, especially after posting my original post and while it was hard, I’m confident in saying that I am very much interested in Polyamory for myself. I want to do it, the problem is finding people to work with that isn’t just hookups. Pain.

To Henri\_luvs\_brunch, No major comment, I answered that in the ramble above. I just want to acknowledge you as your comment was another that stuck in my mind.

To BiggsHoson2020, when I first read your comment, I got defensive. Whenever someone has said that to me in the past it’s always been associated with negative connotation. I then started reflecting on myself and thinking, and you’re right. I was absolutely going about this the entirely wrong way. I was not mentally prepared for it, I barely did my homework, and I didn’t properly think things through. As per typical young people things, I was not immune to the pitfalls of my own mind and soul. I was so focused on potentially being able to be with the person I adored for over a decade, someone I held Insanely close to my heart, and I failed to realize that… I was Not ready for that in the slightest. Between this, my own issues at home, and beyond.

I have given many a thought about this over the year and a half since my last post. On paper, two years older than I was when I wrote it. Where it was the height of everything. Insecurity, paranoia, dread, and all of the above, barely understanding what nightmare web of deep personal issues I was. Now I am standing from a perspective of while Not knowing everything, far from it I’m very young and I have a lot to learn overall; definitely a more matured place than I was back then. I recognize the things I did wrong and what I need to learn from. The big thing that really resonated within me from your comment though was “Polyamorous relationships look different from a monogamous relationship. You should never settle for a polyamorous secondary relationship with somebody you want as a monogamous partner.” It isn’t so much that I wanted strictly a monogamous relationship with them. I’ve known for years they were very open in that sense and that was something I growing with them was whole heartedly supportive and accepting of. I would not be upset in the slightest about my partners going and spending time with their partners, I again am a very open love oriented person. At the end of the day, I only wanted them to be happy! I just… wished that picture of them happy had me in it, yanno? I wanted to be there for them through whatever came their way, I wanted to see them grow from the trauma holes both of us came from. In the end though, somethings are probably best left unsaid.

**- Update -**

Onto the update then, I am both happy and sad to say that I never even got the chance to ask. I didn’t want to anymore, nor would it have been appropriate, nor safe for anyone. After that post, I was informed they were leaving. Not just, leaving city, leaving the whole state entirely. Across country. That halted me in my tracks, and not blaming them for anything, it did not play well with my growing issue of no medications. I made mistakes in the end, I put distance, I kept myself away because I felt unstable and self destructive. The last time we had saw one another in person, I got all the vibes they were Not engaged and just all in all. I think the friendship was already on its way out, in hindsight. In deluded fashion, of course as usual with me, I tried holding hope there was still at the very least Some of that close friendship left there to adhesive anything together, and of course there Was they still very clearly do still think of me as a friend. But in the end, between that era of distance before and after, the many many mistakes I made leading up to this, and the unceremonious way they left. Leaving without even letting me get there to say goodbye at all, and believe me I tried so hard… In the end, they left. Of course I’m bitter about it just a touch, but also I recognize that one, they just had nothing here at all. Family hated them, no nearby friends bar like.. me and a handful of work ones if even. Two, the depths of the trauma run deep. Wont get into it, but there’s a reason I think ultimately this move as much as I hated the idea was Much better than anything I could think of for them. Three, people come in and out of lives all the time, a fact I’ve had burned into my mind since I was 6. No one is there forever, the path and flow of life just… don’t work like that. People come together, form very strong bonds, but with each passing wave, eventually things drift and float. That doesn’t erase the strong bonds that kept us together, the feelings there, the memories. But in the end, they had their own life to live and I wouldn’t in good conscious stop them from following their heart. Melodramatic, perhaps; but I again just want them to be happy with the life they’re given. From the sounds of things, it does seem like that is the case too, for the most part!

After they left, I threw myself all in on therapy, and while I am still working on myself extensively, I have a lot of things to go through if this isn’t already apparent. I’m far far from ready to throw myself in any relationships, I couldn’t do that with anyone. I’ve started to come to realize that even if I had grown the gall to do something, it likely would have ended poorly. I have come to realize that even though I tried so hard, learned what I could, genuinely found a real interest in Polyamory, yeah we just weren’t compatible I think at all. Trauma bonds are just not solid enough foundation, and by the time we reconnected, we were both Very different people.

**- Conclusion -**

I did some soul searching, I still have so much more to do, many things about myself that I need to work on and figure out before even considering allowing anyone into my wall and see what I am like in here when even I don’t know what its like in there sometimes. In the end, despite the regrets, the mistakes, the pain, and sadness. I’m just happy that not only I had such a good friend who helped me get through the worst periods of my life, but I am happy they finally found a place they feel at home. Thanks for the memories!

I am leaving out a bit, like how I kept telling myself the ache would get better after they left, and it did. For the most part. How I felt that even if I did have that energy to even just get my feelings off my chest, I didn’t want to be seen as the person who was trying to get them to stay with a confession of love, \*that\* would have been Really immature of me I won’t deny, especially given the circumstances. I also neglect to say just how deeply chaotic my mindspace was during that time. All in all though, despite how many hangups I have about the situation, I still have a friend there even if we barely talk anymore. I still have the memories untainted by a streak of pain that would have definitely schismed the hell out of our friendship had I acted on Any of this. And I have the peace of mind knowing that they’re doing better, and I am, slowly, piecing myself back together from the rest of the nightmare of my life that has been the last four years and far far beyond.

Happy Holidays to all of you! Not exactly the outcome I wanted at all in this, but it’s one I can safely say that was probably one of the better scenarios to come out, even if in the end I still lost someone super dear to my heart. I just hope they don’t see this if they do browse here (no clue if they do) and immediately know who I am based off of how I write, that would be. One hell of a way to find out my feelings. Sorry in advance if that is the case, genuinely wish you well. Either way, here’s my Christmas gift to this community who, even though I only posted a single post and have No idea who I am, helped me through something that could have ended in so so much heartbreak and sorrow. Hold those you have close and dear while the moment is still fresh, time is fleeting and the world is scary. Who knows what will happen down the line, but even then… Happy wishes and Thank you. All of you. Especially the commenters who’s words, while hard to hear, were exactly what I feel I needed to hear. Not looking for advice, or commendations. I don’t think my actions were honorful or great. I made a lot of dumb decisions and handled everything as poorly as I usually do. I just wanted to get this all off my chest in a way that in my own mind feels at least a little cathartic. I should stop writing before I turn into a broken record heh.

Thank you for listening to my words! There really was no reason for this other than I could. I Love to write and make noise. :)

Adios\~!

Understanding Program Scheduling Power: A Network Analysis,CollegeBasketball,1hkxukt,2024-12-23 16:26:40,3,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/1hkxukt/understanding_program_scheduling_power_a_network/,fu-depaul,,"#Understanding Program Scheduling Power: A Network Analysis

This analysis examines which collegiate programs have the greatest advantage in scheduling home games, using a novel network-based approach that measures both quantity and quality of home game scheduling.

##Methodology Overview

The analysis focuses on two key factors:

- A program's ability to secure home games
- The relative scarcity of their opponents' away games

##Key Considerations

- Performance outcomes and program talent levels were deliberately excluded
- Only regular season games were analyzed
- Neutral site games were omitted from the calculations

##How Programs Are Weighted

Programs receive higher scores when they:

- Successfully schedule home games against teams that rarely play away games
- Secure home games against programs that themselves attract selective away-game opponents

Conversely, programs receive lower scores when they:

- Schedule home games against teams that frequently play away games
- Host opponents who struggle to secure quality home games themselves

##Important Context

This methodology serves as a proxy for measuring a program's scheduling power. Teams that primarily play away games (often for financial guarantees) carry less weight in the analysis, as they represent more accessible scheduling opportunities. The real measure of scheduling strength comes from securing home games against programs that are selective about their away game commitments.

Poly Burnout - Not sure what is best for me,polyamory,1hksfks,2024-12-23 12:14:59,17,0.9,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1hksfks/poly_burnout_not_sure_what_is_best_for_me/,Independent_Cat3445,Musings,"Throwaway account just in case. I’ve been poly for a decade with two long term relationships, starting two years apart. I live with the longer term partner and try to split my time as evenly as possible. I love them both immensely but a culmination of factors have lead me to a place where I’m not sure I can do it anymore. It might very well have wrecked me mentally and financially. It’s parallel poly btw. They don’t talk as they had massive falling out early on that never got repaired to my great disappointment.

One of the biggest drains has been neither of them has had another partner in this entire time. The longer partner is the one who identified as poly and I was up for giving it a go. She has dated over the years but barely over the last few years and it’s never gone past 2 or 3 dates, currently has a FWB but that’s every few months. She’s pretty much stopped trying. The other has had plenty of casual encounters with no interest in a second relationship. Leaving me in a position where I’m emotionally supporting two partners in isolation with from each other. 

One of the most appealing aspects of poly to me was having a polycule and that wonderful support network. Not just me but for my partners, I feel super guilty they can both be quite isolated otherwise. But I sometimes feel a bit upset and bothered by my partners lack of other relationships, particularly with the longer partner as she was the one who wanted to be poly. I have spoken to her about it a while ago and she just seems unmotivated to try. I don’t know if I should be bothered by this or not.

There’s also been a huge financial toll on me, for years I’ve been in gig economy work to give me flexibility and also it’s all my poor mental health allowed for. Most things are split easily that are paid for together with both partners. But there are points where I have had to put more into both due to each of their work situations over the years. Neither has put much effort into career advancement. Again, mainly my longer term partner who has stagnated. My other partner has had jobs often fall apart for reasons outside their control but on a few occasions left jobs because they weren’t perfect fits to my great frustration and despite my protests.
I often feel like I’m the only one who takes work seriously and understands the hard work needed to get through life but can’t reach my full potential because of stress of my relationship situation. Again looping back to my partners absence of other partners. If I ever couldn’t work for a while, neither of them has the capability to pick up the slack.

But then I feel like everyone is losing out financially because my resources are split so I can’t invest as heavily in either relationship. I end up feeling like both of them and me are missing out on more things in life because they’re with me and no other partners.

My other big problem is feeling like I’ve lost all identity outside of being a partner to them. I can find a bit of time for hobbies but very little energy for them. My friendship circle has diminished significantly, partly for reasons of just people getting olde rand have lives, but partly also I feel because I haven’t had time or energy for them. I have a couple of very good friends still but ultimately I feel pretty isolated other than my two relationships. I know I need to find what I really enjoy again but it feels overwhelming. As well because my partners only have a partner around half time I feel guilty about not spending g enough time with them. Even though both are very supportive of me doing other things.

It has been mentioned to be that I might have CPTSD from the triple stress of debt due to losing my job, arguments when my partners fell out and a parent unexpectedly dying all simultaneously a number of years ago. With it being said to me that the longer term partner was likely emotional abusive to me (something which I did successfully confront them about and they did work on a lot. But the temper reactions do sometimes appear to simmer under the surface in difficult situations).

But this range of trauma has left me now unable to process how I feel and properly speak to the longer partner about all this. The shorter term partner is aware of my questions surrounding being poly and is all okay with it. The longer term partner knows I’ve been having a mental health crisis and is very supportive of that. I am slightly concerned it might bring out her anger but I’m much more worried about upsetting her with how I’m feeling about how good being poly has been for me and that I’m not sure I can do it anymore.

Honestly I can often feel like I’m not even in poly relationships, but more like I’m living two entirely separate lives with half the time and half the energy dedicated to either. Then in turn my partners are only getting half a relationship because of their lack of other partners. I don’t want to lose either of them but sometimes wonder if it’s fairer on everyone if I just walk away from both. I simultaneously think I’m being selfish by staying with both of them but also I’m entirely ignoring my own needs. How would I even begin to choose between them if it came down it?

I’m mainly venting here. I’m coming round to the idea that I need time away from both partners to figure out what I want in life on my own but that’s a real tough thing to manage from a money and living stand point.

Also just want to clarify that both relationships are pretty good for the most part, but there are still problems. Just lately I have been feeling very distant from them both and all of the above is having an effect.

(I am seeking therapy currently btw)"
3rd year with no internship/co-op experience. How cooked am I?,UBC,1hkovj0,2024-12-23 09:28:47,41,0.94,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/1hkovj0/3rd_year_with_no_internshipcoop_experience_how/,ikusearch0613,,"Hello, Poli Sci student here. Its kinda ironic how poli major is supposed to be the most talkative and networked people. I suck so hard at networking and at this rate, Im not gonna find a job despite talking to thousands of recruiters or profs. Im stepping to the world without beforehand trained experience aside from 3 years of retails job and still cant move on. Jobs were applied and interviewed, failed every single one of them. I know this is a me problem and I am still trying to work on being a better person at my job, but I cant help feeling completely useless seeing others achieving so many amazing things in their life with their efforts. Living is so exhausting isnt it?"
