5 coins I would recommend buying right now (with explanations),WallStreetBetsCrypto,1i54bub,2025-01-19 12:52:45,26,0.77,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBetsCrypto/comments/1i54bub/5_coins_i_would_recommend_buying_right_now_with/,InnerAbrocoma9880,DD,"I'm a day trader with a \~$300K portfolio and here's what I bought yesterday in preparation for the next (hopefully) bull run:

* **Sperax ($SPA)**: massively undervalued since its last pump where it was sitting comfortably at the $0.02 range. It's currently just at $0.014 which I'm confident is the bottom. The ATH of this coin was $0.24, so big potential.
* **Tezos ($XTZ)**: has likely hit the bottom at around $1.30. This coin has reached $10 on previous bull runs. Also on Coinbase, there is up to 7% staking with only a 2-day unstaking time, which is actually really good.
* **Ribbon Finance ($RBN)**: also undervalued. Currently at $0.34, but primed to lock back into the $0.40 - 0.50 range. In the 2024 bull run, it reached $1.80.
* **Pangolin ($PNG)**: undervalued at $0.29. This coin can pump to the $0.70 - 0.80 range on bull runs.
* **Kyber Network ($KNC)**: I've been tracking this coin for years. It tends to dart between the $0.50 and $1 range quite often, so is perfect for trading. But it also reached an instance ATH of $6 a few years ago.

Obviously I'm not a financial adviser, but hopefully these tips are at least useful food for thought. Good luck!"

Effective Ways to Earn Bitcoin and Crypto in 2025,HowEarnMoneyOnline,1huwyti,2025-01-06 06:30:15,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowEarnMoneyOnline/comments/1huwyti/effective_ways_to_earn_bitcoin_and_crypto_in_2025/,sistyko,,"**Earning cryptocurrency online** can be an attractive prospect, but keep in mind that Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and can be risky. Before use any platform to **earn Bitcoin or crypto online**, it's crucial to thoroughly research the project or platform, understand the associated risks, and consider the legal and tax implications in your country. Beware of scams and fraudulent schemes that promise guaranteed returns or require significant upfront investments. **Always use secure wallets and exchanges** and consider consulting a financial advisor if you're new to cryptocurrency investing.

With these tips in mind, here are some **legitimate and effective ways to potentially earn cryptocurrency online**:

**Mining**: Cryptocurrency mining involves using specialized hardware to solve complex mathematical problems, which helps secure the network and earns you rewards in the form of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin and Ethereum are popular choices for mining, but the cost of hardware and electricity should be considered.

**Crypto Faucets**: Some websites offer a combination of faucets, surveys, and other tasks to earn cryptocurrencies. Faucets give away small amounts of cryptocurrency for free, or by completing simple tasks or captcha. Examples include [**FreeBitcoin**](https://www.moneyonline.wiki/2023/03/freebitcoin-review-guide-payments.html) and [**Cointiply**](https://www.moneyonline.wiki/2023/01/cointiply-gpt-and-bitcoin-faucet.html).

**Airdrops**: Some cryptocurrency projects distribute free tokens (airdrops) to holders of a particular cryptocurrency. To participate, you often need to meet specific criteria or hold a certain amount of the relevant cryptocurrency.

[**Paid Survey Sites**](https://www.moneyonline.wiki/p/paid-online-surveys-websites.html): Some websites offer paid surveys in exchange for cryptocurrency rewards. Users can sign up, complete surveys, and earn cryptocurrency. Some popular options include [**Offer Nation**](https://www.moneyonline.wiki/2023/04/offer-nation-review-guide-payments.html)**,** [**Get-Paid**](https://www.moneyonline.wiki/2022/02/get-paid-review-guide-tutorial.html) and [**GrabPoints**](https://www.moneyonline.wiki/2023/08/grabpoints-review-guide-payments.html)

**Staking**: Many cryptocurrencies use a proof-of-stake (PoS) or delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism. By holding and ""staking"" these cryptocurrencies in a wallet, you can earn rewards in the form of more tokens. Examples include Cardano (ADA) and Tezos (XTZ).

**Lending and DeFi**: Some platforms allow you to lend your cryptocurrencies to others and earn interest in return. Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms offer various opportunities to earn interest, yield farming, and liquidity provision, but they also come with significant risks.

[**Get Paid To (GPT) Sites**](https://www.moneyonline.wiki/p/ptc-and-gpt-websites.html)**:** GPT websites offer a variety of tasks that users can complete for rewards, including cryptocurrencies. Some tasks may include watching videos, clicking on ads, completing offers, and more. Examples of GPT sites that offer cryptocurrency rewards include [**Freecash**](https://www.moneyonline.wiki/2022/01/freecash-review-guide-tutorial.html)**,** [**Rewarding Ways**](https://www.moneyonline.wiki/2023/05/rewarding-ways-review-guide-and-payments.html) and [**Get Paid To**](https://www.moneyonline.wiki/2022/12/getpaidto-review-payments.html)

**Trading**: Cryptocurrency trading involves buying and selling cryptocurrencies on exchanges to profit from price fluctuations. This can be highly profitable, but it's also risky, and many traders end up losing money.

**Bounty Programs**: Many blockchain projects offer bounty programs where you can earn tokens by completing tasks like bug reporting, marketing, or development work.

**Avalanche and Yield Farms**: Yield farming involves providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and earning fees or rewards. Platforms like Avalanche and its native token, AVAX, offer yield farming opportunities.

[**Affiliate Marketing**](https://www.moneyonline.wiki/p/affiliate-marketing.html): Promote cryptocurrency products or services through affiliate programs and earn commissions on referrals.

**Participating in ICOs/IEOs**: Participating in initial coin offerings (ICOs) or initial exchange offerings (IEOs) can allow you to purchase tokens at an early stage, potentially at a lower price, with the hope of their value increasing.

When using these sites to earn cryptocurrencies online, it's essential to be cautious and do your due diligence. Look for user reviews and payment proofs to ensure the platform is legitimate. Also, keep in mind that sometimes the earnings from some of these platforms are generally modest and may not provide substantial income.

Furthermore, consider the privacy and security implications of sharing personal information on these sites, as some may require personal data for survey targeting. **Always use secure cryptocurrency wallets to receive and store your earnings**, and be aware of any fees associated with withdrawing your cryptocurrency rewards.

Understanding Staking in Crypto,BuildOnWYZth,1hplvhi,2024-12-30 07:07:10,3,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildOnWYZth/comments/1hplvhi/understanding_staking_in_crypto/,WYZthChain,,"Staking is one of the most popular ways to earn rewards in the crypto world while supporting blockchain networks. If you‚Äôre curious about how it works and why it‚Äôs important, this guide will break it down step by step.

# 1. What Is Staking?

Staking is the process of locking up your cryptocurrency to help maintain and secure a blockchain network. In return, you earn rewards, typically in the form of more cryptocurrency.

Think of it like planting a tree:

* You plant a seed (your crypto).
* The tree grows and strengthens the ecosystem (the blockchain).
* Over time, the tree gives you fruits (rewards).

Staking is used in blockchains that rely on Proof of Stake (PoS) or similar systems to confirm transactions and create new blocks.

# 2. How Does Staking Work?

Here‚Äôs how it works in simple terms:

1. Lock Your Crypto: You commit some of your cryptocurrency as a ‚Äústake.‚Äù
2. Help the Network: Your stake is used to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain.
3. Earn Rewards: For your help, the blockchain rewards you with additional cryptocurrency.

# 3. Why Do Blockchains Need Staking?

Staking replaces the older system called Proof of Work (PoW) (used by Bitcoin) that requires powerful computers to solve math problems. Instead of using lots of electricity, Proof of Stake networks rely on staked cryptocurrency to achieve the same goal:

* Verifying transactions.
* Adding new blocks to the chain.
* Keeping the network secure.

Staking is more energy-efficient and faster than mining, making it a better option for modern blockchains.

# 4. What Can You Stake?

Not all cryptocurrencies support staking. Popular ones that do include:

* Ethereum (ETH)
* Cardano (ADA)
* Solana (SOL)
* Polkadot (DOT)
* Tezos (XTZ)
* Wyzth (WYZ)

Each blockchain has its own rules for staking, like how much you need to stake and how rewards are calculated.

# 5. How to Start Staking

Getting started with staking is straightforward:

1. Choose a Blockchain: Pick a cryptocurrency that supports staking.
2. Set Up a Wallet: Use a wallet that allows you to stake your crypto. Some wallets come with built-in staking options.
3. Select a Validator or Platform: On some networks, you can stake directly. On others, you might delegate your stake to a validator or use a platform like Binance, Coinbase, or WyScale.
4. Lock Your Crypto: Decide how much you want to stake and lock it up for a specific period.
5. Earn Rewards: Sit back and watch your rewards grow over time!

# 6. What Are the Benefits of Staking?

* Passive Income: Staking lets you earn more cryptocurrency without trading.
* Supports the Network: By staking, you‚Äôre helping the blockchain remain secure and decentralized.
* Environmentally Friendly: Unlike mining, staking uses minimal energy.
* Increased Community Engagement: Stakers often get a say in blockchain decisions through voting rights.

# 7. What Are the Risks?

While staking has many advantages, it‚Äôs not without risks:

* Lock-Up Periods: Some blockchains require you to lock your crypto for weeks or months. You can‚Äôt withdraw it until the period ends.
* Market Volatility: The value of your staked cryptocurrency can go down, affecting the overall value of your rewards.
* Validator Risks: If you delegate your stake to a validator, their mistakes (like going offline) could reduce your rewards or even cost you part of your stake (called ‚Äúslashing‚Äù).
* Liquidity Issues: During the lock-up period, your staked funds aren‚Äôt liquid and can‚Äôt be used elsewhere.

# 8. Staking Rewards: How Much Can You Earn?

The rewards you earn from staking depend on:

* The Blockchain: Different blockchains offer different reward rates.
* Your Stake: The more you stake, the higher your potential rewards.
* Network Activity: Rewards can vary based on how many people are staking and the total activity on the blockchain.

For example:

* Ethereum offers annual returns of around 5-7%.
* Cardano rewards range between 4-6%.
* Solana can provide 6-8% returns.
* WyScale offers competitive and flexible staking solutions, tailored for beginners and advanced users alike.

# 9. Staking Platforms

If you don‚Äôt want to handle staking directly, you can use platforms that make it easier:

* Centralized Exchanges: Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken offer staking as a service.
* DeFi Platforms: Use decentralized platforms like Lido, Rocket Pool, or WyScale for staking.

These platforms often handle the technical details for you, but they might take a small fee from your rewards.

Staking is an exciting way to earn passive income and support blockchain technology at the same time. Whether you‚Äôre a beginner or an experienced crypto enthusiast, staking offers opportunities to grow your holdings and contribute to a more secure and decentralized future"

Tezos: A Pioneering Blockchain for Smart Contracts and Governance,CryptoForexSyndicate,1hm12ka,2024-12-25 08:50:30,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoForexSyndicate/comments/1hm12ka/tezos_a_pioneering_blockchain_for_smart_contracts/,Axiik,,"Tezos is a unique blockchain platform designed for creating decentralized applications (dApps) and executing smart contracts. Launched in 2018 after a record-breaking Initial Coin Offering (ICO) that raised over $230 million, Tezos distinguishes itself with its innovative approach to governance and its ability to evolve without the need for hard forks.

**What is Tezos?**

Tezos is a decentralized blockchain that aims to provide a secure and scalable platform for deploying smart contracts and building dApps. It‚Äôs an open-source project that emphasizes on-chain governance, allowing stakeholders to vote on proposed protocol changes directly.

Unlike many other blockchain networks that require hard forks to implement significant updates, Tezos uses a self-amending ledger to evolve. This feature ensures network continuity, reduces conflicts, and fosters long-term stability.

**How Tezos Works**

The native cryptocurrency of the Tezos platform is XTZ (commonly referred to as ""tez"" or ""tezzies""). Tezos uses a unique Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism called Liquid Proof-of-Stake (LPoS), which allows token holders to participate in network validation, governance, and decision-making.

**Key Concepts of Tezos**

1. Liquid Proof-of-Stake (LPoS)Tezos allows token holders to delegate their staking rights to validators (known as ""bakers"") without transferring ownership of their tokens. This system ensures broad participation and inclusivity in the validation process.
2. On-Chain GovernanceStakeholders can propose, discuss, and vote on protocol upgrades directly on the blockchain. This democratic process eliminates the need for contentious hard forks and promotes adaptability.
3. Smart Contracts and dAppsTezos supports smart contracts and decentralized applications using Michelson, a custom language designed for formal verification. This feature ensures a high level of security for contracts handling sensitive or high-value transactions.

**Advantages of Tezos**

1. Self-AmendmentTezos can upgrade itself through on-chain governance, allowing it to evolve and improve over time without network disruption.
2. Energy EfficiencyThe LPoS consensus mechanism is far less energy-intensive than traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems, making Tezos an environmentally friendly blockchain.
3. Security and ReliabilityThe use of formal verification in its smart contract language ensures robust and error-resistant applications.
4. Active CommunityTezos boasts a vibrant and engaged global community of developers, bakers, and users who contribute to its growth and development.

**Real-World Applications**

Tezos is used in a variety of industries, showcasing its versatility:

\- Tokenization of Assets

From real estate to art, Tezos is employed for securely tokenizing and trading physical and digital assets.

\- Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

Tezos powers DeFi projects that provide financial services like lending, borrowing, and yield farming without intermediaries.

\- NFTs

The platform is increasingly popular for creating and trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs), owing to its low fees and energy efficiency.

\- Corporate Adoption

Companies like Ubisoft and Societe Generale have explored Tezos for applications ranging from gaming to financial services.

**Challenges for Tezos**

Despite its innovative features, Tezos faces competition from other smart contract platforms like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. Additionally, its unique programming language, Michelson, presents a steeper learning curve for developers accustomed to more widely used languages.

**Tezos and TradingView**

For investors and traders interested in XTZ, platforms like TradingView ([for Free Premium version here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingViewFree/comments/1hobjs6/tradingview_premium_ultimate_package_update/)) provide advanced tools to track market performance and conduct technical analysis. TradingView‚Äôs customizable charts and indicators make it easier to monitor Tezos price trends, set alerts, and make informed trading decisions.

**The Future of Tezos**

Tezos continues to gain traction as a platform for secure and adaptable blockchain solutions. Its focus on governance, security, and sustainability positions it as a long-term contender in the blockchain space. With ongoing developments and a growing ecosystem, Tezos is poised to remain a significant player in the world of decentralized technology.

Whether you're a developer looking for a secure platform for your dApps, an investor interested in a sustainable blockchain, or simply curious about the future of decentralized systems, Tezos is a project worth keeping an eye on."

"Tokenized Uranium Goes Live on the Tezos Blockchain with Archax, Cameco Involved",defi,1hkpzbg,2024-12-23 10:23:06,51,0.92,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/1hkpzbg/tokenized_uranium_goes_live_on_the_tezos/,MediocreUnit2203,:news: News,"tokenization process.
Nuclear energy is back in fashion, and a new blockchain-based marketplace aims to hop on the trend bringing investment access in the yellow ore to retail investors in a tokenized form.

London-based Tezos ecosystem development firm Trilitech launched Uranium.io on Tuesday to offer tokens backed by physical uranium oxide U3O8, also known as ""yellowcake.""The app was built on Etherlink, an EVM-compatible layer-2 network on top of Tezos (XTZ). The project recruited U.K.-regulated digital asset firm Archax as custodian for the underlying assets and creating the tokens. The physical metal is stored and maintained in a regulated depository at Cameco, one of the world's largest uranium producers.

Tokenized real-world assets is a rapidly growing corner of the crypto markets, with crypto firms and global financial institutions bringing traditional investments such as commodities to blockchain rails. They do so for cheaper transaction costs, faster settlements and to reach a broader investor audience. The digital tokens represent ownership of the underlying asset. For example, global bank HSBC introduced tokenized gold to retail investors in Hong Kong earlier this year.

Uranium is a crucial metal for energy production fueling nuclear power plants with rising demand. The market for uranium, however, is fragmented with trading concentrated on over-the-counter desks and retail traders' options to invest in the metal has been limited, Arthur Breitman, director of TriliTech and co-founder of the Tezos blockchain, told CoinDesk in an interview. Moving ownership representation to blockchain rails reduces frictions and makes it easier for average investors to participate, he added.

""This is particularly exciting as nuclear power is experiencing a revival,‚Äù Breitman said.

It's not the first effort to bring trading with the yellow ore onto blockchain rails, though. Last year, a project called Uranium3o8 launched a uranium-linked token on decentralized crypto exchange Uniswap backed by forward sales agreement with a mining company. However, the project decided to pivot from its original structure and removed liquidity from the trading pair a few months after launch upon feedback from uranium traders, a spokesperson told CoinDesk, underscoring the difficulties to create a tokenization structure that works.

To ensure that the token's value is anchored to the physical metal, Uranium.io accumulated some 1.6 million ounces of uranium oxide at Cameco, Breitman said. Meanwhile, commodity trading firm Curzon Uranium also provides access to primary markets for the ore."

Whether you choose to invest in XRP or explore its rivals, being well-informed will equip you for success in this fast-paced world of digital currencies.

The Future of Cryptocurrency: Emerging Technologies and Trends Beyond XRP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The cryptocurrency landscape is always evolving, and today we see various emerging technologies and trends that promise to shape the future of digital finance markedly. While XRP has made its mark, other cryptocurrencies are rising to the challenge, showing remarkable potential and innovation.

Check The Details Here: https://moneywave.myofferdeals.com  
  
One of the most exciting trends is the integration of **decentralized finance (DeFi)**. This technology aims to recreate traditional financial systems using blockchains. DeFi platforms allow users to borrow, lend, and earn interest on their assets without relying on banks. Some notable names in DeFi include:

- **Uniswap:** A popular decentralized exchange that enables users to trade cryptocurrencies without an intermediary.
- **Aave:** A platform that allows users to lend and borrow assets, earning interest in the process.
- **Compound:** This protocol allows users to earn interest on their crypto holdings through an automated lending and borrowing system.

These platforms offer an innovation that may outpace XRP's utility, especially for users seeking more autonomy over their assets. The growing interest in DeFi indicates a demand for systems that prioritize user agency and efficiency.

Check The Details Here: https://moneywave.myofferdeals.com  
  
Another notable area of growth is **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)**. These unique digital assets have taken the art and gaming worlds by storm, allowing creators to monetize their work directly. Beyond art, NFTs represent ownership of various assets, from music to real estate. Here‚Äôs how they may influence the future of cryptocurrency:

- **Tokenization of Real Assets:** Real estate, collectibles, and even intellectual property can be tokenized as NFTs, making it easier for investors to participate.
- **Community Engagement:** NFTs give fans ownership stakes in projects or art, fostering a sense of community and shared value.
- **Gaming Revolution:** Video games are embracing NFTs, allowing players to truly own and trade in-game assets.

As these technologies develop, they could create a ecosystem where user interaction takes precedence over traditional financial practices. XRP may not be at the helm of this journey, but it could benefit from the supportive infrastructures that these trends build.

Check The Details Here: https://moneywave.myofferdeals.com  
  
Next, we have the evolution of **layer-two solutions**. As the network congestion of major blockchains rises, the efficiency of transactions becomes more pressing. Layer-two solutions enhance the scalability of existing blockchain networks, allowing for faster and cheaper transactions. Examples include:

- **Polygon:** Aiming to improve Ethereum's scalability while ensuring low transaction costs.
- **Lightning Network:** A second-layer solution for Bitcoin, enabling faster transactions and reduced fees.

By improving transaction speeds and reducing costs, these solutions can offer users a more dynamic cryptocurrency experience. As these technologies mature, they challenge XRP's transaction capabilities while showing a clear pathway toward immediate problem-solving for users.

Check The Details Here: https://moneywave.myofferdeals.com  
  
The growing trend of **environmentally friendly cryptocurrencies** also seeds momentum in the market. With rising concerns about the energy consumption of Bitcoin mining, there's a noticeable shift towards coins that prioritize sustainability. Cryptocurrencies using proof-of-stake instead of proof-of-work reduce energy consumption significantly. Some environmentally friendly alternatives include:

- **Cardano (ADA):** Focused on sustainability through its unique proof-of-stake model.
- **Tezos (XTZ):** Offers a self-amending blockchain, ensuring low energy use.

With increasing environmental awareness, these coins may attract a larger user base looking to invest ethically. As the focus on sustainability grows, XRP could face competition from these greener alternatives.

Check The Details Here: https://moneywave.myofferdeals.com  
  
The rise of **central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)** marks a significant shift. Countries worldwide are exploring the use of blockchain technology to create government-backed digital currencies. The advantages of CBDCs include enhanced transaction security and lower costs. As nations launch digital currencies, they might reshape public perceptions of cryptocurrencies, pushing traditional coins like XRP to adapt or risk being sidelined.

With all these advancements in the cryptocurrency sphere, it is evident that while XRP has solidified its status, the space is teeming with promising trends and technologies. From DeFi and NFTs to layer-two solutions and CBDCs, the crypto world invites you to watch closely as it transforms. Embrace these developments, and consider how they might impact your own interest in cryptocurrency as an investment and a means of financial empowerment.

### Conclusion

As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, the analysis of XRP rivals reveals a wealth of opportunities for growth and innovation. These key players, ranging from Stellar (XLM) to Algorand (ALGO), demonstrate not only their potential to challenge XRP but also their unique capabilities in facilitating rapid transactions and enhancing security. By examining these competitors, you can better understand the shifting dynamics within the crypto space and make informed decisions about your investments.

Check The Details Here: https://moneywave.myofferdeals.com  
  
Moreover, the future of cryptocurrency is brimming with promise due to emerging technologies and trends that extend far beyond XRP. Innovations like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the integration of blockchain technology into various sectors are paving the way for a more inclusive financial ecosystem. As you explore these advancements, keep an eye on the players that aim to disrupt the status quo.

Staying informed about these trends and understanding the strengths of XRP's rivals can empower you to navigate the exciting world of cryptocurrency effectively. Whether you choose to invest in established coins or emerging tokens, remember that the volatility intrinsic to this market also presents unique opportunities. By actively engaging with the market and adapting to its changes, you can position yourself advantageously within this rapidly growing digital economy. As the future unfolds, remain vigilant and open-minded‚Äîthere's much to discover in the realm of promising crypto growth and innovation beyond XRP.

FEEDBACK REQUEST: Thoughts on Collateralizing tzBTC to Borrow XTZ?,tezos,1h87219,2024-12-06 12:44:17,27,0.93,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/tezos/comments/1h87219/feedback_request_thoughts_on_collateralizing/,KevinOnChain,delegation,"Curious to get everyone's thoughts and feedback on this because I'm wondering why others haven't figured this out. 

Right now: 

* Bitcoin‚Äôs price is as all-time-highs (\~$100,000) 
* XTZ borrowing rates are super low on [TezFin](https://app.tezos.finance) (currently 1.4% Borrow APY)
* XTZ rewards for delegation and staking are so [high](https://tzkt.io/) (8% and 16% respectively)

Collateralizing tzBTC to borrow XTZ and delegating it for rewards seems like a no-brainer. The delegation rewards far outweigh the borrowing cost‚Äîthere‚Äôs clear arbitrage here. Even if borrowing rates increase, liquid delegation enables virtually instant returns (it can even be automated with a bot).

Curious if anyone else sees this or has thoughts on why it hasn‚Äôt caught on yet."

Bitcoin (BTC) started the day with a slight drop of 0.1%. According to CoinGecko, the cryptocurrency registered a price of $91,756 in the morning.

The biggest drop within the Top 10 was suffered by XRP, which fell 3.6% after a strong bullish move. On the other hand, Dogecoin (DOGE) showed gains of 3.5%, while Ether (ETH) remained stable above $3,100.

Among the Top 100 cryptocurrencies, Tezos (XTZ) led the gains with a 32% increase, followed by HBAR, which rose by around 26%. However, memecoins saw the biggest losses, with GOAT falling by 7.4%, PEPE by 6.2%, and FLOKI falling by 6%.

A potential bullish catalyst for BTC this week is the launch of new ETF derivatives, specifically a Bitcoin-focused options ETF, which could push its price towards $200,000.

# New BTC ETF on the Market

The Bitcoin Options ETF is set to begin trading on Tuesday, according to a Bloomberg report. The fund‚Äôs early approval has bolstered market optimism, raising expectations of a potential BTC rally towards $200,000.

In addition, spot ETFs have regained strength, starting the week with significant inflows, indicating growing institutional interest in digital assets.

While spot ETFs allow investors to own BTC for the long term without worrying about custody, options ETFs go one step further. These derivatives allow traders to bet both for and against BTC, increasing trading volumes.

This new development has generated excitement in the market, especially after the success of spot ETFs. According to data from Farside Investors, nine ETFs saw inflows worth $254.8 million on November 18, after having seen outflows the previous week.

# Will Bitcoin hit $200,000?

Today, November 19, the BTC price opened with a slight drop of 0.1%, while its trading volume rose by 52% in the last 24 hours, reaching $73.59 billion. According to Coinglass, Bitcoin has accumulated gains of 2% in the week and 30.7% so far in November.

Open interest (OI) on BTC futures has also increased by more than 1.5%, reflecting strong market sentiment.

Optimism over the launch of the US options ETF continues to fuel expectations. A report from BCA Research projects that BTC could reach a peak price of $200,000 in the next six months.

In parallel, analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a positive outlook on BTC. Based on his historical analysis, BTC‚Äôs previous cycles suggest it could reach $150,000. Another well-known analyst, ‚ÄúCrypto Rover,‚Äù supports BCA‚Äôs optimism and believes BTC will hit $200,000 soon.

I know, analogies most of the time are stupid. Still, if we imagine cryptos as living organisms in a digital ecosystem, only the strongest and most adaptable are likely to survive in the long run.

So, how does this analogy work?

In nature, species that adapt to their environment survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous traits. Similarly, cryptocurrencies that adapt to market demands, technological advancements, and regulatory changes are more likely to thrive.

Let‚Äôs look at some examples:

Bitcoin (BTC): The Digital Pioneer
- Analogy: Bitcoin is like the first species to colonize a new environment‚Äîit‚Äôs established and has a significant advantage due to being the first mover.
- Survival Traits: Widespread recognition and adoption as a store of value. Despite scalability issues, solutions like the Lightning Network are helping it adapt.

Ethereum (ETH): The Versatile Adapter
- Analogy: Ethereum is akin to organisms that evolve new functions to exploit different niches.
- Survival Traits: Introduced smart contracts, enabling a whole ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). The transition to Ethereum 2.0 aims to improve scalability and energy efficiency.

Tezos (XTZ): The Self-Evolver
- Analogy: Tezos is like a species with the ability to self-mutate to adapt quickly to environmental changes.
- Survival Traits: Features a self-amending blockchain that can upgrade without hard forks, allowing it to evolve smoothly. On-chain governance lets stakeholders vote on protocol changes, ensuring collective adaptation.

Cardano (ADA): The Research-Driven Species
- Analogy: Cardano resembles species that evolve carefully through gradual changes backed by research (think of humans developing advanced tools).
- Survival Traits: Built on peer-reviewed research and formal verification, aiming for long-term scalability and security.

Dogecoin (DOGE): The Unexpected Survivor
- Analogy: Like the cockroach, which survives in various conditions despite the odds.
- Survival Traits: Started as a meme but gained a strong community and widespread popularity, showing that community support can be a key survival factor.

Just as in nature, the crypto environment is competitive, and resources (like investment and developer attention) are limited. Cryptocurrencies that can‚Äôt keep up may become obsolete, much like extinct species.

So, what do you think? Am I too off? Which cryptocurrencies do you believe are best equipped to survive?"

Do you really need to hide my post? What rule did I or we break? I'd like to know, as I'm part of this community and a longggg time holder of xtz. I was actually enjoying everyone's posts and comments, but man... Censoring this post is BS and says a lot. I've been holding since 2019, but if we can't speak openly about the project I may just walk away from it. 

I really would like to know why... Thanks. "

Update for Tezos Holders: Changes to BitcoinVN‚Äôs XTZ Staking Vault,tezos,1gl1ms8,2024-11-06 10:52:06,17,0.81,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tezos/comments/1gl1ms8/update_for_tezos_holders_changes_to_bitcoinvns/,Bitcoin_Vietnam,news,"Dear BitcoinVN Clients and Followers,

We‚Äôd like to let you know that our XTZ (""Tezos"") staking vault will be phased out in the coming months. This decision reflects a decline in both XTZ-related swap volume and general interest in the XTZ staking service.

**What You Need to Know:**

Automatic Conversion: Any remaining funds in the XTZ vault will be automatically converted back to XTZ before the end of Q4 2024.

Flexible Options: You can [withdraw your XTZ](https://bitcoinvn.io/?deposit=xtzbalance&settle=xtz) directly at any time or, if preferred, swap it into any other digital asset available on BitcoinVN - giving you full control over how you manage your funds.



**Additional Notes:**

XTZ remains available on our platform for instant swap - this update *only* affects liquidity providers in the XTZ staking vault.

Buy or Sell XTZ for VND: You can still [buy or sell XTZ for Vietnamese Dong](https://bitcoinvn.io/?deposit=vnd&settle=xtz), with [cash-out options available at our Cash Offices in Saigon, Hanoi, Da Nang, Hoi An, and Hue](https://bitcoinvn.io/news/how-does-the-cash-pick-up-option-in-saigon-work/).

Celebrating our 11th year of operations, BitcoinVN continues to see healthy growth, with ZEC (""ZCash"") being the most recent addition to our staking options.

Thank you for your understanding and ongoing support. 

For any questions, feel free to contact our support team‚Äîwe‚Äôre here to help and always value your feedback!

Best regards,

Shoutout to the Cryptocurrencies that haven't paid influencers to promote their coin but rather let their tech/ideas do the talking,CryptoCurrency,1g31p58,2024-10-13 18:35:12,94,0.75,85,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1g31p58/shoutout_to_the_cryptocurrencies_that_havent_paid/,CriticalCobraz,PERSPECTIVE,"I just wanted to take a moment to appreciate the cryptocurrency projects that have stayed true to their roots and let their technology and community do the talking, without resorting to paid promotions like influencer marketing.  
(Protip: You know a coin is at least shady when it has been promoted by an influencer)

Here‚Äôs a list of **some** popular coins that didn‚Äôt pay influencers to push their coins but instead focused on building something people saw value on their own:

* **Bitcoin (BTC)** ‚Äì The OG that never needed influencers. Bitcoin‚Äôs reputation as digital gold stands strong on the shoulders of its decentralized, community-driven movement.
* **Ethereum (ETH)** ‚Äì The backbone of decentralized apps (dApps) and smart contracts. Ethereum continues to evolve without chasing influencer-driven hype.
* **Cardano (ADA)** ‚Äì Focused on peer-reviewed research and scientific rigor, Cardano‚Äôs dedication to long-term goals has kept it away from paying for attention.
* **Monero (XMR)** ‚Äì Privacy is power, and Monero has always stood by its commitment to privacy without paying for promotion. Its tech speaks louder than words.
* **Litecoin (LTC)** ‚Äì ""The silver to Bitcoin‚Äôs gold"" has earned its place through utility and reliability, not paid promotions.
* **Tezos (XTZ)** ‚Äì Focused on governance and self-amendment, Tezos is all about building a blockchain that evolves with its community‚Äîno influencer noise needed.
* **Zcash (ZEC)** ‚Äì Another privacy-focused project, Zcash lets its zero-knowledge proofs and privacy protocols do the talking.
* **Algorand (ALGO)** ‚Äì With a focus on solving blockchain trilemma (decentralization, scalability, and security), Algorand focuses on building a robust ecosystem without flashy marketing.
* **Cosmos (ATOM)** ‚Äì The internet of blockchains is here, and Cosmos is letting its vision of interconnectivity take center stage‚Äîno influencer payments required.
* **Chainlink (LINK)** ‚Äì Powering smart contracts with real-world data, Chainlink lets its use cases and partnerships show its strength, no influencer hype needed.
* **Polkadot (DOT)** ‚Äì Focused on interoperability and multi-chain solutions, Polkadot continues to build out a solid tech foundation without paying for followers or hype.
* **NEO (NEO)** ‚Äì ""The Ethereum of China"" has been quietly developing its ecosystem and bridging digital economies without shelling out to influencers.
* **Avalanche (AVAX)** ‚Äì Promising high throughput and low fees, Avalanche is proving its worth with solid tech, not influencer endorsements.
* **Solana (SOL)** ‚Äì While the project is known for its fast and low-cost transactions, it‚Äôs also worth noting that Solana has made waves through innovation rather than relying on paid promotions.

(I think the list is accurate based on my research, don't trust me, do your own research.  
In case I'm wrong, please correct me and I will update the list)

Also I don't like every coin I listed here, due to various reasons but gotta pay respect where it's due.

Edits:

-For people asking why a certain coin in not in the list, I added some coins, If you want to name others feel free to do so in the comments. There are thousands of coins, unfortunatly I can't put them all in a list and also verify every single one, which hasn't paid promoters.
