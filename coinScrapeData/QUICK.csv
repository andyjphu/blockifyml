"My Review - So much potential, only some of it realized",HarryPotterGame,1i9xcxg,2025-01-25 16:20:02,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HarryPotterGame/comments/1i9xcxg/my_review_so_much_potential_only_some_of_it/,Warder45,User Reviews,"Having watched the Hogwarts Baking Show and having thrown on some hogwarts Christmas backgrounds from the game over the holidays, we noticed the game on sale and decided to give it a shot. Overall, I'd give it a 3 out 5 stars. Generally the first half of the game is really good, with the back half being pretty mediocre to bad.



**The Good**: The art and design team deserves some major praise. Hogwarts is amazingly detailed, even without ray tracing, the reflections, lighting, textures, are all really well done. The size of the environments as well as your ability to just mount up and fly around outdoors is really technically impressive. Even the forbidden forest, which I assumed would be a no-fly zone, was open to fly to, which was great. But it's not just all technical, moving portraits, or a hall of music playing one, ghosts wandering around, the school feels full of life. There is a plethora of outfit options you can mix and match. I'm not sure there are words to do justice to just how well the art and design team did in this game.

The reason the first 40-50% of the game is good is that it does a better job at capturing not just the vibe of the books/movies, but even outside of the IP, it's what you'd want in a cozy-ish, YA, school style game. You get to go to a fancy school with classes about learning magic, making friends, and solving problems. They've build a ton of puzzles into the game, some that work really well in the beginning, like portraits that show a location and you need to find it. Helps with exploration of the massive space. Having spells that can levitate and move objects makes for some Breath of the Wild like puzzles. While the Astrology puzzles aren't really hard, they are still pretty fun for what they are.

In fact, as someone who enjoys cozy games, they really iterated on a lot of cozy game concepts and refined them. You get your own magic room, to decorate how you like, to brew potions, house animals, grow plants, etc. They've done an excellent job making all your materials matter. In many cozy games, animal husbandry is more for enjoyment than tangible in game effects. For example, you almost always get more crops for less effort than animal products when trying to make money. Here, everything is used, animal products are required to upgrade your gear, which gets improved with each level, so you'll constantly be swapping things out and wanting to upgrade them again. 

Speaking of husbandry, the animals are all very well animated and realized. There are some very cute creatures in this game. And in your vivarium's where they live, you can launch balls for them to play with or use a spell to pet them, which can be very calming since cat animals purr, duckbill like animals will fall on their back while you pet their tummy. When it comes to animal husbandry, this is the game to beat now.





**The Meh**: While collecting decorations and clothes is a great incentive for solving puzzles, it does have the downside of ""you have to hope it randomly gives you X"" when you solve one. If items were tied to specific puzzles and camps, that would allow player who wanted a specific hat, glasses, coat, etc to beeline it to there so they could equip their look early on. 

The day/night cycle isn't great. It never feels like it's day long enough, and you have to open your map, hold F to then ""sleep"" where you are to move time forward. But weirdly it seems to move from day, to early night, to late night, to day again, which is strange since there are things at night and things during the day, not sure why there is 3 parts to the cycle.

Character models are also quite limited. For how much they put into the environments, it's a shame. It seems they have a couple professors that are slightly higher but otherwise, some look just like students (gardening professor) or just had wrinkles applied to be ""older"". It's really strange they didn't build in different body types.

The map could also use work. Not sure why they though holding down a button to rotate then zooming you back out after you let go was a good design choice. The map constantly fights you in Hogwarts, since floo flames are hard to make out where they really are.

And I'll just leave this here, I did a side quest to save a lady's pet Niffler. Reward? A Niffler lined hat...





**The Bad**: Well lets start with quick one, it's still Harry Potter, warts and all. They did a better job than the movies with diversity, but removing the horrible house elf stuff was a bridge too far I guess. They could have used literally anything, a magical ghost or item instead of Deek and him talking about his crappy master (why do they all come from bad wizards?)

Outside of Potter specific stuff, the last 50% is just not great. The main story was always sort of a filler, but there was a lot of build up for not a lot of payoff towards the end. Since it's YA, I'm even going to cut them some slack in how an army of goblins is setup around a school of wizards and literally no adult is doing anything about it. The main drag is that it just doesn't feel like the same school cozy game. There are still a few side quests, but there are no more classes, even Hogwarts feels a bit lesser since professors will just disappear from their classrooms never to be found. Say nothing of the ""good""/""bad"" paths in the game. It feels like the bad path was tacked on at the end to get the illusion, but it's just ""I want money vs not"" for 90% of the choices.

Sadly combat is also just not very satisfying. You are almost always alone, there are too many spells, forcing you to rotate the bar constantly since some spells just don't work well on certain enemies. I never use the block option, since dodge rolling was infinitely easier and more useful. The idea of color coded shields is a good idea to start, but in the context of the entire combat design, it never really came together. Descriptions of how to tackle enemies gets buried in the glossary and even then, it's not very helpful (boy it would be nice to have a class to take where to showed you how to fight certain monsters...) And this is all before talking about balance.

The games balance is really bad. For as great as upgrades and adding traits to clothing is for making husbandry useful, they did a really bad job balancing those traits out and the power curve as you get higher level. I had 1 level 3 trait increasing all plant damage (out of 6 pieces of gear, so I could have had 5x as much) and with just that one, 2 cabbages and 2 vine plants would wipe out every camp in the game. Hell I'd throw 2 sets of cabbages out and they'd pretty much solo a Troll (the hardest non-boss unit in the game). But it's not just plants, with a couple ancient magic ones, I'd constantly be full and could 1 shot anything. 

I'm not 100% sold on how you collect animals as well. If the game was setup so you rescued animals from poachers and that's how you filled your vivarium, that would have been infinitely better than going to their natural habitat, sucking them up into your bag, then bringing them to your own personal zoo. You are literally a poacher in this game, kidnapping animals to create materials you can harvest. It wouldn't be that hard to build our vivarium via poacher camps (giving players another reason to do them) and put some puzzle system in place to protect animal dens, just re-allocate a couple dozen merlin trials ha.

Speaking of merlin trials, for as great as having so many puzzles in the game is, half of them are not really puzzles but busy work. Once you understand what to do with the merlin trials, there is no difficulty at all. It's just going and doing. It seems like they would have been better served cutting those in half and making the remaining ones a bit better. Which leads to another major pain point, the game doesn't do a good job tracking what has been done. Looking for that remaining page in hogsmede? I hope you have a picture perfect memory for the other 50 you already got if you plan on looking up the rest. This goes for all collectables in the game. I think part of the problem is that they re-use page locations later in the game, so having one that you got still flying around marked as such, would cause too much stuff at one time. 



Overall, I really enjoyed the first 40-50% of the game, and wish the they had been able to harness that for the entire game. I couldn't help but play the remaining game re-designing it in my head. If they had designed this more like a Bioware game, with students you could befriend, they would then be companions on quests, it would open up so much more of the game. Now you could design a better combat system, with all sorts of combos. The room of requirement has so much wasted space by the end, if it was the hangout for your friends, maybe there would be a table where you could suggest classes they take, so help with their builds? Maybe there would just be games or things to do? Speaking of classes, clothing being limited to traits and health would help make classes required for increasing spell damage. Maybe you take potions class to improve your purple spells, or transfiguration for yellow, take botany for increased plant damage. But you can't do them all, which would allow for actual builds in the game. I could probably go on for a while here but you get the idea.



I hope the developers are cognizant of the issues if they plan on doing another game. The game engine, art, and design are really top notch, just let those folks cook. But I hope they take another look at the core game design. "
Being able to keep Rantanen,canes,1i9x7mp,2025-01-25 16:13:32,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9x7mp,GuentzelTheCANE,THIS IS BEYOND SCIENCE,In Nhl 25 I did all the roster moves and contracts to make it like the trade so I could try and resign Mikko.

Gyrocopters or Gyrobombers. Which one to go for?,totalwar,1i9wvit,2025-01-25 15:58:37,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1i9wvit/gyrocopters_or_gyrobombers_which_one_to_go_for/,Caleb_Perdita,Warhammer III,"So I'm currently drafting up plans for a ""standard issue"" army for the dwarfs where each army will be mostly the same with varied compositions to deal with most types of armies with the odd time where I'll swap out some units for specific factions. I've been planning to get two gyros per army but I'm stumped on what variant to go for. IK the trollhammer version is the best but we don't always get to max age of reckoning so until then I got to make do. I did some testing in custom battles and I noticed that the gyrocopter is good against infantry but not so much against heroes and monsters, whereas the bombers are the opposite with their autocannons. Both variants are good against artillery where the copters quickly take out the crew and the bombers take out the artillery pieces.

Could use a bit more testing, but I'm wondering what the rest of you guys think since no doubt there are more experienced dwarf players among you."

I have been playing this game for a long time now and this is probably the best multiplayer game I have played in last 5-6 years. Safe to say, it has given back 10x what its worth.

  
All the good points aside, here are few things I would add if I could as the game feels empty in few areas.

* lack of late game progression/resource sink
   * Weapons customization - they have been working on this for a while now and I think this should be the next big feature they should release. It will be a great way to add some progression and sample resource sink. (high priority)
   * Armor transmog/customization - let us recolor armor/helmets, and maybe even let us swap passives, maybe using req slips or even 5-10 super creds. So many good looking armor sets are collecting dust because they got awful color/useless passive. (low priority)
   * Upgrade path for passive armor stat upgrades(armor, speed, handling, reload speed, ammo cap etc) like other ship modules. (very low priority)
   * Prestige system - 3rd point can even be added as a prestige system post lvl 100 or something. After a certain amount of xp you get a prestige point and buy some passive stat upgrades with it.
* lack of achievement and rewards
   * Milestones - give us some unique rewards for reaching certain milestones like x bug/bot/squid missions completed, complete x missions with less than y deaths, kill x number of bugs/bots/squid heavies etc. These rewards can include player titles, cards, capes etc. (medium priority)
   * Faction rewards - for above milestones certain faction based rewards can be given like B-01 variant with bug/bot/overseer head as shoulder pad or other enemy body/armor parts, helmets, capes, player titles like overseer slayer on reaching a milestone like kill 40 overseers in a mission
   * Weapon skins - these rewards can also include weapons textures like sand on completing x missions with a weapon in desert biome, or forest camo on jungle biome etc
* Gameplay variety 
   * Modifiers - current modifiers are very bland, give us some more unique biome based modifiers like acid effect, ion storms or faction based like bugs spore cloud. (medium priority)
   * More biomes - very low priority but would love to see more biomes like lava world, windy/tornado planets, thunder storm planets with lightning strikes
   * Planetary wildlife/hazards - would love to see some biome specific wildlife hostile and peaceful that we can encounter. Imagine a feline like predator that can hunt helldivers in jungle biome, or a man eating plant. And some planetary hazards like quick sand, tornadoes, lightning strikes, breakable glacier plates etc  (very low priority) "

A Keto Diet Grocery List For Beginners - 31 Must-Have Items,HealthyZapper,1i9vk1k,2025-01-25 15:00:32,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyZapper/comments/1i9vk1k/a_keto_diet_grocery_list_for_beginners_31/,AutoModerator,Keto,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s5gkhpfofs061.jpg?width=2064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c175eb97f2ac90ce1058d2578c321ac507fab89f

Starting the keto diet can be a little overwhelming-the high-fat, low-carb diet, known for its dramatic weight loss results, requires an overhaul of most people's typical shopping lists. That means saying goodbye to some of the easy items you might keep on hand for lazy nights (we're talking to you, quick-cooking rice and frozen french fries), and hello to some slightly more perishable foods that are higher in fat and protein like meat and full-fat dairy. 

But before you go filling your grocery cart with bacon and cheese galore, know that you'll want to opt for good-for-you sources of unsaturated fat and protein-like fish and avocado, instead, says Lyssie Lakatos, RDN, of the Nutrition Twins. ""Since this diet is primarily coming from fat, choosing healthy sources of fat is important,"" she says. So, healthy fat = good; protein = good; but what about everything else? Don't freak-while, yes, tons of stuff is off-limits on the keto diet, there are plenty of yummy things you can eat. To help, a few dietitians weighed in on what they'd put on their keto diet grocery shopping list-so all you really have to do is save it and go to the store.  But first. . . some items to take off your list

There are a few aisles you can skip (the cookie aisle is probably one of them) if you're committing to keto. Here are the non-keto-friendly items you will no longer need to stock your fridge and pantry with. 

Pasta and other grains When you're cutting carbs on keto, pasta, rice, and noodles have to be the first to go (unfortunately). Your local grocery store might have a special health foods section where you can find low-carb or gluten-free pastas and noodles, though. 

Starchy veggiesPotatoes are off limits, and so are other starchy, high-carb vegetables like carrots, believe it or not. Colorful, leafy greens are going to be key staples to add to your basket or cart. 

High-sugar fruitsWhile fruit is something that is usually recommended for a healthy, balanced diet, the keto diet restricts some fruit, says Marisa Moore, MBA, RDN, LD.  Some fruits, like apples, bananas, and pears, are higher in carbs, which break down into sugars, so they're not typically part of a keto eating plan. 

LegumesIf you eat vegan or vegetarian, certain legumes, like beans, lentils, and chickpeas, might be a regular part of your diet for extra protein. On keto, though, they're too high in carbs and too low in fat to be compliant. 

Sugary foodsYou're going to want to bypass any aisle that includes candy, doughnuts, snack cakes, and cookies, as the sugars in any processed sweets should be avoided on the keto diet. Your keto-friendly grocery list

Ok, now that we've gotten the bad news out of the way, here are all the yummy items you can stock up on when you're following a keto diet. There's plenty to be excited about putting in your cart!

Low-carb veggies

Not all vegetables are created equal for keto followers. High-carb veggies are a no-go. Instead, opt for low-carb options like cauliflower, broccoli, spinach, bell pepper, celery, cucumber, eggplant, and asparagus, says Pegah Jalali, RD, a nutritionist with Middleberg Nutrition. 

Frozen veggies are cool, too. Sydney Greene, RD, also of Middleberg Nutrition, recommends frozen cauliflower in particular. ""It's very low carb yet high in fiber and vitamin C. Use cauliflower in place of bananas for a creamy smoothie without the extra carbohydrates,"" Greene says. 

Avocados

Tammy Lakatos Shames, RDN, of Nutrition Twins, describes avocados as one of the very best keto foods, jam-packed with both nutrients and healthy fats. ""I like to have them with some hemp or flax seeds sprinkled on top and some parmesan cheese,"" says Jalali.  

Berries 

Raspberries are a perfect sweet treat for people on the keto diet, since they're the fruit with the fewest carbs, says Jalali-though blueberries and blackberries are great, too. Blackberries and raspberries specifically are a solid option because they contain 8 grams of fiber per cup, too, Moore adds. Salad greens

Pre-washed greens, like spinach, kale and arugula, are a huge timesaver. ""Having greens on hand makes it super easy to throw together a quick salad or add some quick nutrients-folate, vitamin C, fiber, magnesium-to your proteins,"" says Greene. 

For a quick, keto-friendly breakfast, Greene suggests scrambling two whole eggs and a handful of spinach to get a good serving of healthy fat, protein, and fiber. 

Grass-fed beef and organic chicken

Keep grass-fed beef and lamb, along with organic chicken, on hand, recommends Jalali. ""Our clients particularly love Applegate's Great Organic Uncured Beef Hot Dog,"" says Shames-they're non-GMO and made with grass-fed beef, sans nitrates and preservatives. 

Bone broth

Another option? Sip your meat-based protein. Greene loves Bonafide Provisions Bone Broth, which uses bones from grass-fed cows. ""The amino acids found in the broth support a healthy gut,"" says Greene. Tuna, salmon, or sardines (fresh or canned)

If you opt for fresh fish, grill, bake, or pan-fry it in a healthy oil (olive or avocado) and serve with a low-carb veggie like broccoli or cauliflower rice. 

If you choose canned, mix it with mayo and serve over greens, suggests Jalali. For a simple keto lunch, Greene suggests combining a can of tuna with half an avocado in a collard green wrap. 

Cheese

Go for grass-fed, organic, and full-fat options in the dairy aisle, recommends Jalali. For cheese, one easy-to-find option-readily available at groceries and convenience stores alike-is Organic Valley's full fat cheese. ""It fits in the keto diet perfectly,"" says Lakatos. Always read the nutrition info before purchasing pre-shredded cheeses, cautions Jalali, who says they sometimes contain a stabilizer that adds carbs-so just make sure your shredded cheese has zero grams of carbs. 

Greek yogurt and sour cream

These can be used interchangeably on the keto diet, as they all have similar amounts of carbs-Greek yogurt has five grams per serving and sour cream has seven. Just make sure they're plain options-added flavors also add carbs. 

Quark

Quark is a German food that's somewhere in between yogurt and cheese in flavor and consistency-you can add it to smoothies, or use it as a spread or topping. ""It's rich, creamy, and a favorite among our clients who are keto followers,"" says Lakatos. 

Eggs

If you're on a keto diet, opt for Eggland's Best Eggs, says Lakatos. ""They have double the omega-3s and six times the vitamin D of other eggs, thanks to their all-vegetarian hen feed which provides high-quality, keto-friendly nutrients. ""

Moore suggests meal prepping hard boiled eggs and keeping them in the fridge throughout the week for easy on-the-go breakfasts. If properly refrigerated and not cracked, they'll last for 7 days in the fridge. 

Nut milks

Milk can actually have a good amount of carbs, so nut milk is a good alternative on the keto diet, says Lakatos. Unsweetened coconut, hemp, and almond milks in particular are good options, as they contain no carbs and more than four grams of fat-a perfect combo for keto dieters. Almond milk specifically is versatile for a variety of recipes, like a chia seed pudding or a breakfast smoothie, says Moore. ""Simply blend frozen berries with leafy greens and plenty of almond milk for a frosty drink in less than five minutes,"" Moore suggests. 

Avocado, olive, hazelnut, and coconut oil

The keto diet is all about fat, so clearly all healthy oils are welcome on this keto grocery list. Cooking food in the oils is one thing-but you can also amp up your fat intake by drizzling some oil on your cooked meal, as well. 

Grass-fed ghee

Ghee, like the oils above, is a pure fat, which means its free from carbs or protein, says Jalali. ""Ketogenic diets are more than 60 percent fat so having pure fats for all meals helps keep you on track,"" she says. If you can't find ghee, you can also use butter. 

Seaweed

This low-carb snack has just one gram of carbs, and is full of iodine, which supports a healthy thyroid, says Greene. Some even come in individual grab-and-go packets so you can store them in your desk at work or in your purse. 

Olives

You can add olives to salad or have them as an on-the-go snack. ""We find these to be a lifesaver for our keto clients,"" says Shames. Olives offer a healthy monounsaturated source of fat; some even come in different flavors (like taco or sriracha). Pistachios 

Shames recommends single-serving packages of pistachios, too. ""Ninety percent of the fats found in pistachios are the better-for-you mono- and polyunsaturated type,"" says Shames. ""Plus, pistachios provide a good source of plant protein and fiber for a trio that can help to keep you fuller longer. ""

Almonds

Another nut that's high in fiber, healthy fat, and protein is almonds. Moore always recommends them as snacks for clients who are constantly busy and need snacks to keep them satiated throughout the day. You can easily pack single-serve packages ahead of time. 

Nutritional yeast

Nutritional yeast provides B12, a nutrient that many of us-especially vegans and vegetarians-just don't get enough of. It's also a source of protein without many carbs at all, says Lakatos. 

""Keto followers can sprinkle it on their meals for a cheesy flavor and they often use it to make keto-friendly breads and tortillas,"" says Lakatos. 

Chia seeds and flax seeds

You can use these seeds to coat meats, include them in bake goods, or make keto-friendly oatmeal and pudding, says Jalali. These pantry items are high in fiber, but low in carbs. 

Healthy frozen foods

Added items like frozen cauliflower pizza and frozen frittatas can make eating keo simple on mornings and nights when you're strapped for time. Nora Minno, an RD in New York City, loves this pizza, which contains only 16 grams of carbs for the whole pie.  Tofu

""Tofu is a great way to add plant-based protein into a diet that is typically heavy in animal protein and fat,"" says Minno. ""A 3-oz serving contains 80 calories, 4 grams of fat, 9 grams of protein and only 3 grams of carbs. You'll also be getting important micronutrients like calcium, iron, and potassium. ""

Low-carb pasta alternatives

""Shiratake noodles are a great low-carb pasta alternative with only 2 grams of carbs and 0 calories per bag,"" says Minno. 

Nut butter

A high-quality nut butter is a great keto snack, topping for flax crackers, and ingredient for keto fat bombs and desserts, says Lara Clevenger, RD and founder of The Keto Queens. 

Grass-fed beef tallow

Beef tallow is rich in omega 3 and CLA and is a ""high quality saturated fat which has a high smoke point and is great for cooking,"" says Clevenger. 

Chocolate

Yes, you can totally add chocolate to your shopping cart on the keto diet! Clevenger recommends Choc Zero. ""It's sugar-free chocolate, non-gmo, and contains no sugar alcohols or soy lecithin. It's not super bitter like some chocolate bars and tastes great and has a very good texture,"" she says. 

Keto-approved condiments

One of the trickiest things to shop for while keto? Dressings and condiments. Clevenger recommends low-sugar ketchup and BBQ sauce from Alterna Sweets. ""These sauces taste amazing and they all contain only 1 gram net carb per tablespoon,"" she says. As for salad dressing? Clevenger reaches for Primal Kitchen brand. ""These are sugar-free and keto-certified. ""Alternative flours

""Almond flour is one of my favorite baking ingredients,"" Moore says. It's also one of the most common keto-friendly, gluten-free, alternative flours.  ""The almonds provide satiating fiber and protein plus healthy fats,"" Moore adds.  She recommends it for making pie crusts and baking cookies and muffins. 

Coconut flour is another low-carb flour alternative that Moore suggests adding to your pantry. However, keep in mind that you can't just substitute the same amount in a recipe that calls for regular four. ""Because it is highly absorbent, you'll likely need to add more liquid to baked goods that use coconut flour,"" Moore says. 

Keto-friendly sweeteners

For a natural sugar substitute that's keto-compliant, consider stocking up on monk fruit, says Moore. Whether you're baking or looking to sweeten up your coffee, monk fruit is an option that won't take you out of ketosis. Erythritol is another common keto-friendly sugar substitute. Again, you'll want to use in keto-specific recipes since you can't swap in the same amount for a recipe that calls for sugar. 

Keto protein bars

To keep you full during the day, try a keto protein or energy bar that's high in healthy fats (like nuts and oils like avocado oil) and protein, but low in carbs. Keto Bar is a great option-they make a delicious chocolate peanut butter flavor. 

Keto granolas

You won't be able to buy regular cereals, as they'll be too high in carbs, but low-carb or grain-free, low sugar granolas like Lakanto Healthy Quick Breakfast Granola or Lark Ellen Farm Granola are a better choice. You can add milk to them or eat them with yogurt and breakfast is solved."

I was incredibly stoked for this release as the Baby Banter is one of my favorite small knives I ever used. Adding milled aluminum scales and an axis lock seemed to be a perfect addition to the family. The Banter 2 didn't have the finger choil I love so this was going to be my jam. I had a guy waiting for a scale swap so he could have purple with satin and I could have blue with black so I immediately got to work. There were several body screws that were loose from the factory, but since I had to remove them anyways it wasn't a big deal. Once I got the scales off I could see some sloppy milling work but it was only visible from the inside and didn't detect the use in any way. Once I got them both out back together I finally got a chance to play with it. Great ergos. Great styling. Great action. I watched a movie and spent some time flipping it every which way. Here is where I found a couple flaws in design... Ateast for me. I was struggling to flick it open cleanly using the thumb stud (both finger and thumb deployment). When comparing to the OG BB the thumb stud on the BB2 was a little closer to the handle which was causing me to use uncomfortable angles to flick it open. No biggie but anyone that has used the original BB knows how amazing that flicking is. The other thing I found was that in the dark I didn't notice that every time I flipped the blade back down it was cutting the meaty flesh of my palm. Because of the size of the full knife, and the location of the axis lock bar, I have to push the end of the handle into my palm so I can pull the lock back to close. Because of how I had to place my hand around the knife to close it it makes contact withy palm. I will keep playing with it and it's likely a me problem but it was definitely worth noting and I'm definitely disappointed. Like I said above though everything else is great and I look forward to more Banter versions! "

Wednesday: get to hotel around 6, have dinner, go to some bars.

Thursday: walk around the French Market and Jackson Square. Have breakfast and lunch somewhere around there. Then go on a 45 minute cemetery tour. Dinner and what not later on.

Friday: breakfast or early lunch. Be at our hotel at 11:45 to wait to get picked up for a swap tour. The tour is 2 hours but 1 hour away. So I’m guessing it will take 5-6 hours of our day. Have dinner when we get back and watch a parade. I think it starts at 7:00. Might have to have a pretty quick dinner.

Saturday: all we have planned so far is watch part of the parade that starts at 6:30. We have a ghost tour at 8.

Introduction:      
Simgot has had no shortage of IEM releases in the past year, and most have been fairly well received. I have personally reviewed the EA500LM, EM6L, and SuperMix 4. I also own the EW200 but have yet to review that one. The EW300 is a tribrid IEM featuring a single dynamic, one planar, and one piezoelectric driver and also includes two swappable tuning nozzles. Simgot has chosen to offer multiple versions of this model with some slight variations between them. There are three different EW300s: the standard ($69.99), a collaboration with HBB ($75.99), and one that comes with a DSP cable ($79.99). All three seem to have mostly the same general tuning, or at least the same DNA, but the HBB and DSP models sport a matte black shell. I received the standard version for review, so let's break down this newest iteration in Simgot's EW line and see what it has to offer.     

Build, fit, ergonomics:     
The shell of the EW300 is very reminiscent of the EW200 in size, shape, fit, and build quality. They are almost identical but with two distinct differences: the interchangeable nozzles and faceplate design. The standard version of the EW300 features a silver, shiny solid metal shell with an ""X"" on one faceplate and a ""♡"" on the other. The design is an interesting one and some users may take issue with wearing IEMs with a heart on them but I personally like the design and feel that helps it to standout. The shells feel very solid in hand and have a decent weight to them, but they are still comfortable to wear for extended periods. These standard version shells are prone to smudges, fingerprints, and scratches, so those who are averse to this might want to opt for one of the other versions with the matte black finish. The EW300 features a recessed 2-pin connection, which makes cable swapping a bit more difficult. The nozzles measure 6mm at the lip, and they are a little on the short side with an insertion depth that is not particularly deep. I didn't have many issues with fit, but I would prefer a deeper insertion for an easier and better seal. The EW300 comes with two sets of swappable nozzles: silver and gold. They offer distinctly different tunings and are easily changed by simply unscrewing them from the shell. Simgot also includes a few small foam inserts that can be placed inside the nozzles for those who would like to tame the upper frequencies a bit. I did choose to utilize the foam as the stock nozzle was a bit bright for me. There are also extra rubber rings to replace the ones on the nozzles in case they get lost. The stock cable is the same or at least very similar to those provided with other Simgot models. I do like the aesthetics and design, but it's only available in 3.5mm termination and feels a bit thin and cheap in hand. There are also only three pairs of silicone tips included which feels underwhelming at this price point. The stock tips are fine but I still prefer the Penon Liqueurs as they provide a better seal. The case is the same standard Simgot semi-hard-shelled black zipper-style that comes with most of their IEMs. I actually quite like these cases as they are roomy inside and provide good protection. I appreciate their quality and I usually end up utilizing them for other IEMs as well.     

Sound impressions:     
After testing both tuning options, all my impressions in this review are made using the silver nozzle. Unfortunately, I find the gold one to sound thin, hollow, and peaky even with the added foam. There is some extra bass, but it does little to balance out the treble, and the scooped upper mids are too recessed for my liking. Of course, just because I don’t care for it doesn’t mean you won’t prefer the gold one yourself, so I encourage every user to try both.     

I would characterize the silver nozzle as having a somewhat warm V-shaped tuning with an emphasis on the bass and upper midrange. It's not an overly exaggerated bass response, though, and there's still plenty of energy in the upper frequencies to balance it out. I'm not sure which drivers are handling which part of the frequency response, but the EW300 does seem to lack a bit of overall cohesion to my ear. This could be due to a lack of adequate crossover implementation or perhaps the drivers could be at odds a little in their transients, but something just sounds slightly off to me. The note weight does lean a bit thicker, which is great for my preferences. The detail retrieval is a standout feature of the EW300's technicalities and is highly competitive in its price range, although due to the warmer-leaning tonality, it still presents as more musical than clinical. The soundstage has good depth but lacks a bit in width and can present too close to the head on some tracks. The timbre is good but not the best, as it does sound just a bit off, specifically with vocals, though most instruments are spot-on. The imaging is mostly accurate and three-dimensional, although there is room for improvement. The dynamics are not the best, as the warmer tonality can lead to a less exciting presentation, and its tuning starts to fall apart a bit at lower volumes. The separation and layering can suffer a bit, especially on complex tracks where things tend to run together slightly. The EW300 is efficient and easy enough to drive, and it can reach loud volumes without needing amplification. I did try a few different dongle DAC/amps and settled on the BLON V1, as I found it to have good musical synergy with the EW300.     

●Lows - The bass has good balance, with both sub-bass and mid-bass being well represented, but it is slightly more mid-bass tilted to my ears. The rumble and extension are decent but likely won't be enough for true bass enthusiasts. The mid-bass is punchy with good impact, but I do feel like it lacks a bit of weight and slam. The bass also isn't the most resolving, as double kick drums could benefit from being better separated. The attack speed and decay are about average, and the EW300 has a somewhat typical DD bass. By that, I mean it's not super quick like a planar driver nor is it underemphasized like BA bass can sometimes be. The low end does suffer a bit of blooming and bloat, and there's a touch of bleed into the midrange, but it's far from the worst offender I've heard. Overall, the bass is elevated and enjoyable but it won't blow anyone away with its technical performance or texture, as it can sometimes come across as slightly unkempt and ill-defined.     

●Mids - The midrange has an inherent warmth and richness that lends itself beautifully to most vocals and instruments. However, there can be a tiny bit of extra energy in the upper mids/lower treble that can lead to some slight shoutiness and harshness at higher volumes. Female vocalists are generally well-balanced and present just forward enough for my tastes, but their male counterparts suffer a bit more recession and have to contend with some bleed from the midbass. Most instruments like guitars and strings are well-represented, but the timbre can have a little artificial quality depending on the track. The mids overall are pretty good, and the warmth is really nice, but I feel like there's something special missing that I can't quite put my finger on. If I could change anything, I would bring the vocals forward a bit more, improve the timbre, and get better separation from the bass.     

●Highs - The treble is simultaneously crisp and textured while also polite and inoffensive. It's really a well-done treble for my tastes, although it's not perfect. There is still plenty of air and sparkle for my needs, but the highs do roll off a little early. I personally prefer this style of treble, but some will take issue with the lack of air and extension. Cymbals, hi-hats, snares, and claps are well represented but are not harsh or piercing, and they do a great job staying in their lane without impeding on the rest of the frequencies. There can be just a hint of harshness and thinness at higher volumes, but it's not too distracting. I'm mostly pleased with the treble quantity and quality, but I would like a bit thicker note weight and a little less energy in some of the higher frequencies to smooth out any troublesome spots. I think it could be a little warmer to better match the overall tonality of the other frequencies.     

Comparisons:     
●Simgot EM6L (~$110) - The EM6L has a hybrid configuration consisting of 1 DD and 4 BAs. The shell of the EM6L is larger and is a better fit for me. I also prefer the aesthetics of the black shell to the shiny silver. They both include basically the same accessories. The EW300 is a bit warmer and smoother, and it also has more sub-bass presence with a bigger impact and rumble. The EM6L is more mid-bass focused with better impact and punch. The vocals and upper midrange of the EM6L are slightly recessed in comparison to the EW300, but they have better separation and clarity. The EM6L's treble is a bit brighter with more air and extension. Its soundstage is bigger and more spacious. It also has a more natural timbre and sounds more open and airy, with more room for vocals and instruments to breathe. Technicalities including separation, detail retrieval, and imaging are slightly better on the EM6L, and it can navigate complex tracks more aptly. This one really comes down to preference. The EW300 is warmer, with a more boisterous sub-bass, smoother midrange, and tamer treble. In contrast, the EM6L has a tighter and punchier mid-bass response, cleaner upper midrange, and better treble extension. I do like both sets, and I did initially find myself drawn to the warmth and extra bass of the EW300. However, the EM6L is more cohesive, with better tonality, bass texture, and vocal presentation, which for me wins out in the end. Both IEMs can coexist in a collection, and each has its use case, but if I had to choose only one, I'm sticking with the EM6L. It's not quite my tuning preference, but it simply offers a higher quality of sound, and I think it's well worth the increase in price.     
My pick: EM6L      

●Oreveti Lowmaster (~$150) - The Lowmaster is a hybrid featuring 1 DD and 2 BAs. The note weight, soundstage, imaging, timbre, and detail retrieval are all about the same on both sets, and I am unable to discern any significant differences. The EW300 has better sub-bass rumble and overall quantity, but the bass texture and separation are slightly cleaner on the Lowmaster. The Lowmaster still leans a bit brighter and has more treble extension and air but is also more fatiguing, with elements like cymbals, hi-hats, snares, and claps being a little more pronounced in the mix. The EW300 comes the closest to the Lowmaster among the comparisons I performed in that review. In the other comparisons, the tunings are close, but I could definitely hear a distinct advantage in technical factors in the Lowmaster's favor, although the margins of victory were not wide. The EW300 does almost everything the Lowmaster can do, with a few minor tuning differences that make it much better for me and, at less than half the price, a better value. The Lowmaster does win in terms of comfort for me, though. I feel that the EW300 is Simgot's attempt at a slightly smoother and further-refined EW200, so it's an easy recommendation over the Lowmaster, and that's not to mention the additional tuning nozzle that adds variety.     
My winner: EW300     

●Inawaken Dawn Ms (~$50) - Despite different driver configurations, these two graph very similarly. I'd say the Dawn is a bit more energetic and fun, whereas the EW300 is slightly warmer. The Dawn also features just a single DD to the tribrid configuration of the EW300. The Dawn has a better stock cable and tip selection, and I do like the resin shell, aesthetics, and design more too. The fit and insertion depth of the Dawn are also better for my ears. The EW300 has better detail retrieval and resolution, but the Dawn has a bigger soundstage, better imaging, layering, and cohesion, and is more musical to my ears. The bass responses are very similar, but the Dawn has a slightly deeper and bolder sub-bass response, while the EW300 has a punchier, more full mid-bass. In the midrange, vocals are a bit more forward and full-bodied with better note weight and better timbre on the Dawn. But guitar strums sound a bit clearer and are more resolving on the EW300. The Dawn has a bit of extra treble energy, and snares, in particular, are more impactful. It's slightly more incisive with a bit more bite to it, but it doesn't suffer the same thinness as I found on the EW300. These two IEMs are indeed more alike than they are different. It's hard to see why any collection would need both, so it comes down to preference. Is the addition of an extra tuning nozzle worth the added cost? For me, that's a no because I've tried the gold nozzle and it's not a tuning I like, nor would I choose to use it. For me, this one is easy: get the cheaper and, in my opinion, better-looking Dawn unless you want to invest a bit more for the extra tuning nozzle, metal shell, or the DSP option of the EW300.     
My winner: Dawn     

●Simgot EW200 (~$40) - This should be an apt comparison since the 300 is supposed to be a direct upgrade over the 200, and they are part of the same EW product line. Besides the driver configuration (tribrid vs. DD), these two are nearly identical in build. The shell shape, size, weight, fit, and build quality are all pretty much the same. The accessories are also nearly identical, but the EW300 comes with a case. The EW200 definitely has a brighter tuning and thinner note weight, whereas the EW300 sounds fuller and warmer with less top-end extension and air. The bass of the EW300 digs deeper with more sub-bass rumble and impact, but it is cleaner on the EW200. The vocals are slightly more recessed on the EW200, but other midrange instruments such as guitars are slightly more prominent and have a more natural tone. The treble is definitely brighter, more energetic, and more prominently featured with the EW200, and it can be fatiguing at higher volumes. The technicalities are actually very close, and I can't really discern a significant difference between them, which is honestly a point in favor of the EW200 since it's the less expensive set. Also, because it uses just a single DD, it has a more coherent profile and cleaner transients to my ear. Again, this one comes down to preference and the type of tuning you are seeking. Although I don’t particularly prefer the brighter, more energetic EW200, it is honestly the better IEM in my opinion. It can be found at about half the price of the EW300 and yet it competes in technicalities and has better timbre and a more cohesive sound overall. If the treble is a bit too harsh, adding some nozzle filters or changing tips may be helpful, which is really my biggest complaint with the EW200.     
My winner: EW200     

In conclusion:     
It seems Simgot is listening, at least a little, to its consumer base and has finally offered a tweaked version of its house tuning with an infusion of warmth. The EW300 deviates a bit from the brand's slightly brighter and analytical roots, which is a breath of fresh air for me. Offering two distinctly different tuning nozzles is also a great incentive for new customers looking for variety. Unfortunately, I could not find a way to gel with or even tolerate the gold nozzle's tuning for some reason, but the silver one still makes this IEM worthwhile in and of itself. With the silver nozzle, the EW300 offers a warm tonality and a more musical, laid-back experience but still with decent technicalities. My biggest complaint is with the implementation of the tribrid driver configuration, where the tuning doesn't always have a cohesive flow and can sometimes come across as disjointed and incoherent. The resolution, layering, and separation could also be improved. I do wish the cable and tip selection were a bit better, but those seem to be the standard Simgot affair at this point. Another choice that I found puzzling was offering three different models of the EW300 with subtle differences. Simgot should have seriously considered releasing just a single shell design in the matte black colorway and then offered a choice of a 3.5 or DSP cable upon purchase. This would have simplified the entire product line and made it easier on consumers. While I personally don't feel that the EW300 is a direct upgrade over the EW200, as the latter is still very impressive for its price and even competes well against more expensive IEMs in the budget tier, I do think this newest release is an overall enjoyable experience. This one makes for a pretty good all-rounder and everyday carry option. The EW300 is an excellent choice for both devoted Simgot enthusiasts and newcomers who favor a warm and bass-driven sound profile."

Everyone assumes that this means you will have 8/16/24% DMG buff active from this set, on all characters, at all times.

Here's the problem: When you swap into character A, the buff is refreshed to 15 seconds. Let's say that after 8 seconds you swap to character B, now character B has 15 seconds on the buff, while character A has only 7 seconds remaining on their buff. So you have to swap back within 7 seconds, or the stacks are reset to zero.

You would have to play perfectly, and quick assist at least every 7.5 seconds, or the stacks will start falling off.

If you use Astra's ultimate and do chain attacks, this means that the stacks fall off too, since chain attacks arent quick assists.

If you don't have Astra's wengine to provide you extra energy, even if you have slot 6 disk drive with Energy Regen, and a 2-piece drive disk bonus that gives 20% Energy Regen, you will only get enough energy to Quick Assist every ~8-9 seconds, which again means it's impossible to stay at 3 stacks.

It's like... this set is incredibly niche and specific, only Astra can really use it, but even Astra can't keep the buff active properly because you will run into one of these 3 problems, one or the other, all the time"
Reposting here so Amazon gets the point:  all your AI and you still can’t correctly deliver a package,amazonprime,1i9t5kl,2025-01-25 13:15:58,61,0.72,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonprime/comments/1i9t5kl/reposting_here_so_amazon_gets_the_point_all_your/,Paladin3475,,"I tried to resolve this privately but maybe the power of social media might get you to listen.  Here is what happens - you misdelivered a package and dropped the ball on fixing it.

Earlier this week your deliver (I call them yours because their EV had Amazon in the side) delivered a package.  We were expecting a package and so no big deal.  However when my underaged daughter opened it up (she was expecting something), lo and behold it was a phallic motorized device. Definitely not something for a tween.

Look I am as sex positive and really don’t care what people are into but I go to the app and wanted to report a misdelivery.  And because they took a pic of my package being delivered to the wrong house it said it was delivered.  There was literally no option to say “it was delivered to the wrong address.”  I called customer disservice and your professional script readers wouldn’t deviate off script.  So we went to find the driver who skipped out of the neighborhood.

Then the classic “well your daughter can keep it” took me over the edge.  Please explain to me why I would give a tween something sexual?  I mean seriously??????

So at this point I went home and looked at the picture and found it on my neighbors porch about a block away. I rang their doorbell but then didn’t answer.  All the while I have Amazon Customer Disservice on the phone.  So I waited till the neighbor showed up as I could here then in their house.  As a bonus they didn’t speak English and I didn’t speak their language.  So after a game of charades we swapped packages after she said “no” to my package.

Now that I know more about my neighbors and their sex life than I ever wanted too, this could have been easier avoided.

First, add a dang “this is not my house” option.  That ticked me off.  This could alert the delivery driver of a misdelivery and they can immediately fix it.  Second could use AI and immediately flag it was not my door.  I have grey bricks and this was red bricks.  So was not me.  Third, flag items as “sensitive”. In other words, make sure you don’t deliver a dang phallic shaped vibrator to someone when the items are a tween like item also being delivered in the area.

Of all these the option of “not my address” and the AI phot verification to let the driver review and confirm the address is accurate I think could be done quickly or accurately.

But in the end - thanks for delivering a foot long double headed penis shaped vibrator to my 12 year old daughter.  Stay classy Amazon!"

Consoles or computers were bought to compliment the TV you already owned but now someone will buy a new TV to get the best out of a console.

When i say 'the beginning' i can only talk about my own experiences with video gaming. At 45 years old, and one of a dying breed (almost quite literally) i think I'm somewhat an advocate of the past when it comes to our beloved hobby.

Our interest was born in the mid/late 80s, parents were being drilled with the prospect and eventuality that computers were going to be a staple in their kids lives but along with this came a hefty pricetag that my folks couldn't afford, however we had a family friend who was willing to trade a Commodore 64 (breadbin) for all of our now unwanted Lego.
My bro and i had moved onto G.I Joes and Transformers and now our eyes were set on gaming even though the Commodores purpose as far as our parents were concerned was a tool for learning.

Ofcourse without guidance nor the time it took to teach 'code' without any experience themselves, long story short, our parents conceded to us the use of our new gadget as a means of entertainment, which i think benefited them equally in the end, especially when being grounded was no longer a threat, they knew to throw in the ""no computer"" stipulation so if we wasn't going to be good, we had to be good at it!

By my previous paragraph, if it wasnt already obvious my bro and i fell in love with this new device, and so began our new hobby and all the things that came with it.
Whether that be conversation with like minded friends, the lending and sharing of games and gaming sessions in general or even sometimes tell tale signs of a competitive nature that would later be coined as the ""Console Wars"".
Yes they were a thing even before consoles were the dominant force here in the UK, but that could be a story for another time.

We had just moved to a bigger house and while my brother and i were still young enough to share the same bedroom we set the box room up to play our computer games there, we never had a lot of money as a family so we felt extremely privileged to take advantage of the fact a new colour TV downstairs meant we could keep the 12"" black and white one upstairs for our computer games. 
Mystically, we saw all the colours of the rainbow.
 

PRESS PLAY_

The games were predominantly on cassette tapes, so you would be required to enter a command using the keyboard before pressing ""PLAY"" on the cassette player, I've recently found that a harder thing to explain to people than it once was, as the younger generation have no comprehension of what playing music from a cassette tape is like.
It wasnt automatic like it is the modern age, cartridges and CD's or digital software is ready to go, plug and play if you like but back then we had to tell the C64 what we were doing, almost like asking for permission to use it which sounds ridiculous but less so if you're familiar with the term ""SYNTAX ERROR"".
That was basically you being told you're not allowed to play until you've done your chores, it seemed.

Regardless of this, just because you've pressed 'PLAY' that didnt mean you were ready for any such thing.


NOW LOADING_

Yeh this one has made a comeback, many will be familiar with waiting a few short moments before they can carry on where they left off (we'll get to that later) but when i was a kid? Loading times seemed to last an eternity, even more so for a child whose perception of time was stretched.
A 'quick blast while you wait' didn't exist, more like 'wait a while for a quick blast' as games were considerably shorter many moons ago. (More on that later too)
I think a special mention needs to go out to all the games out there that decided not to load afterall, but there wasn't always a sign the load sequence had failed, the TV told you it was loading, the cassette counter would carry on ticking over and although the noises coming from the TV would worry you now, it was a good sign in those days!
The game could fail like this multiple times before deciding you were finally worthy of it.
Maybe it was sick of you literally winding it up, so now it was our turn to be wound up!
At times you may have a larger game, more recently some may remember having to swap out discs to continue playing, in a scenario like this we would have to turn over the cassette tape, rewind it and press play on the analogue tape deck while another portion of the game loaded.
As long as the game appeared to be loading ok, this wasn't a big deal, you were just happy it was working.

However we were blessed in these 'simpler' more complicated times..


PRESS STOP!_

Quite often as your game was loading you would be serenaded with the somewhat sophisticated sound of 'basic' chip tunes, accompanying an image slowly generated akin to a printer creating an picture on your TV usually of the title card while you waited.
If you were lucky there was sometimes a mini game to play thrown in to keep the boredom at bay, i believe it was Ghostbusters that had Space Invaders available during the loading sequence, it didn't take an 80's child genius to know this minigame was better than the title game and upon pressing 'STOP' you would discover that this little gem was still completely playable while abruptly aborting the title game with no remorse. 
It's MY hobby..
These little gameplay 'demos' were few and far between though, and im not sure there was ever any mention of them in the manual, just a free surprise game, no hype.

Additionally, as great as the music could be from these machines we also had to endure quite crass sound effects, not to mention a thing called 'digitised speech' which were very short bursts of a sampled voice effect that probably used up way too much data than it was worth and sounded a lot like a plastic bag being turned inside out, if you could 'see' digitised speech, television static would be the visual equivalent.
But somehow we still understood it, and the implications of hearing any kind of human voice in a video game was mind-blowing having the capability of raising a review score on the basis of technical prowess alone.
All of this was very much of its time and carried the weight of belonging to a single generation in an era that would only have been accepted by the 80's child.
Our immediate ancestors were the living stereotype this industry was once synonymous with and now ashamed of.
We were neither nerds nor jocks, neither were we noobs or hardcore gamers, we were the center of attention and so was our hobby, we adopted eachother and built the very foundation that would go on to rule the entertainment world, and even as 7 year old kids, we knew it would.
The fine line between complex technical wizardry and a child's play thing had truly been blurred.


ALWAYS READ THE MANUAL_

Stuff that! As a 7 year old boy I've waited a good fraction of my life waiting for this game to load so i can play it, and also as a 7 year old boy i think i already know it all!
But we're all well aware about the lack of manuals in video game boxes these days and some of us being fonder of them than others.
As an older kid, buying a brand new video game or even renting one from the stores would have you poring over the manual on the walk back home, we'll never forget the smell of a fresh instruction booklet and we'll forever be thankful to the universe for never raining on this journey home, like, ever.


HIT FIRE!_

Yes, 'hit fire' indeed.
Translated from Ye Olde Book of Bytes this simply means 'Press Start'.
Ofcourse there were no 'start' buttons on your joystick, just a single button replicated numerous times across your means of control with sometimes one of the buttons being a dummy for aesthetic purposes but usually all placed in symmetry meaning whether you were left or right handed you had a fair crack of the whip, was this a thoughtful inclusion? We will never know, there is a modern day equivalent in the Wiimote, but again im thinking this benefit was purely by default.

Anyway! Finally, this is the first chance to use the controller as up until this point it has been redundant and i swear pratting about with it any sooner sometimes interferred with the loading and could cause the game to crash (a paranoid fantasy that has stuck with me to this day) once this was suspected, we would stick the joystick waaay over there until it was necessary to hold it.
When your game was ready to play you'd sit holding your joystick at the base or stuck it to the table via its four suction caps on the underside, gripping the stick and trigger buttons like an ace fighter pilot.
In practice it was always more comfortable to use the base buttons as opposed to pulling the trigger button, but boy how i so wished that was different back then.
We couldn't enjoy ourselves too much however, i lost count the amount of times my dad would have to disassemble the joystick and solder together the little metal pins or connectors that maintained movement of your sprite.
At some point we did discover that the controller ports on the C64 were the same as Sega consoles and those pads worked fine, yes this was a day and age where proprietary compatibility was only a problem when somebody made it one!


THE GAMES_

We were peers. The industry was around the same age as its demographic and just like a kid seeking acceptance our games strived for validation.
The technology was in its infancy by todays standards but the understanding of what could be considered cool or adult orientated was always there, so we were lured in the same as anyone would be today. 

Robocop by Ocean hit the mark for us as we had seen the movie before we hit double digits and it blew our minds, the game resembled it as best as it could and we wasn't naive to the facts but its all we had, hell it was all there was! 
If only it was as good as the Data East arcade game, but once again i suppose that's a story for another time.
It was one of the games that could've done with a modern day patch or update as a later level was so buggy it was practically impossible to beat, thanks to Youtube i was pleasantly surprised to discover later on in life that every single copy of the game was broken. 
And thats the way it was, no patches, no dlc, no tweets and no means of immediate action to complain about it, an old-fashioned case of 'shut up n put up'.

There was no such thing as saving your progress, granted the games were considerably shorter but the idea of playing a game to progress was a different task all together as each time you turned on your system you would start from scratch, turning off your system may aswell have been a factory reset.
This meant that you would get good, a common phrase thrown about to cheaply now but bares no comparison to titles of yesteryear that required a perfect run start to finish to complete a game.
The predetermined algorithm in which enemies attack, levels scroll and items appeared left little margin for error as you remembered more patterns than your grandma could knit.
I'm not sure exactly when passwords became a thing but the idea of using a 34 digit code to jump to the last level always felt uninspired to me.


'POKES' AND CHEATS_

As old as gaming itself discovering a way to enter a cheat code while the game was paused or during a specific point at the title screen would allow you make the game easier.
I don't recall any 'options' in earlier games, no easy setting or a way to increase your lives but you may have been lucky enough to hear of a 'poke' that would help drastically change your performance ingame. 
To be honest, to see the game bend to your will with these newly found powers was something to behold, it felt like you were breaking the law with zero repercussions, you could be invincible, invisible or float over entire levels, i think the modern day equivalent to these would be considered mods, something the PC community would know all about.
At a later stage a way to cheat became a commodity as various companies would produce peripherals designed to aid you do this very thing, but paying to cheat at the cost of a game wasn't an option for me, nor did i care to spoil the design of the games i loved so much, i suppose in essence there is similarities with these devices and today's format of 'pay to win'.


PHYSICAL INTERNET MONTHLY = 75P_

The games weren't the only thing our hobby was built on. 
Each month various magazines were published dedicated to computer games with various features still covered today by other means whether they be reviews, tips, game maps, interviews, a letters page, computer game related artwork and ofcourse, adverts...
This was our way of gathering information, you wasn't drip fed news on a daily basis on command, we had to anticipate the next issue of our chosen magazine released monthly but if you couldn't afford to you'd borrow your friends copy. 
To put this in perspective, imagine only being able to check the Internet for limited gaming news 12 time's per year, no matter how cheap.
Sometimes there were demo cassettes on the front cover at no extra cost, they just wanted you to buy their publication.
At times like these you would've thought there were no such thing as leaks, but i can think of one example where somebody messed up big time! On the 'B side' of a demo cassette freebie somebody had released an entire copy of their next AAA release without realising, i wish i could remember the game and magazine in question (I'm going to say Indiana Jones?) I think that may have even sank the studio but my memory fails me this time. 
There was nothing quite like the news of an upgrade splashed across the cover of your newest issue, once again the rain holding fire as we made that trek home.

I glad we had the rawness of imperfection, there was so much room for improvement, the Atari ST and Amiga were living proof of it. 
That was to be our next step...


PRESS START!_

But it was never to be, as the dawn of the console had crept upon us. 
A machine created soley for the purpose of playing video games, there was no keyboard, no budget games, no freebies, no loading times, more power, more expense, more quality, more action!

We knew it was coming but it happened so fast...
Even when our perception of time was so stretched...
One evening we turned off our computer not realising it was for the last time. 
We were so busy saying hello to a new wave of fun we didnt even look back to wave goodbye. 
We literally traded our past lives for a new one, ignorant to the fact it was the end of an era. 
Unfortunately, unlike the counter on that hearing aid beige tape deck bless it, you can't just press 'REWIND' and watch the numbers dial back.

I liken this to all the new residential estates being put up around our once rural area, we'd play on the building sites and praise having something to do other than hiking through cowpat ridden fields, playing 'kick the can' or 'Run-outs' and picking wild blackberries for Mum. 
Was it all a dream?


GAMEOVER_

There would eventually come a time when our games wouldn't get chewed up (another saying some younger people wouldn't understand) and the blowing into a cartridge ceased.
But will we one day sooner than we'd like to, perhaps be reminiscing of wiping the smears from a disc or checkin for scratches to reassure ourselves the game was fine only to realise that the simplest and most logical explanation must be that the universe has come to collect the dues it saved all those years ago for a rainy day?

I want to camp!,TyrannyGame,1i9s0f1,2025-01-25 12:26:23,9,0.8,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TyrannyGame/comments/1i9s0f1/i_want_to_camp/,Magmas,Discussion,"I feel like this game would really benefit from a proper camping mechanic. Maybe I'm just spoiled by BG3, but it feels like it would really help the game to have a mobile base, rather than just the Spires. Really, it only needs one map with a few tents and your allies hanging around. I have two reasons for this.

Firstly, flavour. I want to be able to stop and talk to my allies, instead of just bringing stuff up in the middle of a random map. This particularly stands out for when you're learning magic sigils from the likes of Lantry or Eb. The game states that you're stood there for *hours* practicing and training, which feels weird when you're in some sort of active combat zone or whatever. On top of that, it would just be nice to have a more casual place to discuss things with your allies and break up the movements a bit more.

Secondly, lack of backtracking. I like switching up my party for different scenarios, but that means crawling all the way back to the Spire to pick up an ally and leave again. I get that we can't just quick swap whenever we feel like it, but being able to change your comp while camping would be nice. 

It just feels like the only real downtime you get in the game is standing on the top of a tower, which isn't exactly a comfortable spot for conversing."
"Astra provides ~24% less +DMG than you think, and it's because Astral Voice is the weirdest Disk Drive set we've gotten so far and doesn't work as you would think",ZZZ_Official,1i9rdzz,2025-01-25 12:00:03,0,0.42,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZZZ_Official/comments/1i9rdzz/astra_provides_24_less_dmg_than_you_think_and_its/,NoPurple9576,Discussion,"Astral Voice gives a stacking +8% DMG buff each time you quick assist into a character, lasting 15 seconds. Everyone assumes that this means you will have 8/16/24% DMG buff active from this set, on all characters, at all times.

Here's the problem: When you swap into character A, the buff is refreshed to 15 seconds. Let's say that after 8 seconds you swap to character B, now character B has 15 seconds on the buff, while character A has only 7 seconds remaining on their buff. So you have to swap back within 7 seconds, or the stacks are reset to zero.

You would have to play perfectly, and quick assist at least every 7.5 seconds, or the stacks will start falling off.

If you use Astra's ultimate and do chain attacks, this means that the stacks fall off too, since chain attacks arent quick assists.

If you don't have Astra's wengine to provide you extra energy, even if you have slot 6 disk drive with Energy Regen, and a 2-piece drive disk bonus that gives 20% Energy Regen, you will only get enough energy to Quick Assist every ~8-9 seconds, which again means it's impossible to stay at 3 stacks.

It's like... this set is incredibly niche and specific, only Astra can really use it, but even Astra can't keep the buff active properly because you will run into one of these 3 problems, one or the other, all the time"
Another Winter vs All Season vs Summer vs Second Set Debate,tires,1i9rbv3,2025-01-25 11:57:31,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/tires/comments/1i9rbv3/another_winter_vs_all_season_vs_summer_vs_second/,bonanzaguy,,"Hey all, looking for some advice because I'm having a bit of a dilemma. I recently picked up an Audi S3 with 19"" wheels on summer tires (Potenza S005). I live in the DC area where winters get decently cold and the occassional snow.

I'm aware that summer tires start to get hard and perform poorly under around 45F and are unsafe to drive in snowy conditions, and so decided to get a second set of wheels. After a bit of research online, a common sentiment was that if you're going to pick up a second set of wheels, you may as well go all in on summers/winters. As such, my original plan was to order a second set of 18"" wheels and put some winter tires on them. I put in the order in early December but they've been backordered and still haven't arrived.

During that time I've been second guessing myself and still don't know what to do. As I've continued to read and research, I feel like winter tires are overkill for my situation. Yes it snows occassionally here, but it's usually cleaned up within a day or two such that I'm never really driving on snowy roads. And yes it gets cold, but usually not much below freezing. I've seen a ton of comments saying that winter tires are not just for snow but also for cold temperatures, but I've also seen conflicting information that all seasons or even summers can be just as good if not better than winters in cold but DRY conditions. (Obviously winters are uncontested for snowy/icy conditions). More importantly, we also get random days in the 50s or 60s during winter months, and online consensus is that winters will wear out very quickly or become unsafe above 45F. Given that, dedicated winter tires don't feel like the right choice for me.

So that has me debating whether I should pick up a set of all seasons instead, which leads me to a bunch more questions. If I do, should I go with a more performance all season like a PS4 AS or Potenza Sport AS, or something that is ""better"" rated for winter conditions like a Bridgestone Weatherpeak. There are just so many options, and tire compounds seem to be constantly improving that figuring out proper differences is proving to be difficult.

And this also raises another question of if I go with a more performance oriented all season like a Potenza Sport AS, does it even make sense to have two sets of wheels in that scenario? Are summer performance tires going to be noticeably different? FWIW I do plan on doing a few days of autocross here and there, but I'm not a dedicated track junky (yet?).

Should I keep the order and get some all seasons for the winter months and use the summers when it's warm? Should I try to cancel the order and just swap to all seasons year round? Do you think winters are actually worth it even with no snow?"

E-SIMs - A Cost-effective and extremely easy way to stay connected while travelling!,TravelProperly,1i9qz37,2025-01-25 11:41:57,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelProperly/comments/1i9qz37/esims_a_costeffective_and_extremely_easy_way_to/,Fluffy_Future_7500,General,"**Hello World!** 

I recently discovered [Saily eSIM](https://go.saily.site/aff_c?offer_id=101&aff_id=6962), and it’s been a total game changer for traveling. Whether you’re heading to Europe for a weekend or flying further afield, eSIMs are the ultimate hassle-free way to stay connected—and [Saily](https://go.saily.site/aff_c?offer_id=101&aff_id=6962) is one of the best options I’ve found.

For those who might not know, an **eSIM** is a digital SIM card that’s built into your phone. Instead of swapping physical SIMs or relying on expensive roaming packages, you can download a profile via QR code and activate it in minutes.

# Why [Saily eSIM](https://go.saily.site/aff_c?offer_id=101&aff_id=6962) Stands Out

https://preview.redd.it/jwi073jh46fe1.png?width=1738&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc0a20b582dfeb063ec076c9722b024f6473777f

**Affordable Roaming-Free Plans:**  
One of the biggest pains of traveling is dealing with roaming charges. With [Saily](https://go.saily.site/aff_c?offer_id=101&aff_id=6962), you can get:

* Europe Plans: 5GB for just £10.50 (valid for 30 days). Perfect for a long weekend or a quick getaway.
* Global Plans: If you’re traveling further, Saily offers global coverage with plans starting at $5 for 3GB. These are ideal for staying connected across multiple countries.

Compare this to my UK carrier’s £5/day EU roaming fee, which would’ve cost me £35 for a week in Spain! With Saily, I paid a fraction of that and had more data to use.

These are rough cost prices - which I am totalling up to be more expensive. A 30 day 5GB Thailand 🇹🇭 data plan for example cost us $7.

**Instant Setup—Anywhere**:  
Forget queuing at foreign mobile shops or trying to decipher another country’s SIM options. [Saily](https://go.saily.site/aff_c?offer_id=101&aff_id=6962) sends you a QR code immediately after purchase, which you scan to activate your plan. It worked perfectly for me while sitting in the airport lounge, so I was connected as soon as I landed.

**Flexibility for Multi-Country Trips**:  
If you’re visiting several countries, [Saily](https://go.saily.site/aff_c?offer_id=101&aff_id=6962) has regional and global plans that save you from the headache of buying separate SIMs. For instance, their Europe-wide plans cover over 30 countries, so you’re set for everything from city breaks in Paris to beach days in Greece.

**Reliable Coverage**:  
[Saily](https://go.saily.site/aff_c?offer_id=101&aff_id=6962) partners with top-tier networks, so I never had to worry about dropped connections or slow speeds, even in more remote areas. It’s been as reliable as my main UK provider, if not better in some cases.

# Why It’s a No-Brainer for Travellers

eSIMs, especially[ Saily](https://go.saily.site/aff_c?offer_id=101&aff_id=6962), remove so much of the stress and cost of staying connected while traveling:

* No expensive roaming fees.
* No fumbling with physical SIM cards.
* No long contracts—you pay for what you need.

Whether you’re a frequent flyer or just planning a holiday, [Saily](https://go.saily.site/aff_c?offer_id=101&aff_id=6962) makes it ridiculously easy to stay online without spending a fortune. Plus, if you’re travelling with family or friends, you can all grab separate plans without worrying about overages or sharing data.

I’ve got a 55gal setup currently running on a Fluval C4 Power Filter. I got this for my son and I to have as a hobby. Currently we’ve got nothing but various forms of tetras and have had the tank running for over a year now. Water tests (albeit VERY sporadically) have always been pretty good. I do battle the constant regrowth of green algae on the inside of the tank, rocks, and any other items in there, but it never led to green or cloudy water.  Before setting this up, I decided I was going to go all plastic and just gravel rocks to “keep it as low maintenance as possible.” It wasn’t until I had it cycled and stocked that I started really reading into the hobby. I learned that live plants will actually assist with my problems. I tried adding live plants in, but honestly, they didn’t take very well and it’s most likely bc I didn’t have a proper substrate in.

So, here is where I am currently….

I have a new Fluval 307 canister filter arriving today with an in-line UVC clarifier. I’m opting for the 307 to air with the speed of more frequent water changes as I am crazy busy with work travel and kids activities.

I’ve debated whether I should completely start over (ie all new substrate, adding live plants, etc). Or, just keeping all of the fake plants and just be on top of the water changes more than I have.

1) if I start over and add different substrate and live plants, I assume I’ll need to put the current stock of fish in a separate tank w my current filter and then get the 55gal planted and start cycling with the new canister filter. Any recs on plants that are low maintenance would be appreciated. I like the tropical river looks with a mix of larger smooth rocks and wild growing plants.

2) if I stay fake and just switch the filter, my concern is that the current gravel in there has the green algae all over it, so it seems like an endless battle and will be quick to return. I was planning to cycle both filters on there at the same time for a few weeks before fully switching over to the 307 canister 100%. Is there any hope that the more frequent H2O changes, and the in-line clapper and possibly some bottom dwelling algae eaters would slowly rid me of the existing green algae? Again, it’s not in the water itself, but on the surface of everything. If you don’t think it will, should I take the fish out while I completely swap out the gravel? And let the new filter cycle on its own while they’re in a separate tank with the existing C4?

Well, that turned into a lot longer than I thought. If you made it this far, bless you!

Thanks!

"[M4A] (A Playing as multiple F) (Always Open) Huge Idea Drop: Harem-Themed Anime & Fandom RP Prompts Packed with Story, Action, and Just the Right Amount of Smut! (Anime, Rule 34. Fandoms, Games.)",harrypotterrp,1i9p8ah,2025-01-25 10:24:19,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotterrp/comments/1i9p8ah/m4a_a_playing_as_multiple_f_always_open_huge_idea/,septimusrp,,"18+ for smut themes.

Hey there! I’m Septimus (M) And it’s nice to meet you!

Today I’m coming forward with the desire to RP as an OC in OC x OC or OC x CC harem based prompts.(I’m greedy, I know but what’s RP without wish fulfilment?)

For my replies I only write in first person and the length of my replies vary from a singular paragraph to a few solid ones depending on how much is given, and how much is going on in a scene.

I figured I’d put a fair warning here that if you reply with low detail, I won’t be rping with you. I’m not looking for a few words as a response. While that might be your thing, that's fine and power to you! It’s just not mine.

I’m someone who likes a nice balance of build-up and story to go along with the smut. I’m not the biggest fan of constant sex, or sex that starts within one or two replies. I also like cute dates and moments, and love to type out action driven moments.

What I look for in a partner:

Third Person responses (Unless you're playing a “main” OC among the harem. Swapping between first person for each character in a harem situation puts too much stress on my tiny brain.)

Don’t take control of my character at any point. Self explanatory but if you write that he does something or has a reaction to something I didn’t write myself it’s majorly off putting and a major red flag for me.

Active: I totally understand that life may not give us time for our hobbies, this is mainly aimed towards the fellas at the back who only are able to write once a week.Sadly for me I finid it kills momentum. I personally try to get at the very least 1 reply out a day, though more is preferred if we both have the time! :)

Communicative: It kinda links in with the other but if you're not feeling the RP or you're busy. Please just let me know, I’m happy to wait for a reply so long as I have a heads up! Also we don’t both need to be online to RP I generally go off the idea that we both reply whenever we’re able to and the other will get to it once we’re up for it/online.

Please for the love of god don’t spam me every 5 mins. I get that you can get excited, and I do too! But sometimes it just comes across as extremely pushy. I’m not ignoring you, I’ll get to you ASAP, promise! Sending roleplay ideas/questions is totally fine!

Detailed responses: Anything just around a paragraph (4+ sentences though it depends on the RP AND my response.) is enough, but more is always very much appreciated.

I don’t do group RPS and I don’t play as female characters.

Now to get into the meat and potatoes, I’ll post my kinks and limits. There’s a lot there and not all of them will be applicable to the starters. Aside from Harems. Those are compulsory.

=====

Kinks:

Harems – (Which doesn’t mean playing a bunch of characters at once. If you prefer to play 1 character per scene that’s fine, though the minimum amount of overall characters I’ll take in a harem/RP would be 4 though more is heavily preferred! This kink is currently compulsory for all my rps)

Outercourse (Which is stuff like titjobs, thigh jobs, grinding, hot dogging, that kinda thing), Risky/public spaces. (Places you can get caught but don’t. Toilet stalls, changing booths, that kinda thing), Facials, Freckles (Face and body), Big, nicely shaped bums (Especially if they jiggle… just an overall fan of the jiggle if I’m honest), Creampies, Cum on tits/body, big cumshots, thigh high socks, shower/water sex (places like pools, showers, hot tubs that kinda things, and a Mutual desire for sex. I also like pubic hair as long as it’s not overly bushy, trimmed/slightly bushy is where it’s at. :). I’m also into the rougher stuff. Things like Anal, rough sex. Choking, Spanking all that as well!

Limits:

Pregnacy, which also includes lactation (Hard limit, sorry), Vomit, Piss, Blood, toilet stuff, knife/gunplay, noncon, Gangbangs (reverse gangbangs with females is fine), non hetero pairings, Rimming/pegging, cartoonishly large proportions, NTR, (There could be more that I haven’t thought of, if you’re unsure feel free to ask)

There could be more that I might be into, that hasn’t been listed so feel free to ask about it and we can work something out. And without further ado let’s head straight into it.

=====

I’ve made an easy access list for you to read through to see if anything piques your interest before you have to scroll through this abundant list.

Of course, due to reddit’s character limits I’ll just be posting a few of the starters below, so you can get a handle on my writing, any other ideas you might be interested in feel free to shoot me a PM and I can send those to you!

Idea 1: My Harem (Hero) Academia.

(So for this one, my character will be a transfer into class 1-A. From Shiketsu. His power is that of Persuasion. With the power he’s able to convince someone to do something as if it’s their own free will. That being said he’s rather hesitant to use it on other people and due to the stigma around his quirk he’s been seen as an outcast and a freak and has been constantly harassed due to the nature of his quirk.)

(The idea I have for this RP is that the girls of class 1-A will help him come out of his shell and accept that his quirk isn’t the villainous thing that other people have led him on to be. This is more of a “Love Route” though I suppose a more selfish route is also available! Also if you wanted to branch out to internships with heroes like Mirko and Mt Lady that’s available too! It’s currently set after the training camp arc and will continue from there.)

Starter: It was a day which started like most others in Class 1-A. The students got ready in the dorms and headed to class to chat among themselves while they waited for Aizawa to enter. However, unlike most days there seemed to be an extra desk placed in the room. The seat caused some confusion which didn’t last long as the first bell rang and Aizawa entered the room.

“Morning everyone.” He stated in his mainly bored and sleepy tone which seemed to sound like he was stifling a yawn. “Today we’ve got a new student transferring in from another school. He’s from Shiketsu, some of you may recognize the name since it’s got the same level of prestige as U.A. but regardless, make sure he feels welcome.” He said, pointing a sweeping stare at everyone and finally resting on the problem student of the U.A class Bakugo.

With that he fell silent and I felt it was my cue to enter. Swallowing a little at the nerves I steeled them quickly and entered. Nervously my blue eyes sweep over some of the familiar faces in the room. Many of the students had standout performances in the UA sports festival and as well in the news reports about the villain attack on the training camp.

I had a lot to live up to if I wanted to join these legends in training but regardless, I was determined to do just that. Breathing a little and shifting my auburn hair from my eyes I smiled the best I could. “My name is Schwarzer, Chris Schwarzer. It’s a pleasure to meet you all.” I say bowing to the class.

Satisfied with the introduction, Aizawa nodded to the spare seat in the room. Taking that as an order I nodded back and headed over to my seat sitting down and getting my books out. Curiously I turned to the seat next to me noticing one of the girls in the class and gave her a slight smile as Aizawa began his lesson.

=====

Idea 2: One Piece.

(I’m not so sure how I want to approach this one, however I’ll jump in and give it a go. Much like the MHA starter this character will have the power of Persuasion. Having eaten the Persua-Persua fruit. I’m thinking for now either he makes a crew with characters from the story, or he joins the Straw Hats and goes on adventures with them. (Obviously this doesn’t have to be canon and completely made up as we go.) Either way I’m super keen on this since I love One Piece to death. I also have a list of potential crewmates I can send!)

Starter: Adventure! Freedom, Treasure and Booze! These were all the things a pirate needed in life. And exactly what every pirate set out to obtain. Two years after the events at Marineford where Strawhat Luffy himself took on the government with an army behind him, and the Whitebeard Pirates at his side in order to rescue his brother… And two years since I felt inspired enough in his absence to set forth on my own.

I gathered up a strong crew and made a name for myself. My alias, Silver Tongue Schwarzer, is a nice title which rolled off the tongue. I had no issues amassing a sizable bounty at 90 million berries. While it wasn’t as grand as other pirates, the world government saw enough of a threat in my power to provide a bounty that large. Of course, had my powers been widely known it’d have rocketed higher.

So then why was I now sitting at a bar on the Sabaody Archipelago, alone and staring into the amber liquid of booze in a mug? It was simple. Mutiny. Those whom I had trusted most among my crew turned on a dime and after reaching the Archipelago they threw me overboard and turned around. To where I didn’t know and quite frankly after their betrayal I didn’t care.

“Damn them. Damn them all.” I muttered under my breath cursing as I downed the rest of my contents. “Another!” I called out to the barkeep who approached to fill my mug.

“You’re looking a little rough there, are you sure you need another?” The bartender asked as he took the mug from me.

“I don’t have anything else to do. I don’t even know what else to do with myself.” I responded grumpily. “Just fill it up.” I demanded.

“Right.” The bartender responded as he filled it with more of the alcoholic amber liquid and slid It in front of me.

=====

Idea 3: Jujutsu Kaisen.

(So I’ve completed the anime and read up to date for Jujutsu Kaisen (No spoilers) and I really enjoy it. I’ve got an interesting idea for a curse ability, my character’s power is basically he emits smells. Mostly for support, however his ability is so strong that he’s unable to turn it off. He always smells great to anyone who smells him, almost like a pheromone. And to cursed spirits it’s a lure. Because of this he wears a lot to cover up his body so he doesn’t let out as much of his scent. He’s in Jujutsu Tech now because he wanted to learn how to use different smells for different things and one day he hopes to be able to control his powers. :) )

Starter: The sounds of fabric ripping filled the air followed up by my swearing as my scent was released into the air. This was bad. My scent leaking out meant that every cursed spirit within a few blocks would barrel down on my position.

It seemed the time for subtlety was out the window and as such I pulled the large hood back and unzipped my jacket which was usually zipped all the way up to cover half my face. Underneath my body was bare. I mean wearing a large coat all day with extra layers was just asking to make me sweat like a pig. I tossed my coat to the side and threw my gloves along with it.

My cursed energy seeped out increasing the potency and the range of my smell. My eyes narrowed at the grade three curse spirit which was staring me down. “Sleep.” I say clapping my hands together as my scent changed to that of a sleep agent.

The cursed spirit swayed a little before collapsing to the ground. My smell even caused me to sway a little as I breathed it in, however I had built up an immunity to it. The sounds of more cursed spirits barreling down on my position could be heard all around me as I grabbed my coat and my gloves and made a run for it into a nearby building. I didn’t have time to finish the spirit off before I ran into the building. This would be a better place for me to fight them given that my smell could permeate more efficiently than it would in an open space.

I wasn’t sure if help was going to come, but for now I’d operate under the assumption that it wasn't.

=====

Idea 7: Fairy Tail

(I love the girls from Fairy Tail, I find them all super hot! As for my character he’s going to be an OC Slayer called a Demon Slayer. My character will use fire based magic to increase his speed and force of attacks. I have some ideas for some missions, but we can keep it pretty casual :))

Starter: Another day in magnolia and another party being held at the large guild building at the centre of town. A large-scale job had just finished with some of the senior ranking wizards. and even though I wasn’t part of that mission, instead being on my own D-Rank job I joined in on the celebrations.

I had only been part of the guild for a couple of weeks and so far, it’s not been as exciting as I’d hoped, although I figured that it’d pick up once I proved myself. I was drinking by myself when I was approached by Makarov. He was wearing an eccentric looking orange outfit. “Schwarzer my boy!” He said as he patted me on the shoulder. “How are you fitting in?” He questioned.

“Fine sir! Everyone has been very welcoming.” I say to him in response.

“Glad to hear it! You’ve been doing a good job, although I’d like to see you do more.” The male said. “So I’ve arranged a partner for you on your next job, that way you can take on something more challenging, what do you say?” He questioned.

“Yes of course!” I say eagerly as a smile spread across my face.

“Great!” He said cheerfully. “I’ll introduce you to who you’ll be working with.” He said as he stood from his spot and led the way over to a female clearing his throat loud enough to get their attention.

=====

Idea 9: Bleach

(So a new human soul reaper makes it into the soul society. His power isn’t great to begin with simply being enough to take out the average hollow. And with the resurgence of the hollow threat the Soul Society has offered to give him a substitute badge to take out those hollows deemed too small for the soul society to handle. Maybe he’s paired up with someone or someone like Orihime steps in to help him grow.)

Starter: Another boring day at university followed by a night of boring patrols. With all the big hollows being taken care of by “Full-fledged” Soul reapers it didn’t leave me with much opportunity to train against bigger enemies.

At least that’s what I thought originally. A few blocks from me there was a rift which opened up and the pure spiritual pressure that came from the hollow that stepped out of it was enough to make me feel as though gravity itself was pushing against me.

It was hard to breathe and even harder to stand as my hand clutched my blade in my left hand tightly. I shook my head as I heard the loud roar of the large breast and could even see its towering form from my position.

It was nothing close to a menos, but it was enough to tower over a three-story building for sure. “Damn.” I hissed to myself as I knew there were no soul reapers around at this stage. With a threat this big I was sure they’d come, but until then it was up to me to buy some time and make sure no humans or souls were consumed.

Pushing myself forward I reached the park that the Hollow had appeared in. Thankfully the park was deserted at this time of night.

When he saw me, the hollow let out a low growl. “You don’t smell like much, but you’ll do as a snack.” The hollow commented as it charged forward.

“Just evade, buy time.” I commented to myself as I began to leap around the battlefield looking a bit like and feeling like an idiot.

The hollow toyed with me a little while enjoying the chase before it seemed to get bored. Just when I was thinking I was fast enough to keep avoiding it the creature’s mouth opened and its forked tongue shot out at me with faster speed than I was anticipating. I raised my blade to defend myself but it was a feeble attempt and I knew it wouldn’t be enough.

=====

Idea 21: Final Fantasy VII. (Others Can be done! :))

(So this one will be set in the world of Final Fantasy VII, however if you’re looking to do others, I’m more than happy to do so! I’m familiar with them all. Mainly 7 and 14 But this one will be focused on FF VII, since Jessie, Yuffie, Tifa and Aerith are best girls! If you wanted to mix this up with FF 14 and have them transported to Eorzea we can make something up!)

Starter: Midgar. Easy place to find work given you were capable enough. There were a lot of monsters prowling the highways between sectors and a lot of people willing to pay mercenaries to get the job done.

“Hiyah!” I called out as I cleaved my blade through the neck of a monster severing its head from the rest of its body and slaying it instantly. It was a tough fight but I overcame it. I panted a little as my muscles relaxed and I slid my blade back into its sheath. The job I was on was simple, kill the beast and return its head to a barkeep in sector 5. I scooped the beast’s head up into a burlap sack and hoisted it over my shoulder before I headed back to the bar.

By this point I was a rather well-known mercenary. Jobs exterminating monsters were easy to come by and easy enough to complete. Plus, the payout paid for my room and for most of my meals. As I entered the bar I headed up to the counter and placed the bloody burlap sack on the counter. “Got it done.” I say to the barkeep.

The older man, his hair and beard white with age frowned a little and looked at the bag. The blood splatter on the counter… which he had just cleaned was enough to let him know that I was serious and he placed the sack full of gil on the counter.

“Thanks.” I say as I picked up the purse. It was lighter than I expected, but even if it was short I wasn’t about to start an argument. In return to my manners, I got a short grunt back.

“Don’tcha forget about disposin of that thing, I ain’t want it.” He said waving his hand dismissively towards the bag.

“Right, I’ll get on that.” I say as I grabbed the sack.

“An there was a woman lookin for you.” He stated. “Said she’d be waitin for you in buildin next to the orphanage.” He stated.

“Right, thanks.” I said to the man and headed out, disposing quickly of the severed head in the sack before I headed up to the building in question. I frowned as I peered inside. My eyes looking around for any sign of someone out of place. It did seem a little crowded in the building after all. I was about to announce myself when I felt a hand tap my shoulder and turned to see who it was.

=====

Idea 26: Cyberfuck(punk) 2077.

(Recently I’ve gotten back into Cyberpunk and after watching the anime which broke my heart, I think the world will be an interesting one to RP in, I don’t have too much in mind in terms of story, but I figured we’d have a bunch of mini adventures across the setting of Night City, maybe a gang being built up or something. As for the starter, I’ve left it open ended enough for you to come in any direction, wanna be one of the Tyger Claws? The victim they had cornered? Another Edgerunner? Even a NCPD Officer, Civilian, all of it is open up! :) )

Starter: “Good morning Night City! Another busy night has passed in our beautiful little hamlet! Several corpos have turned up dead, Overdose? Or Corporate espionage? You tell me! Let’s not forget the gang wars breaking out! Everyone wants their own slice of heaven, but it seems they’re more than willing to get their hands dirty for it!”

The sound of the news broadcast was drowned out by heavy rain as I walked the neon soaked streets of Night City. Boots splashing through neon soaked puddles.This night I had found myself walking beats I’d long since abandoned, what seemed to be a lifetime ago, a different version of myself.

I shook it off, I needed air, and the streets of Watson’s back alleys, a charming concoction of half trash fire, half combat zone filled my nostrils. The pistol on my belt made for an easy-access defence while the old NCPD badge hung heavy in my pocket.

I should have turned it in when I quit, but I figured there was still a use for it here and there. I shook it off and soon the yell of a voice cutting through the heavy rain. I pressed my back against concrete, my eyes seeing four distinct shapes standing around a fifth.

Tiger Claws by the look of them, their ink and chromed out mantis blades had some poor person surrounded, the way their taunts echoed off the alley walls made it clear this wasn’t just a polite meet up.

“It’s not my problem.” I muttered to myself as I took a step back before finding a sigh escaped my lips.

Old habits die hard.

I stepped out, my boots splashing a puddle as I took a breath. “Four against one hardly seems fair.” I called out. The gangers turned to face me, their neon-lit tattoos glowed in the rain making them stand out even more.

“What the hell do you want Choom? You lost?” Came the growling voice of one of the men.

“I’m just out for a stroll, but why don’t we all just take a second to get along hm?” I offered.

The leader of this merry group sneered, his cyberoptics narrowing. “You think this is funny? You just signed your death warrant, you gonk.” He snarled.

I shook my head as my hand reached down to my pistol, pulling the piece and cocking it in one fluid motion. “Time to see if I’ve still got it.” I say bringing the weapon up and firing off a shot. As the first shot rang out the alley lit up like a war zone.

=====

Idea 30: Harry Potter.

(So to keep this one interesting I’m thinking of having it set in an AU where Voldemort and Harry don’t exist. However, there are still dark wizards who are part of a cult around. Defs looking for a Hermionie, Luna or Ginny, you could even have other known people as teachers or students for this one! Ocs are of course welcome too! I do have a reference list for this one as well. Feel free to ask me for that!)

Starter: Another year at Hogwarts, the last for some; and another year of learning was right around the corner. Although times were not peaceful in the wizarding world. Aurors who were the police of the magical world were going missing or showing up dead.

The ministry not wanting to make a panic kept it fairly under wraps, however some of the families have come forward with the information and rumours abound about what was really happening.

Stepping off the train I sighed a little rubbing my temple where a headache had begun to set in. During the train ride here, I found myself stuck next to a boy who wouldn’t stop going on about the rumours and conspiracy theories.

Glad to be off the train I looked around for a minute lost as to where I needed to go. “I know it’s around here somewhere.” I commented, although my sense of direction was always off. Usually I followed everyone else. But this time it seemed I was one of the last ones off the train.

=====

Idea 35: Multi Fandom/Dimensional hopping.

(So like a lot of these fandoms and can’t pick one? This is the RP for you! Basically my character will be given an ability/item that’ll allow him to jump to different realms and gain basic powers for each realm.It’s not super fleshed out but it’s a good starting point!)

Starter: My life was pretty usual, and nothing if not stable. Every day I got up, went to college, did my classes then trained afterwards. I wanted to be the best player on my volleyball team so I worked hard for it. Just like anyone else it wasn't like I had larger than life aspirations, I was happy to keep my head down and work hard.

Though a day soon came that changed everything. I home for my birthday when a strange package had arrived, a gauntlet of some kind, I figured it was a strange device that an aunt or uncle had given me thinking I could play games on it. I didn't think too much of it until later that night where, alone in my room I decided to see if I could test it out.

The glove seemed to form to my hand size, fitting perfectly, and before I knew it a sudden bright light shone from it. When my vision had cleared from the blinding light I realized I wasn't anywhere I recognized, and the gauntlet had changed shape and form.

(Leaving it super open ended to let you pick where we start/who we start with. It's pretty basic so far but gets us stuck in! )

=====

Those are by no means all of the starters and given the size limits of post limits I figured I’d narrow it down to some of the ones I like the most! Feel free to ask me about any of the others! Thanks so much for reading this and I hope to hear from some of you soon! :)"

I have a computer desk job which I can't leave. I swap locations frequently depending on the contract I'm working. I unfortunately don't have a ton of control right now in which contracts I take / which locations I work. 

I've had good success with pain mitigation with a combination of standing desk, macropad, and mouse. However, not every location I'm at has a standing desk and I can't use my macropad for all contracts. 

I have a few questions I'm seeking advice about: 

1) any ideas for how to quickly judge if a sitting desk is set up correctly? I seem to have difficulty judging 90 degrees for my elbows and don't notice until I'm actively in pain. 

2) anyone use a split keyboard and have advice for a similar question? How do I know I'm set up correctly? I feel like tenting is out because I tried it and it made it worse. Also where does one put the mouse? I feel like to the side or in the middle are both bad. I try to use keyboard shortcuts as much as possible.

The Greatest Trick Ever Sold Chapter 12: Ritual Killing,HFY,1i9oqop,2025-01-25 10:01:13,1,0.66,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i9oqop/the_greatest_trick_ever_sold_chapter_12_ritual/,Gabmaister,OC,"**CHAPTER TWELVE**

**Ritual Killing**

 

Escaping the company of armed guards escorting Bram’s auto-carriage back to Bastille would have been a difficult feat if Rowan wasn’t with him. True to her monicker of the Rebel Trickster, the redheaded maiden who’d swapped out her commoner’s clothes for her teal gambeson conjured a fog so thick around the auto-carriage that the escorts following it began bumping into each other.

“Watch where you’re riding!” warned a soldier with a gruff voice.

“You’re the one who’s out of formation!” complained another.

“I cannot bloody see in this damned fog!” yelled a voice that sounded a lot like Vicomte Henry’s.

Coupled with the dark clouds that appeared overhead to cover the twin moons in the sky, visibility on the dirt road had become too horrible for the retinue’s journey to continue. 

“Hold — hold!” Ser Anthony commanded. “Stay in formation around the prince’s auto-carriage. We’ll wait until the fog clears!”

“B-But, Ser,” came an urgent, anxious voice, “the auto-carriage…it’s not here!”

The barking of panicked orders and the anxious neighing of harts filled the night, but neither Bram nor Rowan would hear them. With the aid of her trickery, they’d slipped away into the darkness and took the auto-carriage back down the path they’d come from.

“The fog,” Bram fidgeted in his seat because he couldn’t help feeling uncomfortable on this rough road they were on, “why did the sorcerers not notice you conjuring it?”

“I didn’t use sorcery to summon the fog,” Rowan replied.

One of Bram’s eyebrows twitched upward. “How did you manage it then?”

Rowan stared out the window. It would be a while later before she would reply. “‘Tis an ability restricted to me and those like me…”

There was a finality in her tone that kept Bram from prying further, although he took note of her strange and sudden melancholy, storing it in his mind for future inspection.

They continued in silence, their secret journey taking them along a mountain path just beyond the town of Reise. This path climbed up to the side of the jagged mountain that Bram had scaled to reach the cursed cave where their fates had become intertwined.

Later, when the auto-carriage pulled to a stop, a panel in the upholstered wall slid open.

“We’ve arrived, Your Highness,” said the soldier who’d driven the auto-carriage.

Bram couldn’t help noticing how the soldier’s eyes were glassy and unfocused. It was a telltale sign of sorcery at work.

“Thank you,” he replied.

Once Bram and Rowan exited the auto-carriage, the trickster made its driver move over to the interior and then placed the soldier in a deep sleep that would keep him there while the pair went about their business. 

“That’s convenient…but how long will your spell last?” Bram asked as he shut the carriage door on the soldier who was snoring loudly in his seat.

“Long enough for us to finish our task,” Rowan answered, a slight frown on her lips. “Are you certain you would rather not use him?”

Her crimson-eyed gaze remained fixed on the carriage door.

“We will need blood for the summoning. As much as a grown man can carry,” she insisted. 

“You said it needn’t be human blood.” Bram’s gaze drifted to the tall oaks on the ridge above. “There are plenty of fel beasts who live on Sundermount. Shouldn’t their blood suffice?”

“The blood of beasts is acceptable,” Rowan relented, but couldn’t help adding, “though human blood’s more potent in empowering sorcery, and thus more preferable.”  

“Then use mine,” Bram replied in earnest.

He might be willing to sacrifice the lives of others for their great undertaking, but not if it wasn’t necessary. The prince wasn’t like the other royals and high nobles who treated the lives of commoners so carelessly. Indeed, he could never think lowly of them since being around commoners had helped to keep Bram sane when he was younger.  

As he thought this, he recalled some of those commoners who’d saved him from a youth filled with loneliness.

There was Aimé, one of the palace’s assistant cooks who’d always prepared Bram’s favorite treats after every time he’d been bullied by his siblings. The cook himself had been tormented by the palace’s head chef, one of noble blood who’d loved to berate his underling for lackluster dishes he’d prepared himself.

There was the vivacious Willow of the Soft Touch, a lady of the Pillow Court who’d taught Bram the delights of the flesh. Whenever they’d finished their passionate embrace, she’d always offered him a kind ear and listened to his troubles, and she’d never asked him to pay extra.

There were also the Lost Boys and Girls, a gang of children from the capital’s slums who’d treated Bram as one of their own. They’d played with him when no nobles would, teaching him Hide and Seek and other games of chance and intrigue that eventually led Bram to the Delightful Troupe’s door. 

Most recently, Bram had a wonderful time camping outdoors while in the company of the Mighty Greenwood Gang who’d show him more grace and respect than any noble had.

Such experiences with commoners have reinforced Bram’s belief that one’s blood didn’t determine their worth. Not really.

“It’s what we do that matters,” Bram whispered, though Rowan heard him.

She watched him ready their climbing gear with a thoughtful smile as if she’d listened to his thoughts. It was a smile she’d never shown before that vanished by the time Bram looked up from his work. 

“Is there something on my face?”

Rowan shook her head.

“Nothing,” she flashed him her usual impish grin, “though we won’t be needing the rope.”

“I’ve tasted your unrivaled strength myself, but trust me,” Bram raised the roll of hemp rope to her eye level while recalling how he wished he had one during his previous climb, “this will save—”

It happened so quickly that Bram’s jaw barely had time to drop before Rowan was standing beside him and her arms wrapped around his waist.

“Clench your jaw,” she instructed.

A moment later, the ground was gone, and they were soaring up into the sky at a speed that was faster even than a magic arrow in flight. The harsh winds buffeted Bram’s face while the chill of the mountain air seeped into his bones. Surprisingly, the prince didn’t mind these inconveniences. Bram discovered that he enjoyed flying even if it was only done with Rowan’s aid. It was a short maiden voyage for him though, and soon enough, they touched down on the familiar rocky ground of the ledge that led to the cursed cave.

“That was…brilliant!” Bram said, breathless.

His face shone with delight. It was a delight that was quick to pass, however, for Bram felt sudden nausea overwhelm him, and then he was on his knees and puking what was left of luncheon onto the rocky ground.

“Wait for me here,” Rowan suggested, “and try not to get any of it on you.”

The sound of his retching continued. It was the only response Rowan would get before she disappeared into the air.

When the trickster returned a short while later, the prince was sitting on an outcropping of rock and feeling much better, though his face was still pale from the ordeal. It grew paler still once he noticed what Rowan dropped on the ground between them. 

“Is that…”

Even curled and unconscious, the shaggy beast with russet fur was noticeably large. Eight feet tall and six hundred pounds by Bram’s reckoning.

“…A red grizzly?”

Of the many beasts that called Sundermount home, the red grizzly was known to be one of the most savage. It was a well-known maneater that attacked people who stumbled upon it without any provocation. Hunting a red grizzly in so short a time was a feat that even Ser Anthony couldn’t have easily managed, and his seneschal was once a celebrated champion of the Sovereign-guard.

“Impressed?” Rowan asked.

“Undoubtedly,” Bram nodded. “Is it…dead?”

The trickster shook her head.

“The beast’s blood must be warm for the ritual.” Rowan eyed the muscles peeking through Bram’s loose shirt. “Can you carry it into the cave?”

“Of course,” Bram answered confidently. “I need to be of some use in this quest.”

The prince walked over to the red grizzly whose thick, furry chest was rising and falling in slow, labored breaths.

“You’ve put it to sleep?” Bram asked.

“There was no need for sorcery”—Rowan raised her hand and then clenched it—“when a single fist was enough to shake its consciousness loose.”  

“Ah, yes, I see it now.”

A tiny bit of blood coated the red grizzly’s snout. It seemed to have lost several of its fangs too. There was, however, a bigger issue besides wondering whether the beast would wake up during transit.

Bram’s gaze drifted to the nearby hole in the wall with its familiar warning carved over it. “It won’t fit through the narrow passage leading into the dungeon…”

“That won’t be a problem,” Rowan assured him.

She strode over to the hole in the cliff wall whose edges revealed the tell-tale signs of an entryway hewn from rock eroded by time.

“Mae popeth yn newid mewn amser…”

It was the beginning of a complicated incantation spoken in a language that sounded as alien to Bram as the words he’d learned from his visions. When her voice reached a crescendo, Rowan waved her hands over the entrance, and with crimson sparks flaring from the tips of her fingers, a great rumbling began. With that rumbling came violent change—the rock surrounding the entrance broke apart, folding into itself like the cogs of a great machine, and then reforming into new shapes with perfect detailing. 

“Sorcery to manipulate matter at will,” Bram whispered in awe.

At its core, sorcery was the art of altering one’s surroundings to meet the caster’s demands, but the kind of magic Rowan displayed now was leagues beyond what even the grand sorcerers of the Sovereign’s court could conjure.

“I’ve read about this — the long-lost sorcery of the Transmutation Arts,” Bram recalled the name of the ancient magic whose knowledge had been lost to the Imperium, its fleeting trail remembered only in the most obscure of books. “Incredible, I’ve become witness to history’s hand reaching out to the present from a forgotten past.”

Before Bram’s very eyes, the cave opening achieved a new form; a projecting doorway of massive stone with an arched ceiling raised high by the twin pillars standing to either side of the now expanded entrance. Both pillars had been carved into the shape of a warrior woman who wore a gambeson and sweeping dress like the ones Rowan was wearing, with both statues carrying swords aloft in their hands.

This new entryway had been made with such intricate detailing that Bram couldn’t help admiring Rowan’s artistry.

“You are breathtaking…” He hadn’t meant to say it out loud, but the words spilled from his lips unbidden.

Bram coughed embarrassedly.

“I only meant that your talent is impressive,” he finished lamely.

To witness such compelling sorcery strengthened his belief in the trickster’s power to see his wish fulfilled, though he couldn’t express his thoughts properly in words. It wasn’t necessary, however, for Rowan glanced back at Bram with understanding.

“‘Tis not yet the time to be amazed, My Prince,” she said, her impish smile returning. “Come. There’s more sorcery to be done before this night is over.”     

“O-Of course,” he agreed.

Bram gathered all the strength in his body to help him lift the red grizzly’s lower half onto his shoulders. This was a great feat of strength that few could manage without the aid of sorcery, but the prince had honed his body to such extremes that half-carrying, half-dragging a beast weighing more than five hundred pounds seemed a doable challenge.

“Are you certain you don’t require my help?” Rowan asked.

“This is…nothing…” Bram’s arms shook from the strain, but he didn’t complain. “Lead the…way.”

Later, much later thanks to the slow pace at which Bram carried his burden—insistent as he was not to share the load with Rowan who he believed had done too much already—the trickster and the prince returned to the place where their acquaintanceship first bloomed.

As Rowan crossed the threshold of the long-forgotten temple, light flared from the ancient sunstones hanging at intervals around the spiral chamber. When Bram followed her, a new notification appeared in the air.

\[ALERT! You have entered the dungeon \[Innocence Lost\]. With your body now suited to receiving the system’s boons, the reward for being the first person to visit the dungeon is now applied. For the remaining four days, the experience rate and item-drop rate are doubled while exploring the dungeon.\]

“There’s not much point”—Bram dropped his heavy burden on the stone floor—“to this boon now.”

Instant relief flooded his body, and he began to stretch his tired limbs.

“I’d rather have one that will give me tangible benefits.”

A notification popped up as if it had been waiting for his complaint.

\[CONGRATULATIONS! You’ve pushed yourself to new heights, increasing your Strength \[+1\] and Willpower \[+1\].\]

“Finally.” Bram had been wondering how he was supposed to grow if he couldn’t earn experience normally, but it seemed the Loom took his efforts into account as well. Unfortunately, this also meant the difficulty of his training needed to be increased for Bram to benefit from this reward system. “Fuck…”  

The dungeon of ‘Innocence Lost’ was a temple-like structure with a weathered vaulted ceiling. The spiral markings engraved on its stone floor and the small round crevice at its center where the centerpiece of this chamber. There, in the very spot where she was freed from perdition, the rebel trickster awaited her liberator.

“Do you—”

Before Bram could finish his sentence, a spear formed of blood shot out of Rowan’s palm to pierce the hide of the unconscious red grizzly.

The pain woke the beast, and with a mighty roar, the red grizzly rose to its haunches and hurled a thick, shaggy arm at Bram who stood closest. Claws the size of scullery knives reached out for his face, but Bram weaved out of its way and then slid back to avoid the other arm from hitting his side.

“Why wake it up now?!” he complained.

The red grizzly roared. Its bellow shook the ground, ripping across the chamber like a peel of thunder. It lunged for Bram once more, but a second ‘Blood Spear’ struck the beast’s shoulder before it could take another swipe at him.

“Sorcery as demanding as a summoning ritual requires a violent ending,” Rowan explained. “Now, focus!”

“A little warning next time…” Taking advantage of its momentary daze, Bram drew his sword from its sheath and then sent its blade swiftly across the red grizzly’s outstretched neck. “…would be appreciated!”

Blood gushed out of the savage cut he dealt the red grizzly, but the beast seemed intent not to die alone. It rushed forward with berserker fury and would’ve skewered Bram in the chest with its claws if a third ‘Blood Spear’ hadn’t struck its other shoulder. This caused the beast to stumble right into Bram’s sword which pierced its hide at the last second.

With a final pain-filled roar, the red grizzly crashed onto the floor by the prince’s feet.

Bram was wide-eyed and breathless. “Bloody hell…that was close.”

His hands shook while he retrieved his sword from the chest of the beast that had shown such ferocity that he thought the stories of its savagery seemed modest compared to the real thing. It would’ve killed him if Rowan hadn’t critically wounded it first. It certainly killed Bram’s sword. Its blade, which was already cracked from the earlier fight, broke off as he pulled at the sword’s hilt.

“So much for bastion-forged steel,” Bram sighed.

\[CONGRATULATIONS! You are the first user to slay a \[Red Grizzly\]! The first kill bonus will be added to EXP earned.\]

\[You earned 120 EXP.\]

\[ALERT! Dungeon bonus is applied. 240 EXP earned.\]

\[ALERT! \[Administrator Lv. 1\] prevents you from earning job EXP.\]

Bram sighed as he returned his broken sword to its sheath. “One day you’ll be nice to me and I’ll be pleasantly surprised.”  

His gaze drifted back to the beast’s corpse.

*It’s different…*

The weight of slaying a beast weighed much less on his mind than the killing of other men. Although perhaps he was simply getting used to the act of murder. It was a thought that made Bram’s shoulders shake though he tried hard not to let guilt ruin the moment.

With the red grizzly’s death, the blood pooling beneath it was carried away by the grooves in the stone floor. A line of red was formed, spiraling ever closer to the round crevice at the heart of the chamber.

“‘Tis time,” Rowan insisted. “I shall begin.”

The trickster who’d been standing beside the hole raised her feet one at a time and then folded herself into the lotus position. She sat cross-legged in the air as if there was an invisible chair underneath her.

“Come to me, My Prince.”

An exhausted Bram walked over to her while taking care not to disturb the line of blood flowing on the floor.  

“Take my hands,” Rowan instructed. “The physical connection will strengthen our mental bond, allowing me to peer into the other world of your visions.”

When Bram placed his hands over hers, he asked. “And what am I to do?”

“Think of a mortal you believe we’ll need most to create…” Rowan’s face turned contemplative. “…What did you call it again?”

“A virtual reality game,” Bram answered.

“Yes. That.” Her fingers tightened around his. “Think of the otherworlder who can help build the illusion of your virtual reality game…and I shall drag this unfortunate soul into Aarde…”

My 1989 Toyota FJ62 Project/Story,LandCruisers,1i9miih,2025-01-25 08:04:21,44,0.98,5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9miih,FriendlyShredder,,"This was originally my parent’s Toyota that they had purchased back in the early 90’s. My Dad was ecstatic at the time because he had always dreamed of having one and he loved to be outdoors. My mom was pregnant with my brother at the time and it was essentially brand new when they bought it. It’s been in my family ever since. I still have many memories of driving around in this truck, hunting and camping with my Dad while I was growing up or just the quick grocery trip. My brother was the next owner because he started a family of his own during the pandemic, but he didn’t have the Toyota “bug” that my Dad and I share and didn’t put much work into it. Despite this, he really enjoyed his time with it. Eventually he purchased a brand new Ford f150 Lightning and offered to give me the old beast free of charge! Right now it sits essentially bone stock, street tires on the stock 15” rims, mild rust to both rear quarter panels, interior door panels falling apart, missing interior/exterior trim pieces and some leaking fluid from the engine, tranny and transfer case that overall just need maintenance. With some general maintenance I have it running beautifully right now despite a non-operational AC system that needs upgrading to the newer standard. It’s winter right now anyway, and it’s making good heat thankfully. When I originally got the truck I just moved in to my very first home. Almost 4 months in, someone shot out the back hatch glass with a 9mm. It shattered the rear of course but also continued to the front windshield leaving a spider web crack. I still have the bullet. After a 12 hour drive with my Dad to Arizona I found a replacement rear glass from a 89 that was being parted out. I installed that just recently.

I have some lofty goals for this rig; axle swap to Dana 44’s front and rear, bigger 37” tires w/ bead lock, 2” lift minimum or more depending on tire clearances, new exhaust, engine/tranny/transfer case rebuild, full repaint and some off road upgrades like the ARB front bumper + winch, rear tire mount and a sweet modern roof rack. I plan to leave the power train essentially stock (no LS), just an overhaul with plans to mill out the cylinder heads and get it back to stock compression with a mild bump in HP/Torque from the slightly larger pistons that will go in after milling. I am excited for this journey of restoration and I realize how slow of a burn this will be, but I am all here for it. Let me know what you think! Any suggestions?"
Detailed Guide - How I've Been Self Employed for 2 Years Selling Posters,sidehustle,1i9mi9w,2025-01-25 08:03:57,38,0.89,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/sidehustle/comments/1i9mi9w/detailed_guide_how_ive_been_self_employed_for_2/,tommo278,Success Story,"Hey everyone, bit of context before you read through this. I have been selling POD posters full time for over 2 years now. My next venture is that I have started my own Print on Demand company for posters, PrintShrimp. As one way of creating customers for our service, we are teaching people for free how to also sell posters. Here is a guide I have written on how to sell posters on Etsy. Feel free to have a read through and then check out PrintShrimp, hopefully can help some of you guys out (and get us some more customers!)

All of this is also available in video format on our website too, if you prefer to learn that way. Thanks guys! And as some people asked in other subs, no this isn't written with AI 😅 This took a couple of weeks to put together!

Through this guide, we will teach you everything you need to know about starting to sell posters and generate some income. We will also show you why PrintShrimp is the best POD supplier for all of your poster needs. Trust me, you won’t need much convincing. 

**So, why are posters the best product to sell?**

Also, just thought I’d quickly answer the question - ***why posters?*** If you’ve been researching Print on Demand you’ve probably come across the infinite options of t-shirts, mugs, hats, phone cases, and more. All of these are viable options, however we think posters are the perfect place to start. You can always expand into other areas further down the line! So a brief summary of why posters are the perfect product for Print on Demand:

\-They are ***very easy to design***! Posters are a very easy shape to deal with - can’t go wrong with a rectangle. This makes designing products very easy.

\-Similarly to this, ***what you see is what you get*** with a poster. You can literally see your finished product as you design it in either canva or photoshop. With T-Shirts for example, you have to make your design, and then place it on a t-shirt. Then you have to coordinate with your printers the size you would like the design on the tshirt and many other variables like that. There is no messing about with posters - what you see is what you get.

\-***The same high quality, everywhere***. With other products, if you want to reap the benefits of a printing in various countries, you need to ensure each of your global suppliers stocks the same t-shirts, is able to print in the same way, carries the same sizes etc. Again with posters you avoid all of this hassle- your products will come out the same, no matter which of our global locations are used.

\-They have a ***very favorable profit margin***. As you will see later, the cost price of posters is very low. And people are prepared to pay quite a lot for a decent bit of wall art! I have tried out other products, and the profit margin combined with the order quantity of posters makes them my most profitable product, every single time. Using PrintShrimp, you can be sure to enjoy profits of anywhere between £6 - £40 pure profit per sale. 

\-They are one of the ***easiest to print white label***. This makes them perfect for Print on Demand. Your posters are simply put in a tube, and off they go. There are no extras you need to faff around with, compared to the extra elements other products come with, such as clothing labels on t-shirts. 

**Picking your poster niche**

So, you are ready to start selling posters. Great! Now, the blessing and curse with selling posters is that there are ***infinite possibilities*** regarding what you can sell. So, it can easily be quite overwhelming at first. 

The first thing I would recommend doing is having a ***look at what others are selling***. Etsy is a wonderful place for this (and will likely be a key part of your poster selling journey). So, log on to Etsy and simply type in ‘poster’ in the search bar. Get ready to write a massive list of the broad categories and type of posters that people are selling. 

If you do not have more than 50 categories written down by the end, you are doing something wrong. There are seriously an infinite amount of posters! For example, here are some popular ones to get you started:

Star sign posters, Kitchen posters, World map posters, Custom Dog Portrait posters, Music posters, Movie posters, Fine art posters, Skiing posters, Girl Power posters and Football posters. 

Now, you have a huge list of potential products to sell. What next? There are a few important things you need to bear in mind when picking your niche:

\-**Does this interest me?** 

Don’t make the mistake of going down a niche that didn’t actually interest you just because it would probably be a money maker. Before you know it, what can be a very fun process of making designs can become incredibly \*\*\*monotonous, and feel like a chore\*\*\*. You need to bear in mind that you will be spending a lot of time creating designs - if it is something you are interested in you are much less likely to get burnt out! As well, \*\*\*creativity will flow\*\*\* far better if it is something you are interested in, which at the end of the day will lead to better designs that are more likely to be purchased by customers. 

\-Is this within my design range?

Don’t let this put you off too much. We will go through how to get started on design later on in this guide. However, it is important to note that the plain truth of it is that some niches and designs are a hell of a lot more complicated than others. For example, quote posters can essentially be designed by anyone when you learn about how to put nice fonts together in a good color scheme. On the other hand, some posters you see may have been designed with complex illustrations in a program like Illustrator. To start with, it may be better to pick a niche that seems a bit more simple to get into, as you can always expand your range with other stores further down the line. A good way of evaluating the design complexity is by identifying if this poster is \*\*\*a lot of elements put together\*\*\* or is \*\*\*a lot of elements created by the designer themselves\*\*\*\*\*.\*\* Design can in a lot of cases be like a jigsaw - putting colours, shapes and text together to create an image. This will be a lot easier to start with and can be learnt by anyone, compared to complex drawings and illustrations. 

\-Is this niche subject to copyright issues?

Time to delve deep into good old copyright. Now, when you go through Etsy, you will without a doubt see hundreds of sellers selling music album posters, car posters, movie posters and more. Obviously, these posters contain the property of musicians, companies and more and are therefore copyrighted. The annoying thing is - these are \*\*\*a complete cash cow.\*\*\* If you go down the music poster route, I will honestly be surprised if you \*\*don’t\*\* make thousands. However it is only a matter of time before the copyright strikes start rolling in and you eventually get banned from Etsy. 

So I would highly recommend \*\*\*not making this mistake\*\*\*. Etsy is an incredible platform for selling posters, and it is a hell of a lot easier to make sales on there compared to advertising your own website. And, you \*\*\*only get one chance on Etsy.\*\*\* Once you have been banned once, you are not allowed to sign up again (and they do ID checks - so you won’t be able to rejoin again under your own name). 

So, don’t be shortsighted when it comes to entering Print on Demand. If you keep your designs legitimate, they will last you a lifetime and you will then later be able to crosspost them to other platforms, again without the worry of ever getting shut down. 

**So, how do I actually design posters?**

Now you have an idea of what kind of posters you want to be making, it’s time to get creative and make some designs! Photoshop (and the creative cloud in general) is probably the best for this. However, when starting out it can be a scary investment (it costs about £30 a month unless you can get a student rate!). 

So, while Photoshop is preferable in the long term, when starting out you can learn the ropes of design and get going with Canva. This can be great at the start as they have a load of templates that you can use to get used to designing and experimenting (while it might be tempting to slightly modify these and sell them - this will be quite saturated on places like Etsy so we would recommend doing something new). 

**What size format should I use?**

The best design format to start with is arguably the A sizes - as all the A sizes (A5, A4, A3, A2, A1, A0) are ***scalable***. This means that you can make all of your designs in one size, for example A3, and these designs will be ready to fit to all other A sizes. For example, if you design an A3 poster and someone orders A1, you can just upload this A3 file to PrintShrimp and it will be ready to print.

There is a wide range of other sizes you should consider offering on your shop, especially as these sizes are very popular with the American market. They have a wide range of popular options, which unfortunately aren’t all scalable with each other. This does mean that you will therefore have to make some slight modifications to your design in order to be able to offer them in American sizing, in a few different aspect ratios.

What you can do however is design all of your products in UK sizing, and simply redesign to fit American sizing once you have had an order. Essentially: design in UK sizing, but list in both UK and US sizing. Then when you get a non-A size order, you can quickly redesign it on demand. This means that you don’t have to make a few different versions of each poster when first designing, and can simply do a quick redesign for US sizing when you need to.

Below is PrintShrimps standard size offering. We can also offer any custom sizing too, so please get in touch if you are looking for anything else. With these sizes, your poster orders will be dispatched domestically in whatever country your customer orders from.

**Our recommendations for starting design**

One thing that will not be featured in this guide is a written out explanation or guide on how to design. Honestly, I can’t think of a more boring, or frankly worse, way to learn design. When it comes to getting started, ***experimenting is your best friend!*** Just have a play around and see what you can do. It is a really fun thing to get started with, and the satisfaction of when a poster design comes together is like no other.

A good way to start is honestly by straight up ***copying a poster you see for sale online***. And we don’t mean copying to sell! But just trying to replicate other designs is a great way to get a feel for it and what you can do. We really think you will be surprised at how easy it is to pull together a lot of designs that at first can appear quite complicated!

Your best friend throughout this whole process will be ***google.*** At the start you will not really know how to do anything - but learning how to look into things you want to know about design is all part of the process. At first, it can be quite hard to even know how to search for what you are trying to do, but this will come with time (we promise). Learning ***how to google*** is a skill that you will learn throughout this process. 

Above all, what we think is most important is this golden rule: ***take inspiration but do not steal***. You want to be ***selling similar products in your niche, but not copies***. You need to see what is selling in your niche and get ideas from that, but if you make designs too similar to ones already available, you won’t have much luck. At the end of the day, if two very similar posters are for sale and one shop has 1000 reviews and your newer one has 2, which one is the customer going to buy? You need to make yours offer something different and stand out enough to attract customers.

**Etsy SEO and maximizing your sales**

You may have noticed in this guide we have mentioned Etsy quite a few times! That is because we think it is hands down the best place to ***start selling*** posters. Why? Etsy is a go to place for many looking to decorate their homes and also to buy gifts. It might be tempting to start selling with your own website straight away, however we recommend Etsy as it ***brings the customers to you.*** For example, say you start selling Bathroom Posters. It is going to be a hell of a lot easier to convert sales when you already have customers being shown your page after searching ‘bathroom decor’, compared to advertising your own website. This is especially true as it can be hard to identify your ideal target audience to then advertise to via Meta (Facebook/Instagram) for example. Websites are a great avenue to explore eventually like I now have, but we recommend starting with Etsy and going from there.

**What costs do I need to be aware of?**

So, setting up an Etsy sellers account is currently costs £15. The only other **upfront** cost you will have is the cost of listing a product - this is 20 cents per listing. From then on, every time you make a sale you will be charged a transaction fee of 6.5%, a small payment processing fee, plus another 20 cents for a renewed listing fee. It normally works out to about 10% of each order, a small price to pay for all the benefits Etsy brings. No matter what platform you sell on, you will be faced with some form of transaction fee. Etsy is actually quite reasonable especially as they do not charge you to use their platform on a monthly basis. 

**What do I need to get selling?**

**1. Getting your shop looking pretty**

\-Think of a shop name and design (now you are a professional designer) a logo

\-Design a banner for the top of your shop

\-Add in some about me info/shop announcement

\-I recommend running a sale wherein orders of 3+ items get a 20% of discount. Another big benefit of PrintShrimp is that you receive large discounts when ordering multiple posters. This is great for attracting buyers and larger orders. 

**2. Making your products look attractive**

That is the bulk of the ‘decor’ you will need to do. Next up is ***placing your posters in mock ups!*** As you may notice on Etsy, most shops show their posters framed and hanging on walls. These are 99% of the time not real photos, but digital mock ups. This is where Photoshop comes in really handy, as you can automate this process through a plug in called Bulk Mock Up. If you don’t have photoshop, you can do this on Canva, you will just have to do it manually which can be rather time consuming. 

Now, where can you get the actual Mock Ups? One platform we highly recommend for design in general is platforms like ***Envato Elements***. These are design marketplaces where you have access to millions of design resources that you are ***fully licensed*** to use! 

**3. Titles, tags, and descriptions** 

Now for the slightly more nitty gritty part. You could have the world's most amazing looking poster, however, if you do not get the Etsy SEO right, ***no one is going to see it!*** We will take you through creating a new Etsy listing field by field so you can know how to best list your products. 

The key to Etsy listing optimisation is to ***maximise.*** Literally cram in as many key words as you possibly can! Before you start this process, create a word map of anything you can think of relating to your listing. And come at this from the point of view of, ***if I was looking for a poster like mine, what would I search?***

**Titles**

\-Here you are blessed with 140 characters to title your listing. Essentially, start off with a concise way of properly describing your poster. And then afterwards, add in as many key words as you can! Here is an example of the title of a well selling Skiing poster:

Les Arcs Skiing Poster, Les Arcs Print, Les Alpes, France Ski Poster, Skiing Poster, Snowboarding Poster, Ski Resort Poster Holiday, French

This is 139 characters out of 140 - you should try and maximise this as much as possible! As you can see, this crams in a lot of key words and search terms both related to Skiing as a whole, ***the poster category,*** and then the ***specifics of the poster itself*** (Les Arcs resort in France).

Bear in mind that if you are listing a lot of listings that are of the same theme, you won’t have to spend time creating an entirely new title. For example if your next poster was of a ski resort in Italy, you can copy this one over and just swap out the specifics. For example change “France ski poster” to “Italy ski poster”, change “Les Arcs” to “The Dolomites”, etc. 

**Description**

\-Same logic applies for descriptions - try and cram in as many key words as you can! Here is an example for a Formula One poster:

George Russell, Mercedes Formula One Poster  ***- item specific keywords***

Bright, modern and vibrant poster to liven up your home.  - ***Describes the style of the poster***

All posters are printed on high quality, museum grade 200gsm poster paper. Suitable for framing and frames. - ***Shows the quality of the print. Mentions frames whilst showing it comes unframed***

Experience the thrill of the **racetrack** with this stunning **Formula One** poster. Printed on **high-quality** paper, this **racing car** **wall art print** features a dynamic image of a Formula One car in action, perfect for adding a touch of speed and excitement to any **motorsports room** or **man cave**. Whether you're a die-hard fan or simply appreciate the adrenaline of high-speed **racing**, this poster is sure to impress. Available in a range of sizes, it makes a great addition to your **home or office**, or as a **gift** for a fellow **Formula One enthusiast**. Each poster is **carefully packaged** to ensure **safe delivery**, so you can enjoy your new piece of **art** as soon as possible. - ***A nice bit of text really highlighting a lot of key words such as gift, motorsports, racetrack etc.*** 

You could go further with this too, by adding in extra things related to the poster such as ‘Perfect gift for a Mercedes F1 fan’ etc. 

**Tags**

Now, these are actually probably the ***most important part of your listing***! You get 13 tags (20 character limit for each) and there are essentially search terms that will match your listing with what customers search for when shopping. 

You really need to maximize these - whilst Title and Description play a part, these are the main things that will bring buyers to your listing. Once again, it is important to think about what customers are likely to be searching when looking for a poster similar to yours.

**Life hack alert!** You can actually ***see what tags other sellers are using***. All you need to do is go to a listing similar to yours that is selling well, scroll down and you can actually see them listed out at the bottom of the page! Here is an example of what this may look like:

So, go through a few listings of competitors and make notes on common denominators that you can integrate into your listing.

As you can see here, this seller uses tags such as ‘Birthday Gift’ and ‘Poster Print’. When you first start out, you may be better off ***swapping these out for more listing specific tags***. This seller has been on Etsy for a few years however and has 15,000+ sales, so are more likely to see success from these tags. 

If it’s not clear why, think about it this way. If you searched ‘poster print’ on Etsy today, there will be ***10s of thousands of results***. However, if you searched ‘Russell Mercedes Poster’, you will (as of writing) get ***336 results***. Etsy is far more likely to push your product to the top of the latter tag, against 300 other listings, rather than the top of ‘Poster Print’ where it is incredibly competitive. It is only when you are a more successful shop pulling in a high quantity of orders that these larger and more generic tags will work for you, as Etsy has more trust in your shop and will be more likely to push you to the front. 

**SKUs**

\-One important thing you need to do is add SKUs to all of your products! This is worth doing at the start as it will make your life so much easier when it comes to making sales and using PrintShrimp further down the line. What is an SKU? It is a ‘stock keeping unit’, and is essentially just a product identifier. Your ***SKUs need to match your file name*** that you upload to PrintShrimp. For example, if you made a poster about the eiffel tower, you can literally name the SKU eiffel-tower. There is no need to complicate things! As long as your file name (as in ***the image name of your poster on your computer***) matches your SKU, you will be good to go. 

\-It may be more beneficial to set up a system with unique identifiers, to make organising your files a lot easier further down the line. Say you get to 1000 posters eventually, you’ll want to be able to ***quickly search a code***, and also ensure every ***SKU is always unique***, so you won’t run into accidentally using the same SKU twice further down the line. For example, you can set it up so at the start of each file name, you have \[unique id\]\[info\], so your files will look like - 

A1eiffeltower

A2france

And further down the line:

A99aperolspritz

B1potatoart

This not only removes the potential issue of duplicating SKUs accidentally (for example if you made a few posters of the same subject), but also keeps your files well organised. If you need to find a file, you can search your files according to the code, so just by searching ‘a1’ for example, rather than having to trawl through a load of different files until you find the correct one.

\-If your poster has variations, for example color variations, you can set a ***different SKU for each variation***. Just click the little box when setting up variations that says ‘SKUs vary for each (variation)’. So if you have a poster available either in a white or black background, you can name each file, and therefore each SKU, a1eiffel-tower-black and a1eiffel-tower-white for example.

\-The same goes for different sizes. As different American sizes have different aspect ratios, as mentioned above you may have to reformat some posters if you get a sale for one of these sizes. You can then add in the SKU to your listing once you have reformatted your poster. So for example if you sell a 16x20” version of the eiffel tower poster, you can name this file eiffel-tower-white-1620. Whilst this involves a little bit of set up, the time it saves you overall is massive! 

**Variations and Prices**

\-So, when selling posters there is a huge variety of sizes that you can offer, as mentioned previously. Non-negotiable is that you should be offering A5-A1. These will likely be your main sellers! Especially in the UK. It is also a good idea to offer inch sizing to appeal to a global audience (as bear in mind with PrintShrimp you will be able to print in multiple countries around the world!). 

Below is a recommended pricing structure of what to charge on Etsy. Feel free to mess around with these! You may notice on Etsy that many shops charge a whole lot more for sizes such as A1, 24x36” etc. In my experience I prefer charging a lower rate to attract more sales, but there is validity in going for a lower amount of sales with higher profits.

As mentioned above, you can also offer different variations on items - for example different colour schemes on posters. This is always a decent idea (if it suits the design) as it provides the customer with more options, which might help to convert the sale. You can always add this in later however if you want to keep it simple while you start!

**Setting up shipping profiles**

Etsy makes it very easy to set up different shipping rates for different countries. However, luckily with PrintShrimp you can offer free shipping to the majority of the major countries that are active on Etsy! 

Using PrintShrimp means that your production costs are low enough in each domestic market to justify this. If you look on Etsy you can see there are many shops that ***post internationally*** to countries such as the US or Australia. Therefore, they often charge £8-10 in postage, and have a delivery time of 1-2 weeks. This really ***limits their customer base*** to their domestic market. 

Using PrintShrimp avoids this and means you can offer free shipping (as we absorb the shipping cost in our prices) to the major markets of the UK, Australia, and USA (Europe coming soon!). 

We also offer a ***1 day processing time,*** unlike many POD poster suppliers. This means you can set your Etsy processing time to just one day, which combined with our quick shipping, means you will be ***one of the quickest on Etsy*** at sending out orders. This is obviously very attractive for customers, who are often very impatient with wanting their orders! 

**Getting the sales and extra tips**

\-Don’t list an insane amount of listings when you first get started. Etsy will be like ‘hang on a second’ if a brand new shop suddenly has 200 items in the first week. ***Warm up your account***, and take things slow as you get going. We recommend 5 a day for the first week or so, and then you can start uploading more. You don’t want Etsy to flag your account for suspicious bot-like activity when you first get going. 

\-It is very easy to ***copy listings*** when creating a new one. Simply select an old listing and press copy, and then you can just change the listing specific details to create a new one, rather than having to start from scratch. It can feel like a bit of a ball-ache setting up your first ever listing, but from then on you can just copy it over and just change the specifics. 

\-Try and organize your listings into ***sections***! This really helps the customer journey. Sometimes a customer will click onto your shop after seeing one of your listings, so it really helps if they can easily navigate your shop for what they are looking for.

So, you now have a fully fledged Etsy shop. Well done! Time to start making £3,000 a month straight away right? Not quite. Please bear in mind, ***patience is key*** when starting out. If you started doing this because you are £10,000 in debt to the Albanian mafia and need to pay it off next week, you have come into this in the wrong frame of mind. If you have however started this to slowly build up a side hustle which hopefully one day become your full time gig, then winner winner chicken dinner. 

***Starting out on Etsy isn’t always easy.*** It takes time for your shop to build up trust! As I’ve said before, a buyer is far more likely to purchase from a shop with 1000s of reviews, than a brand new one with 0. But before you know it, you can become one of these shops!

One thing you can do at the very start is to ***encourage your friends and family to buy your posters!*** This is a slightly naughty way of getting a few sales at the start, of course followed by a few glowing 5\* reviews. It really helps to give your shop this little boost at the start, so if this is something you can do then I recommend it. 

Okay, so once you have a fully fledged shop with a decent amount of listings, you might be expecting the sales to start rolling in. And, if you are lucky, they indeed might. However, in my experience, you need to give your listings a little boost. So let us introduce you to:

**The wonderful world of Etsy ads**

Ads!! Oh no, that means money!! We imagine some of you more risk averse people are saying to yourself right now. And yes, it indeed does. But more often than not unfortunately you do ***have to spend money to make money***. 

Fortunately, in my experience anyway, ***Etsy ads do tend to work***. This does however only apply if your products are actually good however, so if you’re back here after paying for ads for 2 months and are losing money at the same rate as your motivation, maybe go back to the start of this guide and pick another niche. 

When you first start out, there are two main strategies. 

**Number 1: The Safer Option**

So, with PrintShrimp, you will essentially be making a minimum of £6 profit per order. With this in mind, I normally start a new shop with a safer strategy of advertising my products with a budget of $3-5 dollars a day. This then means that at the start, you only need to make 1 sale to break even, and anything above that is pure profit! This might not seem like the most dazzling proposition right now, but again please bear in mind that ***growth will be slow at the start.*** This means that you can gradually grow your shop, and therefore the trust that customers have in your shop, over time with a very small risk of ever actually losing money.

**Number 2: The Billy Big Balls Option**

If you were yawning while reading the first option, then this strategy may be for you. This will be better suited to those of you that are a bit more ***risk prone***, and it also helps if you have a bit more ***cash to invest*** at the start. Through this strategy, you can essentially ***pay your way to the top*** of Etsy's rankings. For this, you’ll probably be looking at spending $20 a day on ads. So, this can really add up quickly and is definitely the riskier option. In my experience, the level of sales with this may not always match up to your spend every day. You may find that some days you rake in about 10 sales, and other days only one. But what this does mean is that as your listings get seen and purchased more, they will begin to ***rank higher in Etsy’s organic search rankings***, at a much quicker rate than option one.

This is the beauty of Etsy’s ads. You can pay to boost your products, but then results from this paid promotion ***feed into the organic ranking of your products***. So you may find that you can splash the cash for a while at the start in order to race to the top, and then drop your ad spending later on when your products are already ranking well. 

**Sending your poster orders**

So, you’ve now done the hard bit. You have a running Etsy store, and essentially all you need to now on a daily basis is send out your orders and reply to customer messages! This is where it really becomes ***passive income.*** 

\-Check out the PrintShrimp order portal. Simply sign up, and you can place individual orders through there.

\-Bulk upload: We have an option to bulk upload your Esty orders via csv. 

Seriously, when you are up and running with your first store, it is really as easy as that. 

Once you have your first Etsy store up and running, you can think about expanding. There are many ways to expand your income. You can set up other Etsy stores, as long as the type of posters you are selling varies. You can look into setting up your own Shopify stores, and advertise them through Facebook, Instagram etc.

Through this guide, we will teach you everything you need to know about starting to sell posters and generate some income. We will also show you why PrintShrimp is the best POD supplier for all of your poster needs. Trust me, you won’t need much convincing. "

I have been selling POD posters full time for over 2 years now. My next venture is that I have started my own Print on Demand company for posters, PrintShrimp. As one way of creating customers for our service, we are teaching people for free how to also sell posters. Here is a guide I have written on how to sell posters on Etsy. Feel free to have a read through and then check out PrintShrimp, hopefully can help some of you guys out (and get us some more customers!)

All of this is also available in video format on our website too, if you prefer to learn that way. Thanks guys!

Through this guide, we will teach you everything you need to know about starting to sell posters and generate some income. We will also show you why PrintShrimp is the best POD supplier for all of your poster needs. Trust me, you won’t need much convincing. 

**So, why are posters the best product to sell?**

Also, just thought I’d quickly answer the question - ***why posters?*** If you’ve been researching Print on Demand you’ve probably come across the infinite options of t-shirts, mugs, hats, phone cases, and more. All of these are viable options, however we think posters are the perfect place to start. You can always expand into other areas further down the line! So a brief summary of why posters are the perfect product for Print on Demand:

\-They are ***very easy to design***! Posters are a very easy shape to deal with - can’t go wrong with a rectangle. This makes designing products very easy.

\-Similarly to this, ***what you see is what you get*** with a poster. You can literally see your finished product as you design it in either canva or photoshop. With T-Shirts for example, you have to make your design, and then place it on a t-shirt. Then you have to coordinate with your printers the size you would like the design on the tshirt and many other variables like that. There is no messing about with posters - what you see is what you get.

\-***The same high quality, everywhere***. With other products, if you want to reap the benefits of a printing in various countries, you need to ensure each of your global suppliers stocks the same t-shirts, is able to print in the same way, carries the same sizes etc. Again with posters you avoid all of this hassle- your products will come out the same, no matter which of our global locations are used.

\-They have a ***very favorable profit margin***. As you will see later, the cost price of posters is very low. And people are prepared to pay quite a lot for a decent bit of wall art! I have tried out other products, and the profit margin combined with the order quantity of posters makes them my most profitable product, every single time. Using PrintShrimp, you can be sure to enjoy profits of anywhere between £6 - £40 pure profit per sale. 

\-They are one of the ***easiest to print white label***. This makes them perfect for Print on Demand. Your posters are simply put in a tube, and off they go. There are no extras you need to faff around with, compared to the extra elements other products come with, such as clothing labels on t-shirts. 

**Picking your poster niche**

So, you are ready to start selling posters. Great! Now, the blessing and curse with selling posters is that there are ***infinite possibilities*** regarding what you can sell. So, it can easily be quite overwhelming at first. 

The first thing I would recommend doing is having a ***look at what others are selling***. Etsy is a wonderful place for this (and will likely be a key part of your poster selling journey). So, log on to Etsy and simply type in ‘poster’ in the search bar. Get ready to write a massive list of the broad categories and type of posters that people are selling. 

If you do not have more than 50 categories written down by the end, you are doing something wrong. There are seriously an infinite amount of posters! For example, here are some popular ones to get you started:

Star sign posters, Kitchen posters, World map posters, Custom Dog Portrait posters, Music posters, Movie posters, Fine art posters, Skiing posters, Girl Power posters and Football posters. 

Now, you have a huge list of potential products to sell. What next? There are a few important things you need to bear in mind when picking your niche:

\-**Does this interest me?** 

Don’t make the mistake of going down a niche that didn’t actually interest you just because it would probably be a money maker. Before you know it, what can be a very fun process of making designs can become incredibly \*\*\*monotonous, and feel like a chore\*\*\*. You need to bear in mind that you will be spending a lot of time creating designs - if it is something you are interested in you are much less likely to get burnt out! As well, \*\*\*creativity will flow\*\*\* far better if it is something you are interested in, which at the end of the day will lead to better designs that are more likely to be purchased by customers. 

\-Is this within my design range?

Don’t let this put you off too much. We will go through how to get started on design later on in this guide. However, it is important to note that the plain truth of it is that some niches and designs are a hell of a lot more complicated than others. For example, quote posters can essentially be designed by anyone when you learn about how to put nice fonts together in a good color scheme. On the other hand, some posters you see may have been designed with complex illustrations in a program like Illustrator. To start with, it may be better to pick a niche that seems a bit more simple to get into, as you can always expand your range with other stores further down the line. A good way of evaluating the design complexity is by identifying if this poster is \*\*\*a lot of elements put together\*\*\* or is \*\*\*a lot of elements created by the designer themselves\*\*\*\*\*.\*\* Design can in a lot of cases be like a jigsaw - putting colours, shapes and text together to create an image. This will be a lot easier to start with and can be learnt by anyone, compared to complex drawings and illustrations. 

\-Is this niche subject to copyright issues?

Time to delve deep into good old copyright. Now, when you go through Etsy, you will without a doubt see hundreds of sellers selling music album posters, car posters, movie posters and more. Obviously, these posters contain the property of musicians, companies and more and are therefore copyrighted. The annoying thing is - these are \*\*\*a complete cash cow.\*\*\* If you go down the music poster route, I will honestly be surprised if you \*\*don’t\*\* make thousands. However it is only a matter of time before the copyright strikes start rolling in and you eventually get banned from Etsy. 

So I would highly recommend \*\*\*not making this mistake\*\*\*. Etsy is an incredible platform for selling posters, and it is a hell of a lot easier to make sales on there compared to advertising your own website. And, you \*\*\*only get one chance on Etsy.\*\*\* Once you have been banned once, you are not allowed to sign up again (and they do ID checks - so you won’t be able to rejoin again under your own name). 

So, don’t be shortsighted when it comes to entering Print on Demand. If you keep your designs legitimate, they will last you a lifetime and you will then later be able to crosspost them to other platforms, again without the worry of ever getting shut down. 

**So, how do I actually design posters?**

Now you have an idea of what kind of posters you want to be making, it’s time to get creative and make some designs! Photoshop (and the creative cloud in general) is probably the best for this. However, when starting out it can be a scary investment (it costs about £30 a month unless you can get a student rate!). 

So, while Photoshop is preferable in the long term, when starting out you can learn the ropes of design and get going with Canva. This can be great at the start as they have a load of templates that you can use to get used to designing and experimenting (while it might be tempting to slightly modify these and sell them - this will be quite saturated on places like Etsy so we would recommend doing something new). 

**What size format should I use?**

The best design format to start with is arguably the A sizes - as all the A sizes (A5, A4, A3, A2, A1, A0) are ***scalable***. This means that you can make all of your designs in one size, for example A3, and these designs will be ready to fit to all other A sizes. For example, if you design an A3 poster and someone orders A1, you can just upload this A3 file to PrintShrimp and it will be ready to print.

There is a wide range of other sizes you should consider offering on your shop, especially as these sizes are very popular with the American market. They have a wide range of popular options, which unfortunately aren’t all scalable with each other. This does mean that you will therefore have to make some slight modifications to your design in order to be able to offer them in American sizing, in a few different aspect ratios.

What you can do however is design all of your products in UK sizing, and simply redesign to fit American sizing once you have had an order. Essentially: design in UK sizing, but list in both UK and US sizing. Then when you get a non-A size order, you can quickly redesign it on demand. This means that you don’t have to make a few different versions of each poster when first designing, and can simply do a quick redesign for US sizing when you need to.

Below is PrintShrimps standard size offering. We can also offer any custom sizing too, so please get in touch if you are looking for anything else. With these sizes, your poster orders will be dispatched domestically in whatever country your customer orders from.

**Our recommendations for starting design**

One thing that will not be featured in this guide is a written out explanation or guide on how to design. Honestly, I can’t think of a more boring, or frankly worse, way to learn design. When it comes to getting started, ***experimenting is your best friend!*** Just have a play around and see what you can do. It is a really fun thing to get started with, and the satisfaction of when a poster design comes together is like no other.

A good way to start is honestly by straight up ***copying a poster you see for sale online***. And we don’t mean copying to sell! But just trying to replicate other designs is a great way to get a feel for it and what you can do. We really think you will be surprised at how easy it is to pull together a lot of designs that at first can appear quite complicated!

Your best friend throughout this whole process will be ***google.*** At the start you will not really know how to do anything - but learning how to look into things you want to know about design is all part of the process. At first, it can be quite hard to even know how to search for what you are trying to do, but this will come with time (we promise). Learning ***how to google*** is a skill that you will learn throughout this process. 

Above all, what we think is most important is this golden rule: ***take inspiration but do not steal***. You want to be ***selling similar products in your niche, but not copies***. You need to see what is selling in your niche and get ideas from that, but if you make designs too similar to ones already available, you won’t have much luck. At the end of the day, if two very similar posters are for sale and one shop has 1000 reviews and your newer one has 2, which one is the customer going to buy? You need to make yours offer something different and stand out enough to attract customers.

**Etsy SEO and maximizing your sales**

You may have noticed in this guide we have mentioned Etsy quite a few times! That is because we think it is hands down the best place to ***start selling*** posters. Why? Etsy is a go to place for many looking to decorate their homes and also to buy gifts. It might be tempting to start selling with your own website straight away, however we recommend Etsy as it ***brings the customers to you.*** For example, say you start selling Bathroom Posters. It is going to be a hell of a lot easier to convert sales when you already have customers being shown your page after searching ‘bathroom decor’, compared to advertising your own website. This is especially true as it can be hard to identify your ideal target audience to then advertise to via Meta (Facebook/Instagram) for example. Websites are a great avenue to explore eventually like I now have, but we recommend starting with Etsy and going from there.

**What costs do I need to be aware of?**

So, setting up an Etsy sellers account is currently costs £15. The only other **upfront** cost you will have is the cost of listing a product - this is 20 cents per listing. From then on, every time you make a sale you will be charged a transaction fee of 6.5%, a small payment processing fee, plus another 20 cents for a renewed listing fee. It normally works out to about 10% of each order, a small price to pay for all the benefits Etsy brings. No matter what platform you sell on, you will be faced with some form of transaction fee. Etsy is actually quite reasonable especially as they do not charge you to use their platform on a monthly basis. 

**What do I need to get selling?**

**1. Getting your shop looking pretty**

\-Think of a shop name and design (now you are a professional designer) a logo

\-Design a banner for the top of your shop

\-Add in some about me info/shop announcement

\-I recommend running a sale wherein orders of 3+ items get a 20% of discount. Another big benefit of PrintShrimp is that you receive large discounts when ordering multiple posters. This is great for attracting buyers and larger orders. 

**2. Making your products look attractive**

That is the bulk of the ‘decor’ you will need to do. Next up is ***placing your posters in mock ups!*** As you may notice on Etsy, most shops show their posters framed and hanging on walls. These are 99% of the time not real photos, but digital mock ups. This is where Photoshop comes in really handy, as you can automate this process through a plug in called Bulk Mock Up. If you don’t have photoshop, you can do this on Canva, you will just have to do it manually which can be rather time consuming. 

Now, where can you get the actual Mock Ups? One platform we highly recommend for design in general is platforms like ***Envato Elements***. These are design marketplaces where you have access to millions of design resources that you are ***fully licensed*** to use! 

**3. Titles, tags, and descriptions** 

Now for the slightly more nitty gritty part. You could have the world's most amazing looking poster, however, if you do not get the Etsy SEO right, ***no one is going to see it!*** We will take you through creating a new Etsy listing field by field so you can know how to best list your products. 

The key to Etsy listing optimisation is to ***maximise.*** Literally cram in as many key words as you possibly can! Before you start this process, create a word map of anything you can think of relating to your listing. And come at this from the point of view of, ***if I was looking for a poster like mine, what would I search?***

**Titles**

\-Here you are blessed with 140 characters to title your listing. Essentially, start off with a concise way of properly describing your poster. And then afterwards, add in as many key words as you can! Here is an example of the title of a well selling Skiing poster:

Les Arcs Skiing Poster, Les Arcs Print, Les Alpes, France Ski Poster, Skiing Poster, Snowboarding Poster, Ski Resort Poster Holiday, French

This is 139 characters out of 140 - you should try and maximise this as much as possible! As you can see, this crams in a lot of key words and search terms both related to Skiing as a whole, ***the poster category,*** and then the ***specifics of the poster itself*** (Les Arcs resort in France).

Bear in mind that if you are listing a lot of listings that are of the same theme, you won’t have to spend time creating an entirely new title. For example if your next poster was of a ski resort in Italy, you can copy this one over and just swap out the specifics. For example change “France ski poster” to “Italy ski poster”, change “Les Arcs” to “The Dolomites”, etc. 

**Description**

\-Same logic applies for descriptions - try and cram in as many key words as you can! Here is an example for a Formula One poster:

George Russell, Mercedes Formula One Poster  ***- item specific keywords***

Bright, modern and vibrant poster to liven up your home.  - ***Describes the style of the poster***

All posters are printed on high quality, museum grade 200gsm poster paper. Suitable for framing and frames. - ***Shows the quality of the print. Mentions frames whilst showing it comes unframed***

Experience the thrill of the **racetrack** with this stunning **Formula One** poster. Printed on **high-quality** paper, this **racing car** **wall art print** features a dynamic image of a Formula One car in action, perfect for adding a touch of speed and excitement to any **motorsports room** or **man cave**. Whether you're a die-hard fan or simply appreciate the adrenaline of high-speed **racing**, this poster is sure to impress. Available in a range of sizes, it makes a great addition to your **home or office**, or as a **gift** for a fellow **Formula One enthusiast**. Each poster is **carefully packaged** to ensure **safe delivery**, so you can enjoy your new piece of **art** as soon as possible. - ***A nice bit of text really highlighting a lot of key words such as gift, motorsports, racetrack etc.*** 

You could go further with this too, by adding in extra things related to the poster such as ‘Perfect gift for a Mercedes F1 fan’ etc. 

**Tags**

Now, these are actually probably the ***most important part of your listing***! You get 13 tags (20 character limit for each) and there are essentially search terms that will match your listing with what customers search for when shopping. 

You really need to maximize these - whilst Title and Description play a part, these are the main things that will bring buyers to your listing. Once again, it is important to think about what customers are likely to be searching when looking for a poster similar to yours.

**Life hack alert!** You can actually ***see what tags other sellers are using***. All you need to do is go to a listing similar to yours that is selling well, scroll down and you can actually see them listed out at the bottom of the page! Here is an example of what this may look like:

So, go through a few listings of competitors and make notes on common denominators that you can integrate into your listing.

As you can see here, this seller uses tags such as ‘Birthday Gift’ and ‘Poster Print’. When you first start out, you may be better off ***swapping these out for more listing specific tags***. This seller has been on Etsy for a few years however and has 15,000+ sales, so are more likely to see success from these tags. 

If it’s not clear why, think about it this way. If you searched ‘poster print’ on Etsy today, there will be ***10s of thousands of results***. However, if you searched ‘Russell Mercedes Poster’, you will (as of writing) get ***336 results***. Etsy is far more likely to push your product to the top of the latter tag, against 300 other listings, rather than the top of ‘Poster Print’ where it is incredibly competitive. It is only when you are a more successful shop pulling in a high quantity of orders that these larger and more generic tags will work for you, as Etsy has more trust in your shop and will be more likely to push you to the front. 

**SKUs**

\-One important thing you need to do is add SKUs to all of your products! This is worth doing at the start as it will make your life so much easier when it comes to making sales and using PrintShrimp further down the line. What is an SKU? It is a ‘stock keeping unit’, and is essentially just a product identifier. Your ***SKUs need to match your file name*** that you upload to PrintShrimp. For example, if you made a poster about the eiffel tower, you can literally name the SKU eiffel-tower. There is no need to complicate things! As long as your file name (as in ***the image name of your poster on your computer***) matches your SKU, you will be good to go. 

\-It may be more beneficial to set up a system with unique identifiers, to make organising your files a lot easier further down the line. Say you get to 1000 posters eventually, you’ll want to be able to ***quickly search a code***, and also ensure every ***SKU is always unique***, so you won’t run into accidentally using the same SKU twice further down the line. For example, you can set it up so at the start of each file name, you have \[unique id\]\[info\], so your files will look like - 

A1eiffeltower

A2france

And further down the line:

A99aperolspritz

B1potatoart

This not only removes the potential issue of duplicating SKUs accidentally (for example if you made a few posters of the same subject), but also keeps your files well organised. If you need to find a file, you can search your files according to the code, so just by searching ‘a1’ for example, rather than having to trawl through a load of different files until you find the correct one.

\-If your poster has variations, for example color variations, you can set a ***different SKU for each variation***. Just click the little box when setting up variations that says ‘SKUs vary for each (variation)’. So if you have a poster available either in a white or black background, you can name each file, and therefore each SKU, a1eiffel-tower-black and a1eiffel-tower-white for example.

\-The same goes for different sizes. As different American sizes have different aspect ratios, as mentioned above you may have to reformat some posters if you get a sale for one of these sizes. You can then add in the SKU to your listing once you have reformatted your poster. So for example if you sell a 16x20” version of the eiffel tower poster, you can name this file eiffel-tower-white-1620. Whilst this involves a little bit of set up, the time it saves you overall is massive! 

**Variations and Prices**

\-So, when selling posters there is a huge variety of sizes that you can offer, as mentioned previously. Non-negotiable is that you should be offering A5-A1. These will likely be your main sellers! Especially in the UK. It is also a good idea to offer inch sizing to appeal to a global audience (as bear in mind with PrintShrimp you will be able to print in multiple countries around the world!). 

Below is a recommended pricing structure of what to charge on Etsy. Feel free to mess around with these! You may notice on Etsy that many shops charge a whole lot more for sizes such as A1, 24x36” etc. In my experience I prefer charging a lower rate to attract more sales, but there is validity in going for a lower amount of sales with higher profits.

As mentioned above, you can also offer different variations on items - for example different colour schemes on posters. This is always a decent idea (if it suits the design) as it provides the customer with more options, which might help to convert the sale. You can always add this in later however if you want to keep it simple while you start!

**Setting up shipping profiles**

Etsy makes it very easy to set up different shipping rates for different countries. However, luckily with PrintShrimp you can offer free shipping to the majority of the major countries that are active on Etsy! 

Using PrintShrimp means that your production costs are low enough in each domestic market to justify this. If you look on Etsy you can see there are many shops that ***post internationally*** to countries such as the US or Australia. Therefore, they often charge £8-10 in postage, and have a delivery time of 1-2 weeks. This really ***limits their customer base*** to their domestic market. 

Using PrintShrimp avoids this and means you can offer free shipping (as we absorb the shipping cost in our prices) to the major markets of the UK, Australia, and USA (Europe coming soon!). 

We also offer a ***1 day processing time,*** unlike many POD poster suppliers. This means you can set your Etsy processing time to just one day, which combined with our quick shipping, means you will be ***one of the quickest on Etsy*** at sending out orders. This is obviously very attractive for customers, who are often very impatient with wanting their orders! 

**Getting the sales and extra tips**

\-Don’t list an insane amount of listings when you first get started. Etsy will be like ‘hang on a second’ if a brand new shop suddenly has 200 items in the first week. ***Warm up your account***, and take things slow as you get going. We recommend 5 a day for the first week or so, and then you can start uploading more. You don’t want Etsy to flag your account for suspicious bot-like activity when you first get going. 

\-It is very easy to ***copy listings*** when creating a new one. Simply select an old listing and press copy, and then you can just change the listing specific details to create a new one, rather than having to start from scratch. It can feel like a bit of a ball-ache setting up your first ever listing, but from then on you can just copy it over and just change the specifics. 

\-Try and organize your listings into ***sections***! This really helps the customer journey. Sometimes a customer will click onto your shop after seeing one of your listings, so it really helps if they can easily navigate your shop for what they are looking for.

So, you now have a fully fledged Etsy shop. Well done! Time to start making £3,000 a month straight away right? Not quite. Please bear in mind, ***patience is key*** when starting out. If you started doing this because you are £10,000 in debt to the Albanian mafia and need to pay it off next week, you have come into this in the wrong frame of mind. If you have however started this to slowly build up a side hustle which hopefully one day become your full time gig, then winner winner chicken dinner. 

***Starting out on Etsy isn’t always easy.*** It takes time for your shop to build up trust! As I’ve said before, a buyer is far more likely to purchase from a shop with 1000s of reviews, than a brand new one with 0. But before you know it, you can become one of these shops!

One thing you can do at the very start is to ***encourage your friends and family to buy your posters!*** This is a slightly naughty way of getting a few sales at the start, of course followed by a few glowing 5\* reviews. It really helps to give your shop this little boost at the start, so if this is something you can do then I recommend it. 

Okay, so once you have a fully fledged shop with a decent amount of listings, you might be expecting the sales to start rolling in. And, if you are lucky, they indeed might. However, in my experience, you need to give your listings a little boost. So let us introduce you to:

**The wonderful world of Etsy ads**

Ads!! Oh no, that means money!! We imagine some of you more risk averse people are saying to yourself right now. And yes, it indeed does. But more often than not unfortunately you do ***have to spend money to make money***. 

Fortunately, in my experience anyway, ***Etsy ads do tend to work***. This does however only apply if your products are actually good however, so if you’re back here after paying for ads for 2 months and are losing money at the same rate as your motivation, maybe go back to the start of this guide and pick another niche. 

When you first start out, there are two main strategies. 

**Number 1: The Safer Option**

So, with PrintShrimp, you will essentially be making a minimum of £6 profit per order. With this in mind, I normally start a new shop with a safer strategy of advertising my products with a budget of $3-5 dollars a day. This then means that at the start, you only need to make 1 sale to break even, and anything above that is pure profit! This might not seem like the most dazzling proposition right now, but again please bear in mind that ***growth will be slow at the start.*** This means that you can gradually grow your shop, and therefore the trust that customers have in your shop, over time with a very small risk of ever actually losing money.

**Number 2: The Billy Big Balls Option**

If you were yawning while reading the first option, then this strategy may be for you. This will be better suited to those of you that are a bit more ***risk prone***, and it also helps if you have a bit more ***cash to invest*** at the start. Through this strategy, you can essentially ***pay your way to the top*** of Etsy's rankings. For this, you’ll probably be looking at spending $20 a day on ads. So, this can really add up quickly and is definitely the riskier option. In my experience, the level of sales with this may not always match up to your spend every day. You may find that some days you rake in about 10 sales, and other days only one. But what this does mean is that as your listings get seen and purchased more, they will begin to ***rank higher in Etsy’s organic search rankings***, at a much quicker rate than option one.

This is the beauty of Etsy’s ads. You can pay to boost your products, but then results from this paid promotion ***feed into the organic ranking of your products***. So you may find that you can splash the cash for a while at the start in order to race to the top, and then drop your ad spending later on when your products are already ranking well. 

**Sending your poster orders**

So, you’ve now done the hard bit. You have a running Etsy store, and essentially all you need to now on a daily basis is send out your orders and reply to customer messages! This is where it really becomes ***passive income.*** 

\-Check out the PrintShrimp order portal. Simply sign up, and you can place individual orders through there.

\-Bulk upload: We have an option to bulk upload your Esty orders via csv. 

Seriously, when you are up and running with your first store, it is really as easy as that. 

Once you have your first Etsy store up and running, you can think about expanding. There are many ways to expand your income. You can set up other Etsy stores, as long as the type of posters you are selling varies. You can look into setting up your own Shopify stores, and advertise them through Facebook, Instagram etc.

Through this guide, we will teach you everything you need to know about starting to sell posters and generate some income. We will also show you why PrintShrimp is the best POD supplier for all of your poster needs. Trust me, you won’t need much convincing. "
Detailed Guide - How I've Been Self Employed for 2 Years Selling Posters,dropship,1i9lux8,2025-01-25 07:24:54,44,0.94,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropship/comments/1i9lux8/detailed_guide_how_ive_been_self_employed_for_2/,tommo278,,"Hey everyone, bit of context before you read through this. I have been selling POD posters full time for over 2 years now. My next venture is that I have started my own Print on Demand company for posters, PrintShrimp. As one way of creating customers for our service, we are teaching people for free how to also sell posters. Here is a guide I have written on how to sell posters on Etsy. Feel free to have a read through and then check out PrintShrimp, hopefully can help some of you guys out (and get us some more customers!)

All of this is also available in video format on our website too, if you prefer to learn that way. Thanks guys!

Through this guide, we will teach you everything you need to know about starting to sell posters and generate some income. We will also show you why PrintShrimp is the best POD supplier for all of your poster needs. Trust me, you won’t need much convincing. 

**So, why are posters the best product to sell?**

Also, just thought I’d quickly answer the question - ***why posters?*** If you’ve been researching Print on Demand you’ve probably come across the infinite options of t-shirts, mugs, hats, phone cases, and more. All of these are viable options, however we think posters are the perfect place to start. You can always expand into other areas further down the line! So a brief summary of why posters are the perfect product for Print on Demand:

\-They are ***very easy to design***! Posters are a very easy shape to deal with - can’t go wrong with a rectangle. This makes designing products very easy.

\-Similarly to this, ***what you see is what you get*** with a poster. You can literally see your finished product as you design it in either canva or photoshop. With T-Shirts for example, you have to make your design, and then place it on a t-shirt. Then you have to coordinate with your printers the size you would like the design on the tshirt and many other variables like that. There is no messing about with posters - what you see is what you get.

\-***The same high quality, everywhere***. With other products, if you want to reap the benefits of a printing in various countries, you need to ensure each of your global suppliers stocks the same t-shirts, is able to print in the same way, carries the same sizes etc. Again with posters you avoid all of this hassle- your products will come out the same, no matter which of our global locations are used.

\-They have a ***very favorable profit margin***. As you will see later, the cost price of posters is very low. And people are prepared to pay quite a lot for a decent bit of wall art! I have tried out other products, and the profit margin combined with the order quantity of posters makes them my most profitable product, every single time. Using PrintShrimp, you can be sure to enjoy profits of anywhere between £6 - £40 pure profit per sale. 

\-They are one of the ***easiest to print white label***. This makes them perfect for Print on Demand. Your posters are simply put in a tube, and off they go. There are no extras you need to faff around with, compared to the extra elements other products come with, such as clothing labels on t-shirts. 

**Picking your poster niche**

So, you are ready to start selling posters. Great! Now, the blessing and curse with selling posters is that there are ***infinite possibilities*** regarding what you can sell. So, it can easily be quite overwhelming at first. 

The first thing I would recommend doing is having a ***look at what others are selling***. Etsy is a wonderful place for this (and will likely be a key part of your poster selling journey). So, log on to Etsy and simply type in ‘poster’ in the search bar. Get ready to write a massive list of the broad categories and type of posters that people are selling. 

If you do not have more than 50 categories written down by the end, you are doing something wrong. There are seriously an infinite amount of posters! For example, here are some popular ones to get you started:

Star sign posters, Kitchen posters, World map posters, Custom Dog Portrait posters, Music posters, Movie posters, Fine art posters, Skiing posters, Girl Power posters and Football posters. 

Now, you have a huge list of potential products to sell. What next? There are a few important things you need to bear in mind when picking your niche:

\-**Does this interest me?** 

Don’t make the mistake of going down a niche that didn’t actually interest you just because it would probably be a money maker. Before you know it, what can be a very fun process of making designs can become incredibly \*\*\*monotonous, and feel like a chore\*\*\*. You need to bear in mind that you will be spending a lot of time creating designs - if it is something you are interested in you are much less likely to get burnt out! As well, \*\*\*creativity will flow\*\*\* far better if it is something you are interested in, which at the end of the day will lead to better designs that are more likely to be purchased by customers. 

\-Is this within my design range?

Don’t let this put you off too much. We will go through how to get started on design later on in this guide. However, it is important to note that the plain truth of it is that some niches and designs are a hell of a lot more complicated than others. For example, quote posters can essentially be designed by anyone when you learn about how to put nice fonts together in a good color scheme. On the other hand, some posters you see may have been designed with complex illustrations in a program like Illustrator. To start with, it may be better to pick a niche that seems a bit more simple to get into, as you can always expand your range with other stores further down the line. A good way of evaluating the design complexity is by identifying if this poster is \*\*\*a lot of elements put together\*\*\* or is \*\*\*a lot of elements created by the designer themselves\*\*\*\*\*.\*\* Design can in a lot of cases be like a jigsaw - putting colours, shapes and text together to create an image. This will be a lot easier to start with and can be learnt by anyone, compared to complex drawings and illustrations. 

\-Is this niche subject to copyright issues?

Time to delve deep into good old copyright. Now, when you go through Etsy, you will without a doubt see hundreds of sellers selling music album posters, car posters, movie posters and more. Obviously, these posters contain the property of musicians, companies and more and are therefore copyrighted. The annoying thing is - these are \*\*\*a complete cash cow.\*\*\* If you go down the music poster route, I will honestly be surprised if you \*\*don’t\*\* make thousands. However it is only a matter of time before the copyright strikes start rolling in and you eventually get banned from Etsy.   
  
So I would highly recommend \*\*\*not making this mistake\*\*\*. Etsy is an incredible platform for selling posters, and it is a hell of a lot easier to make sales on there compared to advertising your own website. And, you \*\*\*only get one chance on Etsy.\*\*\* Once you have been banned once, you are not allowed to sign up again (and they do ID checks - so you won’t be able to rejoin again under your own name).   
  
So, don’t be shortsighted when it comes to entering Print on Demand. If you keep your designs legitimate, they will last you a lifetime and you will then later be able to crosspost them to other platforms, again without the worry of ever getting shut down. 

**So, how do I actually design posters?**

Now you have an idea of what kind of posters you want to be making, it’s time to get creative and make some designs! Photoshop (and the creative cloud in general) is probably the best for this. However, when starting out it can be a scary investment (it costs about £30 a month unless you can get a student rate!). 

So, while Photoshop is preferable in the long term, when starting out you can learn the ropes of design and get going with Canva. This can be great at the start as they have a load of templates that you can use to get used to designing and experimenting (while it might be tempting to slightly modify these and sell them - this will be quite saturated on places like Etsy so we would recommend doing something new). 

**What size format should I use?**

The best design format to start with is arguably the A sizes - as all the A sizes (A5, A4, A3, A2, A1, A0) are ***scalable***. This means that you can make all of your designs in one size, for example A3, and these designs will be ready to fit to all other A sizes. For example, if you design an A3 poster and someone orders A1, you can just upload this A3 file to PrintShrimp and it will be ready to print.

There is a wide range of other sizes you should consider offering on your shop, especially as these sizes are very popular with the American market. They have a wide range of popular options, which unfortunately aren’t all scalable with each other. This does mean that you will therefore have to make some slight modifications to your design in order to be able to offer them in American sizing, in a few different aspect ratios.

What you can do however is design all of your products in UK sizing, and simply redesign to fit American sizing once you have had an order. Essentially: design in UK sizing, but list in both UK and US sizing. Then when you get a non-A size order, you can quickly redesign it on demand. This means that you don’t have to make a few different versions of each poster when first designing, and can simply do a quick redesign for US sizing when you need to.

Below is PrintShrimps standard size offering. We can also offer any custom sizing too, so please get in touch if you are looking for anything else. With these sizes, your poster orders will be dispatched domestically in whatever country your customer orders from.

**Our recommendations for starting design**

One thing that will not be featured in this guide is a written out explanation or guide on how to design. Honestly, I can’t think of a more boring, or frankly worse, way to learn design. When it comes to getting started, ***experimenting is your best friend!*** Just have a play around and see what you can do. It is a really fun thing to get started with, and the satisfaction of when a poster design comes together is like no other.

A good way to start is honestly by straight up ***copying a poster you see for sale online***. And we don’t mean copying to sell! But just trying to replicate other designs is a great way to get a feel for it and what you can do. We really think you will be surprised at how easy it is to pull together a lot of designs that at first can appear quite complicated!

Your best friend throughout this whole process will be ***google.*** At the start you will not really know how to do anything - but learning how to look into things you want to know about design is all part of the process. At first, it can be quite hard to even know how to search for what you are trying to do, but this will come with time (we promise). Learning ***how to google*** is a skill that you will learn throughout this process. 

Above all, what we think is most important is this golden rule: ***take inspiration but do not steal***. You want to be ***selling similar products in your niche, but not copies***. You need to see what is selling in your niche and get ideas from that, but if you make designs too similar to ones already available, you won’t have much luck. At the end of the day, if two very similar posters are for sale and one shop has 1000 reviews and your newer one has 2, which one is the customer going to buy? You need to make yours offer something different and stand out enough to attract customers.

**Etsy SEO and maximizing your sales**

You may have noticed in this guide we have mentioned Etsy quite a few times! That is because we think it is hands down the best place to ***start selling*** posters. Why? Etsy is a go to place for many looking to decorate their homes and also to buy gifts. It might be tempting to start selling with your own website straight away, however we recommend Etsy as it ***brings the customers to you.*** For example, say you start selling Bathroom Posters. It is going to be a hell of a lot easier to convert sales when you already have customers being shown your page after searching ‘bathroom decor’, compared to advertising your own website. This is especially true as it can be hard to identify your ideal target audience to then advertise to via Meta (Facebook/Instagram) for example. Websites are a great avenue to explore eventually like I now have, but we recommend starting with Etsy and going from there.

**What costs do I need to be aware of?**

So, setting up an Etsy sellers account is currently costs £15. The only other **upfront** cost you will have is the cost of listing a product - this is 20 cents per listing. From then on, every time you make a sale you will be charged a transaction fee of 6.5%, a small payment processing fee, plus another 20 cents for a renewed listing fee. It normally works out to about 10% of each order, a small price to pay for all the benefits Etsy brings. No matter what platform you sell on, you will be faced with some form of transaction fee. Etsy is actually quite reasonable especially as they do not charge you to use their platform on a monthly basis. 

**What do I need to get selling?**

**1. Getting your shop looking pretty**

\-Think of a shop name and design (now you are a professional designer) a logo

\-Design a banner for the top of your shop

\-Add in some about me info/shop announcement

\-I recommend running a sale wherein orders of 3+ items get a 20% of discount. Another big benefit of PrintShrimp is that you receive large discounts when ordering multiple posters. This is great for attracting buyers and larger orders. 

**2. Making your products look attractive**

That is the bulk of the ‘decor’ you will need to do. Next up is ***placing your posters in mock ups!*** As you may notice on Etsy, most shops show their posters framed and hanging on walls. These are 99% of the time not real photos, but digital mock ups. This is where Photoshop comes in really handy, as you can automate this process through a plug in called Bulk Mock Up. If you don’t have photoshop, you can do this on Canva, you will just have to do it manually which can be rather time consuming. 

Now, where can you get the actual Mock Ups? One platform we highly recommend for design in general is platforms like ***Envato Elements***. These are design marketplaces where you have access to millions of design resources that you are ***fully licensed*** to use! 

**3. Titles, tags, and descriptions** 

Now for the slightly more nitty gritty part. You could have the world's most amazing looking poster, however, if you do not get the Etsy SEO right, ***no one is going to see it!*** We will take you through creating a new Etsy listing field by field so you can know how to best list your products. 

The key to Etsy listing optimisation is to ***maximise.*** Literally cram in as many key words as you possibly can! Before you start this process, create a word map of anything you can think of relating to your listing. And come at this from the point of view of, ***if I was looking for a poster like mine, what would I search?***

**Titles**

\-Here you are blessed with 140 characters to title your listing. Essentially, start off with a concise way of properly describing your poster. And then afterwards, add in as many key words as you can! Here is an example of the title of a well selling Skiing poster:

Les Arcs Skiing Poster, Les Arcs Print, Les Alpes, France Ski Poster, Skiing Poster, Snowboarding Poster, Ski Resort Poster Holiday, French

This is 139 characters out of 140 - you should try and maximise this as much as possible! As you can see, this crams in a lot of key words and search terms both related to Skiing as a whole, ***the poster category,*** and then the ***specifics of the poster itself*** (Les Arcs resort in France).

Bear in mind that if you are listing a lot of listings that are of the same theme, you won’t have to spend time creating an entirely new title. For example if your next poster was of a ski resort in Italy, you can copy this one over and just swap out the specifics. For example change “France ski poster” to “Italy ski poster”, change “Les Arcs” to “The Dolomites”, etc. 

**Description**

\-Same logic applies for descriptions - try and cram in as many key words as you can! Here is an example for a Formula One poster:

George Russell, Mercedes Formula One Poster  ***- item specific keywords***

Bright, modern and vibrant poster to liven up your home.  - ***Describes the style of the poster***

All posters are printed on high quality, museum grade 200gsm poster paper. Suitable for framing and frames. - ***Shows the quality of the print. Mentions frames whilst showing it comes unframed***

Experience the thrill of the **racetrack** with this stunning **Formula One** poster. Printed on **high-quality** paper, this **racing car** **wall art print** features a dynamic image of a Formula One car in action, perfect for adding a touch of speed and excitement to any **motorsports room** or **man cave**. Whether you're a die-hard fan or simply appreciate the adrenaline of high-speed **racing**, this poster is sure to impress. Available in a range of sizes, it makes a great addition to your **home or office**, or as a **gift** for a fellow **Formula One enthusiast**. Each poster is **carefully packaged** to ensure **safe delivery**, so you can enjoy your new piece of **art** as soon as possible. - ***A nice bit of text really highlighting a lot of key words such as gift, motorsports, racetrack etc.*** 

You could go further with this too, by adding in extra things related to the poster such as ‘Perfect gift for a Mercedes F1 fan’ etc. 

**Tags**

Now, these are actually probably the ***most important part of your listing***! You get 13 tags (20 character limit for each) and there are essentially search terms that will match your listing with what customers search for when shopping. 

You really need to maximize these - whilst Title and Description play a part, these are the main things that will bring buyers to your listing. Once again, it is important to think about what customers are likely to be searching when looking for a poster similar to yours.

**Life hack alert!** You can actually ***see what tags other sellers are using***. All you need to do is go to a listing similar to yours that is selling well, scroll down and you can actually see them listed out at the bottom of the page! Here is an example of what this may look like:

So, go through a few listings of competitors and make notes on common denominators that you can integrate into your listing.

As you can see here, this seller uses tags such as ‘Birthday Gift’ and ‘Poster Print’. When you first start out, you may be better off ***swapping these out for more listing specific tags***. This seller has been on Etsy for a few years however and has 15,000+ sales, so are more likely to see success from these tags. 

If it’s not clear why, think about it this way. If you searched ‘poster print’ on Etsy today, there will be ***10s of thousands of results***. However, if you searched ‘Russell Mercedes Poster’, you will (as of writing) get ***336 results***. Etsy is far more likely to push your product to the top of the latter tag, against 300 other listings, rather than the top of ‘Poster Print’ where it is incredibly competitive. It is only when you are a more successful shop pulling in a high quantity of orders that these larger and more generic tags will work for you, as Etsy has more trust in your shop and will be more likely to push you to the front. 

**SKUs**

\-One important thing you need to do is add SKUs to all of your products! This is worth doing at the start as it will make your life so much easier when it comes to making sales and using PrintShrimp further down the line. What is an SKU? It is a ‘stock keeping unit’, and is essentially just a product identifier. Your ***SKUs need to match your file name*** that you upload to PrintShrimp. For example, if you made a poster about the eiffel tower, you can literally name the SKU eiffel-tower. There is no need to complicate things! As long as your file name (as in ***the image name of your poster on your computer***) matches your SKU, you will be good to go. 

\-It may be more beneficial to set up a system with unique identifiers, to make organising your files a lot easier further down the line. Say you get to 1000 posters eventually, you’ll want to be able to ***quickly search a code***, and also ensure every ***SKU is always unique***, so you won’t run into accidentally using the same SKU twice further down the line. For example, you can set it up so at the start of each file name, you have \[unique id\]\[info\], so your files will look like - 

A1eiffeltower

A2france

And further down the line:

A99aperolspritz

B1potatoart

This not only removes the potential issue of duplicating SKUs accidentally (for example if you made a few posters of the same subject), but also keeps your files well organised. If you need to find a file, you can search your files according to the code, so just by searching ‘a1’ for example, rather than having to trawl through a load of different files until you find the correct one.

\-If your poster has variations, for example color variations, you can set a ***different SKU for each variation***. Just click the little box when setting up variations that says ‘SKUs vary for each (variation)’. So if you have a poster available either in a white or black background, you can name each file, and therefore each SKU, a1eiffel-tower-black and a1eiffel-tower-white for example.

\-The same goes for different sizes. As different American sizes have different aspect ratios, as mentioned above you may have to reformat some posters if you get a sale for one of these sizes. You can then add in the SKU to your listing once you have reformatted your poster. So for example if you sell a 16x20” version of the eiffel tower poster, you can name this file eiffel-tower-white-1620. Whilst this involves a little bit of set up, the time it saves you overall is massive! 

**Variations and Prices**

\-So, when selling posters there is a huge variety of sizes that you can offer, as mentioned previously. Non-negotiable is that you should be offering A5-A1. These will likely be your main sellers! Especially in the UK. It is also a good idea to offer inch sizing to appeal to a global audience (as bear in mind with PrintShrimp you will be able to print in multiple countries around the world!). 

Below is a recommended pricing structure of what to charge on Etsy. Feel free to mess around with these! You may notice on Etsy that many shops charge a whole lot more for sizes such as A1, 24x36” etc. In my experience I prefer charging a lower rate to attract more sales, but there is validity in going for a lower amount of sales with higher profits.

As mentioned above, you can also offer different variations on items - for example different colour schemes on posters. This is always a decent idea (if it suits the design) as it provides the customer with more options, which might help to convert the sale. You can always add this in later however if you want to keep it simple while you start!

**Setting up shipping profiles**

Etsy makes it very easy to set up different shipping rates for different countries. However, luckily with PrintShrimp you can offer free shipping to the majority of the major countries that are active on Etsy! 

Using PrintShrimp means that your production costs are low enough in each domestic market to justify this. If you look on Etsy you can see there are many shops that ***post internationally*** to countries such as the US or Australia. Therefore, they often charge £8-10 in postage, and have a delivery time of 1-2 weeks. This really ***limits their customer base*** to their domestic market. 

Using PrintShrimp avoids this and means you can offer free shipping (as we absorb the shipping cost in our prices) to the major markets of the UK, Australia, and USA (Europe coming soon!). 

We also offer a ***1 day processing time,*** unlike many POD poster suppliers. This means you can set your Etsy processing time to just one day, which combined with our quick shipping, means you will be ***one of the quickest on Etsy*** at sending out orders. This is obviously very attractive for customers, who are often very impatient with wanting their orders! 

**Getting the sales and extra tips**

\-Don’t list an insane amount of listings when you first get started. Etsy will be like ‘hang on a second’ if a brand new shop suddenly has 200 items in the first week. ***Warm up your account***, and take things slow as you get going. We recommend 5 a day for the first week or so, and then you can start uploading more. You don’t want Etsy to flag your account for suspicious bot-like activity when you first get going. 

\-It is very easy to ***copy listings*** when creating a new one. Simply select an old listing and press copy, and then you can just change the listing specific details to create a new one, rather than having to start from scratch. It can feel like a bit of a ball-ache setting up your first ever listing, but from then on you can just copy it over and just change the specifics. 

\-Try and organize your listings into ***sections***! This really helps the customer journey. Sometimes a customer will click onto your shop after seeing one of your listings, so it really helps if they can easily navigate your shop for what they are looking for.

So, you now have a fully fledged Etsy shop. Well done! Time to start making £3,000 a month straight away right? Not quite. Please bear in mind, ***patience is key*** when starting out. If you started doing this because you are £10,000 in debt to the Albanian mafia and need to pay it off next week, you have come into this in the wrong frame of mind. If you have however started this to slowly build up a side hustle which hopefully one day become your full time gig, then winner winner chicken dinner. 

***Starting out on Etsy isn’t always easy.*** It takes time for your shop to build up trust! As I’ve said before, a buyer is far more likely to purchase from a shop with 1000s of reviews, than a brand new one with 0. But before you know it, you can become one of these shops!

One thing you can do at the very start is to ***encourage your friends and family to buy your posters!*** This is a slightly naughty way of getting a few sales at the start, of course followed by a few glowing 5\* reviews. It really helps to give your shop this little boost at the start, so if this is something you can do then I recommend it. 

Okay, so once you have a fully fledged shop with a decent amount of listings, you might be expecting the sales to start rolling in. And, if you are lucky, they indeed might. However, in my experience, you need to give your listings a little boost. So let us introduce you to:

**The wonderful world of Etsy ads**

Ads!! Oh no, that means money!! We imagine some of you more risk averse people are saying to yourself right now. And yes, it indeed does. But more often than not unfortunately you do ***have to spend money to make money***. 

Fortunately, in my experience anyway, ***Etsy ads do tend to work***. This does however only apply if your products are actually good however, so if you’re back here after paying for ads for 2 months and are losing money at the same rate as your motivation, maybe go back to the start of this guide and pick another niche. 

When you first start out, there are two main strategies. 

**Number 1: The Safer Option**

So, with PrintShrimp, you will essentially be making a minimum of £6 profit per order. With this in mind, I normally start a new shop with a safer strategy of advertising my products with a budget of $3-5 dollars a day. This then means that at the start, you only need to make 1 sale to break even, and anything above that is pure profit! This might not seem like the most dazzling proposition right now, but again please bear in mind that ***growth will be slow at the start.*** This means that you can gradually grow your shop, and therefore the trust that customers have in your shop, over time with a very small risk of ever actually losing money.

**Number 2: The Billy Big Balls Option**

If you were yawning while reading the first option, then this strategy may be for you. This will be better suited to those of you that are a bit more ***risk prone***, and it also helps if you have a bit more ***cash to invest*** at the start. Through this strategy, you can essentially ***pay your way to the top*** of Etsy's rankings. For this, you’ll probably be looking at spending $20 a day on ads. So, this can really add up quickly and is definitely the riskier option. In my experience, the level of sales with this may not always match up to your spend every day. You may find that some days you rake in about 10 sales, and other days only one. But what this does mean is that as your listings get seen and purchased more, they will begin to ***rank higher in Etsy’s organic search rankings***, at a much quicker rate than option one.

This is the beauty of Etsy’s ads. You can pay to boost your products, but then results from this paid promotion ***feed into the organic ranking of your products***. So you may find that you can splash the cash for a while at the start in order to race to the top, and then drop your ad spending later on when your products are already ranking well. 

**Sending your poster orders**

So, you’ve now done the hard bit. You have a running Etsy store, and essentially all you need to now on a daily basis is send out your orders and reply to customer messages! This is where it really becomes ***passive income.*** 

\-Check out the PrintShrimp order portal. Simply sign up, and you can place individual orders through there.

\-Bulk upload: We have an option to bulk upload your Esty orders via csv. 

Seriously, when you are up and running with your first store, it is really as easy as that. 

Once you have your first Etsy store up and running, you can think about expanding. There are many ways to expand your income. You can set up other Etsy stores, as long as the type of posters you are selling varies. You can look into setting up your own Shopify stores, and advertise them through Facebook, Instagram etc.

Through this guide, we will teach you everything you need to know about starting to sell posters and generate some income. We will also show you why PrintShrimp is the best POD supplier for all of your poster needs. Trust me, you won’t need much convincing. "
Potential MMU waste solution (cold pull),3Dprinting,1i9kvmk,2025-01-25 06:18:05,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1i9kvmk/potential_mmu_waste_solution_cold_pull/,Uxcis,Discussion,"I thought of a potential solution to the material waste that comes along with most MMU systems, but I am skeptical of it.

If you were to have a hotend that is very smooth, non-stick (some sort of coating), and could heat and cool very quickly (induction heating+watercooling the hotend?), then you could probably cold pull the filament per material swap, which eliminates the need to purge the filament, or at least significantly reduce the amount. If you could get the cold pull reliable.

Am i missing something?"
[Complete] [69k] [Fantasy/Mystery] The Scorched Guard,BetaReaders,1i9kgsx,2025-01-25 05:48:37,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetaReaders/comments/1i9kgsx/complete_69k_fantasymystery_the_scorched_guard/,wordyelliot,60k,"**Blurb:**

A disgraced former guard shouldering the blame for a catastrophe he did not cause returns to the city to find the next generation of guardsmen aren't living up to their duty. When they wont investigate a *clearly* suspicious death he takes it upon himself to solve the murder - unintentionally banding together a party of outcasts who step up to find justice where the city won't.

**Excerpt**:

""It is not the city's job to put your hearth out at night. There is nothing we can do. I hope you make peace with your loss.""

Jarrod's dismissal was loud and clear. He turned and motioned for his entourage to follow. They dutifully obliged, even his second, who had seemed disappointed the altercation hadn't called for more drastic measures.

The woman would not be dismissed so easily. She whipped her head towards the crowd in a frenzied search. Brack wondered what she might be looking for when her eyes locked on the cart just in front of him. He could see her face clearly now, her bright eyes wet but determined. Eyes that needed an answer. Eyes that only saw red.

She sprinted at the cart and snatched a large bottle of wine. Dark liquid swirled within a thick and presumably heavy glass. Her smaller hands still circled its neck with a firm grip. Brack could see the plan forming, could recognize the fumes of revenge that spurred her rage. It was a fury so recognizable he almost didn't stop her.

Almost.

The woman planted her feet and swung the bottle behind her, readying herself for a hefty wind up. The retreating guards still hadn't breached the edge of the crowd. She took aim. She passed her weight between her heels, planted her front foot, and swung the bottle up and over her head, channeling all her strength into what promised to be an impressive pitch.

The crowd gasped as a few of them caught on to her intention. Luckily, Brack got to her before the followthrough. At the top of her arc, he snatched the bottle from the air before she could complete her throw. The sudden interruption of her momentum knocked her off balance, and she was forcefully swung around to face Brack directly.

She let out a growl of frustration but the sound dissipated as soon as she met Brack's eyes. Her wide, bright green caught his own dark stare and she released the bottle entirely. The manic energy rolled off her body in waves and she remained in place, breathing like she had just run the entire city gate to gate.

There was no hiding now. Even with his hood up there was no shadow dark enough to obscure his harsh visage. Brack willed his gaze to be softer, more human, wishing desperately to offset his grizzly and intimidating face. Crackling scars completely covered his left side, splitting his forehead, tracing the outside of his left eye, then falling down his chin and neck, implying they continued down the rest of his body. The skin was dark and scorched, giving the appearance of leathery scales that met in a gnarled patchwork. Every crease looked miserably dry, and formed red, raw cracks that looked as if they'd never fully heal.

He knew how terrifying he looked. How pitiful he looked. He knew there was no hiding who he was or how he became this way. The woman surely recognized him, but to her credit she did not flinch or back down.

When the shock wore off she kept staring. She waited for his next move, but he hadn't thought that far. All he knew was whatever lay in store for them would likely call for a considerable amount of bravery, and this woman had shown it in spades.

This was why he had returned.

  
**Feedback:**

* Still isn't terribly polished but I've done some structure/pacing edits and would love some insight on how it reads. 
* I know I have to trim it down quite a bit. Still doing the work, but if anyone with some perspective can give any insight into which darlings are particularly kill-able that could be helpful.
* Tear apart my intro if you must. (Not this bit, theres a prologue and chapter before this excerpt...) I take a chapter or two before it really gets going (I know, I know...) but I like the pace/set up of it and I just want to know if it keeps attention well enough because I think it does but I may also be biased...

**Timeline**:

I don't have a set timeline, I'll be futzing with this for a bit so I'm open to any level of commitment/timeframe.

I read/respond pretty quickly so if we swap I can churn things out pretty quick.

**Critique/Swap**:

I'd be happy to read almost anything. If it's not a genre I'm particularly well versed in I can let you know, but in general I read all over and like to cross genes for the sake of breaking up monotony. So try me!"

(https://exvius.fandom.com/wiki/Tegmine/JP)

Now, I would like to add, this guide encompasses all the permanent missions related to this trial that will allow you to promote Teg to EX3. And, for the first time in my guides - I get to directly mention *Sinzar*! 😇

Also, thank *Kojimaru* as always, for the permanent mission clears as well. Let's begin!

To locate the fight, after you reach the Hidden Chamber, run to the bottom right section of the map and you will find the pedestal to Tegmine's crystal.

**Boss info/race**

*Tochalouse the Envious/Human, Beast* - Oh boy, this guy.... He has 2 phases. **Phase 1** - This guy, not only he has Physical accuracy boosted on his attacks, he will drain your MP and attack you with hybrid attacks. On top of that, he has this Trap mechanic build in him, which means if you attack him with any element, he will imbue your party with that element, boost his elemental resistance to that element and reduce your element resist and this will keep increasing in value if you keep attacking him with the same element on increasing turns, making it harder for you to burst this guy down. He will keep warning you until 16 turns that something big is about to happen and then, he will attack your whole party will an omni-element attack and reset this turn count. Oh, he can also inflict you with status ailments, so keep this in mind also. **Phase 2** - at 50% HP, he will shift to his next and final phase. He will open with 2x physical attacks on your provoker with accuracy boosted, then 2x AoE, Petrify AoE, Fixed attack AoE and Berserk. Goddamn! That's a lot! On next turns, he will eject your provoker for 2 turns, he will buff his physical offense and defense stats which you can't remove. He will inflict death and status ailments and just like phase 1, he will deal hybrid, fixed and physical attacks on your party with accuracy boosted.

**Mission - clear the battle, clear in 25/18/12 Turns (win 200 Tegmine shards, Tegmine unit and 400 Lapis)**

**Sinzar's video** - https://youtu.be/wIr4xUnaxU4

**Notes** - uh, rather than me explaining anything, just watch the video. He has done a pretty damn good job explaining this clear.

**Mission - clear with Harbingers of Chaos category Team (win 50 Tegmine shards)**

**Koji's video** - https://youtu.be/Qh2l_rKINps

**His Team** - Gabranth (Neo Vision), Dioxus (leader), Cloud of Darkness (True SBB unit) x2, Chorale and Ihana

**Notes**

1. Gab - HP and defense bulk. Provoke 100%. Give him at least 2 Lakshmi Synergy. Physical tanking, provoker, mitigation provider. He has EX Bonus as omnicover as well.
2. Dio - Build for damage. 1 source of Guts in the shift form. There for LS and Dark damage. (Ashal, Onyx Sephiroth or Ardyn will fare better here) 
3. CoD - build for damage. Has Dark area fields, dark debuffs, constant dark damage through LB.
4. Chorale - LB gauge fill equipment and 1 source of Guts. 1 source of Ribbon. Stat Debuffer and big Dark imperil.
5. Ihana - 1 source of MP reduce for skills, Dispel spell on materia, bulk and 1 source of MP Healing if you can fit it. Human killer buffer. Offensive stat and LB damage buffer.
6. Friend - same as own CoD.
7. Your goal with this team is to down the boss HP to 50% in first 3 turns.
8. If you want to swap any other unit in your team to fulfill a role, make sure they belong to the Harbingers of Chaos category.
9. If you have Tegmine already, you can slot him in Ihana's place as he provides Beast and Human killer buff for the party. This config will allow you to clear the ""clear with Tegmine"" mission. (but not the Chaos one)

**Mission - clear with The Gathering category Team (win 50 Tegmine shards)**

**Koji's video** - https://youtu.be/R3onsBEI51U

**His Team** - Ihana, Dark Roca (leader), Vanharma x2, King of Bal Galuf and Knights of Pluto Captain Steiner

**Notes**

1. Gear everyone in party except Vanharma with a Death Immunity source.
2. It is better if you enhance your units with pots to ensure more damage and durability. If your units are dying often in the battle, maybe door pot them (or replace them with newer units that can fulfill the mentioned role)
3. Ihana - 1 source of MP reduce for skill. HP and defense bulk. 100% Provoke. 2 sources of Guts. Dual wielding and has a source of Attack +1. Offensive stat and LB damage buffer. Has human killer buffs also. Normal attack can heal MP (very crucial since the boss loves to drain party's MP) and provide 2x AoE mirage (this is great because even if boss Berserk her, she can be useful to the party).
4. Roca - build for damage. Has 2 sources of Guts. Also has ability that fills party's HP and MP over time. Can also AoE Earth imbue (Ihana also can do this) and Quick to shorten CD on Vanharma mainly. Can also LB Fill the party through Haste.
5. Vanharma - build for damage. Has Dispel Force and Bahamut Synergy. Make sure he has unlocked his latent abilities from the Sealed Tower mission clears.
6. Steiner - HP and defense bulk. Geared same way in both base and shift forms. Give him maybe 2-3 sources of MP reduce for skill and 1 MP Healing source. Also, Ribbon effect and Lakshmi Synergy. Physical tank, mitigations through LB, debuffer. 
7. Galuf - don't worry about his EX levels. Just gear him with HP and Defense bulk (maybe 1 source of MP reduce for skills also). Give him at least one Breaker materia (Edge, President Raegan, Return Akstar, Tulien TMR). Main debuffer (on the defensive side at side). Also, chain support with Roca.
8. Friend - almost the same equipment and all abilities as own Van.
9. If you want to swap any other unit in your team to fulfill a role, make sure they belong to The Gathering category.
10. The idea with this party to stall the first phase as much as possible and slowly chip away the boss's HP and then 1 Hit KO (or maybe 2 if you can't hack it) the boss in 2nd phase. Of course, you can change this course by bursting the boss in first phase by 2/3 turns if you have newer units (like Raegan or Akstar of Ultimate Summon fame or maybe Hyoh and Panthera Ultimus).

**Mission - clear with Tegmine in your team (win 50 Tegmine shards)**

**Koji's video** - https://youtu.be/td-vyPPvaCI

**His Team** - Denial of Focus Vanille, Runda, The Undying (True SBB unit) x2, Tegmine and Flaring Aether Rain (leader)

**Notes**
1. Have everyone (except Vanille) in your party equipped with a source of Death Immunity.
2. If possible, stick all units in your party with a ribbon effect source. If not, don't worry about it.
3. Vanille - 100% Provoke. Have 1 source of MP reduce for skills. Set on Phoenix with Fira (for chaining) and Self reraise ability learned. Don't worry about death Immunity on her as we need her to die and reraise so that the effects of Berserk from the boss don't stick on her. Debuffer, area imperil on boss and AoE cure. 
4. Runda - 100% Provoke (we need him on the lower spot than Vanille since she's our priority Provoker. You know, the provoke priority mechanic). Have him set on Lakshmi. Have Ribbon effect, Lakshmi Synergy on him as well to counter status ailment heals. Bahamut Synergy also for the evocation gauge fill and Lehftia (normal version) TMR for Fire BS ability chaining support. You can heal the party with Runda with the help of Lakshmi summon. Physical Tank, mitigations and LB filler.
5. Undying - Build for damage. Boost his MP as much as possible so you can use his MP burst ability (Global players, remember this one?). 
6. Teg - just ribbon effect, MP Healing, MP reduce for skill sources. Has perfect dispel and ST ally debuff clear ability. Also has Human and Beast killer buff ability like I mentioned in the Chaos section.
7. Rain - build the same way in both base and shift form for damage boost. Has Fire imbue and has AoE Fire amp buff. Great for himself and Undyings. 
8. Friend - same equipment as own Undying. 
9.  If you want to swap any other unit in your team to fulfill a role..... Eh, choose whoever you want. Just make sure Tegmine **STAYS** in your party somewhere. And like I mentioned in the Chaos section, you can use that team also.
10.  In phase 2, you might notice in the video that the boss petrified both Undying (and them healing it because their SLB went off). You can't heal this with LS because boss doesn't attack Runda. If that happens, use Vanille's Esuna spell to cure it."
My first attempt at an ECS... your thoughts please?,gameenginedevs,1i9k8jm,2025-01-25 05:31:36,18,0.82,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameenginedevs/comments/1i9k8jm/my_first_attempt_at_an_ecs_your_thoughts_please/,TheOrdersMaster,,"So, a couple of days ago I asked how you all handle Entities / Scene Graphs and the overwhelming majority was using ECS. So naturally, having little to no experience in C++ memory management, apart from half a semesters worth of lectures years ago (which I spent doing work for other courses), I decided I wanted an ECS too, and I wanted the flying unicorn type of ECS if I'm going through the trouble of rebuilding half my engine (to be fair there wasn't much more than a scenegraph and a hardcoded simple render pipeline).

In any case I read the blogs of some very smart and generous people:

* [Austin Morlan](https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/)
* [Niko Savas](https://medium.com/@savas/nomad-game-engine-part-2-ecs-9132829188e5)
* [David Colson](https://www.david-colson.com/2020/02/09/making-a-simple-ecs.html)
* [Stefan Reinalter (Molecular)](https://blog.molecular-matters.com/2013/10/22/implementing-a-semi-automatic-structure-of-arrays-data-container/)

And then I force fed ChatGPT with my ridicoulous requirements until it spat out enough broken code for me to clobber together some form of solution. To whit: I think I've arrived at a rather elegant solution? At least my very inexperienced ego is telling me as much.

In Niko Savas Blog I found him talking about SoA and AoS type storage, and seeing that it would be completley overkill for my application, I **needed** to implement SoA. But I didn't want to declare the Components like it's SoA. And I didn't want to access it like it's SoA. And I didn't want to register any Components. And I didn't want to use type traits for my Components.

And so I arrived at my flying unicorn ECS.

(to those who are about to say: just use entt, well yes I could do that, but why use a superior product when I can make an inferior version in a couple of weeks.)

Now, since I need to keep my ego in check somehow I thought I'd present it on here and let you fine people tell me how stupid I really am.

I'm not going to post the whole code, I just want to sanity check my thought process, I'll figure out all the little bugs myself, how else am I going to stay awake until 4 am? (also, the code is in a very ugly and undocumented state, and I'm doing my very best to procrastinate on the documentation)

# First: Entities

64-bit may be overkill, but if I didn't have megalomania I wouldn't be doing any of this.

The actual interaction of entities is done through an Entity class that stores a reference to the scene class (my Everything Manager, I didn't split entity and component managers up into individual classes, seemed unnecessarily cumbersome at the time, though the scene class is growing uncomfortably large)

# Components

    struct Transform{
      bool clean;
      glm::vec3 position;
      glm::quat rotation;
      glm::vec3 scale;
      glm::mat4 worldModelMatrix;
    };

Components are just aggregate structs. No type traits necessary. This makes them easy to define and maintain. The goal is to keep these as simple as possible and allow for quick iteration without having to correctly update dozens of defintions & declarations. This feature was one of the hardest to implement due to the sparse reflection capabilities of C++ (one of the many things I learned about on this journey).

# SoA Storage of Components

I handle the conversion to SoA type storage though my ComponentPool class that is structured something like so:

    template <typename T>
    using VectorOf = std::vector<T>;
    
    // Metafunction to transform a tuple of types into a tuple of vectors
    template <typename Tuple>
    struct TupleOfVectors;
    
    template <typename... Types>
    struct TupleOfVectors<std::tuple<Types...>> {
        using type = std::tuple<VectorOf<std::conditional_t<std::is_same_v<Types, bool>, uint8_t, Types>>...>; // taking care of vector<bool> being a PIA
    };
    
    template<typename cType>
    class ComponentPool : public IComponentPool {
    
        using MemberTypeTuple = decltype(boost::pfr::structure_to_tuple(std::declval<cType&>()));
        using VectorTuple = typename TupleOfVectors<MemberTypeTuple>::type;
        static constexpr size_t Indices = std::tuple_size<MemberTypeTuple>::value;
    
        VectorTuple componentData;
        std::vector<size_t> dense, sparse;
    
        // ... c'tors functions etc.
    };

 The VectorTuple is a datatype I generate using boost/pfr and some template metaprogramming to create a Tuple of vectors. Each memeber in the struct cType is given it's own vector in the Tuple. And this is where I'm very unsure of wether I'm stupid or not. I've not seen anyone use vectors for SoA. I see two possible reasons for that: 1. I'm very stupid and vectors are a horrible way of doing SoA 2. People don't like dealing with template metaprogramming (which I get, my head hurts). My thinking was why use arrays that have a static size when I can use vectors that get bigger by themselves. And they take care of memory management. But here I'd really appreciate some input for my sanities sake.

I also make use of sparse set logic to keep track of the Components. I stole the idea from David Colson. It's quite useful as it gives me an up to date list of all entities that have a component for free. I've also found that it makes sorting the vectors very simple since I can supply a new dense vector and quickly swap the positions of elements using std::swap (i think it works on everything except vector<bool>).

# Accessing Components

Finally, to access the data as if I was using AoS in an OOP style manner (e.g. `Transform.pos = thePos;` I use a handle class Component<cType> and a Proxy struct. The Proxy struct extends the cType and is declared inside the ComponentPool class. It has all it's copy/move etc. c'tors removed so it cannot persist past a single line of code. The Component<cType> overrides the -> operator to create and return an instance of a newly created proxy struct which is generated from the Tuple of Vectors. To bring the data back into the SoA storage I hijacked the destructor of the Proxy class to write the data back into the tuple of vectors.

    struct ComponentProxy : public cType {
            explicit ComponentProxy(ComponentPool<cType>& pool, EntityID entityId)
                : cType(pool.reconstructComponent(entityId)), pool(pool), entityId(entityId) {}
    
       ComponentPool<cType>& pool; // Reference to the parent Component class
       EntityID entityId;
    
       ~ComponentProxy() { pool.writeComponentToPool(*this, entityId); }
       ComponentProxy* operator->() { return this; }
    
       // ... delete all the copy/move etc. ctors
    }

This let's me access the type like so: 

    Entity myentity = scene.addEntity();
    myentity.get<Transform>()->position.x = 3.1415;

It does mean that when I change only the position of the Transform, the entire struct is getting reconstructed from the tuple of vectors and then written back, even though most of it hasn't changed. That being said, the performance critical stuff is meant to work via Systems and directly iterate over the vectors. Those systems will be kept close to the declaration of the components they concern, making maintaining them that much simpler.

Still I'm concerned about how this could impact things like multi-threading or networking if I ever get that far.

# Conclusion

If you've come this far, thank you for reading all that. I'm really not sure about any of this. So any criticism you may have is welcome. As I said I'm mostly curious about your thoughts on storing everything in vectors and on my method of providing AoS style access through the proxy.

So yeah, cheers and happy coding."
Towels,distractible,1i9k0g4,2025-01-25 05:14:57,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/distractible/comments/1i9k0g4/towels/,TJMurphy002,Most recent episode (potential spoilers),"Okay, so... i have a strong opinion about this and i dont think people talk enough about this.

Towels don't need to be changed after every shower.  If they do, you're showering badly.  They're for drying a clean body, so if you're only using your shower towel for your body, you're good for at least a few times drying.

DON'T SHARE TOWELS WITH PEOPLE.  That's gross.  It's bad enough most people use their own towels in different orientations to where face and crotch have touched the same spots, but now you're going to add in a second set of crotch gunk?  Stop it.

I have OCD, so i know this is one of my idiosyncracies, but like, hear me out.  I have the best way of using a shower towel.  I only buy towels that have their tag in a specific corner (lower right if you're wearing the towel on your shoulders) BECAUSE it shows the orientation of the towel.  I drape that towel over my shoulders, tag at the same spot as always, and dry my face with the upper inside right corner.  Then i flip the right outside up over my head to dry my hair.  This keeps me from needing a second towel to dry my hair but also keeps my head hair from being transferred to my body whilst drying the rest of me.  Then i flip the right side back down (back to cape form) and do the shimmy thing to dry my shoulder blades, go under my arms, use the inside left to dry my main body in the front (so not the same side my face was dried on), work the towel down to dry my back with the same part that was on my shoulders, then wrap the left side in first then right around my waist so that the body drying part is in direct contact with my genital area and the back part is around my butt as i wrap the towel around my hips (like a skirt).  I pat dry and dont scrub dry because i scrubbed in the shower (whole point of the shower is to get clean, which involves some sort of friction with a scrubbing device on skin).  My feet air dry because im not putting my wet, bathroom floor germ covered feet on my towel.  I have bathroom rugs/mats for that.  Long story short, my face never EVER touches the same part of the towel as my crotch and my hair never comes in contact with my body.  My towel never touches the floor, and my face part of the towel never comes in contact with the other side of the towel that deals with body, even when it's wrapped because i dont use the outside left side for drying.  It is a boundary for the face part to not touch the body part.  

I know this is excessive, but i can assuredly and efficiently dry myself quickly without worrying about if my nose just touched the part of the towel that my bum touched last because every time i use the towel, it's oriented the same way.  Face to face part, back to back part.  Towels last me 3-4 showers before i decide they need to be washed, and (i know this part isn't as common) i have 6 towels that swap out while the others are in the hamper waiting to go through the laundry cycle.

My dog also has her own towel and i treat it similarly so she doesnt have her muddy paw or butthole part touching her face or ears.  

It's clean, it's effective, it's easy to memorise once you see it in action, and it is the objectively CORRECT way to use towels.

I set out to do that with Runa here.
 Started out with Light Armor and Two-handed, but swapped to One-handed after mastering two handed. I didn't have much to do trophy wise, just complete the main story, the Dawnguard, and the Dragonborn. 
 After all 3 were done, I ran through the civil war questline to be able to purchase all the hearthfire homesteads, and built them all. After all of that, maxing smithing and enchanting, and a few questlines here and there, I was only about level 56. I had been playing on Master for awhile, and found it incredibly easy with dual-wielding Stalhrim maces, so I decided to level up quick with the telekinesis.
 After killing a Legendary dragon, I decided to let Runa rest after one more challenge. And you can see the quick results of that, on Master no less.

So ends the tale of Runa, the last Dragonborn. Shield-Maiden of the Empire, Vampirelord, and a mother.

"I do not like (most of) the Xenoblade X DE UI changes, here is why.",Xenoblade_Chronicles,1i9jmw5,2025-01-25 04:47:02,0,0.4,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenoblade_Chronicles/comments/1i9jmw5/i_do_not_like_most_of_the_xenoblade_x_de_ui/,Interesting-Injury87,Xenoblade X,"One thing in advance. I like the INCREASE in font size as well as select UI elements being bigger. While i personally didnt have a lot of problems with the UI originally(even on a CRT TV) i get why people did complain.

secondly, this is my personall opinion, you are free to discuss and tell me why you think i am wrong. But i dont claim i am objectivly right, this is how i personally feel and that is it.

  
And while i started trying to organize this.. this quickly devolved into a random collection of opinions whenever i ahd them.

  
What i am talking about is the changes in design that arent just ""bigger text"" and co.(altough text plays a part in this)

  
We now have quite a few images of the UI in combat and out of it. And i feel confortable to at least talk about them.

Typface:(as in.. just the way letters look, not their size, or color, that would be font)

  
XCX had a few different Typfaces, the Typface used in the Overdrive Gauge was different from the one used for Floating damage numbers, and both are different from the one used for ""UI elements""(like the Clock or HP numbers)

DE unifies it into 1 typeface as far as we can tell from all currently available screenshots. And its the most generic sans serif font imagimable. 

This is especially noticable with the overdrive counter, which went from a BEAUTIFULL ""blocky"" font(including the colors so its a font), where several numbers straight up look like they come from a seven segment display(2 5 6 3(to a lesser extent)being the most perfect example of this) it looked ""futurustic"" in that charming ""old school"" kinda way. the same font was also used in Xenoblade 2 DLC for Elmas unique mechanic. the Numbers change color depending on what ""combo"" you are in and POP



The new overdrive font(as we talk about styling as well its a font here) Is generic and flat in contrast, it stays white regardless of what combo you are on, and feels out of place in the ""gearwork"" that is the overdrive counter itself

What makes this even more outragous imo is that the COUNTDOWN, uses a different font, which IS more blocky, and form a small glance MAY be the Original typeface from the WII U version for the overdrive counter itself, just with a lot of the ""effects"" disabled or slightly reworked. The 6 on the ""countdown"" and the 6 in the counter in the original are VERY similiar but i wouldnt bet on it being the same, but at least very similiar.

  
The floating damage numbers in the WII U version used a ""squished"" looking font, which was noticable for numbers like 3 2 5 and 6, with flat tops and bottoms, with very sharp curves (basicaly just a half circle slapped at the end of 2 bars that dont touch each other) you never saw a Number curve upwards at the end of a prong(noticable at the 3 most commonly) this gave, to me, the Floating numbers a distinct look and ""removed"" them from the rest of the UI content to be more easily processed(this is PERSONAL OPINION)

  
The removal of the ""segments"" of the overdrive gauge in favor or just a countdown is... sad to me. It is more userfriendly now, but also imo, less fun, just having a countdown count down till you are out feels more ""game"" then the original gauge which felt mroe organic, basically overheating(which is what it is) and the gauge implying how much termal capacity remains (similair to how XC3 oroboros timer worked)



THERE WAS A SECTION ABOUT INFORMATION LOST THAT  DELETED AS I REALIZED THE INFORMATION IS STILL(mostlY) AVAILABLE BUT MOVED)



the new minimap looks boring and bland, it has no character, and you could swap its color and put it into XC2 or 3 and i honestly would be unlikely to notice, the X map had character and felt unique. It is mostly the ""frame"" the original one had that i am missing, and i dont understand why they had to ""sanitize"" the ui so much. 

The Quest reminders, imo, are to intrusive and could have been made smaller or semi transparent like the original one. They take up like a 12th of the screen(1/4 horizontal, 1/3 vertical from some short look) and are opaque., we can appereantly hide them via a button combo, which is good, but dosnt solve the problem of them being to big. (also i am weird and dont like them showing us where the locations for collectable items are for quests... it defeats the point of exploring and discovering imo, it took me a while to find the last items for the proficency exam in XCX on WII U, and it FELT like i acomplished something when i did finally find it. i hope this is a toggle or only triggers once you found one at least, but i doubt it is.)

  
The new squadtask ""tab"" while more information rich, now overrides the questreminder it seems. and i can imagine it being easier to miss a new squad task popping up now that there isnt a reminder in the bottom corner at any given time. That said, its better that we can now easily read what the tasks are instead of up to 6 button presses to scroll trough all of them. i would hvae liked a mix of the OG and new UI for those tho.

  
the TP bar..... i am torn a bit. on onehand, a lot of MP bars(which TP is, dont pretend it isnt) are under the HP bars.. but so are a lot of XP bars in games, I am also playing a  LOT of FFXIV where the MP bar is left of the HP bar s so seeing it below the HP bar now feels wrong to me. There is also the color change, in the OG the TP bar was green, easily differentiating it from the class XP bar, the regular XP bar, and the HP bar, now its a lighter shade of blue. making it more easily lost if you glance over. personal opinion i know.

The removal of the XP and Class XP bar was a good one tho, those being present where they where extended the UI unecesseraly.



the Frontiernav UI, the bit we saw made me genuinly sad. it looks so boring, flat and bland, it has basicaly no character now and they solved it in the most boring way imaginable.

  
The UI, overall, just feels like a ""prototype"" of how the UI should have become, before unique final graphics got made, or typefaces chosen.... it dosnt feel like X if that make sense. it feels like ""some generic Sci-Fi RPG"".. THATS WHAT THE MINIMAP REMINDS ME OFF, Star ocean the Divine force..(after looking at it, its not quite the same, but you could replace the minimap of either with the other and none would bat an eye)



the new Character menu where you can see everything at once is great tho

  
endword.

i am sure i will grow to at least, ""like"" the new UI. it isnt as abhorerent as i find the XC2 UI, I imagine that XCX lost a lot of unique things as it has to work on a handheld as well now as a primary way.

the UI was ""alright"" on the Gamepad, but certainly not good, so i can see them reworking it to be as FRIENDLY as possible for the handheld mode. which is a shame

You know how most memecoins come and go, right? They ride the hype, make some noise, and then vanish. But $DOGEFATHER? That’s a different story. This one’s built to last, and it’s doing things most other tokens only dream of.


---

The Power of Community

Here’s what makes $DOGEFATHER stand out—it’s all about the people. Have you ever seen a token where holders actually get a say in decisions? That’s what this project is doing. The community isn’t just watching from the sidelines; they’re in the game, helping shape the future. This kind of connection makes the project stronger and gives everyone a reason to stick around.


---

No Secrets, Just Trust

Let’s be real—trust is hard to find in crypto. Projects promise the world and then disappear. But with $DOGEFATHER, it’s different. Everything is transparent, from updates to decisions. You don’t have to guess what’s happening because they keep the community in the loop. And with 35% of the supply locked in a smart contract, there’s no chance of a rug pull. That’s a big deal in a space where scams are all too common.


---

Thinking Long-Term

Most memecoins are about quick flips and fast money. $DOGEFATHER? It’s playing the long game. The locked supply shows they’re serious about building stability. This isn’t just about hype; it’s about creating something that lasts. And honestly, it’s refreshing to see a memecoin with an actual plan for the future.


---

Why $DOGEFATHER is Different

It’s easy to call every new token “just another memecoin,” but $DOGEFATHER is proving that wrong. It’s driven by a passionate community, built on transparency, and focused on sustainability. That’s a rare combo in crypto.

How do I maximize under-bed storage?,Bedscape,1i9h86t,2025-01-25 01:47:06,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bedscape/comments/1i9h86t/how_do_i_maximize_underbed_storage/,noah99212,,"Maximizing under-bed storage can be a game-changer for small spaces or decluttering! Here are some ideas and tips:

**1. Invest in Storage Containers**

* **Clear bins**: Use transparent plastic bins so you can easily see what's inside.
* **Rolling containers**: Bins or drawers with wheels make it easier to slide them in and out.
* **Vacuum-sealed bags**: Great for reducing bulk, especially for seasonal clothing or bedding.

**2. Use Bed Risers**

* Add risers to elevate your bed for more storage space. Some risers come with built-in outlets or USB ports for added functionality.

**3. Opt for Bed Frames with Built-in Storage**

* Swap out your standard bed frame for one with built-in drawers or shelves underneath.

**4. Organize by Category**

* Assign each bin or drawer a specific purpose, like winter clothes, shoes, or extra linens, to keep everything tidy and easy to find.

**5. Label Everything**

* Use labels on opaque containers or bags for quick identification without having to open everything.

**6. Use Under-Bed Shoe Organizers**

* Flat, zippered shoe organizers can fit neatly under most beds and protect shoes from dust.

**7. Consider Sliding Trays**

* Low-profile sliding trays can help you utilize the full depth of the under-bed space, especially for items you use frequently.

**8. DIY Dividers**

* If your bed frame has a wide-open under-bed space, add dividers to prevent items from sliding around.

**9. Keep it Clean**

* Use a bed skirt to hide your under-bed storage and protect the area from dust."

You’re doing your own thing, being an absolute menace to other players (ankle biting, stealing eggs, etc etc) and you come across someone with the most pompous, righteous attitude that you’re surprised they’re not the leader of a clan.

Typical CoS global chat beef. ‘I am strong and I can do whatever I want! Don’t make me mad. Don’t you do it, you won’t like me when I’m mad’. So of course I NEED to see what this all powerful creature is. I find them making demands of a nesting desp.

Opra. They’re an opra. A teen opra. I get out my darling no mutation no traits bellu, put on a pie and void plushie, and kill them without getting hit. They then complain that I’m too small (I’m a tier 1) and that I do too much damage (how is this my problem).

Revenge killing is a thing. This player calls me stupid because ‘they have a revive token’. They fly back and then start fighting the desp for?? Not protecting them?? They try to throw the desp in the lava since they were nesting at volcano. I, of course, jump down and start pulverizing the teen opra again. They fly off into the ocean to heal.

Rinse and repeat. Five or so times. They come back to volcano, I start attacking them, they dive back into the ocean to heal. After this fifth attempt I decide ‘yknow what, I have 3 bite trait Euvias in storage. I wanna use them here.’ So while the opra is in the sea healing (and it grows to adult and boasts about how I’m ’done for now that they have their breath), I swap my bellu for a Euvias.

I’d gotten them to half with the bellu, so it’s quick work with the Euvias. Death two for the opra. I sit in the ocean to get my breath and stamina back. Lo and behold they revived AGAIN. At this point I am saying in pack chat to come and watch because I question how many revives this person is going to waste.

‘Why are you attacking me?’ Asks the opra currently getting bled to death via pie plushie.

‘You came back over here? And you were being an absolute edgelord in global chat. This is just comedy.’

Round three. They attack me with healing hunter active. They’re attacking. With healing hunter. Okay. Thunderstorm happens halfway through and by now there’s a whole group of people sitting on the side of volcano watching this go down. Death three for the opra.

Would you believe me if I said there was a round four? Because there was (if you can even call it that). They came up to me and asked ‘will you stop attacking me if I let you play as the creature I’m playing’. Insert post title here. When did that ever come up as being part of the fight. And LET ME play as that creature? What.

Round four is short lived because they started to run away and I was worried about being dubbed a ‘targetter’ despite them returning four times. Because you know. Cos player logic.

Anyways shoutout to that random koh player that swam up on this fight and menu’d after putting a whole line of question marks in chat."

The State of EVs in 2025 - LIVE! | Talking Cars with Consumer Reports,electricvehicles,1i9fvf7,2025-01-25 00:17:48,1,0.53,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1i9fvf7/the_state_of_evs_in_2025_live_talking_cars_with/,WeldAE,Discussion,"I've long ago given up on CR with it comes to EVs. I honestly don't think they hate EVs, just no one on staff likes or tries to keep up with the industry. You would think they would hire someone that sort of kinda likes EVs. A lot of the issues with [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=657e0sQDDdo) is because of lack of knowledge. Of course, they picked the questions and the questions are where the problem is, and they basically validated the questions by not knowing why they were false questions.

The three participants all reported on what car they would buy:

* Jennifer - Wanted a PHEV Honda Ridgeline but since that does exist ICE.
* Alex - Would buy an ICE car or maybe a Hybrid.
* Jake - Just bought a car and it was a manual ICE car.
* Dave - Wasn't asked as he was running the chat questions live

Timestamps:

* [Opening comments on the State of EVs in 2025](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=47) \- 8.7% market share and not just Tesla now, a lot more hybrids, lots of delayed and canceled EVs and politics is going against them.
* [2012 Tesla Model S had to replace battery for $20k](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=231) \- Implied that all EVs have battery problems, maybe used batteries are the answer?
* [My Versa gets 40mpg, why do I need an EV](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=328) EVs are not for everyone, but a hybrid will be nicer than the ICE Verse.
* [F-150 Lightning in Wisconsin](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=409) \- You are brave to own an EV in that condition.  Do you even use your EV truck as a truck? Winter tire is going to reduce range and might not be livable.  EVs warm up much better than ICE cars.
* [Adapting to road trips with an EV](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=514) \- Alex reluctantly takes them because it's his job.  Agreed that Tesla is fine, but non-Tesla is not.
* [Trump is going to pull the plug on EVs](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=556) \-Jake points out that the auto industry needs stability.  Alex thinks BEVs are a question mark if they will make it.
* [Why are the Model 3/Y depreciating so fast](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=731) \- Alex said batteries will die, so no one wants them used. Jack thinks used car buyers can't charge, so not as attractive to them, and the tech is changing too quickly.  Points out the 2012 Model S didn't have Autopilot as an example and EVs with Chademo.
* [Asked Panelists EV or ICE for their car](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=921)
* [Will hydrogen make a comeback](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=1024) \- Yes
* [Considering a Vinfast or Hybrid](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=1271) \- Hybrid unless Vinfast is near free.
* [Will US get battery swap for EVs](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=1344) \- No.
* [Federal Road Taxes](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=1533) \- Need to pay for the road, and EVs are harder on the roads.
* [Where do EV batteries end up after the car is scraped](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=1729) \- Didn't know, but probably recycling and repurposed for other uses.
* [Are EVs throw away since the battery only lasts 10 years](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=1831) \- Not just EVs being thrown away, and EVs will stabilize once they quit changing so fast.
* [Will EVs get more reliable](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=1983) \- They already have, but they have to build them more basic without all the features.
* [Why are EV Radiators Hidden](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=2136) \- To look different and EVs don't have the same need for cooling.
* [Are EVs better for the environment](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=2224) \- Maybe, but it's very much an open question.
* [Should EVs be required to have heated headlights and taillights](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=2370) \- No, all cars with LEDs have this issue.
* [Top EV](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=2515)
   * Jennifer - Ioniq5 / BMW i5 / BMW iX
   * Jake - Ioniq5 N
   * Alex - Ioniq6
* [Will EVs get more Affordable](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=2687) \- Mostly No.  EVs dominate luxury and sports cars, and these classes are expensive.
* [Will Insurance Remain High for EVs](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=2934) \- They will remain high but shop around.
* [What car do you want to be an EV](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=3065)
   * Jennifer - Honda Ridgeline
   * Jake - Convertible Roadster Sports Car
   * Alex - PHEV pickup trucks

Granite Station Fuel 'N Go,HFY,1i9fhon,2025-01-24 23:55:10,244,0.99,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i9fhon/granite_station_fuel_n_go/,darkPrince010,OC,"Granite Station had been forgotten by nearly all who had traveled past it, even those who stopped for a quick refuel and a bite of something slightly fresher than dehydrated rations and cubes. The ship-fuel depot was one of a hundreds of such waypoints, and while it was technically mobile, it could always be found anchored at the edge of the Granite Field asteroid belt that gave it its name. The asteroids were barely worth the credits of blasting semi-precious metals out of them, and so It was frequented often by only the most hard-put-upon miners and freehaulers.

The station was veritable Ship of Theseus, a custom amalgamation of bits and pieces of slightly-less-broken starships and station platforms cobbled together over nearly three decades, and it was Goodman’s pride and joy. 

Humans were seemingly one of the few races in the galaxy who didn’t mind a life of unglamorous and often-underappreciated work. Goodman himself often said he wanted nothing more out of life than to help where he was needed, and maybe one day to go sightseeing across the stars. This entire arm of the galaxy was dotted with dozens of such stations, each typically offering fuel and amenities for crews passing by, but rarely visited by royal star cruisers or world-defense fleets. Those larger vessels had power and resupply needs far in excess of what a lone, modest station like Goodman’s could provide, even immediately after a full restocking. For less important ships and schedules, though—often for the mining caste of Geranians, Lifun workers, or even humans themselves—such a fuel depot was a welcome stop for ships running on fumes, hoping to carry a modest cargo just a bit further to eke out a living.

Many years had passed, with Goodman’s son and daughter both growing from bouncing toddlers he often had to weave between while cooking up still-wiggling alien tentacles for patrons, to now helping just as much as he did, sometimes more. When the years reminded him of their presence and he needed to take a breather, he could count on Charlotte and David to pick up the slack. Just like his old man, David managed to make one meal’s worth of supplies feed half a dozen, while Charlotte had more accuracy with the fueling port crane than he ever did, often getting a ship hooked up and halfway filled before her old man would have even secured a latch.

Goodman sometimes joked that Granite Station’s one modest claim to fame was its relative proximity to Italion, the capital of the Imperium of Allied Systems and a hub world for billions. The planet was so densely packed that it was said one could live, grow old, and die, and never see the unobstructed night sky overhead. Goodman often told his children this was truly how the station got its name: Not from the asteroid belt, but because, as he’d say with a chuckle and a knowing wink, “We are always taken for *granite.”* The joke never failed to draw groans and a few chuckles from his long-suffering children.

---

The events of the Tarkanian Burst began with simple static across the radio signals of the holoplayer-radio, something even a few firm slaps to the aged device failed to fix. Goodman usually assumed such things were caused by failing, worn-out tech, since the entire fuel depot was cobbled together from parts of varying ages and conditions. However, when other miners and haulers reported their ship communications were also disrupted, Goodman began to worry the problem might be bigger than a broken radio.

The holo-radio channel Goodman always listened to, Tynovus Prime, was broadcast from the famous planet of the same name: A massive hub of antennas and transmitters with such redundancy that disruptions rarely occurred and, if they did, lasted only seconds. 

But this time, no response came. Nearly all the one-way planetary channels were filled with static, while the two-way ship-based channels carried disjointed reports of damage, disruption, chaos, and people fleeing from a disaster still unfolding.

A survey probe ship, between jobs for the Royal Tekedaa, had ventured deeper than most dared into the zone of destruction. It reported that the path of devastation seemed to follow a singular direction, flowing back toward what had been considered a safely-distant black hole dubbed Tarkanian. The astrological phenomena had only been lightly cataloged, and the reports had missed a dark gas giant in its orbit, the massive planets countless tons of mass unilluminated by any nearby stars. It appeared that in the millennia since, the gas giant’s decaying orbit brought it close enough for its atmosphere to be ripped away, suddenly adding billions of tons of charged gas to the black hole’s accretion disk. The result was a massive, tightly focused beam of high-energy, radioactive particles, emitted along the black hole’s axis.

This quasar, though anticipated to be short-lived as far as astronomical phenomena go, was calculated to pour forth its power for hours, perhaps even days, while the gas was consumed and obliterated. 

As communications were gradually restored while the Tarkanian quasar’s pulse faded, attention turned to the beam’s trajectory. The capital of the Allied Planets, Italion, was perilously close to the perimeter of the beam. While the capital avoided the edge of the beam by hundreds of millions of kilometers, the communication world Tynovus Prime was not as fortunate. It was sterilized, vast swaths of its surface turned to outrightds slag by the sheer force of the flare.

Somber relief at the capitol world’s survival soon turned to horror; Observations revealed that while the planet itself had been spared, its star had received a glancing blow from the beam. This impact wasn’t enough to immediately trigger a supernova—a small miracle in and of itself—but the star’s stability was irreparably compromised. With each passing day, solar flares began lashing out repeatedly, scouring towards the capital world itself.

This threat galvanized action. Hundreds of fleets filled with warships, carriers, and other ponderous vessels from across the alliance mobilized. Evacuating the entire planet was deemed effectively impossible, but another plan began to unfold even as transports began trying to save what small fraction of the populace they could. The large ships were flown into careful orbits around the capital planet, and these vessels extended their protective shield bubbles to form a lattice of shielding between thousands of ships, effectively replicating a planetary shield facing off against the raging star.

Goodman and others watched with bated breath, as the maneuver had been just in the nick of time too as the magnetic belts around the planet began to falter. With each new solar flare, the planet’s natural defenses were becoming exhausted, allowing more and more dangerous radiation to seep through. But now, thanks to the planetary shield lattice, they had bought some time. 

How much time, however, was uncertain. The sun continued to shudder, struggling against the forces tearing it apart. The frequent, unpredictable flares battered the shielding ships, depleting their fuel reserves at an alarming rate.

Goodman listened intently to the newscasts. There was a glimmer of hope: the Barvan Collective had developed a solar extraction rig, initially designed for mining exotic plasmas from the surfaces of stars in solar nurseries they controlled. The Collective scientists believed it could be repurposed to help stabilize the degrading sun. 

Unfortunately, the rig was large, cumbersome, and barely capable of faster-than-light travel. It would take weeks to arrive. By then, more pessimistic scientists and reporters predicted, there might be little of the population, or the planet itself, left to save.

That was when David and Charlotte saw their father sit up, his expression sharp and resolute in a way they hadn’t seen before. Without a word, he grabbed the microphone for the holo-radio, and flipped it to *Transmit* as he opened a wide-broadcast channel. “Not sure who all is receiving right now, but this is Granite Station. We’ll be in the shadow of Italion’s fifth planet as soon as we can. Hope to see some friends there.”

With that, Goodman shut off the channel and turned to his children. “You two, make sure the last patrons here are taken care of and happy before they’re sent out. Then sweep up and lock down,” he said, striding to flip the lit-up sign in the window from *Yes, We’re Open!* to *Closed. Come Again Soon!* “Meanwhile, I’ll be down warming up the engines.”

The siblings exchanged excited looks. They couldn’t recall ever seeing Granite Station actually fly anywhere, except for the occasional small booster push to maintain orbit or avoid a stray asteroid. They’d certainly never seen it jump to faster-than-light travel.

Barely a quarter-hour later, the station groaned and creaked as the stars streaked past, glowing lines of blue-white as it jumped through the ether. Then, with a lurch and a deep groan that reverberated through the structure, the station dropped out of FTL travel and switched to standard thruster propulsion.

In the distance, they saw the faint glimmer of the pulsing star, so small they could easily cover it with a thumb when looking out the window. Beyond that, Italion itself was just a distant speck, glowing unnaturally bright blue from the combined mass of shields protecting it.

But then the view was abruptly obscured by a looming mass. Goodman had brought the station into orbit behind Italion's fifth planet. The planet was rocky, lifeless, and barren, save for a few failed mining attempts from ages past. Despite its lack of mineral wealth, it provided a vital physical bulwark against any flares that might stray their way.

“All right, kids,” Goodman said, descending the dusty ladder from the piloting tower and returning to the diner and depot. “Let’s make the most of this. I’ve updated Schwarzkof to know about our new drop-off for fuel, water, and food. He’s still doing rounds on the back end of the Garnian sphere and isn’t due to the station for another week anyway. He bumped me to the top of his list, but he’s gotta finish over there first, so we’re looking at five days before we see his mug poking around here.”

The kids nodded, and Goodman saw the spark of focus as they sprinted off to their positions, preparing the station for service once more. Returning to the radio, he opened a targeted two-way broadcast, limited to the Italion system. “Attention all vessels in need of refuel and restock: This is Granite Station, orbiting behind the fifth planet. Ready for any who need to cycle out and stop by.”

A chorus of affirmatives replied in a dozen languages, alongside hundreds of simple chimes of acknowledgment from captains too busy or unwilling to respond verbally. Goodman had barely returned to the navigation array when landing sequence requests began trickling in.

At first, it was three or four vessels—medium to small cruisers that wouldn’t strain the station’s fuel reserves. But the trickle quickly became a stream, with medium and larger ships arriving. Goodman's calculations showed the station's fuel reserves dwindling to barely ten percent of capacity by day’s end.

His heart sank as he watched the incoming ships on the automatic scans. Several were visibly damaged, smoking, or crackling where their shielding had started to fail, leaving them exposed to fire and radiation. Gritting his teeth, Goodman assigned landing platforms, calculated ETAs, and stretched their resources as far as they would go. The last dozen ships in the queue were warned they might leave empty-handed if the earlier arrivals consumed all the remaining fuel. Still, Goodman extended an invitation for their crews to board for a meal, a shower, or whatever hygienic ritual their species required.

Then, a priority chime sounded. The alert was accompanied by a clear and distinct clarion call—the unmistakable signal of the Order of the Divine Fulcrum, renowned monks and aid workers that had been eagerly awaited by all affected along the quasar’s destructive path.

*“Attention, Granite Station. This is the* Axis of Camaraderie. *We are requesting docking and refueling, if you’ll have us.”*

There was kindness in the request, but also a note of urgency. Goodman's heart sank further when he saw the size of the vessel—a full capital ship nearly five times the length of Granite Station itself. On a good day, they might have had enough reserves to fill *half* of its power capacitors and fuel tanks. Now, he knew they could offer little more than a few vapors, if that.

Taking a deep breath, he keyed the comm. ""Acknowledged, *Axis of Camaraderie.* Unfortunately, it looks like we'll be—""

*”-diverting you to another station.”*

Another voice cut in over the radio, and Goodman froze. Staring out the window in shock, he saw another station emerging from lightspeed. This one was a more compact and squat affair, with large tanks of fuel replacing the diner and amenities Granite Station offered. It had far fewer landing ports and a single fueling crane, but to Goodman, it was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen.

A familiar voice came over the comm. *""Howdy, you old coot,""* it said. *""We decided we wanted to help too. Gotta make sure you’re representing humanity right, eh?""*

Goodman’s brow furrowed in confusion. “Ezekiel? Is that the *Crimson Cove*? What do you mean *we*? You pilot that scrapheap solo.”

In response, he just received a laugh. Goodman couldn’t help but laugh in exhilaration as well, as more and more notification pings filled the air. Ships were emerging from hyperspeed—not warships or massive transports with shielding or evacuation capacity, but stations like his. Most were crewed by humans, and many were run by people Goodman recognized from years of cooperation and story-swapping.

As he watched the other stations fly in to anchor orbits, he could see repair bays and docking gantries were fully deployed. He hurried about the rooms of their boarding house, flattening platform couches out into beds, and pulling retractable bunks from walls to transform rooms for dozens into makeshift sleeping quarters for hundreds. It wasn’t luxury, but it was far better than the claustrophobic quarters and grueling schedules aboard a ship of the line.

Dozens of eateries had also thrown open their doors. Goodman caught snippets over the radios of cooks and staff issuing orders, repurposing fine dining areas into mess halls capable of feeding entire starship crews in one sitting.

And, most importantly, nearly every station carried fuel reserves, and together they had enough to refuel fleets of the largest capital ships ever built a hundred times over.

The *Axis of Camaraderie* had already docked at the *Crimson Cove,* and more requests for docking permissions poured in as other capital ships arrived, many showing visible signs of damage. Goodman began to wonder how many of those crews had been prepared to sacrifice everything, selling their very lives, to buy just a few more hours for salvation to arrive.

Now, thanks to the growing fleet of stations, those ships could cycle back, refuel, repair damage, and let their exhausted crews recover. Shields that had been held at maximum for hours or even days could remain interlocked, protecting the planet below from the relentless onslaught.

---

Goodman had lost track of how many days had passed. Schwarzkof had arrived two days earlier than Goodman’s initial estimate—just in time, as the Granite Station’s fuel reserves were dipping dangerously close to empty. The android hadn’t come alone; instead, he brought a small flotilla of fueling tankers. Giving Goodman a sly wink, he said, **""[Figured with all the do-gooding going on, there’d be plenty of others who might need some fuel as well.]""**

When Goodman moved to pay, the robot’s credit beacon malfunctioned. The android scowled good-naturedly before chuckling. **""[Well, I suppose if you can’t pay for it, it’s free,]""** he said.

Before Goodman could respond, Charlotte, sitting nearby and taking a quick breather with a tall cup of *bernahr* juice, piped up. ""I could probably fix that for you if you want—""

She was cut off by her father’s raised hand. Goodman kept his eyes locked on the android. ""Are you sure?""

The android’s multi-lens gaze shifted from Goodman to Charlotte, and then, after a long pause, back to Goodman. **""[I’m sure,]""** he said. **""[Besides, the probability will be good for business in the long run!]""**

Goodman nodded silently, and the android waved off any further protests before returning to his ship.

Only a few hours later, Goodman stepped out to the edge of the docking platforms to catch a breath of fresh air. Granite Station’s atmosphere bubble was fresher than most—something Goodman had always taken great care to maintain. He gazed out at the thousands of ships that had cycled in for refueling and resupply. Dozens more arrived by the day, helping to shield the planet and allowing those in dire need to escape to the relative safety behind the fifth moon. Almost equal in number were the straggler stations arriving as well, almost the entire face of the sun-guarded side of the rocky planet saturated with orbiting way stations.

It was a dazzling sight—a sparkling sea of colors and shapes, ships and lights. Music and chatter filled the air and the radio channels, creating a sense of unity amidst the chaos.

Suddenly, a low rumbling beneath his feet caused the station to gently rock. Goodman froze, worried the star might have finally erupted, rendering all their efforts futile. But as he looked up, he saw space ripple and shift, the starfield’s light bending slightly as an enormous shape dropped out of lightspeed.

It was the Collective’s solar miner, accompanied by a fleet of scientific support ships, here to complete the adjustments that had dominated the news for the past half week.

Cheers erupted around him. Goodman could hear whoops, shouts of excitement, clapping, and whistling. Crews on nearby stations waved and gestured, thrilled at the sight. The final piece of the plan had arrived. For the first time, Goodman allowed himself to hope—it might just be okay after all.

---

In the decades that followed, Granite Station became legendary. Visitors who managed to arrive before Goodman’s retirement could hardly believe that such a momentous act had been sparked by a humble station. Though the station still looked much the same, nearly every component had been replaced or updated, thanks to the generosity of those who had benefited from its service during the crisis.

If David is around, he’ll eagerly give you a tour of the eatery, pointing out various spots where he once served alien dishes he had only read about in books. He quickly figured out suitable recipes based on his knowledge, suggestions from crew members, and advice from his father, doing his best to stretch a week’s worth of supplies into meals for ten times the number of people in half the time. He credits this experience as the “final push,” as his father would say, that urged him to pursue a career in the culinary arts. David went on to become a renowned chef for the Royal Tekedaa.

Charlotte, on the other hand, is always there, happily managing the station after Goodman retired. She can often be found in her workshop tinkering with gadgets or updating the station’s systems, chasing down any number of small quirks that arise on a vessel of that size. She, too, has her share of stories, from refueling Royal cruisers and Imperial warships back to back, to a particularly nerve-wracking incident involving the defusing of an unstable reactor core on a pleasure yacht.

If you ask either of them where Goodman is these days, they’ll glance toward the vast field of stars and say he’s out there somewhere—probably stopping to offer a ride, fix a hypercoil, or share a sandwich and a story with someone in need.

37/M almost 4 years and almost happy with it,finehair,1i9eeuc,2025-01-24 22:51:58,106,0.92,23,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9eeuc,Vitoseph2,Misc,"I've been growing out my hair for nearly 4 years. I started with the usual male mindset of (2in1 shampoo, once a week, nothing else) and I slowly experimented on my own. I didn't ask for advice or help for a long time. I was afraid of people judging me as being too ""girly""

After swapping to separate shampoo and conditioner (about 5 months in) I wasn't making much headway. I started to think ""how do most women's hair look so great?"" And then I had the idea to use women's hair products instead of men's. It made an instant change, like within 2 weeks. My hair was less greasy, softer, and my dandruff started getting better.

About another 6 months later, I hadn't made much new progress. My hair was longer, but it felt really thin and fine (which it is, but worse than it is now). I decided to try using some more expensive brands, but I wasn't sure what to get, and I still had a hard time talking to people about it. I also still hadn't discovered the use of a hair dryer or a proper brush instead of a men's comb. I ended up getting about 4 different brands and shampoos/conditioners for hydration, volumizing, and repair. Again, I started to see very quick results. My hair started to be less thin looking, even softer, yet felt more durable. It still wasn't very long but I started having less breakage too.

After about another year (roughly 2 years into growing hair out) I think I finally got my first trim and finally worked up the courage to go in to an actual salon to ask for recommendations. I made the jump into trying some more expensive products (my choice, I asked them about different price points). I started using Oribe gold last and hair alchemy. I absolutely love how concentrated it is so I have to use like 1/4-1/3 the amount I have to for other brands. My hair started to be healthier looking and feeling than ever before. This is also when I got an actual hairdryer and went through like 6 different brushes trying to find one I actually liked. And I swapped from regular hair ties to exclusively using scrunchies.

Another year and a half went by and I got about 4 inches chopped off. The women at the salon (and almost everywhere I go now) complimented me a lot and seemed actually jealous of my hair. This was such a huge confidence boost the first time I experienced it, I can't even explain it. Like I, a guy, actually got compliments! I still feel giddy and happy every time this happens. 

There's only a couple things I'm trying to fine tune and narrow down with my routine. I got a new hairdryer (drybar single shot to go with my other basic revlon) to try and dry my ends better, and a silk pillowcase. I'm trying to reduce e damage and improve gloss and shine for my hair at this point. I don't color or bleach my hair at all so the pics are all natural and recent. A week ago I got some new after shower serums (I'd never used anything that I'd put in after conditioner prior to now). I think they're helping but we'll see soon if my previous experience tells me anything.


I'd also appreciate any suggestions on routine, products, treatments, or anything else you can think of."

Anycubic Kobra 2 Neo upgrades and mods. I have some questions!,3Dprinting,1i9dm4u,2025-01-24 22:07:35,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1i9dm4u/anycubic_kobra_2_neo_upgrades_and_mods_i_have/,mihaiioan,Question,"Hey everyone! I recently got into 3D printing and am absolutely hooked. My journey started with experimenting on an older Anycubic Mega X that a friend had lying around, and after just 3 days of testing and getting my hands dirty, I decided to invest in my own printer. I ended up ordering the Anycubic Kobra 2 Neo—limited budget, so no Bambu or Prusa for now, but I’m excited to make the most of what I have!

Now, I’m looking to upgrade and improve my Kobra 2 Neo, and I’d really appreciate any advice, links to mods, or your experiences with similar upgrades. Here’s what I’d like to work on:

1. **Improving Z-axis stability:** I’m thinking of adding a dual Z-axis mod with a synced belt system. I see no need for a second motor—seems like overkill—and a belt with a tensioner looks like a much simpler and effective solution.
2. **X-axis linear rail upgrade:** The default roller system is wearing out quickly; there’s a lot of residue building up on the rollers. I’ve seen linear rail kits for other Kobra models, and I think I can adapt one for the Kobra 2 Neo.
3. **Y-axis linear rail upgrade:** There’s noticeable wobble in the heated bed, and I suspect the roller mechanism is to blame. Switching to linear rails should help stabilize it.
4. **Quick-Change Tool Head** \- it would be amazing if i could fast swap the entire print head assembly

If you’ve done similar mods, have any recommendations, or know of kits, guides, or parts that would work, please share! I’d also love to hear about your experience with upgrading budget printers like this one. Any tips, tricks, or links are super welcome. Thanks in advance!

I will be back with more updates, photos and stuff that I have improved so far."
The current Lore my interpretation of Kitsunami,CharacterAMARoleplay,1i9djhb,2025-01-24 22:03:42,6,1.0,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterAMARoleplay/comments/1i9djhb/the_current_lore_my_interpretation_of_kitsunami/,KitsunamiReacts_,Personal Lore,"(Finally after a week of writing this down I can finally show the lore of my interpretation of Kitsunami. Sorry if what I say seems long and rehashes what is already known of canon Kit as I decided to frame it as if this was the first time Kitsunami was ever introduced and my interpretation only holds minor changes.  Starting from Capabilities and fail-safe, they are explained as if told through Dr. Starline video logs with the last ability being explained through the perspective of Kit's diary)

**Kitsunami Ketsukane’s lore/Backstory**

Operation: Remaster is a plan designed to transform the hero-versus-villain dynamic, or in other words break what Dr. Starline called “The Sonic Cycle.” However, the real goal behind this operation was to prove his worth to the doctor he idolizes.

Step One: Starline planned to remove Dr. Eggman from the equation and take his place, all without the doctor’s lack of change.

Step Two: Replace the so-called “heroes” who hindered the possibility of change. The general population depended too heavily on these figures, finding it easier to swap out the “celebrities” than to shift the attitudes of the populace. The platypus asserts that by controlling the ""hero vs. villain"" dynamic, he will be able to influence the world and its people in line with the dramatic narratives they have grown accustomed to.

This leads us to Kitsunami, or Kitsunami Ketsukane, as he prefers to be called—the sorrowful sidekick and the imposter meant to take the place of Miles ""Tails"" Prower. Initially an average individual, Starline somehow obtained Kitsunami and transformed the young fennec by integrating cybernetic enhancements and research on the artificial chaos created by the doctor’s grandfather, utilizing Power Cores and biological data from Sonic and Tails. He also enhanced Kit’s physical durability with the Metal Virus and crafted a new personality and memories using codes acquired from Dr Eggman’s wooden robot daughter, Belle.

Kit was specifically designed to assist Surge the Tenrec, with Starline modeling him after Sonic's sidekick, Tails. Following this, Kit underwent hypnotic sessions where Starline implanted false motivations, leading him to develop a distorted attachment to Surge and a desire to help her unconditionally. Both Kit and Surge were subjected to numerous tests, and whenever they showed signs of frustration, Starline would wipe their memories through hypnosis, which inflicted considerable psychological trauma on both of them.

But this only went according to Starline's plan for so long. Like many instances before, Surge and Kitsunami grew curious of what the doctor had truly done to them. This curiosity led them to investigate Starline’s video logs, where they ultimately uncovered the horrifying truths behind their creation.

Expecting the two to grew curious once again Starline found the two within his computer room where the platypus attempted to wipe the memories of the imposter but in a pivotal moment, Surge seized Starline's glove and used it to render the platypus unconscious. Afterward, as Surge declared her intention to eliminate everyone associated with Sonic, Kit proposed a cunning plan: they could leverage Starline for her scheme by pretending to adhere to his original intentions, then eliminate him, Eggman, and Sonic when the opportunity arose. As the Starline had awakened, Kit and Surge had fained ignorance to what they found and continued to play along with Starline’s plan.

Upon reaching Eggperial City, the new capital of Eggman, Kit and Surge learned from Orbot that Sonic and Tails had entered the city. Sticking to their plan, Surge confronted Sonic while Kit faced Tails, who initially thought there had been a misunderstanding. Despite Tails' efforts to connect with and support him, Kit dismissed his kindness, grappling with his identity in the absence of Surge. During their encounter, Kit openly expressed his disdain for Dr. Starline, blaming him for what happened to him and affirming his loyalty to Surge's mission to defeat Sonic.

As the battle progressed, Kit managed to catch Tails off guard but soon encountered a significant setback when his hydro-pack ran out of water. Overwhelmed with panic at the thought of disappointing Surge, he ultimately fell victim to Tails, rendering him unconscious upon deactivation of his hydro-pack. Tails, along with Belle, carried the unconscious Kit back to Sonic, where the boy eventually awoke, only to hear about the presumed demise of Surge. This revelation shattered Kit's reality as he called out for Surge.

Shortly after receiving such devastating news, the world around the fennec started to warp, and Kit unexpectedly found himself in a city that seemed to belong to a different part of Mobius—or at least a version of it. Overwhelmed by grief and unsure of what to do in his new surroundings, the fennec ventured into the bustling crowd, searching for someone he could be of use to. His previous exposure to Dr. Starline’s hypno-glove and the distorted understanding of his purpose compelled him to seek out a way to be of use. 

During his search, Kit came across Scott, a human, and Kanako, a fox-like monster, who offered the fennec a place to call home. Initially, the couple seemed like a way for Kit to feel useful to someone, but as time passed, he began to see them as family. His fear of losing another loved one drove him to prioritize their safety and well-being above all else.

**Capabilities and Fail-Safe**

**Starline Log #8 Hydrokinesis**

Hydrokinesis—the ability to manipulate water solely with the mind—is an incredibly intriguing skill, yet it can be quite challenging to develop in someone without any prior connection to it. However, I didn’t need to fret due to knowing that the foundation was already laid by the remarkable creations of the doctor's grandfather: Artificial Chaos beings. These entities are equipped with an AI-driven system that enables them to generate cohesion in water and create controlled shapes for basic functions, all powered by chaos-drives. The craftsmanship involved is so meticulous that integrating it with my own innovative design would naturally suggest that the fennec would share similar traits. My hypothesis proved to be correct: Kitsunami exhibited abilities akin to those of the Artificial Chaos. With each test, he appeared to become more adept at controlling his powers, with his range of control expanding. However, the fennec seemed to have reached a plateau, managing to control only up to 300,000 gallons for some time… how unfortunate!

**Starline log #9 The Hydro-pack**

The hydro-pack, a brilliant invention of my own design, is a backpack capable of gradually extracting and storing water vapor from the air, providing a supply for Kitsunami's hydrokinesis. Additionally, this clever device serves as an emergency fail-safe; after all, I wouldn’t be a doctor if I didn’t consider every possible contingency, right? The hydro-pack was specifically crafted to be the heart of Kitsunami's cybernetic enchantments. If the pack is separated from Kitsunami or forcibly disabled, it will ultimately cause the fennec to lose consciousness after a certain period

**Starline Log #10 Hemokinesis**

**Hemokinesis, or bloodbending if you're a simpleton, presented itself as a side effect during my experiments with Surge and Kit. At one point, the tenrec sustained a wound on her arm due to her lack of experience, which inadvertently allowed Kitsunami to control that specific body part when he activated his abilities. This discovery piqued my interest, prompting me to conduct a separate test to explore this phenomenon further.**

**I used a Flicky that I had found outside the base as our test subject, replicating the conditions from the previous incident. Initially, the boy seemed to struggle; the Flicky maintained control over its wounded wing. However, my initial observation was soon proven incorrect, as the fennec quickly gained control, moving the wing with the same ease he typically exhibited while manipulating water.**

**I continued my experiments to uncover the full extent of this ability. I found that Kitsunami appeared to need a wound and some time before he could control a target's body part, with the time required varying based on the individual's size. Interestingly, a target could regain control of their limb if they possessed a higher concentration than Kitsunami**

https://i.redd.it/2pzuqh9am1fe1.gif

**Starline Log #11 Fake Chaos**

Super forms were a recurring variable when thwarting the doctor's schemes. So, why not try to replicate this phenomenon for our fennec friend? This limited-time state is induced by chaos energy. However, an unexpected result emerged during the replication process: the fennec did not acquire the glow or invulnerability I had anticipated, similar to what Super Sonic or Super Tails experience when enhanced by chaos energy. Instead, his hydrokinesis increased in strength. In hopes of achieving better results, I added more chaos energy, which caused Kitsunami to gradually take on an appearance reminiscent of Perfect Chaos. I named this new state ""Fake Chaos,"" but it appeared to be smaller in scale, varying with the amount of water available.

At first, ""Fake Chaos"" seemed manageable using my hypno-glove, but with each attempt to control this state, his mind became less susceptible to influence, turning him into a liability rather than an asset. Consequently, I decided to erase all memories of this state from the fennec’s mind.

**Kit's Diary**

Purple water—I'm not quite sure what to call it, but Ms. Kanako described it as defensive magic. This magic, which I acquired after training with Ms. NK, coating  the body to absorb damage from any harm that comes into contact with the user. When the water is exposed too much physical trauma, it eventually bursts, creating a small shockwave. Despite my practice, I still struggle to utilize it more than once a day. However, I wish to improve upon such so I can show Ms. Kanako what I have learned

AITA for not swapping shifts with a coworker because she had a date?,AITAH,1i9cu7e,2025-01-24 21:25:37,4,0.75,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i9cu7e/aita_for_not_swapping_shifts_with_a_coworker/,Optimal-Awareness425,,"So, I (18F) work at a bakery, and we have this system where we rotate shifts between 5 coworkers to make sure everything’s covered. A coworker (made up name Sarah) asked to swap shifts because she had a *date*.

Thing is, I already had plans—a whole shopping day with my sister that we’d been planning forever. It wasn’t just like a quick trip to the mall; it was a full-on bonding day that I couldn’t cancel. So, I told Sarah no, and I guess she didn’t take it well as all other coworkers rejected swaping as well. She ended up missing her date.

Now, at work, everyone’s giving me *that look,* like I’m the villain of the week, not supporting ""girly situations"". I get that people have helped me swap shifts before, but I only ask when it’s something important or last-minute that I can’t control, like family emergencies. This was just... a date. Not saying dates aren’t important, but I don’t think they rank above pre-planned family stuff, you know?

I’m starting to feel bad because everyone’s acting like I ruined her love life or something. So, like, AITA for not swapping shifts with her? Or are people overreacting?"

I have a USB running to each katana, so tone studio access is not a problem. but If I want to play through my focusrite, I have to have a 1/4 jack running from both amps to the focusrite and switch them manually each time and I have to move both my expression pedals and my single GAFC each time. I route the cables behind my L desk, so it's annoying when I swap multiple times per session. 

At the end of the day, I'd love to have my GAFC and expression pedals tucked under my desk and be able to have them just work on the 110 if I have it turned on, and the 100w mkII if I have it turned on. No moving equipment between amps, and no rerouting cables. Is this possible? I'm buying a GAFC EX as well, if that helps. I planned on using it so that I can quickly switch between all 8 banks on the MKII. 

Last question, regarding the switching of amps going to my focusrite. If I don't want to plug and unplug the 1/4 jack each time I switch between bass and guitar, can I just pop a Y splitter in the focusrite input, and it will just pickup the amps when they're on? "

It was decent—not great, but affordable—and had reasonably good components for its price range. However, its major drawback was the SSD, which only had 250 GB of storage. At first, this was fine, but as I installed more programs and files started piling up, it quickly became clear that the storage wasn't enough.

In 2022, I upgraded to a compatible 1 TB SSD. I cloned the data from the original SSD, swapped it out, and everything was fine. The laptop worked well until mid-2023, when it started to fall apart. First, I noticed issues with the hinges. Then the keyboard membranes began to fail. By 2024, the Nvidia graphics card—a modest 450 MX model—died. The laptop would crash constantly no matter what I did: rebooting, formatting, reinstalling drivers, etc. Eventually, I disabled the Nvidia graphics card, which temporarily resolved the crashing.

In November 2024, I got a new computer, as the old one had become practically unusable. Thanks to a great Black Friday deal on Amazon, I was able to purchase a much more powerful machine with a 500 GB SSD—significantly better than my previous setup.

Now, while I’m happy with my new laptop, I still have the 1 TB SSD from the old one, which I’m not currently using. My new computer is compatible with it and even has an extra slot for installation. However, I’ve never formatted an HDD or SSD with Windows installed on it before. A friend told me I can't just plug it in and format it like a USB drive. Could you explain the correct procedure for formatting the SSD?"
2025 WinkBed Review,Mattress,1i9b08z,2025-01-24 19:52:19,2,0.75,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mattress/comments/1i9b08z/2025_winkbed_review/,Zzbrent1,,"I ordered a WinkBed (luxury firm; queen-sized) at the end of November 2024. It arrived promptly (in 5 days), I opened it up, it quickly took shape, and my wife and I slept on it the same night.

The next morning we both woke up with our bodies aching. I called WinkBed and asked what happened, they assured me that the bed was fine but required time to break-in and that our bodies would adjust. It took about a week for our bodies to stop aching all over, but I still had back pain every morning after sleeping on it, and my wife and I would both wake up in the middle of the night (several times per night) because of how uncomfortable it was. After two weeks I reached out to NapLab to see if the break-in excuse from WinkBed was true, or just marketing BS. NapLab responded (quickly) explaining that time for a bed to break-in was legit, but that it should not be that uncomfortable for me and my wife for two weeks. I reached out to WinkBed to prompt a return but they told me I needed to keep the bed for 30 days. Without enough money to buy a second bed, we put up with it for awhile and I reached out to WinkBed as soon as the 30 days were up (on December 29th, 2024). 

Afmt first they tried to get me to exchange the bed for a different model, stating that we would sleep better on a softer version and that it ""only"" would cost $50 to swap. I swiftly said ""No thank you"" and started the return process. After a few days, I receiv d an email from a company called Sharetown. They said someone would reach out to me in 2-5 business days, but they had my number listed wrong in their email, so I responded back immediately telling them my number was wrong. They said they corrected it and would be reaching out soon. After a week of not hearing from them, I reached out and asked when I would hear from them. They told me the name of my assigned rep and said I should hear from her soon. Another few days passed, I reached out again, this time they reached out to the rep and told her to contact me. The rep tried but they said it failed. Turns out they gave her the wrong phone number. We got this corrected and she was finally able to contact me. I tried to schedule the pick up as soon as possible so we could get a refund and find a new bed. But she kept cancelling, rescheduling, and pushing back the date. After two more weeks, the mattress was finally picked up, at 7 PM (the original pick up time we agreed upon was 6 PM). Additionally, they requested I help load the mattress into the truck (though I was originally told it was a white glove pickup that required nothing from me). My wife and I then moved it to our garage to make the pickup easier.

I immediately sent the pickup receipt to WinkBed who refunded me the very next day (so at least that was prompt). However, they still charged us $9.03 as an ""environmental fee"".

Overall, a terrible experience. It quite literally felt like we were sleeping on wooden slats, the return took over three weeks, and we were still charged the environmental fee (which was not told would happen when we first ordered; we were told we would get a full refund if we decided we didn't like the mattress).

We now sleep on a Purple Plus mattress. We both like it much better, and we no longer wake up in the middle of the night due to discomfort. "
Used limited warranty for o3 headset,MetaQuestVR,1i9afyu,2025-01-24 19:25:15,1,0.66,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MetaQuestVR/comments/1i9afyu/used_limited_warranty_for_o3_headset/,No_nope_noteven,,"Anyone else have a headset stop working, do the warranty process, and then send in the entire kit including the controllers and charger instead of JUST the damaged headset? I revived back from them only a headset….now I’m in the process of getting the rest back. Wondering if anyone else made this mistake and how smooth it went to fix it? 
I do have to give it to them, the warranty process was so easy that even my ADHD brain got it done quickly! But I also wonder if that’s because they have to do a lot of swapping out damaged equipment? 

Thanks! "

Failed CanvasTV and experience with customer service,Hisense,1i99fq4,2025-01-24 18:37:34,5,0.86,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hisense/comments/1i99fq4/failed_canvastv_and_experience_with_customer/,btrayn1,,"Hello all - just thought I'd share our experience recently.

Purchased a new 65"" CanvasTV (65S7N) from Amazon (USA) back in early November and it was working great until Tuesday, January 14th. Came home from work and tried to turn on the TV to watch the Kraken hockey game and....... nothing. No picture. Not even the standby LED was lit. Tried plugging it into a different wall outlet and even a different power cord and still nothing. Tried holding the power button for 30 seconds and pressing the reset button on the back and still a big nope.

Called Hisense and after navigating a few phone tree options I was connected to a live agent rather quickly. The agent went through some of the basic troubleshooting steps and agreed there was a problem and said she would escalate it and I would receive a call back withing 24 hours. 24 hours later...... nothing. I finally called Hisense again on Thursday, January 16th and after a quick phone tree was connected to a live agent and similarly walked through some basic troubleshooting steps. This agent, however, asked for all of the information about the TV and our purchase and had me upload a photo of the receipt and the barcode/serial number from the back of the TV and initiated an in-person service call for me. Woohoo - now we're getting somewhere! After the call, I received an email with details, but it was a little cryptic. Turns out they shipped out a new power board, main board, and remote, which all arrived on Tuesday, January 21st. The next day I got a call from a technician who had us scheduled for an on-site visit on Friday, January 24th (today). 

The technician showed up today with a helper and I gave him the box with the new parts and they quickly set about laying the TV face down on the carpet and removing the frame and rear panel and swapped out each of the parts and put everything back together and tested the TV was working again. They had me run through the Google TV setup real quick to ensure it was all good and then left.

Overall, we're pretty satisfied. It took a little longer than we hoped (10 days), but aside from a couple calls to Hisense, it took very little effort on our part and the TV is working fine again. I asked the technician about Hisense TVs and he said he doesn't repair any more Hisense TVs than any other brand and in fact had just come from a service call to repair a nearly brand new Sony. He even added that Hisense is one of the better companies he works with that actually follows through with sending parts and getting things fixed for customers, so that was good to hear. Fingers crossed, we don't have any more problems with our CanvasTV as we REALLY like it! We have a 5 year old H9G that has had no problems, but using it as a backup the past 10 days showed us how much better the CanvasTV is, lol. Here's hoping each of our Hisense TVs continue to offer years more of trouble free service! 🍻"

Machine Guns!,distractible,1i98gb2,2025-01-24 17:52:59,0,0.5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/distractible/comments/1i98gb2/machine_guns/,ZealousZhil,Reference,"I know it was a bit, but a cool tidbit I think might be appreciated after listening to the [Insert Topic Here] episode is that machine guns specifically, or at least the M240B, does in fact wear very quickly. You need to change the barrel every 2 minutes of firing, or else it will literally melt.

So, you have a second barrel matched specifically to your 240 (barrels are serialized and made in pairs, a third barrel shouldn't typically work) laying on the ground beside your setup. You call for the barrel change with your partner, the ""A-Gunner,"" and swap them out to let the other cool.

There's a lot more to it, but a quick summary ought to do for now! Unless of course, anyone is further curious."

UI Suggestions,Soundmap,1i97d27,2025-01-24 17:04:56,16,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Soundmap/comments/1i97d27/ui_suggestions/,vermillio_n,Suggestion,"Loving the game, but if im being nitpicky, the UI and navigation could really use some improvement! Here are some of my suggestions. Please feel free to correct me if ive misunderstood anything or comment your own suggestions etc.

1. Right now, putting multiple songs up for trade is a huge hassle because I have to scroll down songs ive already selected for trade and remember which ones I havent yet placed up for offer. Its hard when im trying to put up offers for 500-1000 songs.

My suggestion: When creating a new open offer, allow us to only view and select songs that are not already in existing offers.

2. When browsing a person's collection, allow us to filter their collection by OUR favorites as well. This enables us to quickly find songs we might want from that person, and to potentially open a trade for them.

3. In open offers, allow us the edition option (which includes week1 / day1)

4. In open offers, create a dropdown menu which allows us to select a flair/tag for the offer: coins, swaps/quest (or free). This prevents the need for people to copy and paste their preferred form of currency into the notes.

5. Allow us to ""lock"" tracks, which require an additional pop up confirmation before selling.

6. Fix the ""shiny"" wheel spin so that the outcome appropriately reflects where the needle lands on.

7. Make for viewing artist discography far easier. Ive managed to navigate to it a couple times on accident but I think it should be made fairly obvious as completing a discography could be viewed as one of the major end objectives in the game.

My suggestion: When clicking any track, not only does it bring up the track information, but swipe right to view the whole artist's discog. OR clicking an artist in favourites brings up their discog

8. Fix the ""invite friends for free coins"" section (not sure if only mine is broken but its buggy asf for me). Im not able to select from my contacts. Also please provide a url link so we can copy and paste it.

9. Under the ""Trade"" tab, enable filtering all open offers under 'Username'. This allows us to find users that start with a certain letter that have trades open instead of us searching for random users to trade with / scrolling down 10 years to find one with an open trade.

10. Honestly remove the ""invite friends for free coins"" bit in the profile - its an eyesore and i dont deserve it after paying 19.99.

11. Allow us to send an OPEN trade offer to a friend. You will choose a song + any amount of coins, and the friend can choose to accept it and what they will want to give for it. My friends and I have different favourite artists, and sometimes I have a track I want to send to them. Instead of myself going to their page to select a seemingly (?) random song and trading it (and not knowing if they want to actually keep that song or not). This way they can just pick a song they are willing to part with + coins optional if they want to proceed with the trade.

12. Quest re-rolls show how many available out of 3. Also, why tf are we opening regular lootboxes for 3k. Almost no rare in the game is worth 3k so explain to me why this is even an option, especially when youre not guarenteed a rare. 

13. Include information / transparency regarding quest song inputs. I notice that if i put in rare songs, I have a seemingly higher chance of receiving a rare song? I should be told this / this should be made clear in the UI.

These are just some off the top of my dome - might update later if I think of additional ones. Feel free to add your own too / correct me if ive misunderstood anything."
Prototipo 6 Tank review: by Zorin - The Italian proto Standardpanzer,WorldofTanksConsole,1i979sy,2025-01-24 17:01:15,10,0.81,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanksConsole/comments/1i979sy/prototipo_6_tank_review_by_zorin_the_italian/,zorin234,Review,"Pros: 

* Good pen overall for all ammo
* Low turret dispersion.
* Above average PTW and terrain resistances. 

Neutral: 

* Okay Accuracy
* Average gun depression o 8

Cons: 

* Low hull traverse speeds. 
* Lower end VR
* Low-ish DPM. 
* Low armor
* Low-ish damage potential. 
* Poor camo for its height. 

Armor: 

* It's not great, but could be worse. Lots of thick looking numbers, but most are just small bits on the front of the turret. For what it is the turret is not half bad compared to most leopards. 
* Outside the turret front, its pretty light. Sides are good enough to prevent a decent amount of overmatch but that is it. There is not spaced armor, so HE will work quite well against this tank if you have a large gun or HESH. 

Gameplay:

* Well it's a lightly armored medium with a pretty decent gun. Decent accuracy but not amazing. So you're pretty much just playing a flanker or sniper… just like a leopard… which this tank kinda is. 
* Main issues are the low-ish DPM not making up for the lack of armor as much. Mobility while okay in a straight line is quite limited otherwise. Due to the limited mobility i tend to swap between both the engine upgrades as the PTW is quite fine 
* Other equipment? Reload one naturally. The last is a bit up in the air. If the tank had camo equal to its height I would very much consider running the camo net. (could swap out the mobility) At time of review however it does not, so if in the future it is changed then go ahead. 
* The last equipment should attempt to address the rather meh movement dispersion of 0.22. This is quite limiting as you often do have to drive out quickly to shoot due to low armor so you're gonna need to run and gun perk to get that down. So back to the equipment, vents or stabilizer. I'm iffy on recommending stabilizers as the turret dispersion is already very low and feel vents would offer a better boost overall.
* Anyhow, gameplay isn't anything special. Just play 2nd line and sniper and support. 

Cosmetics: 

* Well it's a leopard, just not as long and has a welded turret. Overall it looks pretty cool. Despite a prototype never being built, this looks quite “real” . It does lack a good deal of crew stuff but that's fine.  
* Due to the tank not being as long it does start to look like it's in between a Leopard 1A3 and the RU 251 / HWK 30. 
* Inscriptions are located on the 2nd armor skirt along the hull sides. The flag is on the back of the turret above

[Leopard 1A1 for comparison](https://preview.redd.it/yvajt78xk0fe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2ad482fd3059b5d75353b5b0610703b2d659ff1)

General Thoughts: 

* Well it's an Italian version of the German Standardpanzer so it's not too far off from gameplay of a Leopard. Just a slower version. With it being an early version is not as fast so a bit of a downside. 
* I wonder why its Camo is higher than pretty much every other leopard. Protoipo sits around 360 while others are around 330. 
* Its a fine tank, just think it could use a small bump somewhere. View to 390, tad bit more DPM or accuracy. That's fine for a release of a premium, i continue to prefer premiums to release a tad more meh for safety. Just with so many things around it, it feels like this one could have released just a tad stronger… eh oh well. 



Buy?

* While its on the cheaper end of a tier 8 medium at 8.9k base and at time writing 7.9k discount. I don't think this excels enough or is unique enough to warrant purchase outright or over similar tanks. 
* This just doesn't have enough accuracy or DPM to warrant the other stats of this “sniper” being meh. 
* If you want a similar tank that I think is better overall the Indien-Panzer is available as a TT tank. 
   * Panzer 58 if your stuck on a premium. (also on sale at the time of the release of this review) 
* As for when to pick this up? If you like Italians or want like high Pen HE I think this could be considered with a 30% discount with how cheap the base price is. "
Question/help with Combat Behavior Settings/Interaction Options settings & priorities,blackops6,1i96pq0,2025-01-24 16:37:06,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1i96pq0/questionhelp_with_combat_behavior/,BigRigButters111,Support,"Are there any settings options to prioritize different interaction options/actions over others? Specifically to prioritize reload first followed by resupply pick ups and similar actions INSTEAD of dropped weapons pick ups in bo6? It’s infuriating how many times I’m trying to quickly grab a resupply or even just simply trying to reload and I’m around a slew of dropped weapons and if I’m too close to a dropped weapon or more frustratingly moving still when attempting to quickly grab a resupply the game switches the interaction option tooltip from the resupply to the dropped weapon instead so god forbid you’re say tactically sprinting and sliding around fast paced and not paying the extra attention to which option you’re I guess closest to at any given second for the game to decide to switch focus to and offer as the popup interaction option.
I am playing on Xbox and I currently have my “Interact/Reload Behavior” settings set to “Prioritize Reload” which is supposed to allow for tapping to reload or interact separately or prioritizing reloads and holding when there is an interaction option. 
There doesn’t seem to be any other settings options to specify priority for different interaction options themselves, so if there are multiple guns dropped around a resupply it either forces you to take an extra second or more to specifically move your character around to get on or off from the pop up interaction options for weapon pickups and instead ensure that the interaction option for the resupply is highlighted and correctly implemented. So what is supposed to be a fast quick action to easily perform interactions and reloads with little effort instead requires more time and attention to avoid swapping my weapons with used weapons on the ground which more than likely are half empty or completely empty and cost me a death.

BuildDelete - 36738185 (Client-sided only, but can delete any model with a click, even if all its parts are locked; this can be used to phase through anything because it appears solid in the Serverside)

BuildResize - 58901534 (Client-sided only, but can resize any part, even if locked)

BuildGroupDragger - 36334760 (Client-sided only, but can drag any model, even if locked)

BuildCloneTest - 36017373 (Client-sided only; this is slightly broken, as it seems to clone models at their current position but not move them)

BuildSurface - 58901575 (Client-sided only, but you can put parts on surfaces such as hinges in your Client)

RoVacuum 2012 - 84418938 (Slightly broken, as this does not kill players anymore, but leaves hitbox anchors for them)

Chaos Master’s Wing Slasher - 87361995 (Does good swing damage, and pressing Q will cause all flying players near the player to be stuck in vines and drop the gears they hold)

Lincoln’s Golden Rail Splitter - 445150567 (With a swing, this can turn any unlocked part, anchored or not, and no matter how big or small, into a bunch of rusty cubes)

ALS Ice Bucket Challenge - 173751087 (This is pretty much useless, but creates a lot of tiny parts, which, if spammed with many buckets, cause lag)

Time Watch - 81330766 (This, when equipped and clicked, sends the user back to his previous position after a few “frames” in between, no matter how far away)

Electric Lightning Trap - 80576913 (This becomes invisible once deployed, and once any entity, even the player, steps on it, he is trapped inside a cone of lightning for a few seconds, unable to move or use gear)

Joint Breaker - 83704179 (This sword, with a swing, unanchors any unlocked part, no matter how big or small)

Captain Skeledeath’s Axe - 188644771 (This does decent swing damage, but when Q is pressed, a mound of skulls and other bones, all having a black fire effect, rises from the ground below where the player pressed Q; these bones instantly kill any player who touches them, and will last for a decent amount of time before disappearing)

Furno’s Pack and Plasma Gun - 89390459 (This shoots blue fireballs, which travel moderately fast and do decent damage; if this gear is equipped and the player jumps or is in the air at all, he will begin to rise upward, the rate of which will accelerate until the gear is unequipped, and the effect stops until the gear is re-equipped; this gear essentially gives you reverse gravity while in the air)

Tix Launcher - 391005275 (This shoots a few tix, which, when they hit any entity at close range, slow him down for a short period of time)

Magical Rainbow Pony - 26417031 (When used, a small, rectangular, rainbow platform will be spawned under or near the player, and after a second or two, will rise until it is thousands of studs into the air, and then dissapear; the player can ride this platform all the way up)

RC Street Hawk - 184758255 (This creates a small racecar which can be driven using WASD, and when any part of the screen is left clicked and held, the car rises up and flies in the direction the cursor is holding)

Balloon Tank - 172249239 (This deploys a miniature tank which shoots balloons that do decent damage to players)

Racing Tractor - 1708355542 (This turns the player into a tractor, which has slow acceleration, but moves at fast at full speed on the ground)

Staff of Neverending Frost - 66896601 (This shoots a snowflake projectile, which freezes any entity in a block of ice; when Q is pressed, a giant square mat of ice will grow from where Q was pressed and last for some time before dissapearing; any entity who touches the mat will have his walkspeed quickly reduced to 0 and will be encased in a block of ice, which does infinite damage once it melts)

Bo Staff 7000 - 159199263 (When Q is pressed, the player’s walkspeed will be set to 0 until the gear is unequipped, but a ghostly grey cylinder will form around the player, instantly killing and ceasing the motion of any entity that touches it)

Gear Cloner - 97161295 (This duplicates any gear other than itself which the player has in his hotbar or backpack)

Stop Hitting Yourself - 91360104 (When any entity is clicked, he will slowly start to lose health, with a red dotted line forming between the victim and the gear; the effect will not stop with any distance, rather only until the gear is unequipped or the affected entity is dead)

Noobcaik - 107458461 (When deployed and touched by an entity, the entity will freeze, hold only the cake, and wave his arms in the air for a few seconds, while dozens of messages flood the entity’s screen, making it hard to see and creating a period of vulnerability to opponents)

Summer Hang Glider - 450566409 (When this gear is equipped and any part of the screen is left clicked and held, the player will glide in the direction the cursor is holding; it is possible to gain height with this gear by holding upwards)

Vampire Vanquisher: Sword and Shield - 94794847 (When Q is pressed, a translucent red shockwave bubble spreads outward from the player, causing any entity caught in its radius to unequip his gear and grab his ears, remaining frozen in place for a few seconds)

Dagger of Shattered Dimensions - 71037101 (Whichever direction is double-clicked is where the player will lunge with this sword; this does great damage, along with the dagger’s slash, but when Q is pressed, a gold ring forms around the player and becomes an orange bubble, inside of which all entities, parts, and projectiles are completely frozen until the bubble dissipates five seconds later)

Cool Story Air Conditioner - 119101643 (This is slightly broken, as it spawns an air conditioner, which levitates, disappears, and shortly after causes a bunch of identical air conditioners to fall alone one axis onto the same spot, creating deadly explosions once they hit the ground)

R-Orb - 98411393 (This allows the player to fly when space is pressed once, and when any part of the screen is clicked and held, a giant, blue, translucent orb will grow in the players hands, launching in the direction the cursor was aiming when left click is released)

Telamonster: The Chaos Edge - 93136746 (Whichever direction is double-clicked is where the player will lunge with this sword, leaving a trail of fire which causes serious damage to entities; when Q is pressed, the player will jump up and slam the ground with the sword, causing a shockwave, which traps any nearby entities in red thorns, immobilizing them and damaging them slightly)

Chartreuse Periastron Gamma - 80661504 (When double clicked, a green laser which does heavy damage will shoot from the tip of the sword in whichever direction the player is facing; pressing Q will form a green bubble shield around the player which deflects almost all projectiles)

Nightmare Slayer - 1103011681 (When entities are killed with this sword, they will turn into black skeletons with high walkspeed, which kill other entities; when Q is pressed, a black hole, which sucks in and kills any entities and unanchored parts, will be formed, which has an outer bubble that marks the zone of attraction for the hole)

Subspace Tripmine - 11999247 (Once deployed, this tripmine will become invisible, and when stepped on by any entity, including the player, will detonate, turning all nearby parts pink and dealing incredible damage)

Rainbow Periastron - 159229806 (The player can lunge with this sword in whichever direction the cursor double-clicks; when Q is pressed, a giant copy of the sword will appear above the player, and, after a few seconds, a giant white cylindrical beam, which disintegrates any entities in its path, will shoot from the sword, and disappear soon after reaching its maximum length; the direction the beam fires in can be controlled by the movement of the cursor)

Intern Racing Chair 2014 - 169602388 (This chair is controlled with WASD; two rockets can be fired one at a time with left click, which reload after a short while)

Noir Periastron - 120307951 (The player can lunge with this sword in whichever direction the cursor double-clicks; when Q is pressed, the time will be set to night, and a heavy shadow will be cast over everything in the game while a circle of light will form on whichever surface is closest to the player, who will become invisible for a short period of time (including the sword); the light will disappear once the player is visible again)

Super Freeze Ray 2011 - 42845853 (This shoots elongated beams of ice, which freeze all players (specifically players) and encase them in blocks of ice, which easily slide along a smooth surface, leading to those frozen gliding along the ground)

Ivory Periastron - 108158379 (The player can lunge with this sword in whichever direction the cursor double-clicks; pressing Q will create a giant white orb above the player in the sky, which will then rain down many smaller white orbs, which home in on entities, blinding them and doing considerable damage)

Festive Periastron - 139577901 (The player can lunge with this sword in whichever direction the cursor double-clicks; pressing Q will transform the player into a giant Christmas ornament for a short period of time; when any entity is touched by the ornament, he will be instantly killed)

Earth Horn - 236403380 (When blown, a shockwave causes all nearby players to trip, be immobilized, and if in the damage radius, quickly die)

PE Whistle - 128160832 (Whatever surface is clicked, no matter how far away, will have a small red ring appear on it, which will be the target of many appearing dodgeballs, which can kill or do great damage to enemies caught by them while they are still in the air)

Wind Horn - 127506257 (When blown, several translucent blue columns will appear, slowly moving in the direction the player was facing when the horn was used; these columns function similarly to the Slayer’s black hole, sucking up all entities and unanchored parts)

Paint Bucket - 18474459 (This, once a color is selected, changes the color of any part with a click, no matter how far away)

Scroll of Sevenless - 125013830 (In whichever direction the player left-clicks, a giant string of fiery explosions will occur, instantly killing any entity in its path)

Spectral Sword of Illusion - 68848741 (This sword has a large hitbox and does serious damage; pressing Q will throw the sword like a frisbee in the direction the cursor faces once the key is pressed, which will travel a short distance before returning to the player’s hand)

Laser Finger Pointers - 115377964 (This gear shoots three lasers, the color and effects of which can be changed by left clicking; the green laser heals at a moderate pace, the red laser drains health at the same rate, and the blue laser pushes back any entity who touches it)

BTools (Model) - 142785488 (This is not a gear, rather a model, but it is allowed in most gear games and admin games; it allows for the manipulation of almost all aspects of the game, save for editing and creating scripts, as well as many things normally changeable in Roblox Studio with the Explorer)

Instant Campfire - 123234510 (Wherever the player left-clicks, a campfire is spawned; this can cause lag, as clicking rapidly, especially with an autoclicker, can overpower the gear’s cooldown and spawn unlimited campfires)

Moneybag - 16722267 (This creates rectangular bills, which disappear after a few seconds; this can create lag, as using many moneybags at once can slow down the game and thereby the clear time, leading to more bills on the ground at once)

Classic Bucket - 25162389 (When this comes into contact with any entity holding a gear, the entity’s gear will be swapped with the bucket, and the player will get the entity’s gear)

Steampunk Steam Gun - 356212933 (This shoots steam, and at close range, the steam can kill almost instantly when touched by an entity)

Sonic Boom Tuba - 47871635 (This creates four circular shockwaves in sequence, which knock back and trip any entity hit by them)

Terra Warrior Staff - 155414424 (This, when equipped and left-click is held, creates a cube of earth, which when the cursor is released, launches the cube wherever the cursor is pointing at a high velocity)

Azure Mines Pickaxe - 583030187 (This functions the same as the Joint Breaker)

Gigantic Bat Wings - 1074738432 (This functions the same as the Rainbow Magic Carpet, but without the trail, and the wings flap while the player is moving through the air)

Ghastly Ghoul Gun - 131372632 (This shoots a white orb, which kills any entity it hits and turns him into a speedy ghost which attacks other entities)

Chalk Sword - 119917556 (Client-sided only, but when Q is pressed and left-click is held, a continuous white line can be drawn on any surface within a radius of the player)

Quantum Entangler - 72644644 (This creates a duplicate of the player, who moves randomly; pressing Q or E will swap the player with his clone, and pressing X will caused a bright red ring to grow from the player and the duplicate, ceasing movement for about a second, but any entity who touches the ring will be dealt heavy damage)

Instant Treehouse - 119917513 (This deploys a miniature treehouse, which grows into an actual treehouse with a ladder and small room at the top, which anyone can access)

Fist of Schoolage - 65469882 (This gear is a giant fist; if any entity touches this, he will be knocked back and dealt hefty damage)

Medusa Head - 89487934 (Left-clicking with this equipped will cause all entities in a large radius, in whichever direction the player is facing, to be petrified and turned to stone for a short amount of time)

Confusoray 672 - 48596305 (This gear shoots a blue orb which travels quickly; when the orb hits an entity, it will slow his walkspeed down by a lot for a few seconds, but when the effect wears off, the entity’s walkspeed will be set to 16, no matter how fast he was before)

Wormhole Tunneler - 34870758 (This shoots a projectile which spawns a portal on any surface it hits; shooting the gun at a surface after a portal has already formed will create a different-colored portal, through which instantaneous travel is possible)

Flaming Hedgehog Cannon - 60357972 (This gear shoots a hedgehog, trailed by fire, which quickly homes in on any entity within a certain radius of its path, killing him instantly)

Orbital Flute Strike - 225921650 (When the player left-clicks, his camera will be sent high into the air, which will follow the motion of the flute to the ground, where it will explode, killing nearby entities)

RC Tank - 83021197 (This is slightly broken, as the tank it spawns disappears after getting too far from the player and moves lackadaisically)

Crossbow of the Sea - 236438668 (This shoots an arrow (affected by gravity), which, upon touching a surface, will spawn a giant orb of terrain water, which entities can swim through, and which will disappear after a few seconds)

Light - 77443461 (When Q is pressed, a giant glowing sigil will form on the ground around the player, with a column of light expanding and contracting, and the player gaining walkspeed and sword damage; when E is pressed, the player will turn into several glowing orbs and quickly be transported to whichever direction the cursor is facing within a certain radius)

Conjuror’s Fist - 90718686 (Whichever surface is left-clicked, no matter how far away, will have a giant stone fist drop from the sky and slam into it, dealing damage to any flinging any entities caught by it)

U.Fun.O - 566780416 (This gear spawns a small U.F.O., which is not affected by gravity, and can be controlled to move in any direction by holding left-click; it does not seem to despawn with distance, and can be used to access and view points far away from the player)

Rubyhorde the Rapacious’ Treasure - 117544573 (When used, the player shakes the chest, and a multitude of gold coins spawn in a vague circle around him; if any entity holding a gear touches one of these coins, he will have his gear taken away and given to the player who holds the chest)

Personal UFO - 163352376 (Once deployed, this creates a U.F.O. which will grow until becoming large enough for the player to sit in; the player can sit in the middle and move the vehicle with WASD, and the height of the craft can be lowered or heightened with Q and E (currently the tractor beam is broken and does not do anything))

Sword of Darkness - 77443491 (When this gear is held, the player will gain much walkspeed, and pressing Q will create a giant dark sigil on the ground around the player, with a column of darkness expanding and contracting, which gives the player more sword damage)

Korblox Sword and Shield - 68539623 (This sword has the ability to kill players with forcefield, and pressing Q will bring the shield in front of the player, deflecting damage)

Orinthian Axe - 147143821 (By pressing Q, this axe will be drawn back by the player’s arm and thrown, with it killing any entities in its path, and returning after a few seconds like a boomerang)

Rayvenge Sword - 92142829 (This sword can cut the arms off any entity, even forcefielded players)

Beehive - 117498775 (This, once deployed, spawns a swarm of bees that chase and kill nearby entities at a constant speed, but disappear after a few dozen seconds)

Holiday Ornament Staff - 99797357 (This spawns giant rolling Christmas ornaments, which are identical to the one the players can transform into with the Festive Periastron Chi; these balls can only really be used for obstruction, as they are broken and don’t kill entities anymore)

Heart Break Cake - 146057771 (When deployed, this cake will cause any entity that touches it to have his walkspeed set to 0 temporarily, and his arms flail in the air with the cake in one hand)

JediTkacheff’s DeathStar - 53130867 (When Q is pressed, a red, translucent bubble will form around the player and follow him until disappearing a few seconds later; this bubble will deal good damage to those who touch it)

Make it Rain - 99797403 (This is currently broken, but it is supposed to cause nearby entities to follow the player mindlessly for a short period of time, unequipping any gear held by them in the process)

Portable Justice - 82357101 (This can trap any entity in a cage for an indefinite period of time when he is left-clicked at close range; the entity will unequip the gear he is holding)

Poseidon’s Quake Trident - 54130559 (Pressing Q will cause the player to stand still, while a giant yellow object to grow and spin around the player, causing any entities caught in it to be tripped and temporarily immobilized)

Elder Wand - 2435999675 (When any part of the screen is left-clicked with this gear equipped, the player will teleport instantly to a random SpawnLocation in the game, no matter how far away)

Positronic Platform Producer - 34898883 (This shoots a green, metallic platform, which anchors itself once it hits any part, but disappears after changing colors a few times, with red being its final color; these platforms can be used for parkour, but can also be shot at entities to easily mess up movement and cause them to jump extremely high)

Super Spy Laser Blaster - 208659734 (This creates a cyan laser beam, which extends at least 200 studs;  the laser functions similarly to the red variant of the Laser Finger Pointers, as it slowly drains health from any entity)

Sorcus’ Sword of Judgement - 53623322 (When X is pressed, the player will tilt the sword sideways, and sparkles will appear for a split-second; this sets the health of all players (and probably entities) in the game to 75 (not 75%); when Q is pressed, the player will freeze in place, and a blue orb will spawn in the middle of the torso, wavering for a second and then homing in indefinitely at a constant speed on any nearby player until he gets hit, which will then cause the wielder to teleport to the player hit by the orb and swing the sword, either killing or severely damaging said player; if there are any more players within a certain radius, the orb will choose a new target to home in on, with the same thing happening if yet another player is hit, and the wielder will teleport high into the air while the orb is homing in on a new target)

Alien Parasite - 76170515 (This gear spawns a small alien with left-click, which will chase any entity the player left-clicks on in close range, dealing about as much damage as a normal entity has health (100) per second; if it is not chasing another entity, it will stay close to the player, following him around)

Orb Crystal Launcher - 61916108 (This launches several small, hardly visible shards of crystal at a very fast velocity wherever the player left-clicks, which slowly rise along their trajectory while in the air; these can be shot through walls up to a certain thickness, making them good for surprise attacks at moderate distance, and they deal about as much damage as a normal entity has health (100))

Ne’kotikoz Phaser - 61459678 (With left-click, this shoots an invisible (and presumably small) projectile, only visible through its dotted orange trail; this projectile damages and temporarily stuns any enemy upon hitting him, forcing a sitting pose and knocking the entity back through anti-gravity)

Super Spy Drone - 987032734 (This creates a drone, which the player’s camera is locked onto from first person; this is controlled using WASD, and can be lowered or heightened using Q and E; it is essentially the same as the U.Fun.O, but with much faster speed and versatility; the camera direction can also be changed by moving the cursor left or right on the screen)

RAIG Table - 110789105 (This gear spawns a table in front of the player, which will then be flipped as the player’s walkspeed is set to 0, and whoever is touched by the table while it is in motion will be tripped and flung; this can be used in conjunction with the Spring Launcher to make whichever surface the flowers spawn on a bouncy conveyor (by flipping the table over the patch of flowers)

Spring Launcher - 150366351 (This shoots springs, which do no damage, but there is a chance the launcher will shoot a yellow flower, which, when in contact with the ground, will create a flower patch that will remain for a short while before disappearing; this can be used in conjunction with the RAIG Table to turn the ground into a conveyor)

Rainbow Hot Air Balloon - 410001793 (This functions almost exactly the same as the U.Fun.O, with a small hot air balloon spawning near the player on the ground, that can be controlled by holding left-click)

Wizard Orb - 38327125 (When this gear is equipped, whichever part of the screen the player left-clicks on will have an invisible projectile launched in that direction, which the player’s camera will follow; this projectile will stop and disappear after 200 studs or so, and can phase through any object, letting the player see behind walls and into normally inaccessible areas)

Amethyst Periastron - 93136802 (The player can lunge with this sword in whichever direction the cursor double-clicks; pressing Q will summon a huge purple meteor, which will travel in the sky along a path before disappearing; the meteor will stop any players using flying gears within a 512x512 stud radius, and pressing X will cause smaller meteors to fall down from the larger meteor and deal heavy damage to any entities (these meteors have a large hitbox and can kill instantly with a direct hit)

Cupid’s Beloved Blade - 106064277 (This is slightly broken, as it does not swing or lunge, but rather deals damage in the idle grip; any part this blade touches, even when dropped, will turn pink, no matter how large or small)

Deluxe Dance Ray - 430065768 (This shoots a colorful rectangular projectile, which causes any entity it hits to stop moving and do a random dance (there are several potential dance animations) for a few seconds, unable to use his gear until the dance finishes)

If you think this list needs gears, search the Roblox catalog for more by hitting **Accessories>Gear**, and don’t forget to scroll to “**Unavailable Items**” and hit “**Show**”, though a more reliable method would be to search the different types of gear on the Roblox wiki. A good way to test these gears and more is in gear games, the most faithful of which right now seems to be “\[1000+ GEARS!\] Test Every Gear and become op!💥”, which can be found **here**:

[https://www.roblox.com/games/17471847036/1000-GEARS-Test-Every-Gear-and-become-op](https://www.roblox.com/games/17471847036/1000-GEARS-Test-Every-Gear-and-become-op)

This is probably the most popular game right now which uses **this** model:

Games that use the “hat and gear machine” sourced above or some variation of it have much potential, as I have discovered that these machines can be used to spawn in not only the unchanged version of any gear ever created (“gear wall” models typically have changed (fixed) versions of gears rather than the unchanged originals), but also any model that the creator of the game has favorited or purchased (these can be checked by going to the creator’s **Inventory** or **Favorites**), even if the pages on the Creator Marketplace say you need permission to access them. The same can be done with any model made by Roblox. This is done by finding the gear or model ID and inputting it into the number pad and pressing enter."
"[Poe2] Any minion specific advice : Gear, leveling and Uniques to farm ?",PathOfExileSSF,1i96ghc,2025-01-24 16:25:59,2,0.63,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileSSF/comments/1i96ghc/poe2_any_minion_specific_advice_gear_leveling_and/,Competitive-Math-458,,"So been loving poe 2 and so far not even hit maps, just doing lots of fresh start to end of act 3 style runs to fully test out lots of build options. 

However I'm wanting to focus on minions now and go all way to end game. So going to do a fresh start HCSSF and first goal is just getting to maps. 

I have generally found that sniper gas explode with flame wall is a strong option at act 1 for quickly killing bosses, then arsonists become a bit stronger once you start getting those aoe nodes and snipers look better later again once you can oneshot with supports like fork and chain and have crazy clear. 

So I assume the best option is to go either sniper or arsonist for act 1 depending on how much spirit i have, for example 3 snipers > 2 arsonists. Then maybe act 2 we swap to arsonist once we have flamiblity and doggo and stick on that until I feel comfy enough with dmg for snipers to one shot white mobs. I do plan to run flame wall srs on sniper or arsonist, not just for damage but also things like blind and maim.  

However I'm not too sure on stats and bases early, like should I be running ES gear right from lv2 or should I take just enough Int for skills then take str nodes for some flat hp and look for other base options ? 

I also know items like Trunch and fireflower can be string uniques but seems very rare and hard to get. So any other suggestions like would you ever run a wand with level of fire skills to boost flamiblity and flame wall ?

Box Sleeves vs Custom-Printed Boxes (I will not promote),startups,1i96fwt,2025-01-24 16:25:20,0,0.33,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1i96fwt/box_sleeves_vs_customprinted_boxes_i_will_not/,uprinting,I will not promote,"Packaging might seem like a small detail, but it's a HUGE part of your brand story and how customers perceive you. Two packaging options that are popular to our clients are box sleeves and custom-printed boxes. So if maybe you’re considering either of them, here’s a quick rundown of the two:

**Box sleeves** work for smaller orders because they’re more budget-friendly, costing less than fully printed boxes. These are mostly used for seasonal promotions or product variations. You can use plain boxes and swap out the sleeves for different designs. They’re customizable in terms of size (2"" to 12"" in length, 0.5"" to 6"" in width, and 2"" to 18"" in height) and material (18 pt. or 24 pt. cardstock). Then you can choose coatings like glossy UV, matte UV, or soft touch lamination (which may be done with custom prints as well). They’re commonly used for apparel, soaps, food packaging, and cosmetics. You can have them coated with aqueous coating, glossy UV, matte UV, glossy + matte UV, or soft touch lamination.  

Now **custom printed boxes** offer a more polished, premium look because you can tailor the dimensions exactly to your product. They’re actually cost-effective in bulk so it’s recommended for stable product lines or for long-term branding. They also create a high-end unboxing experience that go well for e-commerce business (subscription boxes or promotional kits). There are also other premium features that you can add like foil stamping, add window cut-outs for a sneak peek at the packed item, or use spot UV to add depth and contrast to your designs, and more. 

Which one do you think works for your business at this point? Or have you experimented with different packaging options?"

OW Uni ft Ninek Rush Aid Ep 13-14 Guest Junkbuck,Competitiveoverwatch,1i949bh,2025-01-24 14:51:19,34,0.95,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1i949bh/ow_uni_ft_ninek_rush_aid_ep_1314_guest_junkbuck/,Finklemeire,Fluff :flair-fluff:,"Very short episode 13 summary since it was both half the length of normal as well as just predictions for OWCS Korea which has ended already so didn't see too much point.

Ep 13

They're talking about the Juno meta. Rush doesn't think she's insanely op in her entirety but in OW2 support ults are so important and her ult is broken and she charges it very fast

Rush and Ninek wish this hero came out way sooner they would've done so well abusing her

Rush doesn't feel like Zeta Division ever changes up what they're doing. Ninek agrees he can't ever imagine them leaving the flex dps and hitscan combo to add in a venture or something

Ninek asks if Rush thinks its a double flex dps meta but rush honestly thinks there isn't much a dps player can do right now at all

Ninek wonder who should play Juno and Rush thinks since there's no headshot on Juno anyone can do it and it doesn't matter


They joke if Juno had headshot dmg viol2t would be the best Juno

They use ChatGPT to ask it who will win OWCS Korea and Rush days chatgpt is stupid because it says his name is Choi Yoon Tae


-----------------------------

Ep 14

They're invited Junkbuck cause while Ninek and him were drinking Junkbuck asked to come on

Junkbuck is basically a foreigner cause he was born in Korea but left pretty soon after. Junkbuck says it's why foreigners think he has to be full Korean cause his English pronunciation is poor but full Koreans think he's from out of the country cause his Korean pronunciation is weak too

They're talking about how despite both being veterans junkbuck and Rush have met very few times ever. Junkbuck says he also isn't the type to act friendly with people just cause he knows of them. Ninek agrees and that it's why despite working in the scene so long he doesn't know anybody. Junkbuck agrees and says he has no friends

Ninek asks how it is to come back to Korea for the first time ever and staying so long. Junkbuck says if you never leave your house like he does everywhere is the same

Ninek asks if they really felt the rivalry in those battle for Texas games. He was really jealous of those. Junkbuck says yeah but the problem was we always won the unimportant regular season games while they won all the important one. Rush butt's in to say he was going to say the exact same thing

Junkbuck and i would always complain cause he would lose to Dallas and i would lose to Shanghai and it was just those 2 in every finals

Ninek asks what it was like in Houston when Jake went from player to coach to caster to coach back to casting. Junkbuck says it's his fault Jake quit coaching. They talked a lot during his coaching seasons but also fought a lot as well. He felt bad after a while but Jake ended up getting it coaching and competition is vicious. Only one team can ever win and everyone else loses. Says only sociopaths or psychopaths can keep coaching for a long time. Jake was top nice for that so he chose an alternate path

Talk about there 2022 rosters cause the conversation was on coaches having to make the tough decision to be ch some players. Rush says he even played Guriyo and how he gives all of his players a shot. Ninek remembers how they lost to Guriyo on Cicruit and that Kilo was super boomed loaing the Widow match up to Guriyo

Ninek tells a funny behind the scenes story. Kilo would destroy Merit. They say all the Widow players have a certain tempo for when they grapple or peak etc. Jist happened to be that Merits weakness was Kilo which is interesting given the perception of Merit being so high

Ninek says if they start talking about OWL stories they could fill up 2 hours but junkbuck says he's much more comfortable talking about Houston and Shock than his current teams secrets

They try to go over Falcons losing to Poker Face but Junkbuck can't recall too much because he's the type to try to forget bad memories quickly

Says they didn't prepare enough and then comms broke down between majed and koreans but ninek thinks it isn't the biggest deal to lose in the regular season. Junkbucks hot take is that the regular season is completely worthless and he honestly doesn't given a shit about it or the seed you get if you're good enough you can win on the day.

Happy helped a lot with the mood of the team. Felt like the Falcons players all respect each other to such a degree it's hard for them to relax amongst each other and just joke around/relax

They're review Falcon vs CR and note how serious Falcons dugout looks. Junkbuck says it's always serious. Then the VOD flips to CR and they're all smiling

In Zeta vs Falcons they purposefully played hitscan to bait zeta into the hitscan mirror. Knew it was over for Zeta when they kept winning the hitscan mirror

Junkbuck says a bunch of the players had COVID during the game. But they played better so he joked they should get sick before every big game. Rush ever the instigator says what it really means is that they're better than zeta even while they're sick

Junkbuck was astounded there were no surprises by map 4. Cause map 1 you can always just say control is rng but how do you lose the mirror twice so completely and then not swap he expected them to pull out an orisa or something. Ninek says it's a running point between him Rush and Aid that Zeta always no matter what just plays like Zeta with no surprises outside of when Violet (real name Minki)  pulls out a super players for the team calling it the Dopamine-ki plays. 

Say it's a coach gap and bring up how heessang always calls it a coach gap when they win. If Falcons beat CR it's a coach gap and if they lose it's a coach gap. Rush brings back up that he's never lost to Falcons so it is a coach gap and Ninek cracks up remembering Once Again did beat Falcons.

Rush asked who was the one at fault in Houston? Since it can't be Junkbuck he left the team and then won afterall

Ninek heard that Zeta were in really bad moods after losing to Falcons but Aid points out they swore they wouldn't get 3rd anymore and got 2nd (trolling them)

Ninek asks but what if they say they won't get 2nd next time and go back to 3rd place

They're start talking about wanting to invite Rascal onto the podcast to ask about Zeta. They can't believe he's been coaching for 2 years now but he was still top 10 leader boards for juno. Ninek says Rascal is the coach you slot in week 1 of any new hero release cause he's so good at picking up new heroes and then bench him the next week. Junkbuck says Rascal probably hates him because he's the one that benched Rascal a lot

Junkbuck says though whenever genji comes up he wanted to put rascal in Rush mentions Rascal always says Super Genji is why he got permabenched into retirement. Ninek specifies the super genji is ALL crustys fault

Ninek used to always argue Rascal should be the Brig in GOATs while junkbuck wanted Architect in for Brig during Shock GOATs era

Ninek says he was always good at randomly pulling new stuff out like the brig the Baptiste and echo it's why he used to scream at him so much in Philly Fusion asking why the fuck he was using his shift key like that.

Rascal said he couldn't stop himself. Ninek says Rascal was the kind of player once he made a bad habit would keep doing it no matter what

Ninek says they talked too much about Rascal and wanted to move on to another player they all knew in Fearless since junkbuck and Rush have worked with him

Junkbuck says spun positively, Fearless doesn't need coaching, spun poorly dude was simply Uncoachable

Fearless is the type that doesn't work in a dysfunctional team but when it's smooth he's the best player and doesnt require much input.

Ninek says Violet is kinda like that but Junkbuck disagrees. Viol2t needs to be as a person destroyed before he works. Junkbuck loves Violet but he needs to be smooshed to work with the team smoothly
Ninek argues he just does whatever just like Fearless. Junkbuck says he hates watching Violet doing whatever he wants to do 

I remember hearing in.2023 Violet wanted to do some play and he stopped cause Pelican forbade him from it. Junkbuck recalls a time those 2 extremely disagreed on a decision. But Violet is the kind of player that if you become a teammate with him he is extremely unlikable. Not in a he's a terrible person way but he is an Overwatch sociopath like good coaches are. Doesn't consider human feelings at all in making decisions and how it can sound so he can come off rude but he's like the neighborhood dumb older brother figure closest translation like the village idiot?) we called him that a lot on Houston so we would says he's the village idiot let's just be understanding to him.

Current Violet is a lot better to humans now. Ninek asked what Rush would do with a player whose rude but really good. Rush says he never worked with a rude player during Paris and Dallas. 

Ninek says Rush and Junkbuck are both coaches that are similar in that they'll randomly talks to themselves and say things like ""this idiot can't be serious why is he doing that"" Rush retorts Ninek is WAY worse tempered than him

Ninek agrees. Junkbuck says he's the type that when he's pissed but no one else is mad he gets even more furious but if someone else is also angry at oddly calms him down instead. 

Ninek tells a story of Crusty being off somewhere else while him and junkbuck were together with the players off to the side. Him and junkbuck were fighting so hard that the players started talking to themselves worried and asking why are those two fighting so hard ahould someone go stop them

Junkbuck said he started feeling bad at one point cause his ability to control his rage got so bad he felt bad for Jake having to be there and witness it. Ninek agreed saying he had a year he was going to win one last time before retiring from full time coaching cause he realized he couldn't control his mental

Ninek thinks its really hard to keep coaching new players and much prefers creating a long lasting core. Asks rush if he prefers that as well. Rush just says he does whatever he yells a lot during scrims and games but during vod review he's super calm and informative. Junkbuck butts in to say that's exactly what he does. But that's another example of coaches being psychotic

Ninek says coaches should get a separate room for themselves for this reason. He says its gonna make it awkward for players if they hear the coaches screaming and they're gonna be looking over their shoulders too much. 

Aid says they can still hear it from the other room when you yell as loudly as Ninek does. Ninek disagrees and says he doesnt yell during scrims. Rush starts laughing and notes Ninek is lying. Ninek does admit he was a very angry person during Paris but was the most angry with Philly Fusion. On Paris his mindset was ""how the fuck do they not know this"" and on Fusion it was ""Holy fuck how do these people still not know this"" Aid says Ninek is jist an angry individual. Ninek specifies he can't deny that but he does get a new type of anger often

A viewer asks if they plan to win OWCS Asia and Stockholm. Junkbuck says he can only give the most basic answer which is...

""We practice so we can 3-0 and 4-0 everyone of course we play to win everything and we have to win everything""

Ninek goes back to coaches and anger and says maybe it's possible for a coach to not get angry if they don't do their jobs. Rush says the more you know the game the angrier you get

Ninek asks if magically the Overwatch World Cup were back would Junkbuck coach it? Junkbuck says if he gets paid for it he would do it.

Junkbuck is one year younger than Ryujehong

Viewer asked for the Fearless juice (I guess they mentioned something about Rushs time in Paris and Fearless not joining him) Rush says first of all Fearless was a monkey one trick at the time. Also didn't know who benbest was or that he would be on the team if he did he would've also gotten Fearless. Thought he needed an all around main tank before figuring out he had benbest.

Ninek apologizes to Nosmite for it not working out but Rush says he wasn't a bad player he just wasn't aggressive enough a player for what the team needed

Nosmite is apparently in the same college Rush graduated from

They're were asked why they chose Coluge after super retired but ninek says he wanted KSAA at the time instead he got outvoted. But coluge struggled initially so he tried to protect him. He likes coluge and that he's a good kid

They're talking about who plays Juno and Junkbuck says it depends on the comp but realistically anyone can play it since she's a low skill hero

Fielder Brig gets big compliments from Junkbuck and Rush. Rush says Fielder is only bad at Zenyatta. Ninek says that idea is overblown a bit but rush maintains his zen is clearly different from. The fragger mindset of say a Violet

Ninek says he remembers first seeing Fielder trying out for a Pacific team and thought he was good (zen meta) but when they met in person and watched him play against someone he got destroyed and now he even says he hates playing zen

Fielder knows his zen falls behind the best. He isn't awful but you wouldn't say its his calling card hero like his Ana according to Aid. Ninek says it's hard to be so good at Bap and Ana but bad at Zen. He says shu is good at all 3 doesn't that mean Shu is the best? Rush says Shu can't play Brig though. Ninek says Shus Kiriko used to be super mega ass but is now good. Shu self admitted prefers to deal damage than heal

They're talking about the 2023 Finals. Junkbuck says he was so pissed off because Atlanta and Houston should have been in the Finals. He admits if they prepared a bit better on their counterswap preparations they could've done it but them and Mayhem didn't scrim a lot. They scrimmed Atlanta a lot and Atlanta won most of their scrims versus Mayhem so he was pissed off when he was readying against them and had to play Mayhem instead. 

Junkbuck says everything fit for Mayhem to win that tournament. The meta fit everything for them genuinely the player personalities style and everything was perfect for them to win. Gunba is know to be human scum worse than even them and the situation fit him perfectly.

They're agree no one expected it cause that team of all the winners had the least winners aura before winning ever. But admit they got coach gapped at the end of the day so there's no point.

They're saying it makes no sense how one side of the bracket had Mayhem and Outlaws while the other was so weak. They recall the leadership for owl pulled some stupid rule change with Infernal getting a higher seed than Spark because of it and ninek says he can't remember it clearly because trying to remember every stupid blizzard/owl decision is infinite never ending mental anguish. Swears they change their rules every tournament randomly and pick a new team to fuck over constantly

Ninek asks rush if other games are like this or if OWL was just stupid. Rush says every esport is like this no matter what. Rush always says that no one hates an esport/game like the players of that esport/game
