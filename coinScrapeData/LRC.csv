**\^ \[**[**I highly recommend reading Uma Roy's fantastic summary of this proposal on Twitter**](https://x.com/pumatheuma/status/1880286929956270261) **+ replies\] \^**

**Disclaimer:** I am not an Ethereum developer.

I have decent understanding of general computer reasoning & logic, alongside some (*rusty*) basic coding skills in a few languages. **My interest in Loopring / Ethereum** stems almost exclusively from the **countless implications** which their successful adoption may very well bring about **within these next few upcoming years**, and **hold immense faith** in their ultimate **potential to drastically reform** how **our entire world & society** operates - **for the better**.

**I would heavily advise that you don't take any of my technical simplifications within this post as definite for the time being - and instead whenever possible: opt to learn directly from source materials / related experts.**

With how fresh [this recent proposal iteration](https://ethresear.ch/t/native-rollups-superpowers-from-l1-execution) actually is, I imagine that most Ethereum L2 teams/developers (*of those even currently focused on this*) are still brainstorming how all of this would work, and how their existing projects would fit in. Even on the Ethereum Research forum post, there have been several [replies over these past few days](https://ethresear.ch/t/native-rollups-superpowers-from-l1-execution/21517/9) following release which brought up some potential concerns with the current design, and are still yet to be answered.

There was [a post made here yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/loopringorg/comments/1i7b3d5/saw_vitalik_reposting_about_native_rollups_how/) asking if Native Rollups would mean inevitable obsolescence for Loopring, paired with a considerable amount of apocalyptic-tier reactions (*and unanswered calls for official team comment*). In hopes of somewhat easing the ongoing lack of any explanation whatsoever here (*non-team included*) since then, I wanted to make a quick (optimistic) summary of how I'm understanding everything so far:

* Any existing rollup can become 'Native' once the proposal is implemented:
   * In a similar manner to how Taiko is a '**Based**' zkEVM, but a (L2) zkEVM nonetheless
      * with 'Based' meaning that **Ethereum L1 stakers sequence Taiko's proposed blocks**, even if  validation for them being proposed in the first place is done via zkProofs
   * Loopring/any L2 Rollup would also be able to become '**Native**', but a L2 nonetheless
      * with 'Native' meaning that **they can essentially grab a precompiled valid proof + state from Ethereum L1**, without having to do it with an off-chain method such as zkProofs
   * Furthermore, a L2 Rollup also has the option to **become both 'Native' and 'Based'**
      * which would make them an '**ultrasound** rollup'
* Despite perhaps seeming like a no-brainer to become 'ultrasound'
   * Realistically, **we would most likely end up with a mix of all of these** across different rollups:
      * \[*'Based' / 'Native' / 'Ultrasound' / neither 'Based' nor 'Native'*\]
   * **Consider that if a Rollup**:
      * grabs a precompiled valid proof / state from Ethereum L1 (Native)
      * simply re-executes it
      * and asks Ethereum L1 stakers to sequence it for settlement (Based)
   * In the case of doing all three (Ultrasound):
      * They are asking Ethereum L1 to do a vast majority of the work throughout this entire process, and will therefore **incur heftier fees** (*depending on if 'Native' and/or 'Based'*)
      * If 'Native' and simply re-executing the provided precompilled proof: then rollup will also **limited to L1's inherit gas limits**
      * meanwhile **independent proof systems (e.g. zkProofs) are far more flexible with gas usage**: **customised splits** between partaking users, ability to **check gas fee total** prior to sending, **payment of gas using non-$ETH** tokens (**+ possible incentives**: *20% discount when paying for gas via $LRC on Loopring's protocol*) etc.

https://preview.redd.it/2c0lbhy0luee1.png?width=593&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f1dd79360c56f8e1fe4ca227bae81d4833c31bc

* Kind of brings us back to why having '*a healthy Taiko*' L2 is important for Loopring even now:
   * **Taiko incurs heavier fees due to gaining the privilege of L1 sequencing** (Based)
      * which **need to be offset by a healthy amount of users + constant transactions**, or otherwise fees and/or settlement speed would greatly suffer due to the increased cost from L1 sequencers
   * If 'Based' Taiko achieves stable overall performance, then **Loopring also benefits as a non-based L3**:
      * **By using its own zkProofs** for both internal L3 sequencing + validation without incurring L1 fees
      * with **resulting rollup blocks** (*in reality: thousands+ of L3 transactions*) **subsequentially being settled onto Taiko** and counted as a 'single transaction' block (alongside the many others which are already being made directly on Taiko as 'true single transactions').
      * **If the Loopring L3 zkProofs are implemented bug-free, and are sound in logic** (*e.g. no token dictating this process*): L3 block is settled on 'Based' Taiko **->** and the containing Taiko L2 block is settled by L1 sequencers **-> Loopring essentially inherits the best of both worlds**

Therefore, I am inclined to believe that **regardless of Native Rollups existing, the incentive to use Loopring as an L3 across various L2s should still remain** \- primarily due to the gas implications which make it counter-productive for everyone to be 'Native' / 'Ultrasound'?

Loopring L3s would still benefit from the underlying 'Native' / 'Based' / 'Ultrasound' properties of whichever L2 is being passed its zkProof blocks - while circumventing the increased gas & limitations, yet still retaining '***near-absolute***' **Ethereum L1 security inheritance** (*again, assuming the zkProofs used are bug-free + sound*)

* at the cost of the L3 proofs / sequencing technically not having '***absolute inheritance***'
   * (*achieveable throughout an entire transaction if made directly using 'Native' / 'Ultrasound' Rollups*)

Keep in mind that a lot of Loopring's value as a product originates from use in conjunction with its **Smart Wallet**:

* due to the sheer **convenience** (*yet minimal security tradeoff*) provided to its end users
   * for (*typically intended*) use as a **daily function, yet non-custodial, hot wallet**
* **natively intertwined with its L2 / L3 protocols** to create a **feature-rich & portable single-app  experience**
   * **simulataneously tailored towards performing a vast amount of financial tasks:**
   * ranging anywhere from **general Ethereum asset management**,
   * to **advanced day-trading** (*e.g. long/short positions for non-Ethereum assets w/ CEX liquidity & leverage*)

I'll conclude here because I didn't even intend for this to end up as long as it already has. As of now, **my main struggle** when trying to piece everything together - **is figuring out where the clear boundaries lay for what is considered valid use** when utilising a mix of ""Native"" and alternative proofs (e.g. ZK) layers, in the context of both:

**a) an individual rollup layer**

* **What optimisations can be made to a** 'Native' Rollup **precompiled proof** **prior to re-executing**?
   * **What are the limits** of this **before a proof is no longer valid / Rollup is no longer truly 'Native'**?

**b) multi-layer rollup stacks** recursively settling proofs on each other

* How would different **varying proofs types + degrees of 'Native' / 'Based'** affect performance / stability?
   * What should you analyse to determine **which stack is best optimised for needs** \+ **risk adversity level**?

**Just to clarify again: I'm not an Ethereum developer** ‚ÄºÔ∏è but rather just another (*currently* *very tired*) ape amongst the many of us here. Regardless, I thought this would still probably be worthwhile sharing given yesterday's sentiment - at least while we wait to receive official clarification from the Loopring team detailing their outlook on all of this.

GameStop x PSAcard *could* single-handedly warrant reviving their NFT Marketplace,loopringorg,1i3ptr6,2025-01-17 15:25:02,272,0.93,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/loopringorg/comments/1i3ptr6/gamestop_x_psacard_could_singlehandedly_warrant/,Iron_Monkey,üí¨ Discussion üí¨,"[Alright, alright - I know: \\""Another GameStop post on \/r\/loopringorg üôÑ\\""  ](https://preview.redd.it/pfhqwbr8iree1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fe7632ee32fba08797a359d097116a5b43399a6)

Nobody wants to see this seemingly dead horse (*responsible for leading many of us here*) continue to be whacked like a pi√±ata - especially in another shameless attempt to harvest what little short-term hopium might still be left inside.

**I truly get it, and let me be explicitly clear**: the intent of my post is not to convince you that any of this is currently in the works /  likely to happen. In actuality, this serves as a less abstract & deeper-dive extension of [another post made here last month which received significant traction](https://www.reddit.com/r/loopringorg/comments/1h5bcuv/could_looprings_partnership_with_gamestop_open/) \- and was **merely speculating about this recent partnership**.

(*Outside of surface-level + light snooping done solely for this: I am virtually clueless regarding any existing specifics within the card grading scene. However, if you happen to be plugged in + notice something stated which turns out to be outright false / heavily goes against established etiquette or standards etc. - please just let me know* üíô)

Mixed inbetween the many optimistic replies to the original post, there were also **skeptics wondering how tokenization of physical cards via NFTs could even be implemented and/or provide worthwhile utility**. However, nobody in the thread seemed to be aware of the fact that such a Web3 service already exists:

[https:\/\/courtyard.io\/about](https://preview.redd.it/x7nm3o8lzkde1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=5053e40d2fa3334f03ad55663c18bc2a24a66062)

**Courtyard utilises Polygon's Proof-of-Stake chain** as its back-end for minting/storing/managing NFTs. These **NFTs are owned + used by their customers to digitally verify ownership of any given graded trading card being held in a real-life physical vault by their partner: Brink's**.

https://preview.redd.it/3c5xebii4lde1.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=52358e4a54568041478ed591d70c834a7128d404

**When Brink's initially receive a physical graded card for vaulting - the corresponding NFT for that graded serial number is minted + distributed to its sender**. These can then be **circulated throughout Courtyard's platform** via marketplace + auctions + digital pack opening / peer-2-peer trades.

* (*+ the original vaulter of a card(s) is incentivised to provide their liquidity for these services via fee earning schemes based on subsequent further use of their card(s) by other users on the platform*)

**When a user decides to 'redeem' their NFT representing ownership proof** (*being used for these instantaneous selling / trading services*) in order **to receive the corresponding tangible physical card**: the **NFT is exchanged with Courtyard, who then handle shipping the card to you from Brink's**.

Overall, a very neat and **useful service - especially if you specifically highly value the financial aspect of this collectibles hobby**. Alternatively, these could also be used as a **'digital trophy'** of sorts by displaying on your Web3 profile(s) / within metaverse spaces (*e.g. games which choose to integrate specific NFTs*), **for those who favour their digital social circles** more than the traditional benefits of physical ownership.

>""Yeah, this is cool and all u/Iron\_Monkey... but isn't this post about GameStop x PSAcards? and how they are going to finally turbo-moonpump the $LRC bag I dumped my entire life savings into? Instead it seems like you have just come to shill a project which completely screwed over their chances by being first ü§¨""

I wanted to highlight Courtyard's existing service first because **it is living & undeniable proof that**:

* **NFT tokenization of graded trading cards is not only feasible to execute**
   * but **the utility provided is also clearly significant** if it already has a **sizeable demographic of active users** \- with **many listings being in the $XXX price range** (*+ even $XXXX isn't uncommon*)
      * **77k listings via marketplace feature alone since March 2022 launch**

[and now for why I believe GameStop x PSAcards still have the advantage if they choose to enter this space üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è](https://preview.redd.it/shnkgodimree1.png?width=854&format=png&auto=webp&s=5481b1d9262d28b7b7f486f090aa08ac87b31d3a)

* The **GameStop NFT Marketplace was built using our beloved Loopring protocol**, and is therefore **objectively superior to Courtyard's Polygon PoS chain**.
   * Although Polygon's PoS chain is based on Ethereum + its transaction history (*therefore making assets on either inherently bridgeable to the other*) - it is still a **centralised sidechain** being secured by its own (*waaaay smaller than Ethereum L1's*) demographic of stakers.
      * (*Stakers lock X amount of funds in exchange for gaining a proportional amount of votes which can either approve/decline blocks/transactions being proposed for settlement*)
   * **Loopring uses zkRollups, making it a 'true L2'** solution inheriting Ethereum's security because **only the re-constructable cryptographic proofs being used to validate compressing / bundling transactions are moved off-chain** (*while Polygon PoS is moving your assets off-chain*).
      * Polygon PoS is an relic of its time because **aside from being a permanent potential security risk for user assets** vs L2s - **even the superior fees / speed benefit it once provided is negligible** with Loopring L3 (*e.g. Loopring DeFi on Taiko zkEVM*) now achieving instanteous settlement + sub-cent fees (*which can even be entirely sponsored by dApps for their users using gas tanks*) via zkRollups.
      * **In Polygon's defence: they also know this** and have diverted their focus towards their new Hermez zkEVM in these past couple years. The current plan for the existing fragmented PoS chain is to transition towards being a 'zkEVM Validium', which I'm admitedly not versed on as of now but seems to still be somewhat weaker security wise vs true L2/L3s.
* **GameStop's NFT Marketplace + accompanying (consumer-focused) Wallet have both already been stress tested by thousands of users / creators** in functionality during their public Beta releases.
   * [nft.gamestop.com](http://nft.gamestop.com) has remained online (*albeit with gutted marketplace functionality*), and the Wallet is still functional for Ethereum L1 / Loopring / Immutable use if you didn't get rid of it.
      * Again, this highlights that **all of the code for these products is finished and still functional** \- just not 'officially live' due to the '**regulatory uncertainty**' reasoning given for shutdown last year.
      * (+ their reasoning will likely no longer be a valid concern within the near future based on [how crypto-friendly this incoming US administration have projected their intentions to be](https://www.reuters.com/technology/trumps-inauguration-marks-new-era-cryptocurrency-2025-01-17/) **- an extreme contrast to the current one guilty of repeatedly halting attempts made to advance the space**).

* **GameStop x PSAcard are inherently just better suited for executing this tokenized graded cards/collectibles niche** compared to Courtyard x Brink's, **paired with having significantly wider potential customer onboarding reach**.
   * **GameStop is the world's biggest video game retailer.**
      * **Pokemon, Magic the Gathering, and Yu-Gi-Oh make up a huge chunk of the current graded card market**. Take a wild guess what demographic is most likely to buy these?
   * **PSA is the world's leading card grading authenticator.**
      * \+ already have their **own in-house Vault** system.
   * **Courtyard was created solely to execute this tokenized marketplace niche.**
      * Yet somehow **on this Ethereum-based subreddit within a post discussing the idea of this exact product potentially being executed by GameStop x PSA** \- *nobody mentioned them existing*?
   * **Brink's is an established firm, but their primary customer base is far more generalised** \- with trading cards / collectables most definitely not being anywhere near a leading demographic.
      * This must have some sort of **effect on their processing speeds when vaulting cards** if backlogged / perhaps even on average days.
      * **Greatly diminished efficiency of any potential advertising aimed at directing existing customers** towards Courtyard's service.
   * **With the GameStop x PSAcard partnership - you only need to give your card(s) to GameStop** (and they deliver to PSA for grading: who have the ability to immediately vault + tokenize them afterwards).
      * **This process is specialised & streamlined for its purpose** (with standardised risk-appropriate care precautions in place + context-suitable insurance policies) **due to being a direct partnership between 2 companies who collectively possess all of the resources required to make this work**.
      * **Customers avoid the unnecessary potential headache from using mail services** for each individual acquiring / grading / vaulting steps, and now also have the further benefit of being able to **collect redeemed cards at a local GameStop**.
      * If you have a GameStop Pro membership: it is already cheaper to get your cards PSA graded through them instead of PSA directly partially because of the free shipping benefit - but moreso primarily because it is **$24.99/card via PSA's website** vs **$17.99/card @ GameStop**.

...and for the delectable '**cherry on top**'?

* Nat Turner (**CEO of Collectors - parent company of PSAcards**)
   * was **appointed to GameStop's Board of Directors** on the 18th of November 2024
      * (*cohencidentally shortly after the US presidential election results* ü§î)
   * has **spoken several times in the past few years about his** **intent to enter the NFT space**
      * and more specifically, utilising NFTs within the context of ""**IRL collectibles**""**:**

Adresse von Steveguo (LRC CEO) macht sachen mit GME NFT contract Adresse.,Spielstopp,1hf5wf8,2024-12-15 18:51:40,49,0.95,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spielstopp/comments/1hf5wf8/adresse_von_steveguo_lrc_ceo_macht_sachen_mit_gme/,AncientCosmonaut,NFT / Krypto,"Achtung: Teilweise Copy Pasta vom Loopring unter.

Vor ein paar Tagen gab es also einen Beitrag √ºber neue Aktivit√§ten beim Gamestop-NFT-Vertrag. K√ºrzlich gab es eine weitere Transaktion, und ich glaube nicht, dass sie aufgegriffen wurde, aber die Adresse, die damit interagiert, ist eine mit dem ENS von steveguo.eth, dem Loopring-CEO.

Also, lasst uns das mal genauer betrachten. - GME-Vertragsadresse: [https://etherscan.io/address/0xc852ac7aae4b0f0a0deb9e8a391eba2047d80026#internaltx](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc852ac7aae4b0f0a0deb9e8a391eba2047d80026#internaltx)

\- Wenn man sich die letzte Transaktion ansieht, ist die Absenderadresse [https://etherscan.io/address/0x59f3163ab39b8b90daf57508bc1faecb2f2cd374](https://etherscan.io/address/0x59f3163ab39b8b90daf57508bc1faecb2f2cd374)

\- Etherscan hat einen Abschnitt ‚Äûfinanziert von‚Äú, der f√ºr mich so aussieht, als w√ºrde er ENS-Wallets anzeigen, die Geld √ºberweisen. Und in diesem Fall wird dieses Wallet von ‚Äûsteveguo.eth‚Äú finanziert.

[https://etherscan.io/address/0x1f28f10176f89f4e9985873b84d14e75751bb3d1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1f28f10176f89f4e9985873b84d14e75751bb3d1) Diese Finanzierung erfolgte vor 239 Tagen, aber die NFT-Transaktionen sind aktuell

Entweder Steve selbst oder einer der anderen Ingenieure bei Loopring interagiert definitiv mit der GME-Vertragsadresse zum Testen. Dieser Vertrag war f√ºr ‚Äûcreate nft‚Äú

Jetzt haben wir also einen 100-prozentigen Beweis, dass GME und LRC weiterhin zusammenarbeiten.

Ich war in letzter Zeit ziemlich pessimistisch, da keine Neuigkeiten von Loopring positiv waren, aber selbst ich fange an, Hoffnung zu sch√∂pfen. Es stellt sich heraus, dass das Schweigen bedeutet, dass sie immer noch unter Geheimhaltungsvereinbarung stehen und immer noch mit dem urspr√ºnglichen Plan fortfahren.

\-----

Pers√∂nliche Gedanken.

Spoiler: Der GME-NFT-Marktplatz wurde nie als gescheitert angesehen sondern nur aufgrund von ""anhaltende regulatorische Unsicherheit im Kryptobereich"" (vor√ºbergehend) abgeschaltet. Diese Entscheidungen spiegeln die Herausforderungen wieder, denen Unternehmen im Kryptobereich aufgrund fehlender klarer regulatorischer Rahmenbedingungen(USA) gegen√ºberstehen.

N√ºtzliche Infos:

\- GME hat ein paar, begrenzte NFT's mit Nutzen gestartet. (Illiuvium, CyberCrew, Musik, Looperlands).  
\- Der Marktplatz hat die BETA-Phase nie verlassen.  
\- Die URL ist immer noch verf√ºgbar.  
\- Regulatorische Unsicherheit (zu der Zeit), SEC mit Ethereum als Sicherheit oder nicht.  
\- Grading Card Eigentum in Kombination mit NFT-Nutzung w√§re ein Real World use case von Kr.  
\- Das Eigentum an digitalen Verm√∂genswerten und der Weiterverkauf von Spielen w√ºrde einen Marktplatz ben√∂tigen.

Ich habe selbst noch Loopring weil ich damals davon ausging, dass das Ding mit GME, Loopring und IMX gro√ü wird. Vielleicht war ich einfach nur zu fr√ºh dran. Die Sterne stehen gut, dass mit der neuen US-Regierung und einem neuen SEC-Chef der Pro Krypto ist, der Markplatz neu ausgerollt wird."

There was another txn recently, and I don't think its been picked up on but the address interacting with it is one with the ENS of steveguo.eth, the loopring CEO.

So lets break this down.

\- GME Contract address: [https://etherscan.io/address/0xc852ac7aae4b0f0a0deb9e8a391eba2047d80026#internaltx](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc852ac7aae4b0f0a0deb9e8a391eba2047d80026#internaltx)

\- Looking at the latest txn, the from address is [https://etherscan.io/address/0x59f3163ab39b8b90daf57508bc1faecb2f2cd374](https://etherscan.io/address/0x59f3163ab39b8b90daf57508bc1faecb2f2cd374)

\- Etherscan has a \`funded by\` section, which looks to me showing ENS wallets sending funds in. And in this case, this wallet is funded by \`steveguo.eth\` . [https://etherscan.io/address/0x1f28f10176f89f4e9985873b84d14e75751bb3d1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1f28f10176f89f4e9985873b84d14e75751bb3d1) This funding was 239 days ago, but the NFT txns are recent

So either Steve himself, or one of the other engineers on Loopring is definitely interacting with the GME contract address for testing. This contract was for \`create nft\`

So now we have 100% proof GME + LRC are still working together.

I've been pretty bearish of late, as no news from Loopring has not been positive, but even I'm starting to gain hope. Turns out the silence means they're still under NDA, and still moving ahead with the original plan.

I'm not one for hopium, but this is traceable and real right?"

My average costs is around $0.33, so I'm almost on break even again. One side of me says to get out and reinvest in other crypto, the other side of me says to keep my LRC and hope for gains. I believe in the tech and such, I love the wallet, but I'm afraid people just won't buy LRC anymore. On the other hand, there is so much growth possible.

What do you think? Can LRC hit a dollar next year? Will alt season bring some big money to LRC? Will Loopring promote this token? Will there be partnerships or major steps so people will focus on LRC again? "

NFT Marketplace - What Are the Chances?,loopringorg,1gzp7zo,2024-11-25 12:59:44,119,0.91,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/loopringorg/comments/1gzp7zo/nft_marketplace_what_are_the_chances/,beep-frotz-negatory,üí¨ Discussion üí¨,"Loopring has a roadmap for the future, as noted by the recent Q3 update, which significantly involves multi-network features.  I do see this as a desirable feature, and hopefully it'll bring more users into the ecosystem that benefit from its utility.  The roadmap does make me slightly bullish on Loopring over 2025, but I want to see how successful (in terms of users) each milestone is before considering more buy orders.

On the other hand, I am looking for the odds of a short-term catalyst which could cause a spike in LRC.  In this case, the catalyst I am looking at is the GameStop NFT Marketplace.  Similar to a Pros & Cons list, I am attempting to decide if it's worth placing a further ""bet"" on a potential future release.  Here are my initial thoughts:

\*The NFT Marketplace will not be returning:\*  
1)  Regulatory risk continues to loom over NFTs.  Their classification as a security would be detrimental to a final release.  
2)  NFT Marketplace revenues were low when GameStop decided to wind down the Beta operations.  If I remember correctly, the marketplace was released at the tail end of the NFT hype.  Without providing any utility NFTs in a non-beta marketplace, perhaps we'd see the same revenue trend.

\*The NFT Marketplace will be returning\*  
1)  GameStop has left the Beta NFT Marketplace site up.  If there was 0% chance of them releasing a final product, why leave the website up and operational (besides continuing to provide the winding-down notice & instructions)?  I am still able to connect my Loopring Wallet to the marketplace (which simply feels good).  
2)  One of GameStop's creator wallets still holds over $28,000 in crypto:  https://explorer.loopring.io/account/183393.  Although, for a public company like GameStop, this is small potatoes.  However, if there was no intention on continuing to pursue blockchain products, why not drain the wallet and redirect the funds?  
3)  Although it continues to loom, there is a possibility that the regulatory risk involving NFTs could fall by the wayside with the new administration.  With an infrastructure currently in place, GameStop would be in prime position to hit the ground running.

So far, I am leaning towards a greatly possibility of a Loopring-powered (as one of the partners) GameStop NFT Marketplace.  The marketplace was sleek, the community was wonderful, and I loved the functionality.  However, it's more of a 55/45 chance in my mind.  What other 'Pros vs Cons' am I missing that could weigh the scale one way or another?  I'm all ears for both negative and positive."

Thread for buying and selling LRC.

A healthy ecosystem will rely on the ease and ability and cost of moving this product around and finding the greatest benefit.

Here are the big questions:

1. Buying and holding on CEX vs buying on CEX and moving to LSW (Loopring Smart Wallet).

2. Benefits of moving to L2 vs holding on L1.

3. The most efficient pathway (cost effective/least steps) of buying on CEX and moving to L2 on LSW. 

4. The most efficient pathway of moving from L2 on LSW back to CEX to cash out.

5. The most efficient pathway of cashing out in general using options like swapping on L2 in LSW and moving to CEX in other forms like USDC or ETH, etc.

6. Which CEX charges lowest fees to sell LRC directly. 

I personally believe once these pathways are well understood, there will be more interest in this ecosystem and there will be greater incentives to buy in and support Loopring in general. 
My personal experiences using CEX and layer-swapping in either direction results in massive price impact. 
A case has not yet been made for how and why utilizing L2 is an advantage to normies.
In fact often when the question is posed of what are the most cost effective pathways, the answers coming back suggest those people either have never or only very rarely have even attempted to move LRC around."

We are over a support(green box) that we just tested giving us 10% with low volume.
We are right there to break out the 50MA(blue line). Next target is the golden pocket/trend line of a possible wedge. If we break it we moon. 

Macro patterns: we are inside an accomulation structure weekly and like I wrote this is the spring so expect big moves like we have recently seen, that golden pocket is right halfway, so we could expect a bit of retracement or a sharp breakout. 
Lastly as you can see there is a big weekly wedge, that coincides with the golden pocket, so expect a really sharp breakout or a retracement. 

Hope this helped y'all to clear your mind and decide what Is best for you. "

I‚Äôve been holding Loopring (LRC) since 2021, and I can‚Äôt help but notice that while other cryptos are seeing some solid gains in the current market, LRC isn‚Äôt really rallying the same way. Back when I bought in, the hype around Layer 2 solutions and Loopring‚Äôs potential to revolutionize decentralized trading had me convinced it was a solid bet.

But now, with so much competition in the Layer 2 and DeFi space‚ÄîOptimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, and more‚ÄîI‚Äôm wondering if LRC is falling behind. It doesn‚Äôt seem to be capturing the same momentum as these other projects.

What‚Äôs your take? Is Loopring still a strong long-term hold, or has it been outpaced by newer tech and better marketing? Do you think the project still has the potential to deliver on its vision, or is it time to reconsider?

I‚Äôd love to hear your insights‚Äîespecially from those closely following the project or actively using its ecosystem."

**Takeaways**

* **BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust became the first US spot bitcoin ETF approved for options trading:**¬†The price of bitcoin subsequently surged to nearly $98,000 on Thursday, reaching a new all-time high.
* **Institutional interest in MicroStrategy surged this week, with the value of those holdings jumping to $15.3 billion:**¬†Microstrategy founder Michael Saylor has continued to purchase bitcoin and MSTR shares have seen year-to-date gains of roughly 450%.
* **Trump considers Teresa Goody Guill√©n for SEC chair:**¬†Her appointment would likely usher in crypto-friendly policies and regulatory reform.
* **Meme coins including Bonk, Mog, and Brett have set all-time highs amid a rally partly driven by the resurgence of DOGE to $0.43:**¬†Bonk surged 120% following a burn campaign earlier this week, while Moo Deng also hit record prices.
* **Russia has drafted amendments to tax crypto income, classifying digital assets as property:**¬†The new laws would subject trading and mining income to a 15% personal income tax, while VAT exemptions would apply to crypto transactions.

9th June 2024, \_not\_it (member): Hi u/Magic Pan, me again. Question: Is Loopring planning for LRC to have any meaningful, or more, utility in the future? For instance, it seems Loopring is focusing heavily on expanding the wallet to be used on other networks. Is Loopring expecting or planning for LRC to have a role in any of the multi-network expansion of the LSW or the protocol?  
People are wondering and/or concerned that there is an expanding separation between Loopring‚Äôs planned developments on one end, and the actual token on the other.

18th July 2024, magicpan888 (Team): Regarding the utility of LRC, the current uses are:

1. Staking: Stake LRC to earn trading fees accumulated via Loopring DEX.
2. Gas Fee Deduction: Use LRC as the payment token to receive a 20% discount on gas fees.

Looking ahead, we can consider adding more utilities such as:

1. Collateral: Allow LRC to be used as collateral for Loopring Portal.
2. Governance Participation: Enable LRC holders to have a greater role in governance, such as voting on network expansions and new token listings on the Portal.
3. Revenue Sharing: Provide LRC stakers with additional revenue-sharing opportunities, such as sharing revenue from Loopring DeFi activities, distinct from today's DEX trading fees. while we are also looking forward hearing any constructive suggestions from community.

18th July 2024, \_not\_it (member): Hi u/Magic Pan thank you for responding here, but I don‚Äôt think you answered the question. The question is: Is Loopring expecting or planning for LRC to have a role in any of the multi-network expansion of the LSW or the protocol?  
For instance, one of the two pieces of ‚Äúutility‚Äù you mention is staking to earn DEX trading fees. But the DEX is not part of the multinetwork deployment, so your answer doesn‚Äôt specifically address LRC utility in connection with multinetwork. What role, if any, will LRC have in connection with multinetwork plans? Because it continues to look like LRC is not *needed* for anything

19th July 2024, magicpan888 (Team): LRC more ties to the protocol itself. When Loopring is deployed as layer 3 on top of other EVM compatible networks, Loopring protocol extends its usage on those networks as well. Though Loopring Wallet can be the portal for user to get access to Loopring Defi services, by nature it's a rather different product than Loopring Protocol. This is the reason why we try to revision Loopring Protocol and Loopring Smart Wallet earlier.

6th August 2024, \_not\_it (member): Thanks for the response. A couple follow ups, please--numbered for ease in responding :).

1. Just for clarity's sake: are you saying Dual Investment, Portal, and Block Trade will \~certainly\~ be part of the initial roll out, but others (like what?) may be added later? Or are you saying that it's uncertain what will be definitely part of the initial roll out?
2. What role, if any, does LRC have in the L3 products on Taiko? For instance, will LRC be required for use of L3 products on Taiko?
3. Will there be any trading or use competitions / incentives associated with the rollout? If so, will rewards be something other than Loopheads or picture/gif-related NFTs?
4. Finally, with L3 officially launching, will marketing efforts (other than tweets from Loopring-associated accounts) begin? (Previously, you mentioned that we'll likely have to rely on marketing or co-marketing with partners. Are there steps in place for Taiko or other mediums/platforms to promote Loopring's Taiko-related L3 offerings?)

[https://discord.com/channels/488848270525857792/488848270525857796/1270409239243919432](https://discord.com/channels/488848270525857792/488848270525857796/1270409239243919432)

8th August 2024, ablankstory (Team): Here's my take on this, for what it's worth:

1. We will deploy ""Loopring Earn"" onto Taiko. This means in both the Wallet app (using a Taiko wallet) and Loopring Earn Dapp (switch network to Taiko). The products on Loopring Earn (when connected using the Taiko network) will be Dual Investment, Block Trade, and Portal. If we release additional Loopring Earn products, and we think it makes sense to deploy those products to the Taiko instance of Loopring Earn, we will. Think of Loopring Earn as a DApp deployed on Taiko. It'll be a L3 behind the scenes, but for all intents and purposes it will look/feel/function like a DApp deployed on Taiko.
2. The utility of LRC on Taiko is still being discussed. But to be transparent, its utility will be what Loopring makes it - not what Taiko makes it. Meaning, Taiko isn't forced to require anyone to spend LRC for transactions or anything else. However, Loopring Earn deployed on Taiko may make use of LRC or provide benefits to LRC holders. We (Loopring) would love to provide more utility for LRC holders and are discussing different approaches to that end.
3. If this is in reference to competitions to help promote Loopring Earn on Taiko, we are discussing promotions/incentives. While we have NFTs available today to provide as promotional rewards, it's unlikely someone outside of the Loopring community will see value in a Loophead NFT (not saying there isn't any value, but perceived value is different). We may look to provide other rewards/incentives to help promote the launch. We would also work closely with Taiko to help co-market/promote as well.
4. Tapping into other partners' communities is always helpful. So when we deploy Loopring Earn on Taiko, we will work with Taiko to help promote.

That's what I have for now. Hopefully it's helpful to you.

>19th July 2024, ilikeplantsandsuch (member): convoluted doesnt begin to describe it, but adding expensive to that list is gonna kill it for any meaningful participation

19th July 2024, ablankstory (Team): so to do what you want to do purely with an EOA wallet is all the same steps, except the transfer to your Loopring Smart Wallet at the end. I think your frustration/confusion is moreso on the side of the CEX (e.g., Coinbase) not allowing direct transfer to your wallet over the Taiko network. Because of that, you're needing to bridge the ETH from X network to Taiko. In this instance, it's cheapest for you to first move the ETH to Base and then to Taiko rather than doing a L1 transfer to a wallet and then a bridge. So again, I wouldn't say it's necessarily the wallet's fault...moreso how easy it is to move from a CEX to a non-mainstream (yet) chain.

19th July 2024, ablankstory (Team): Once we add Base to our wallet, you would be able to withdraw from Coinbase to your Loopring Wallet (base network) and then bridge to Taiko from our wallet (assuming Layerswap and other bridges support our Base smart contract wallet)

9th August 2024, writerofjots (member): So, u/B.üëæ , according to this message from yesterday, the Loopring team does know how to discuss and even agree on things. Which is a relief, let me tell you. So, since you have said so many times that the team is discussing the hack and whether victims will be made whole, what has the team agreed on? Because, it's been 61 days since the hack, and weeks since I started asking this same question. Seems like plenty of time for Loopring to come to an agreement, don't you think?

It takes a long time because it‚Äôs a $5M loss that wasn‚Äôt accounted for in our financial forecast. It‚Äôs not like $20 you can find in an old pair of jeans.

10th August 2024, dutchchicken (member): I can't speak for anyone other than myself, but so much has changed and most of what we get are ""L3 soon"" and ""multi-network soon"" and a bunch of other ""soons,"" so the timing us unclear. Why? What is causing things to be postponed?

What is the nature of the relationship with Taiko as it seems to be less integrated and symbiotic than was initially sold to us. What role do people now play on each team and is there any overlap? And I see a lot of things in bitcorns post that I was going to add here, so I'll shut up now.

10th August 2024, bitcorn (member): I guess I just don‚Äôt currently see the value in the loopring token.

What happened with GSMP? Is there any connections still there? Is that 100% dead to LRC? Are there other partnerships coming? Just feel I don‚Äôt know anything‚Ä¶ and maybe that‚Äôs my fault

10th August 2024, ablankstory (Team): there's a lot to unpack here...

1. I can't talk on the specifics around the split as that was Daniel's decision and made before I came onboard (i think). I can only speculate that he loves building and innovating in the space. Loopring is and always will be an app specific rollup. Daniel most likely wanted to build a generic one to help extend Ethereum even more. As to why the split, if I had to guess - getting more VC interest to fund a massive, expensive project. That doesn't mean that Loopring and Taiko don't talk, share ideas, strategize together still. But as you know, they are two separate projects.
2. Benefits are that each project can carry out its goals but still find synergy and benefits when and where we want to collaborate. For example, we can continue building our wallet, deploy on multiple L2, etc. Taiko can continue to extend ethereum with any evm-compatible dapp that wants to build on it. That includes Loopring and our Loopring Earn dapp.
3. Our current plan is to continue extending Loopring L3 (Earn and maybe more features) to other L2s. I'll say it's taken a bit longer than I would've anticipated to get our support for Taiko fully up and running. But I think that can be attributed to (1. it was our first deployment on an L2, 2. they are a new chain and working through their own issues, 3. the hack, buttoning up our security, reworking the app to support seed phrases, etc. have been the priority). I would love to see us roll out support for Base and other L2s at a faster pace, and we want to. The more L2s we can add support for, the more eyes we can get on Loopring. Additionally, we still have our plans to enhance Portal, Block Trade, introduce Trading Bots, etc. to help further the applications and functionality of our Wallet and Protocol.
4. I can't really comment on GSMP because they just decided to shut it down. I don't think anyone is happy with the decision. I personally haven't chatted with them recently.

[https://discord.com/channels/488848270525857792/488848270525857796/1271547065859833877](https://discord.com/channels/488848270525857792/488848270525857796/1271547065859833877)

I'd say the hack is what really slowed things down. We needed to understand how the hack was performed, work with a security team to figure out what changes needed to occur, make those changes, rework the app (backend and frontend), etc. This was a huge ""project"" that wasn't accounted for when we were planning out CY2024 and early 2025. Additionally, the team continues to work on the app itself to rewrite it in a common language so future updates can happen faster - but to put this into perspective, another app did this and I think it took them 1 year to get every screen/function/etc. switched over. So we're still in early innings on this part.

[https://discord.com/channels/488848270525857792/488848270525857796/1271547953319903232](https://discord.com/channels/488848270525857792/488848270525857796/1271547953319903232)

but that's the app team, not necessarily the backend team...if that makes sense. So that isn't stopping ALL work by any means. Just wanted to remind you that it's happening.

10th August 2024, dutchchicken (member): Thank you, u/blank. I think that being this open and honest is the best way to allay concerns and uncertainty. Please remember, we KNOW we are basically beta-testers and this is a work in progress. That is why it is so detrimental to feel like we are being kept in the dark. There are still questions about the multi-sig wallet and who is using it for what, but that is beyond my comprehension, so I will let someone who knows how to ask intelligent questions on that topic jump in. But please, please, please keep this line of communication going. It will benefit this project immensely.

And not to harp on this, but having 1st and 3rd party cyber-coverage as a part of your E&O insurance would likely have included forensics teams that would have done a lot of this for you. Just saying, prudent risk management is essential. Please tell the team that it is worth the investment.

10th August 2024, ablankstory (Team): During our discussions on updating our smart contract to add a delay (30-60 days for changes unless it's a critical bug), we have discussed more individuals. Since we don't have an official DAO, we would need to find other leaders in the Ethereum community to act as those signers. Finding those people, and those people being interested, is what we'll need to look at. It may be difficult to find willing people that are known and trustworthy.

What would you change if you were running Loopring? A few of my thoughts...,loopringorg,1edlb84,2024-07-27 13:11:21,71,0.79,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/loopringorg/comments/1edlb84/what_would_you_change_if_you_were_running/,datasmash,üí¨ Discussion üí¨,"I've been here a while, I stacked heavily before the GME stuff was a thing, and rode it all the way up and now all the way back down. Its been excruciating to watch. If I were in charge of Loopring, this is what I would do differently to drive growth, adoption, and trust within the community

## Marketing

- Increase Marketing Efforts: There needs to be a significant ramp-up of marketing campaigns. The current efforts are insufficient and quite frankly an embarrassment. 
- Replace Ineffective Personnel: Byron would have to go. His contributions are more akin to a social media intern rather than someone driving substantial adoption, defining strategy and creating meaningful content.
- Hire Effective Promoters: Hire the people who are currently hyping up shitcoins in the top 50. If they can do that with projects that have zero fundamentals, imagine what they can achieve with an actual project

## Community Trust and Relations:

- Fix Airdrops: The current airdrop strategy has destroyed the trust of OG users. This needs to be fixed immediately.
- Revise Taiko Partnership Terms: Remind Wang that offering the Loopring community only 0.25% of the airdrop funds is insulting, especially after moving forward with the tech invested in (zkEVM).
- Deploy Loopring as L3 on Taiko L2: This integration needs to happen to strengthen the ecosystem. Now they've committed down this path, Loopring is not viable without the reduced fees L3 will bring
- Swallow the gas fee's for all OG users who paid for guardians txns, contract upgrades, ENS, etc so they can create a new multi network wallet mirroring their old one. Whoever thought that people would just be ok with having to create new wallets is a moron and should be fired
- The hack. This is obvious, make it right, be on hand to support people who trusted the platform, set an example

## User Experience:

- Reduce Fees: Lower the fees for adding guardians and wallet creation. High fees make the platform less attractive and negate its purpose. If this means L3, then whatever, but currently fee's are a huge barrier
- Engage with the Community: Regularly interact with users to validate ideas and understand their needs, rather than building technically interesting features with no clear use case.
- Rebuild Trust: Trust is crucial. Deliberate steps need to be taken to rebuild it.

## Trading and Technology:
- Increase Trading Pairs on DEX: Like Uniswap, more trading pairs should be available to drive volume and adoption. The LRC token is pretty much worthless right now without volume
- Enhance NFT Technology: Shift focus from trash JPEGs to real-world applications like property, e-commerce, and insurance tech. At the very least make dynamic/oracle-based NFTs usable for creators.
- Reintroduce Points for Activity: Bring back points for user activity and make them worthwhile. Users shouldn't need to log in daily for two years just to cover one transaction.
- Empower Users: Truly enable people to be their own bank.

## Waste of time

- On/Off ramps
- GME partnership
- Loopheads
- Staking
- Dual investment
- AMM
- NFTs
- Red packets
- Portal/margins
- Multi-network (probably)

## Stuff that has actually worked

- Guardians
- DEX (though more pairs are needed)
- Block trading / CEX liquidity

Loopring had immense potential, and has done a pretty decent job at building something, but a terrible job at execution in terms of adoption and community trust.

Long position on Loopring Portal explained in simple language:,loopringorg,1e7srsk,2024-07-20 06:41:13,89,0.91,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/loopringorg/comments/1e7srsk/long_position_on_loopring_portal_explained_in/,Icy_Particular3663,üí¨ Discussion üí¨,"My Experience using Loopring Portal:

**Total Collateral** = $386

* This is the amount of USDT I locked into the portal 
* These funds still stay in my custody in the Loopring wallet, but I‚Äôve signed a smart contract which means that if I lose a lot of money trading in Loopring portal my **collateral** will be liquidated.

**Total debt**¬† = 385.59

* This is the amount of USDT I borrowed from the Loopring Portal to purchase LRC during the dip 
* This means I‚Äôm betting on looping‚Äôs price increasing¬†= I'm going long
* On this debt I also need to pay interest this is paid hourly (0.001713%). This adds up to 15.01% APR

**Total profit** = $52.21

* This is the amount of **profit** I‚Äôve made so far in my long position on $LRC
* This is because the price of LRC has gone up today; it is higher than the price I bought in at

**Total Equity** = $438.70

* This is my collateral + profit
* It's how much my position is worth after I pay back my **Total debt**

**Margin Level** = 2.14

This indicates how close my position is to:

**Being liquidated** = I lose the $386 I locked in as collateral¬†

*OR*

Getting **margin call**ed = I will be asked to add more collateral to avoid the liquidation¬†



How is **Margin Level** calculated?¬†

* **Total equity/total collateral** + 1 = 438/386 + 1 = 2.14 (rounded)¬†

If my **Equity** decreases eg) if loopring price decreases, then this number **(Margin level)** gets lower. Once it reaches 1.10 I will lose all my **collateral** so it can be used to repay my **debt**.

A Look Into Grayscale's Proposed Privacy ETF & Potential Role of Oasis,altcoin,1ddj57f,2024-06-11 13:00:41,8,0.91,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1ddj57f/a_look_into_grayscales_proposed_privacy_etf/,DC600A,,"The financial aspect of crypto is a huge draw for users. Now, despite the volatility of the crypto markets, the lucrative pull is undeniable. So, when Bitcoin ETFs got approved and succeeded, it paved the way for Ethereum ETFs. While early market sentiments are yet to call out the final result if it is a hit or a miss, indications are it will be successful. The focus now shifts to another untapped potential for ETFs - privacy, and it is a big deal.

Whether you are a veteran or a newbie in the ETF scene, Grayscale is a well-known name that inspires confidence. Some sources have suggested that Grayscale is prepped for filing a privacy ETF and they have been considering and monitoring several projects since 2022. Here is the list of assets under consideration:

* 0x (ZRX)
* 1inch (1INCH)
* Apecoin (APE)
* Arweave (AR)
* Axie Infinity (AXS)
* Bancor (BNT)
* BitTorrent (BTT)
* Bora (BORA)
* Iota (IOTA)
* Kava (KAVA)
* Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)
* Loopring (LRC)
* Monero (XMR)
* Near (NEAR)
* Numeraire (NMR)
* [Oasis (ROSE)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/oasis-network/)

While Ethereum itself depends on L2 solutions to implement privacy effectively in its ecosystem, there is no dearth of blockchain protocols that have been working in this field and have achieved various degrees of success. As a pioneer in smart privacy for web3 and AI with privacy-preserving technologies in use,¬†[Oasis](https://oasisprotocol.org/)'s inclusion in the above list is as expected. However, before getting into how or why Oasis / $Rose could feature in Grayscale's plans, it is useful first to examine the makeup of the privacy ETF.

Ed, a well-known persona in the blockchain and crypto and web3 space, and an engaged Oasis community member with 3+ years of experience being embedded across the ecosystem while contributing towards community building, business development, networking, and marketing activities, has put it all together.

Let's start by looking at what type of projects will constitute this ETF.

* Data Privacy Solution Providers
* Cyber Service Providers
* Blockchain-Based Privacy Solutions
* Network & Communication Security Provider
* Privacy-Preserving Protocols

The projects considered also have some eligibility criteria to fulfill before qualifying and we will mention the top 3 here.

First, a substantial portion, if not all, of their revenue has to come from one or more of the categories mentioned above. Second, the projects need to be listed on U.S., non-U.S. developed market or emerging market exchanges. Third, the market cap must equal to or in excess of $250M.

Projects are scored as 'primary' or 'secondary' based on three metrics.

1. Data Privacy Solutions, Cyber Services, or Blockchain Privacy Solutions take priority over other sectors
2. If ALL or just some business operations are aimed at privacy
3. By alignment with GDPR and CCPA regulations

The prominence and priority of Oasis in Grayscale's proposed privacy ETF plans becomes evident based on the above discussion as it firmly falls under the 'primary' category. While the fact remains that quite a few of the projects mentioned above in Grayscale's list have lost relevance, Oasis has gone from strength to strength emerging as a regulatory-compliant solution provider in addition to its confidentiality capabilities.

According to Ed, this is just the tip of the iceberg and there are other reasons too that underline why Oasis / $Rose is well-positioned in Grayscale's proposed privacy ETF.

To note, Grayscale has reiterated its principal investment strategy of avoiding exposure to digital assets directly, and still, $Rose has potentially a significant role to play in the privacy ETF when it comes out. Intrigued? The answer lies in a single entity having effected a huge accumulation of $Rose (approximately $440M) on chain through Coinbase. To deep dive into this,¬†[check out Ed's thread](https://x.com/ECrypto0/status/1800135721648546253)¬†on Twitter (X).

Favorable market sentiments of ETFs aside, Grayscale's backing of the privacy narrative is well-deserved and timely. Oasis has always been privacy-focused in line with its founder, Prof. Dawn Song's expertise in computer security and decentralized confidentiality. In conclusion, the potential is all there for a blockbuster privacy ETF with an MVP role by Oasis, but nothing is concrete yet. Hopefully, we will hear something positive very soon.

Let's discuss in the comments what you like about privacy ETFs, and also what other criteria, metrics, and projects you think would make it more robust and impactful."

What is the current cheapest pathway everyone is using?

Banxa and ramp are obviously not it

Also what are the cheapest options for swapping? the LSW is obviously not that either in my experience.

i would love to hear everybody‚Äôs experiences and solutions.

here are some obligatory words for the automod:

Loopring (LRC) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to provide a high-speed, low-cost trading platform that leverages the benefits of both centralized and decentralized exchanges. Here's a breakdown of its key features and components:

1. **Layer 2 Solution**: Loopring uses a technology called zkRollups (Zero-Knowledge Rollups) to increase transaction throughput and reduce costs. This allows for many transactions to be processed off-chain, with only the final state being recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, significantly improving scalability.

2. **Security**: By using zkRollups, Loopring ensures that user assets are always under their control, even though the transactions are processed off-chain. This combines the security of a decentralized exchange with the efficiency of centralized exchanges.

3. **Token (LRC)**: LRC is the native utility token of the Loopring protocol. It is used for various purposes within the ecosystem, including staking, which is required for certain operations and to earn protocol fees.

4. **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)**: Loopring provides the infrastructure for building DEXs that can offer high throughput and low fees, making decentralized trading more practical and accessible.

5. **Order Matching**: Loopring employs an order ring-matching system where multiple orders can be matched together in a circular trade, increasing liquidity and improving the chances of order fulfillment.

6. **Liquidity Mining and Incentives**: To attract users and liquidity providers, Loopring offers various incentive programs, including liquidity mining rewards, where users can earn LRC tokens for providing liquidity to the platform.

Overall, Loopring aims to enhance the user experience in decentralized trading by addressing key issues like scalability, cost, and security through innovative use of zkRollups and other advanced blockchain technologies."

Dear Members of the Board,loopringorg,1d8365t,2024-06-04 13:40:58,108,0.76,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/loopringorg/comments/1d8365t/dear_members_of_the_board/,stepwn,üí¨ Discussion üí¨,"I am writing to express my concerns and disappointment regarding the recent TAIKO airdrop to Loopring wallets with ""account activity"" over the past year. While this initiative was presented as a reward for active participation, the execution and distribution of these rewards have raised several issues that need to be addressed urgently.

Firstly, the criteria for receiving the airdrop, particularly the multipliers based on wallet ""interactions"" has resulted in significant disparities. Many long-term investors who have held substantial amounts of LRC for over three years received nothing, while others with minimal activity were rewarded disproportionately. This inconsistency undermines the principle of fair distribution and equitable treatment of all stakeholders.

It appears that the airdrop and other reward mechanisms, such as NFT red packets, are being used as ***a disguised gambling system***. This system requires users to perform certain tasks with the hope of receiving valuable rewards, essentially serving as ***unpaid user testing for Loopring‚Äôs products***. This approach not only exploits the community‚Äôs efforts but also introduces elements of chance and favoritism, which is contrary to the ethos of fairness and transparency.

Moreover, many of us invested heavily in Loopring three years ago, anticipating the development of zkEVM technology. However, following the departure of the CEO and the pivot to TAIKO, we find ourselves holding investments in a project that has not delivered on its initial promise. While the remaining technology is still worth investing in, the current practices of gambling-like rewards and ***potential self-dealing are deeply concerning***.

The lack of transparency regarding the specifics of how participation over the past year would affect TAIKO airdrop rewards has led to a sense of betrayal among the community. It seems that those with closer ties to the team, who were able to create multiple wallets, have benefited disproportionately. This situation, whether intentional or not, creates an environment that feels akin to the inequality depicted in George Orwell‚Äôs ""Animal Farm"" ‚Äì where some are ""more equal than others.""

I am calling on the Loopring board to address these issues with immediate effect. Transparency is paramount. ***The community deserves it***.

Loopring has always promoted the concept of being your own bank, emphasizing equality and fairness. It is crucial that the current practices align with these principles to restore trust and integrity within the community.

TAIKO Airdrop Eligibility and Criteria,loopringorg,1d832tx,2024-06-04 13:37:07,30,0.82,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/loopringorg/comments/1d832tx/taiko_airdrop_eligibility_and_criteria/,FireSpiritBoi,üí¨ Discussion üí¨,"QUESTION:

Why do I only get 110 Taiko when I have met the criteria for 1, 2 and 3?

1. I have 50k LRC

2. I have had an L2 for 2 years

3. I have loopring.eth ens linked to my wallet.



CRITERIA:

To qualify for the TAIKO airdrop, recipients must meet the following requirements:

**Entry Criteria:**  
To be eligible for the airdrop, the recipient's address must have engaged in at least one Loopring smart wallet transaction or one Loopring L2 transaction within the 12 months prior to the airdrop. The snapshot for this airdrop is set at the Ethereum mainnet block height 19859999.

**Multiplier Factor Criteria:**

1. Hold a minimum of 1,000 LRC on L1 or Loopring L2
2. Have a Loopring L2 account
3. Use a Loopring smart wallet address
4. Hold one or more Loopheads NFTs
5. Hold one or more Taiko Task NFTs
6. Hold more than 100,000 LRC on L1 or Loopring L2

**Weight Categories:**  
Each additional criterion met (from the Multiplier Factor Criteria) will double the address's weight. The six different weight categories are: 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x, and 32x.

**Additional Note for Taiko Task NFT Holders:**  
Since the Loopring smart wallet doesn't support deploying on various networks with the same address when the task kicked off, users have provided another Loopring Smart Wallet address to receive this NFT. That Loopring Smart Wallet address will be treated as eligible for at least the minimum 1x factor.

This structured approach ensures that more engaged users receive greater rewards through the airdrop.

Loopring at it again. Taiko Airdrop drama.,CryptoCurrency,1d80ikw,2024-06-04 11:50:28,80,0.7,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1d80ikw/loopring_at_it_again_taiko_airdrop_drama/,krfc89,COMEDY,"As alwys loopring team delivers. After 10 quarterly reports, Game Stop fiasko and D.Wang leaving woth Zkvm technology to start new project it was time to wreck the Old users and early adopters, people who bought in years ago because of Zkvm.

Team decided that people who activated the wallet, activated L2, staked and participated in liquidity pools for years are not eligible for the Taiko airdrop. 

Why ? 

Because they aren't active enough and they are ""Old"" users. It means people who staked and provided liquidity in thousands of dollars for years are less active then people who just bought some Lrc month ago. 

Guess this is how loyality of early adopters is rewarded. 

This Air Drop is worth at least 7/10 quarterly reports"
