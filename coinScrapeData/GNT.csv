Success migrating 7 year old GNT to GLM!,GolemProject,1h8ebvq,2024-12-06 18:02:14,17,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/GolemProject/comments/1h8ebvq/success_migrating_7_year_old_gnt_to_glm/,KeepsItReal,,"What a journey trying to migrate my GNT to GLM 😂 I was lost after the official token migration tool wouldn't work, after finally locating my GNT on my ledger on MEW, adding the token contract, locating the correct wallet, connecting it to Metamask, and getting the coins to actually appear. The MEW Golem tool doesn't exist in the new update, and Metamask wouldn't let me confirm the migration for some reason. After pouring through reddit and discord, someone recommended converting through the eth wallet on [mycrypto.com](http://mycrypto.com), and I found their token migration tool for GNT that finally worked. I even found some LEND that it converted to AAVE! Hopefully the hell I went through helps someone!"

Section IV.M.2.a.xviii: Golem Network (GLM)  
  
Analysis on Golem Network (GLM)  
  
Abstract  
  
The Golem Network, with its utility token GLM, represents a pioneering venture into decentralized supercomputing, aiming to democratize access to computational resources through blockchain technology. This abstract encapsulates an in-depth analysis of GLM within the context of trend following strategies in cryptocurrency trading. GLM, functioning as the currency within Golem's peer-to-peer marketplace for computing power, has transitioned from its predecessor GNT, marking a significant evolution in its tokenomics and utility. Our analysis delves into GLM's performance metrics, exploring its volatility, market cap trends, and trading volumes, alongside a comparative study against broader market indices. By applying trend following methodologies, this study assesses GLM's historical price movements, identifying key trends and reversal points that could inform trading strategies. Furthermore, we incorporate sentiment analysis from real-time platforms like X to gauge community and market sentiment's impact on GLM's price dynamics. This comprehensive approach not only evaluates GLM's potential as an investment within the volatile crypto market but also scrutinizes the practical implications of trend following in enhancing trading outcomes for GLM, offering insights into risk management, optimal entry/exit points, and the adaptability of such strategies in the face of market shifts.

"Golem Network Sheds $72M in Ethereum Amid Market Turmoil: Panic Sell or Smart Strategy?
",cryptotrading,1dyxsqm,2024-07-09 05:04:58,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptotrading/comments/1dyxsqm/golem_network_sheds_72m_in_ethereum_amid_market/,humbagas,,"The Golem Network, popular for its decentralized computing platform, has taken part in massive Ethereum (ETH) transactions that indicate financial importance. The on-chain analytics platform [Lookonchain](https://id.tomo.inc/x@lookonchain) have  disclosed on X that it recorded approximately 24,400 ETH worth \~$72M were being dumped into Binance and other main exchanges by Golem Network over the past three days.

This sale comes during a period of notable market volatility, particularly for [Ethereum](https://blockchainreporter.net/price-prediction/ethereum-price-prediction/), which has seen a substantial decrease in value recently. Golem Network: having introduced itself to the cryptocurrency community in November 2016 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), GNT raised roughly $8million or rather, 820kat an incredibly low price of Just $10.2 per ETH 

Now, jumping back to today – selling a piece of their stake instead paints a more nuanced picture around asset management, especially now that the price of ETH at last check traded $3,033 having plunged nearly 20% over the past month. 

According to Lookonchain, Golem still has roughly 127,634 ETH in reserve ($372 million), which shows just how much they’re holding onto their ETH bags and playing the long game.

Before losing access I did back up my private key (or at least, I think/hope I did).

My Golem is still in GNT form and I never migrated it to GLM. I have what I believe is the private key but I can't figure out what to do with it. I tried putting it into MyEtherWallet but it says its not a real key? Not sure if this is because it's still in GNT form and not the new GLM form. Any help would be appreciated. It's not worth much (<$50) but if you can help out I'd gladly tip!

The file I exported starts with ""address,privatekey,"" followed by a 108 character alpha-numeric string. Oddly enough, 2 of those characters are commas?? 1 randomly within the string, and the 2nd at the very end. There are 64 characters after the comma (not including the comma at the very end) and 42 before the comma.

I no longer have access to Jaxx wallet so this private key is all that I have left"

I see that I'm unable to do anything except buy and sell GNT on the Coinbase exchange. While other supported coins I'm able to convert (trade) to other types. How do I convert these so they are supported for exchange at Coinbase? I'm in the US so there don't appear to be any exchanges in the US that support the GNT coin. My ultimate goal is to be able to convert to Bitcoin or to cash out.

Do I need to go to [https://migrate.golem.network/](https://migrate.golem.network/) and create a wallet and then send the GNT to that new wallet and then migrate to the GLM format? Then I send it back to Coinbase again where I can convert to BTC or USD? Seems like some heavy fees could be involved."

As a puppy he and his siblings were stolen from their temple in Tibet and brought to Chicago, where they were held captive by demons. The monk in charge of bringing them home hired the professional wizard Harry Dresden to rescue them, and either because he sensed that he could do the most good with Harry or because he simply liked the cut of his jib, Mouse stowed away in Harry's car to stay with him. Initially named for his small size, he quickly grew into a monster of a canine to become of of Harry's most loyal and reliable allies.

Recently he's taken a backseat on Harry's adventures in order to focus on his current mission: >!Protecting Harry's daughter, Maggie Dresden!<.

Is Golem Network Is A Good Investment?,cryptologi_st,vkclvw,2022-06-25 07:00:13,4,0.84,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptologi_st/comments/vkclvw/is_golem_network_is_a_good_investment/,Cryptologi_st,," You may have known Golem from its former native token, GNT!  However, the Golem team began migrating GNT tokens to GLM tokens in 2020. But What is exactly Golem? Golem is a decentralised marketplace for idle and unused computing power, and it acts as a decentralised global supercomputer. GLM is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, which is the utility token of the Golem ecosystem. [Keep on reading here to learn how to earn passive income daily by renting out your unused computing power!](https://www.cryptologi.st/news/golem-network-2022-invest-or-not?utm_source=Forum&utm_medium=Media&utm_campaign=Promotion)"
Utility Tokens Vrs Governance Tokens,CryptoCurrency,uw8mkd,2022-05-23 15:47:15,10,0.78,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uw8mkd/utility_tokens_vrs_governance_tokens/,Zealousideal-War6206,ANALYSIS,"What is a governance token?
--------------------------------------------

Governance tokens are crypto currencies that signify voting power on a blockchain project. They are gems in the realm of Decentralized Finance, they are majorly part of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) projects since they need to distribute powers and rights to users in order to remain decentralized.

Apart from the fact that many DeFi tokens in the market are governance tokens, these governance tokens are not just for voting or does not have only a voting right. These cryptocurrencies or tokens also allow holders to earn money by yield farming, staking, create loans.  Examples of Governance Tokens include but not limited to Cryptex (CTX), Compound (COMP), and Synthetic (SNX).

I have an extensive post on Governance token, you can read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ubvstn/what_are_governance_tokens_and_why_they_are_hot/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

What is a utility token?
-----------------------------------

Utility tokens are a unique type of cryptocurrency that gives holders access to products and services. Utility tokens does not represent voting rights or ownership stake in a blockchain project, they are more like a “VIP ticket”. These tokens allows holders gain access to special services such as participating in a lunchpad. Utility tokens are unique to its ecosystem. Example of Utility Tokens are Binance Coin (BNB), Golem(GNT), Braves Basic Attention Token (BAT), Chainlink (Link), Polygon (Matic) etc. 

Though some utility tokens have some limited governance feature, there is still a difference between utility tokens and Governance Tokens. Example, Binance users can vote on token listings but can’t go beyond that to write a proposal. 

Governance token vs utility token. 
-----------------------------------------------------
Is there a difference between governance tokens and utility tokens? 
Clearly there is a difference between Governance Tokens and utility tokens eventhough some utility tokens carries some govenance feature like I mentioned ealier. 

-All Governance tokens can serve as a utility tokens but not all utility tokens are governance tokens. 

-All Governance tokens have voting power but not all utility tokens poses voting power. Golem (GNT), for instance, allows users to participate in the Golem protocol and participate in their network to loan out their computer’s spare processing power to others. However, Golem holders don’t have the power to vote on the future of Golem protocol.

-The bottom line is, most utility token do not posses the right to make proposals and change how a certain protocol looks.
In conclusion, Governance Tokens are upgraded version of utility tokens. 

Governance Tokens To look out For:
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Cryptex Finance- (CTX) 
   With a total supply of 10,000,000.
  CTX is a governance token that powers and secures the Cryptex protocol. 
Holders of CTX can vote on protocol upgrades for Total Crypto Market Cap Token (TCAP) as well as all future products within the Cryptex Finance ecosystem. 

2. Synthetic- (Snx) 
With a total supply of 190,075,446,
Synthetix is a derivatives protocol backed by a native token SNX.
In other to mint new derivatives that is Synths, usrs must stake at least 750% of the Synths value in SNX.

3.  Compound - (COMP) 
With a total supply of 10,000,000.
is the governance token behind the lending protocol.
COMP is earned by users for lending or borrowing assets.
Comp is used to govern protocol decisions on the compound governance dashboard."

#Carrot Glace
---------------------------------

>*""All the worlds babes belong to me!""* 

Carrot is commonly seen flirting with girls, which he often goes to many extremes to get their attention. Unless they have a boyfriend in which he then backs off. He not only flirts with village girls he also flirts with Dotta who enjoys the compliments directed at her but usually directed at times in which is not appropriate to, such as in when getting missions. He is pretty powerless compared to his brother, the Misu sisters and Gateau, with his only power being is his body is resistant to magic.

**Zoanthropy**

-----------------------------------------

When Carrot is hit by a Magic spell ""with intent to harm him"", his magical ability of Zoanthropy activates, transforming him into a monstrous version of one of the twelve zodiac animals. He [cannot choose what he changes into](https://imgur.com/a/4KP3lf7) and the strength of the spell can determine how much he transforms with weak spells only [partially transforming him](https://imgur.com/a/EFE4zw2). Also, spells that do not directly damage him may not trigger the transformation, such as [Regal's Crystal Magic](https://imgur.com/a/iqUUSNm) or [Mind Control](https://imgur.com/a/hYAKCgx) or spells that would [tear him apart](https://imgur.com/a/yazgOGN). 

**Partial Transformation**

**Horned Beast**

* Causes [mass destruction when transforming](https://imgur.com/a/C1RUIvl)

* Blasted with [Platina Energy](https://imgur.com/a/vgDk7XJ). Marron explains Carrot cannot absorb Platina Energy as it lacks ""evil intent"". However, when attempting to [save his father, Carrot did manage to turn into a giant dragon after being hit with it](https://imgur.com/a/FrBRmpl).

#Marron Glace
--------------------------------------

>*""You made one mistake and that was hurting my big brother!""* 

Marron, despite being younger than his brother, Carrot Glace, is the more mature and level-headed of the Glace brothers, getting his good looks from his mother Apricot (who is never shown in the series). His expertise is in the practice of defensive Oriental magic, often in the form of scraps of paper resembling Shinto wards. As a child, Marron was bullied relentlessly by the other children because of his feminine looks and was saved by his older brother. Now that he is older and advanced in skill and magic, he believes it is time to return the favor.

**Magic**

#Tira Misu
-----------------------------------

>*""Ohohohohoho! Be a good doggy or I'll whip you!""*


Tira is deeply in love with Carrot, but due to her shy nature she isn't very up-front until later in the manga. Tira gets jealous when Carrot flirts with other girls, and along with her sister Chocolate, she whips Carrot as punishment for his wandering eyes (though Tira is not as vicious as Chocolate is). In battle, Tira occasionally uses a wire/thread instead of a whip. She also has basic knowledge of Gaia's magic, which is derived from nature; magic she learned from Apricot Glace, though she is only able to heal with it.

#Chocolat Misu
--------------------------------

>*""I love you Darling, enough to kill you...""*


The sexy, straightforward, sometimes high-maintenance, short-tempered and somewhat nymphomaniac older sister of Tira. She is madly in love with Carrot (whom she more than often calls ""Darling""), and literally throws herself at him. Often, Carrot is petrified of her and flees from her advances. Still, she keeps a close bond with Tira, protecting her when it's needed and fighting in her name more than once. She and Gateau are a separate team early in the manga, but eventually all five form a single group.

**Mille Fuelle**

Also known as Milphey-uy, he is a transsexual male who most often acts with Carrot's group and has a thorough knowledge of necromancy and all kind of magic. His power comes from his Guardian Spirit, the Phoenix.

**Onion Glace**

A former Haz Knight who left the group to raise a family. He married Apricot Anzu, a fellow hunter and is Carrot and Marron's father. His appearance is very similar to Carrot's, with the addition of a facial scar and a far more muscular body. After the death of Apricot, it seems he has become as much of a lecher as his oldest son, at times.

I hope you are all in the green and doing good. I've been out of touch from the crypto world for almost a year now, got a very busy life now which helped me from looking at my portfolio almost every ten minutes back then. It just crossed my mind that I still have a few of these vintage cryptos and I would like to know (for those who recognized them) if you have any updates about them or if they are already 6 ft under the crypt or still ongoing projects that has as bright / gloomy future. (Of course these are not my main portfolio, these were some hot stuffs back then I think) . Thank you

Coinbase API: USDC Market Prices - No Golem or Loom,CoinBase,qn080o,2021-11-04 21:35:47,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/qn080o/coinbase_api_usdc_market_prices_no_golem_or_loom/,exitof99,,"Using the following URL:

GET https://api.coinbase.com/v2/exchange-rates?currency=USDC

It seems to return byte for byte exactly the same as:

GET https://api.coinbase.com/v2/exchange-rates?currency=USD

This means that markets restricted to only USDC trading are not available, such as LOOM and GNT (Golem).

There is a note in the API documentation that states that you can pass supported currencies, which leads to this call:

GET https://api.coinbase.com/v2/currencies

But, looking at that, Tether is not listed, yet, I'm able to pull the Tether prices using USDT as the parameter in the call. The default is also USD, so I was thinking maybe it was defaulting to USD, but when trying ""666"" or ""WEINER"" as the parameter value, the API doesn't respond, meaning that USDC is a valid value.

Further, the Prices API calls also do not accept LOOM or GNT, or any USDC market:

GET https://api.coinbase.com/v2/prices/CVC-USDC/buy

^^^ Won't work, but the following works:

https://api.coinbase.com/v2/prices/CVC-USD/buy

Does anyone know a workaround or a way to get these?"
Wildland Update (GLM - Golem Foundation Project) & why Golem is a sleeping giant,CryptoCurrency,qmhqtx,2021-11-04 06:35:46,16,0.86,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qmhqtx/wildland_update_glm_golem_foundation_project_why/,bose25,🔴 UNRELIABLE SOURCE,"You might have heard of Golem, the 2016 ICO that raised $8m in 29 minutes to fund a decentralised marketplace for trading computing power.

The company split in two, to **Golem Factory** which is still building that network, and **Golem Foundation** which is building other projects (such as Wildland), where both sides will utilise the same GLM token.

While the original Golem Network (**which will compete with AWS and centralised cloud-compute services**) now has 600 providers who have earned a total of 67,000 tokens for processing computations (you can become a provider and earn GLM y'know), Golem Foundation's Wildland project (**which will compete with Dropbox/Drive and centralised cloud-storage services**) is just taking off.

Wildland, to summarise as best as I can, will replace current centralised cloud storage providers, allowing you to sync many providers together and access data from each all in one folder, synced to all of your devices, with better usability through categorisation of your files.

**From Wlodek, part of Golem Foundation**:

""Let's say you have a large amount of data stored in different cloud buckets - some of your files reside on Dropbox, others on Google Drive, AWS S3 or some NAS. With Wildland you can expose all this dispersed data as one unified file system (or - to oversimplify it a bit - all these files will appear to reside locally on your hard-drive), and manage them with a file manager of your choice (e.g. the MacOS Finder, or if you are a Linux user - Thunar, Dolphin, Nautilus, etc.), without having to use any vendor-specific tools. This feature frees you from dependency on close-sourced, vendor-controlled apps and APIs, and allows you to manage your data with tools that you are comfortable with, and which you can modify to best suit your needs. ""

**They have just released the following blog post detailing what's coming up next for Wildland**: [https://wildland.io/2021/11/03/whatsnext.html](https://wildland.io/2021/11/03/whatsnext.html)

**Highlights for me include**:

* Focusing efforts on developing a user-friendly app to replace cloud storage providers
* Free cloud storage 'starter pack' to rival free tiers from Dropbox and similar services
* Wildland marketplace for purchasing additional storage to launch shortly after the app
   * Also available for users to sell their storage capacity to the network
* App available on macOS/iOS initially with Linux, Windows, Android and web apps planned
* Users issued with governance tokens
* **Burning GLM tokens as part of the app rollout**
   * Initially from Golem Foundation's supply and then as part of every Wildland transaction automatically
* Future governance dashboard to allow Wildland to be fully governed by users
* Integration of Wildland with a number of third-party apps and data sources
   * Dropbox, Google Drive and Amazon S3 apparently already available

**Why do I think that Golem is a sleeping giant?**

* Both Golem Factory and Golem Foundation are building big centralised-service-killers which will make those services cheaper and safer for users while also providing other users with an income stream
* The results of a large scientific project to simulate billions of chemical reactions to understand the origin of life on Earth will soon be published in scientific journals, bringing significant exposure to the Golem Network, and likely more researchers who will need to use the network: [https://cointelegraph.com/news/project-partnering-with-golem-network-attempts-to-simulate-the-creation-of-life-on-earth](https://cointelegraph.com/news/project-partnering-with-golem-network-attempts-to-simulate-the-creation-of-life-on-earth)
* Golem Factory has recently built Thorg, probably the most user-friendly mining software available, which pays out in GLM
   * As users use the software, it mines other cryptocurrencies and trades them for GLM
   * Golem are working with agencies to market towards the gaming community primarily to promote Thorg
* Golem Factory is closing in on launching GPU computing, which will accelerate the amount of work that providers can do, making it more attractive for requestors to use the network instead of centralised services
   * Thorg is already bringing in some GPU-heavy users who will, once released, be able to use Thorg for computing on the network *instead* of mining other cryptocurrencies
* Golem Foundation was created with the sole aim of providing more value to the GLM token and ecosystem through creating more use-cases
   * Wildland is their first major project, but every new project will add more use-cases and cause a snowball effect of value
* Coinbase are yet to add the GLM token, HOWEVER, they previously added the old GNT token to CoinbasePro and thus will need to migrate that to the new token at some point
   * They previously said twice earlier this year that this would be completed during Q1 and then during Q2, so while they are massively behind schedule it is something they appear to intend to do
* Both companies are EXTREMELY well funded, moreso than practically any other cryptocurrency project out there, giving them an insane amount that can be used to market their projects once they are developed enough:
   * Golem Factory has $780,000,000 in Ether and another $28m in their own tokens: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x7da82c7ab4771ff031b66538d2fb9b0b047f6cf9](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7da82c7ab4771ff031b66538d2fb9b0b047f6cf9)
   * Golem Foundation has $504,000,000 in Ether: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x3d4530082c3eb60f58af03f79b1ed3f40e591cd1#internaltx](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3d4530082c3eb60f58af03f79b1ed3f40e591cd1#internaltx)
   * Between them, they have more than a BILLION DOLLARS in funding, which is only going up as the price of Ether appreciates
* Golem Factory is a member of the Enterprize Ethereum Alliance and is dedicated to building on Ethereum and improving the ecosystem alongside hundreds of others: [https://entethalliance.org/eea-members/#g](https://entethalliance.org/eea-members/#g)

$GLM has been added to our exchange service!,Cryptocurrency_Daily,qlfq1w,2021-11-02 18:15:57,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cryptocurrency_Daily/comments/qlfq1w/glm_has_been_added_to_our_exchange_service/,Shimbo_io,,"[Shimbo.io](https://Shimbo.io) is developing a new service that allows our partners to add an instant crypto exchange feature. And recently we've added the support of $GLM on our platform!

On April 28th 2016 the Golem Project was announced, led by Golem Factory. The network launched on mainnet on April 10, 2018. The Golem Network is a decentralized computation network, a new way of distributing redundant computing power to those who are in need of it, on-demand. It creates a peer-to-peer network where users join on an equal basis to buy and sell computation, splitting up complicated tasks into smaller subtasks in the network. In Golem there’s no central authority and no user is more or less important than another.

GNT or Golem Network Token is needed to pay for computations on the network and is the currency that drives our marketplace. As a Requestor, you set a bid for an amount of GNT you are willing to pay to have your task completed. As a Provider, you earn GNT by computing tasks for Requestors. You can set your minimum and maximum price thresholds in your settings.

On November 11th, 2016, the GNT token sale started and finished. The token sale reached the maximum cap in 29 minutes with 1 billion GNT tokens created and distributed. 82% of the GNT went to token sale participants, 12% to the operating company, and 6% to Golem’s founders. On November 19th, 2020, the GNT token began a migration to the new token GLM where individuals holding GNT were able to burn their old GNT tokens and receive the new GLM 1:1. It will always be possible to migrate GNT to GLM 1:1.

Ive recently started using Delta after FTX app completely removed all portfolios from users, and I'm liking it!

I've come across an interesting one though, I've been trying to add a transaction for my Golem (GNT) coin and it only allows me to select 2 exchanges which are none of which I need (I use BTCMarkets). Any ideas or is this as expected for some reason?

The two exchanges are COSS and HOTBIT.

Alts going strong today (relative to bitcoin),CryptoCurrency,pnaka9,2021-09-13 03:15:54,9,0.71,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pnaka9/alts_going_strong_today_relative_to_bitcoin/,Flying_Koeksister,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION,"*EDIT: BTC dropped heavily taking many alts down with it. Updated to reflect new results.*

*Edit2: Sorry for the multiple edits. Alts dropped quite a bit today.*

So here we are once again looking at what’s going strong for today. As usual all increases are reported relative to BTC.

**What is this relative strength business?**

Relative strength is the ratio of the asset performance relative to a market index. In this case, we talking about crypto, and the market index I am using is the BTC spot price.

Hence, ALGO being + 8.77% above BTC shows that it is performing 8% better than BTC. This essentially shows ALGO has strong relative strength (for today).

In a nutshell  it’s another way to measure a cryptos performance.

**What’s in it for me?**

Relative strength is something mostly used by traders. But I am sharing here for the following reasons :

\- Spread of hopium and positivity

\- For those who are purely curious

\- To help those discover coins they did not know about

&#x200B;

Right with that intro over. Let us look at the markets:

&#x200B;

Edit: I had to redo this and make several edits due to alts dropping a lot today.

&#x200B;

## Still green and strong (relative to BTC)

\-  **Tezos (XTZ):**  (**~~was  +18.01%    )~~**    now **17.38%**

*o Something like Eth but uses proof of stake.*

&#x200B;

**- Polkadot (DOT): now +7%**

*o Deals with multi chain interoperability and scalability*

&#x200B;

**- Dai (DAI): +3.25%**

*Eth stable coin. This inclusion may seem strange yet its green relative to my FIAT (+1%) and also green relative to BTC (+3.25%)*

&#x200B;

A lot of coins fell today suddenly, hence the strike outs.

## Coins that fell off this list today (was positive now negative)

These coins were in green, but had to be removed off the list as they became negative later in the day. 

\- **StorJ (STORJ):** *Decentralized storage.*

\- **Golem (GNT):**  *Decentralized computing power*

\- **Chainlink (LINK):**  *Eth coin. Allows access to tamper proof off-chain data sources in smart contracts*

\- **MonaCoin (MONA):** *Fork of litecoin\]*

**- TRON (TRX):** Founded in Singapore. Decentralized content entertainment ecosystem

**- Civic (CVC) :**  *Decentralized Identity verification. Eth token*

**- Siacoin (SC):**  *Decentralized storage*

**- Waves (WAVES):** *A platform for custom tokens , smart contracts (like Etherium)*

**- Algorand (ALGO):**  *A beloved coin here at* r/cryptocurrency\~\~\*. So far has been showing a very strong showing since the crypto sale/ flash crash.\*\~\~

All increases quoted relative to bitcoin

# List Of ERC20 Tokens

But what are the best tokens with the ERC20 standard? The following is a list of tokens that are all based on ERC20 standards in Ethereum Blockchain.

&#x200B;

* Chainlink
* Tether
* Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)
* OmiseGO (OMG)
* 0x (ZRX)
* Populous (PPT)
* Maker (MKR)
* Augur (REP)
* Golem (GNT)
* IOStoken (IOST)
* Status (SNT)
* DigixDAO (DGD and DGX)
* Loopring (LRC)
* Basic Attention Tokens (BAT)

Keep in mind that if a token is built to the ERC20 standard and transferred to a private blockchain, you will need to move all the tokens with the new address in the new blockchain. In this case, a general process must be performed to transfer the tokens you already have in your Ethereum wallet to the new blockchain wallet. Before making any transfer, you need to make sure what blockchain your token has moved to and the exact wallet address. If you enter this address incorrectly, you will lose your entire token supply."

I thought it is meant to send back to the original address??????

The two transactions above have nothing to do with me I assumed the migration was complete but couldn't understand how it took pretty much all the ETH I swapped and even worse how it done these transactions without my consent without the ledger being plugged in.

The ICO was made with 1,000,000,000 GNT available. From this, 6% or 60,000,000 GNT was kept by the Golem Team, and 12%, or 120,000,000 GNT, was kept by Golem Factory GmbH. This means that 820,000,000 GNT was made public here, and I will assume that Golem has kept all their GNT/GLM and only liquidated ETH, but this is not entirely true because of bounties but that's on a relatively small scale. This means that **180,000,000** GNT/GLM is ""lost"" for now.

* **Death rates**

Every year, about 0.75% die ([macrotrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/WLD/world/death-rate)). If we exclude that potential social groups may collect more crypto than others, this means that if we use this value and extrapolate it to span over 5 years, we can see that in theory, **24,878,136 GNT/GLM**, should be lost from deaths. 

1.0075 \^ 5 \* 820,000,000 - 820,000,000 =  24,878,136 GNT/GLM

Most people don't ""future-proof"" their crypto so that family members will be able to get them if they die, so I am assuming the full amount here.

also, ~~Golem the supercomputer will kill everyone through AI and make GLM worth an infinite amount of money~~

* **Migration**

Right now, only 51.06% of GNT have been migrated to the new GLM token. Exchanges may be doing it out of laziness, technical issues, or legal reasons - but how does it look for individuals and holders in general? We can take a look at [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa74476443119A942dE498590Fe1f2454d7D4aC0d#balances) and see holders relative to their balances. This instantly shows that 10.95% of all GNT is owned by Golem, probably 20.44% owned by Coinbase, and 1.55% owned by Binance. People can still migrate, and all of these hold big portions of GNT and don't instantly need GLM - but I assume they still hold the wallets for these coins. I wanted to draw a conclusion here with how many held coins that weren't worth enough to migrate, but I can't really do this at the moment as all top 500 holders have > 28,000 GNT. I can however make the current locked away funds easier for us to understand, as we can remove **435,770,211 GNT/GLM** in the *current situation*, as the rest are already removed from what Golem kept to themselves from the ICO.

* **zkSync providers & requestors**

Although they can still withdraw at any time, it can be costly. They need to pay withdrawal fees, then to trade them they will need to pay ETH fees and have enough for both a trade and a deposit - which most people won't have. For instance, 500 of the online providers don't even have 10 GLM in total earnings, and a lot of people try out providing someday or some week only to never return - and all this GLM gets locked up, usually never to be seen again. I would only estimate a few thousand to be lost to this, though.

* **Miscellaneous factors**

Many people are too lazy to check markets, many people are holding long-term, many people have too little GLM to sell on exchanges and/or withdrawing from them, many people don't have ETH to transact, many people will lose their wallets regardless

**Conclusion**

Although a lot isn't permanently lost, as I could only estimate comfortably **24,878,136 GNT/GLM** being gone, and the rest being very speculative in lost wallets and too few tokens to actually be worth selling, there is still a lot of GNT/GLM that is locked away. Thousands by providers, probably hundreds of thousands on exchanges, probably millions in lost wallets, and other very speculative stuff for the most part. We can however see that for now, there are at least 43,781,899,321 GNT/GLM locked away temporarily - behind migrations, the Golem team, and dead wallets - meaning that the total coin supply is temporarily at most at **359,351,653** GLM."

**Bitcoin (BTC)** 

The first and most widely recognized cryptocurrency. Bitcoin allows users to send money anywhere, anytime in a peer-to-peer fashion without the need for banks or governments. It has been analogized to “Gold on the internet” due to its hard money, non-sovereign properties but also the ease with which one can store and send it. Bitcoin is the most secure, censorship-resistant, and de-risked cryptocurrency in the world. Read more about [Bitcoin’s strengths and weaknesses. ](https://www.cryptoeq.io/corereports/bitcoin)

**Litecoin (LTC)** 

The silver to Bitcoin's gold. Litecoin optimized for cheaper, faster transactions compared to Bitcoin while still preserving much of the original design including Proof of Work. Commerce/merchant adoption of Litecoin as a means of payment remains negligible while the security and price relative to Bitcoin have declined over time. Read more about [Litecoin’s strengths and weaknesses. ](https://cryptoeq.io/corereports/litecoin-abridged)

If you want to join me in watching metamask account get robbed by some asshole look below,CryptoCurrency,oip4mi,2021-07-12 07:12:31,10912,0.85,2736,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oip4mi/if_you_want_to_join_me_in_watching_metamask/,007happyguy,SECURITY,"My metamask wallet number is 0xc97603fc31d6e96C2A145EC44B369d5263470279

Some bustard who tricked me into clicking on a dodgy link (pretending to be tech support for SNX on discord) has taken half my wallet so far (about $130k). The rest is still there but disappearing slowly in front of my eyes.

You can see all the transactions from this morning how he/she is cleaning up.

Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be anything I can do other than jumping on the occasional ETH transfer they are making in so I can sweep it out.

The only reason I haven't shared my secret phrase with the whole world is a quiet hope I might one day get it back. But if  that's never going to happen maybe I should share it with you all. After all it would amuse me if someone else steals it before @scofield#0471 takes it all.....

EDIT: 

I can see people asking why am I not moving the coins out. The answer is I really, really, really tried. 
However there seems to be script which instantly transfer the coins to a different wallet, no matter what I type in for gas fees or the address. So far I failed on ALCX, on YFI, on SLP, on AAVE - so I have given up as I don’t know what to do a setting up a script myself is beyond my abilities. Whenever I add in ETH, all it does is makes its easier to the bastard to take my coins. So all I can literally do is watch right now.

SECOND EDIT

I was sent a link to a site which was going to validate my MM extension. The site looked real enough that I clicked on it and entered my security phrase. That was where I suddenly blew up 6 years worth of HODLing in one go….

THIRD EDIT

Normally I am hyper sensitive to security and very very wary of online support from strangers. However, due to a rare combination of sleep deprivation from staying up late to watch the Euro 2020 final, and not paying attention when I should have I made the fatal error of falling for what is now obviously a elaborate con. I’m so used to clicking approve on Defi sites to connect to wallets that my guard has as down and this looked genuine enough.

By the time I realised what was happening it was too late. I logged into MM from a MacBook as my original wallet was on pc, but it made no difference. They initially took 8 ETH, some sushi and old GNT I forgot to convert. With no gas fees the raid stopped. So I thought I would be quick and add a little gas and try and take some out. That didn’t work - no matter what I big in gas fees it was either immediately outbid (lost my aave and STETH) or accepted and went to another wallet which I didn’t recognise (lost my ALCX there). Later the fucker started liquidating my assets and put gas in to do this. I managed - and this was through the most frantic clicking and accepting any fucking gas bid at the highest price  to transfer out the ETH to a separate wallet. I managed to get some out which slowed the attacks as there was no ETH to pay for the gas. This would happen every hour and I managed to get about 0.05 ETH LOL 

This was totally my mistake and not due to SNX, who to be fair, warn you not to do what I did. But I was tired, had sent a message to their tech support sub and instead of reading the warning, ignored it like a noob so yeah - I own this and it’s my fault.

To those of you who think this is fake, I hope it never happens to you. I had to take a day off work to watch this slow motion disaster - I am sitting with a sick feeling, with pounding chest and periodically start tearing up which I can only assume is a slow motion panic attack. I have told my wife who is understandably shocked. When it all goes, I get to tell the rest of family that I got fucked over through ONE SINGLE LAPSE OF JUDGEMENT.

I posted this as a warning to the bulk of the community who could just as easily have fallen for the same

I used to look down on exchanges but they all look safer as least they have 2FA which MM lacks.

I’m pretty much done now with believing crypto will only change the world for the better and for the first time have been thinking, bring on more fucking regulation and make every wallet linked to an ID  - that way one day I can find out the bastard who cleaned me out and will spend what I have left on justice.

FOURTH EDIT

Thank you so much to everyone for their sympathy and support. To those of you telling me I’m dumb /stupid / foolish for so much holding on MM, thank for the comments but after the first 100 I stopped reading them as they get dull quickly. It was a mistake to leave so much on MM and with hindsight, the fact that my ledger wasn’t letting me connect to some Defi sites was an obvious flag rather than an obstacle.

So since this afternoon, I was recommend the flashbots service on discord by some of you. With some (read massive) trepidation about using discord again, I posted my details and one of their whitehat guys Alex got in touch. 

I won’t give all the details for now as he’s still on the case but he already rescued just over 40 steth that was staked on curve as a ETH/STETH LP pool. I’m overjoyed as that’s $85k that I had written off now back (and in a ledger before any of you ask).

I’m hopeful as to what happens to the remaining $35k but it already feels like a fuck you to the thief.

Thanks to those of you who told me some of my stolen money may have gone to kraken, I’m messaging them so I hope they can freeze the money and if I’m lucky even help ID the counterpart (not holding my breath though as I don’t know ifs it’s real and whether they will help or not).

With respect to the site I clicked on, DM if you really want to know but I left it off here in case someone else clicks on it and makes the same mistake I did. I’ve got in touch with the domain hosts to ask for their help in identifying the thief.

Obviously it not the best day in the world but feels a hell of a lot better than it did a few hours ago.

FIFTH and hopefully final edit

Thank you to everyone who has sent positive messages of support, both below and in the chat. They have really helped, especially at the start when I was super stressed with indescribable feeling of watching my account get emptied in front of my eyes and being powerless to do anything about it. The (useful) advice from people was helpful and I am especially thankful that the flashbots teams was recommended.

Alex has been been awesome. After he verified that the account was actually mine he stepped to stop the bleed (and I appreciated the fact that both the groups on discord and even this sub want to fact-check this to make sure it’s not a scam or a lie to flame someone). He set up a burner to remove incoming ETH which meant the thief couldn’t take more as there was no gas on the account. He then started to work on moving out the remaining coins to a safe wallet. At the time of writing he’s retrieved 117k from the 120k that was left (using this mornings prices). There’s a bit left which will hopefully come over but given how much was taken this am, that’s a rounding error on what I lost. For those of you who need his details DM or wait as I’ll edit one last time and add his Twitter account when this is all over and I’m calm. He has been amazing and whilst they ask for a modest fee it’s well worth it.

Thanks to Kraken for reaching out and apologies to SNX if it looked like I was blaming them for my mistake. Hopefully Kraken can help but I’m also going to message a lot of the other exchanges too - anything I can do to make the money hard to get for the thief will make me happy and maybe it might even get him caught (but really not holding my breath on that).

For those of you who keep wondering (1) no, I am not doing this for moon farming as making a few dollars and getting karma in no way makes up for a hit, (2) this isn’t a new account. I’ve been on Reddit for years but am usually silent as the chats can get poisonous quickly, (3) even I knew it was risky leaving so much on a hot wallet but I have used MM for a long time and found Ledger to be challenging with some Defi. I really wish I had been more careful but that’s done. I don’t blame anyone other than myself and the bastard who stole my coins but wish MM had 2FA which would have killed this or a way to hard freeze your account instantly which again would stop the bleed and work out a recovery and (4) for all of you who are sitting on your high horse lecturing me on how dumb this is and why you should never use your private data online - I fully understand and agree with your point of view, as YESTERDAY I would have been like YOU safe in the knowledge that nothing like this would ever happen to ME…..

It’s been a hell of day but I’ll be fine with time.

SIXTH AND FINAL EDIT

Okay so it been a surreal 24 hours. For those of you who want the full sequence of events it’s basically this.

I have a few different accounts but started using MetaMask heavily in recent months. Basically because Argent was heavy in gas prices and my ledger didn’t always connect to some of the DEFI sites I stitched to MM. Thanks to a run up in crypto market valuations, and some small trades and staking, the $20k was playing with 6 months ago in the hot wallet had became around $250-260k yesterday.

My first mistake was leaving such a large amount on MM. In fact I had been actively considering moving some of it but with hindsight waited too too long. At times gas prices on ETH have been insane and was my pure bad luck that yesterday was one of the cheapest days around where tx were a few dollars rather than $20-70 which I’d seen in previous weeks. Trying to save a few hundred bucks turned out to be a very bad decision.

With hindsight, I wish I had got up and gone to work and the worst that would have happened would have been feeling deeply disappointed by the England performance the night before.  Instead I went on to make one of the most expensive mistake of my life. 

I decided that yesterday I would finally get around to messaging the help desk at the discord chat for SNX and ask if they could help me with some SNX I had deposited there on the L2 wallet. The problem was, that I was able to see the amount of SNX on their Optimism mainnet which showed SNX token only but not but not my ETH, whilst the Ethereum mainnet showed my ETH and other alts but not the SNX tokens.

I went to the sub and asked for help in the chat. Got no response and tried a bit later. That time I got 3 people replying in private chats each claiming to be from SNX. Whilst the SNX sub warns against this, I was tired and assumed that maybe it was like some of the other subs where people can advise you if the mods are busy.

To my misfortune I replied to the scammer explaining the problem. He basically told me my MM wallet wasn’t syncing back to the network and I should validate it. That sounded plausible given I couldn’t see my total balances and also in recent weeks I’ve faced a glitch as time where the wallet balance comes up a zero for up to a minute when I first open it so thought maybe he’s right.

To help, he sent a link to quite a detailed looking site which looked real enough and unfortunately, thanks to weeks of linking random DEFI sites to my MM wallet  I had become unfortunately desensitised to connecting to random pages and accepting connections to my wallet

When I tried the link on the fake site, it wasn’t working apparently so Scammer suggested I try again. This time, I figured maybe I should try the option to connect to my wallet by entering my private pass phrase. 

Yes I know it was dumb NOW

Yes I realise it’s my fault.

I’ll live with this expensive mistake for a long time.

A strange set of events in which I was super tired, not nearly alert enough and my warning radar was off meant I went for the most basic and simple phishing scam. To those of you on your high horses laughing about how this can never happen to you - good luck and I hope you carry on living perfect lives in which you never make a mistake.

A few mins pass as the scammer is still engaged on the discord chat explaining it will take some time. He then causally asks me if I have a ledger and want to sync that too….

At that instant, I suddenly realise what I’ve done and get a cold sweat. Why the fuck should he ask that unless….

I check my MM wallet on zapper.fi and see that the wallet balance has suddenly dropped. I’m now missing $20k and a quick check shows my 8 ETH, some sushi and some Golem which I had are gone. 
 
I start to get super angry that I’ve lost 8 coins. After a few mins I calm down and suddenly realise that the only reason I haven’t lost more is there is now zero ETH on my account so no way to do more transactions.

It’s likely that he must have set up a copy of my wallet on his pc and started emptying it out. At this stage I’m becoming less angry about what’s gone and becoming deeply worried about the rest.

I send frantic emails to MM which aren’t answered until late in the evening and the next morning (which basically tell me there is nothing that can be done in my case and be more careful next time - thanks guys, will never be using you again.)

At this point, the major weakness of MM finally hits me. Forget the convenience, if all goes wrong I have literally NO way to stop any transactions (hell they don’t even show in my wallet but I can see them on zapper) or freeze the account. Consensys may have built a nice chrome extension but it’s useless if there’s a problem. 

At some point I look up and see that more of my coins are disappearing. 20 odd STETH suddenly disappearing is especially painful. I check on zapper and can see he is putting in ETH to put up gas fees to move stuff off the Defi sites and liquidating my coins and moving them out. Now I’m actively watching the account on zapper. Whenever I saw ETH come in I tried to first move the coins to my ledger but every single time it just goes to another unknown wallet. WTF? I eventually understand that they have copied my account on a different pc and are probably running a script to automatically outbid me. I had watched my one YFI go - that hurt as I had spent a BTC on it lol. I watched my 104 ALCX go - another 15 ETH gone in smoke. 

My whole accounts looks fucked and all I can literally do is watch….

Around this point I send my first panicked message to Reddit that I was down 130k and likely to lose the whole lot. I figure maybe between the likely ridicule and crap I will get, maybe I will get lucky with some help. 

In the meantime all I can do is try to run slight interference by trying to move some of the ETH that the thief was adding to another account. Strangely moving ETH to another wallet appears to be the only coin I could impact. When I can moved it I try and run a tx and cancel it with a high gas fee to disrupt the ETH balance and screw up his transfers. This slows the bleeding but it’s not over and I don’t know what I can do. I read messaged here about trying other pcs, logging out of MM, I try it all and it does no good and makes me more stressed that the scammer might be stealing more when I’m not watching.

When I first posted on Reddit I was down about half with the remaining amount staked on curve (alcx/ETH LP, zrx/ETH LP, ETH/stETH LPs) which was around 120k. Don’t know why they were last to go but thank god they were there.

In between the usual trolls and assholes calling me a liar, there were messages of support and some very helpful suggestions on then flashbots discord sub (initially sent to me by the SNX subs).

I messaged flashbots and Alex from there got in touch. I gave him full info and access to my ex to verify it was mine). Even he commented that I shouldn’t do this (lost track of how many times I heard that yesterday) but as my account was already compromised I had to trust it would be okay as without it he couldn’t do anything.

He explained that he would first set up a burner so any ETH coming in would be immediately burned leaving no gas for transfers. This was quickly set up which closed the gate on the thief for the short term. 

For those of you checking the wallet history you can see some incoming ETH which then immediately is removed - that scammer’s ETH he’s wasting now. I didn’t want to alert him as to what was happening, so there was minimal mentions of this on my posts to Reddit, which I was still checking as this forum sometimes has some very useful feedback and suggestions.

Over the next 8 hours Alex managed to move the remaining balance to a hard wallet and basically recovered all of my remaining balance minus some dust and dai staked on alchemix which I can’t get back so it’s all there which was around 117k out of 120k. I don’t know how he did it - if you really want to know go to discord and ask him - but I am overjoyed that he did what he did. It’s amazing for both his stepping in and spending hours to save this and no less for his 100% total honesty and integrity. If he had moved the coins elsewhere and told me it was the original thief I would never have known.

In the end I’ve lost about 55 ETH and saved about the same (values were all over the place as the market tanked in the evening).

I didn’t post for moons or karma. I posted as a warning and for help and I’m glad I did. I would never have found the courage to trust flashbots without it. I would not have been alerted to the scammer using Kraken to deposit the stolen coins.

To those of you who offered financial support/crypto/gofundme, thank you so much but there is really no need. Alex has saved a big chunk and I will be alright. Losing this amount of coins thanks to a scam is painful but if I couldn’t stomach large swings I wouldn’t have held on for years - if I can live through a few 80% drawdowns in BTC and ETH and recover, then I’ll come back from this okay (however for a while I will stop measuring my crypto value in $ rather than #coins lol).

Thank you very much to everyone who offered emotional support and well wishes. They are very much appreciated and more than make up for the large number of trolls and morons who like to throw around shit. Please don’t worry about me. My wife, whilst initially shocked and upset, is fully supportive and I have every confidence I will do really well (especially after EIP 1559 and later ETH 2.0)

To the libertarians, outraged that I’ve swung to side of more regulation, I want to say that I still believe that you should do what you want - legally. It doesn’t have to be totally anonymous - hell half the problem with the current version of the internet is anonymous trolls venting lies and crap everywhere. 

For crypto to go truly mainstream you need some degree of safety and the ability to follow up and prosecute crimes. Watching some c*** screw me over in real time was an infuriating and humbling experience and definitely made me resent the anonymity of the scammer…..

BTW for those of you who go on about being your own bank good luck and come back to the real world where actual banks are regulated and safe (unlike the current Wild West of crypto Defi) and remember many of us don’t want to be our own bank. I never thought about being my own bank and bought coins like ETH for other reasons. I like the blockchain and the crypto space as they are exciting and disruptive ideas that will hopefully make a new version of the internet in due course and change the world. However like the internet 2.0, no matter how it starts, eventually governments will step in and more regulation is coming. 

Mr scammer, I’ve already reported you to a bunch of exchanges where you seem to be staking your stolen coins and even if I can’t get you immediately, your records are permanently there on the blockchain and one day you will be fucking found….

Finally thanks again to Alex!

For those of you who asked about him, his Twitter handle is @amanusk_

Differences between Coin and Token — HKToken Course 7,HKToken,oiolox,2021-07-12 06:32:08,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HKToken/comments/oiolox/differences_between_coin_and_token_hktoken_course/,HKTokenWallet,,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ttct2djjera71.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58fecb1c2fd559aa13d96635448bc84767b29709

 

**Main point:**

– Coins are any cryptocurrency that has a standalone independant blockchain (Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, …)

– Altcoins are considered as coins that are not Bitcoin.

– Tokens are cryptocurrencies that do not have their own blockchain but live on another blockchain. As they live on another blockchain, they benefit from its technology. (ERC-20 tokens…)

# Coin

Coins refer to any cryptocurrency that has a standalone, independent blockchain — like Bitcoin.

These cryptocurrencies are bootstrapped from scratch, and the broader network is designed explicitly to achieve a certain goal. For example, Bitcoin exists as a censorship-resistant store of value and medium of exchange that has a secure, fixed monetary policy. The native token of Bitcoin, BTC (i.e., bitcoins), is the most liquid cryptocurrency in the market and has both the highest market cap and realized market cap in the cryptocurrency sector.

Coin projects typically draw inspiration from past technologies or other cryptocurrencies and fuse them into an innovative network catering to a specific purpose.

Another example of a coin, Ethereum’s Ether (ETH) is the native coin of a smart contracts platform for creating general-purpose computer programs that run on a decentralized blockchain. Rather than focusing on financial data, Ethereum focuses on arbitrary program data that can cover anything from games to social media. Ether is used for sending/receiving, managing assets, paying gas fees, and interacting with decentralized applications (dapps) on the network.

You might also have heard about Altcoins. Basically, we call Altcoins any coins that are an alternative to Bitcoin.

# Token

Tokens are a unique outlay of broader smart contracts platforms like Ethereum that enable users to create, issue, and manage tokens that are derivatives of the primary blockchain.

For example, the ICO craze of 2017 was fueled by Ethereum’s ERC-20 token standard, which is basically a protocol for creating tokens (besides ETH) on the Ethereum blockchain that can be exchanged with each other. Projects would announce or build an application on Ethereum using smart contracts, and issue a native token for use in that application, raising funds directly from investors in ETH in the process.

Tokens occupy a unique corner of the cryptocurrency market where they function as “utility” tokens within an application’s ecosystem for incentivizing certain behavior or paying fees. For example, the popular ERC-20 token Dai is part of the MakerDAO dapp on Ethereum. MakerDAO is a way for users to access credit instruments like lending/borrowing using Dai, which is designed to be stable. ERC-20 tokens like Dai can be exchanged for any other ERC-20 token or other Ethereum-based standards (i.e., ERC-721), including the ETH coin.

As a result, tokens exist as application-specific tokens within a coin’s broader cryptocurrency/blockchain network, like Dai existing within Ethereum’s ecosystem.

Other tokens besides Dai include Maker (MKR), 0x, Augur (REP), Komodo (KMD), and Golem (GNT).

Coins need to be exchanged with each other through cryptocurrency exchanges because they are built on different, non-standardized code protocols. Conversely, tokens on Ethereum (e.g., ERC-20) can be exchanged through internal applications amongst each other with minimal friction because they are built on standardized code protocols.

Approaching cryptocurrency markets is a challenging task, but understanding the basic distinction between the various types of cryptocurrencies can help you manage risk and make better decisions in a volatile ecosystem."
Top 10 Cryptocurrencies With Practical Usecases,CryptoCurrency,ogvk6o,2021-07-09 09:28:47,19,0.67,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ogvk6o/top_10_cryptocurrencies_with_practical_usecases/,BTCrrsr,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION,"1. Bitcoin (Payments & Storer of Value)

Of course, I will start my list with the king of cryptocurrencies – Bitcoin.

Bitcoin has been effectively solving a real-world problem since it was born in 2009. It was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto and meant to be an alternative to the traditional banking system for the global masses.

Satoshi understood that central banks and governments have become insidious and inflationary. That’s why, through Bitcoin, he wanted to show us that decentralized trust could be created and we no longer needed to be at the mercy of centralized ledgers (banks, PayPal, etc.) that charge arbitrarily for the mere transfer of funds.

He also created Bitcoin to be a reliable store of value, just like how the value of gold can be preserved for ages.

And now, in 2017, Bitcoin’s 9408 full-running nodes are a testimony to the fact that Bitcoin is the decentralized powerhouse that it was designed to be. Since 2009, it has only become stronger and stronger.

I know some complaint about high Bitcoin transaction fees, but as it figures out how to effectively scale, that will go away.

Bitcoin has so far proudly lived the test of time and will continue to improve with second layer technologies.


2. Ethereum (Smart Contracts & DApps)

 Ethereum entered the market in early 2014 with an announcement from its founder, Vitalik Buterin.

Ethereum intends to be a one-stop shop for creating decentralized applications and smart contracts that have no single point of failure and are autonomous.

And after almost 3 years since Ethereum’s launch, I would say that it has been very successful in implementing its use case of smart contracts and DApps.

It’s 667 DApps – out of which some are running and some are in development – along with a total of 1727819 contracts that have already been deployed on Ethereum’s blockchain are a testimony to the fact that it is achieving its objective.

Even though we keep on hearing about Ethereum hacks, hard forks, and scaling issues, that doesn’t mean it has no practical use. I believe it will keep on doing well by solving and implementing its fundamental purpose.


3. Monero (Anonymous, Private & Fungible Digital Money)

Did you know that Bitcoin is not anonymous?

That’s right. It’s not. Everything exists on the public blockchain. This feature of Bitcoin makes it pseudo-anonymous and non-fungible. Noticing this, Monero (XMR) came into the market in 2014 with a practical idea of making truly anonymous, private, and fungible digital money.

And in 2017, Monero has been inching closer to its original goal as they have successfully tested and implemented stealth addresses, ring signatures, and ring CT-like technologies (see the Wiki page for more info). The only thing left is the implementation of permanent IP obfuscation, which I believe will be happening soon. But for now, as a workaround, you can use a Tor or onion network to acheive this objective.

And a Twitter comment by Riccardo Spagni (core developer of Monero) speaks volumes about Monero’s privacy. During the recent AlphaBay fiasco, investigators weren’t even able to find the amount of Monero funds that AlphaBay had accumulated.


But it needs to be noted that the features of privacy, anonymity, and fungibility are not only necessary for criminals. Even normal people like you and me need these things because, without them, it’s easy to be robbed or kidnapped.

That’s why the Monero currency has a practical use case which it is trying to implement.


4. Factom (Decentralized Notary)

Factom (FCT) entered the cryptocurrency market in late 2014. It intends to be the immutable universal record keeper of the world.

Factom’s founder Peter Kirby realized that Bitcoin’s blockchain, by design, has core constraints which don’t leave much scope for innovative solutions. But over the years, this very blockchain has proven to be the most trustable and immutable record of monetary transactions ever created.

Factom was designed to take advantage of that security and immutability.

Once something is recorded onto the Factom platform, it can’t be changed, and it becomes forever immutable as it becomes anchored to Bitcoin’s blockchain. This acts like a trustable record against which any digital artifact (documents, videos, or audios) can be verified, and original records are kept safe.

Factom uses SHA-256 hash, Bitcoin’s blockchain, and its own blockchain to achieve three things:

“Proof of Existence”
“Proof of Process”
“Proof of Audit”
And this is what makes it the world’s most trusted decentralized notary.

So far, Factom has secured over 126,485,400 records, which is a testimony to its practicality.

See our exclusive guide on Factom for more info.


5. Dash (Digital Cash)

Dash was created three years ago on 18 January 2014 by its developer Evan Duffield. Dash was originally released as “XCoin” (XCO). In February 2014, the name was changed to “Darkcoin”.  And on 25 March 2015, Darkcoin was rebranded as “Dash”.

Evan plans to make Dash easy to use as well as anonymous for privacy-centric users.

Dash aims to study the best practices of the fiat world and work backward in developing their products to be user-friendly for the people. So even though people are using the DASH crypto on the backend, they will have no problems interacting with it because of the familiar traditional banking UI.

Dash is a good investment because of the practical usages, features like InstantSend/PrivateSend, the strong foundation, and the remarkable work of their management team.

If you are not holding enough Dash in your portfolio, you should consider stocking up.

Our CEO, Harsh Agrawal, met the Dash director of finance, Ryan Taylor, at the Bitcoin Miami event. You can watch their discussion here.


6. Golem (Decentralized Supercomputers)

You can think of Golem as the Airbnb of computers.

It is the world’s first open-sourced and decentralized super-computer which is powered by its Ethereum-based, Golem cryptocurrency – GNT (Golem Network Tokens). GNT’s coin supply is fixed, which means as the project becomes more popular, the price of GNT will likely increase.

Golem’s “supercomputer” gets its power from both small personal laptops and giant data centers spread around the world. And as a user of Golem’s platform, you can run a website, do energy-intensive scientific calculations, run a long code, or do CGI rendering. You can even run miners using this computational resource and mine cryptocurrencies.

Golem supercomputers will run when the user pays GNT tokens. These tokens will be given to people who have rented out their extra computing power on the Golem network.

Golem has a long roadmap of around 4-5 years, which is pretty long in this fast-changing crypto world. But there is no exaggeration in saying that once the Golem platform is live, the GNT cryptocurrency will have tremendous value. See this article for their development roadmap.


7. Siacoin (Decentralized Cloud Storage)

If Golem is the Airbnb of computers, then Sia is the Airbnb of hard drives. They have a very viable use case and are trying to solve something that most of us everyday – cloud storage.

Sia allows its users to rent out their unused hard drive space, and hence, make money.

While Sia is a cloud storage platform like Google Drive, Dropbox, and Amazon Cloud, what sets Sia apart is that it is an open-source, blockchain-based, and decentralized cloud storage platform. In short, Sia is a decentralized cloud where data is stored on the blockchain.

Centralized storage services are prone to single points of failure and also the misuse of unencrypted data for higher business profits.

One other thing that makes this technology very practical is that it can be very cheap when compared to Google Drive, Dropbox, and Amazon Cloud.

But there are huge challenges in the way decentralized data will be stored, and Sia has a long development roadmap.

The long-term goal of Sia is to compete with the major cloud storage platforms. But in the blockchain space, Sia also has direct competitors like Storj and MaidSafe… but Sia claims to be better with encryption and decentralization.

The Sia developer’s community is confident that they are making a highly competent product, and they don’t believe in mass marketing campaigns for promotion.

Sia’s use case is definitely practical, and it’s a crypto worth watching in the future.


8. IOTA (Internet Of Things)

IOTA is another cryptocurrency which claims to be the next generation of cryptocurrency. IOTA aims to be the most widely used cryptocurrency in this ever-growing internet world.

IOTA has the potential to change the way we do payments because it offers completely free transactions which are not possible with other cryptocurrencies.

It is also the first cryptocurrency without a blockchain; instead, it uses something called Tangle technology.

Expect a slow adoption rate for IOTA because it will only grow as more and more people start using IOT things and smartphones/smart devices.


9. Ripple (Bank’s Cryptocurrency)

Ripple is like a cryptocurrency for banks.

Ripple is a payment protocol that allows banks to send real-time international payments to each other without the need for a central counterparty or clearance hub.

It is designed in a way that it complies with all the banks and central banking institutions. Ripple can be implemented on top of swift infrastructure which all the banks currently have.

Ripple (XRP) is solving the valid problem of international remittances.

During its initial days, I was quite skeptical regarding Ripple, but it is definitely trying to solve some of the pain points of international banking.

Expect a huge growth of XRP because banks are hungry to adapt to blockchain tech, and Ripple provides a ready-made, plug and play solution for their problems.

And it’s happening… they have already started doing real-time payments with the National Bank of Abu Dhabi.


10. Civic (Universal Digital Identity)

Civic is on a mission to create a digital identity for everyone in a decentralized manner. These identities will be compliant with various rules and regulations of the governments around the world (like a digital ID number).

Civic uses the blockchain to secure data. This data is stringently verified by Civic or identity verifying partners and then attested and anchored to the blockchain in the form of un-decryptable data. This data is only exchanged between the user and the requestor of that data by using Civic tokens (CVC).

This way, you need not give your data again and again to various entities. Civic makes it easy and truly frictionless for users and identity requestors to verify data and prevent identity theft because it is all stored on the blockchain.

Civic is implementing a practical use case for identity verification, and I believe this project will further prove itself to be a valuable crypto-coin in the very near future

Finally taking the Coinbase Pro Migration to Coinbase themselves.,GolemProject,og47pe,2021-07-08 06:07:01,19,0.91,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/GolemProject/comments/og47pe/finally_taking_the_coinbase_pro_migration_to/,PSVjasper99,Event,"Hi all,

As you have noticed, we have entered the 3rd quarter of 2021! And yet we can see that Coinbase Pro has not migrated to GLM, as a leading exchange. Promise after promise is being broken.

I think it is absurd that we still have to put up with so many messages of people either waiting, or having bought GNT and deposited it to an exchange where they can't access it, meaning the funds are lost.

I don't have the impression that there is a lot of pressure from either the team or Coinbase themselves to get this done as fast as possible. There is excuse after excuse. I get that it is ultimately up to them, but every GNT that is lost by this stupid behaviour is one too much, and I feel like we need to man up and stand for those in our community that have not been up-to-date with this migration.

Therefore I suggest we take matters into our own hands and start contacting them as a community. Since Coinbase Pro can't directly be contacted by phone, we can only really Tweet and e-mail to them. If you have a (verified) CBP account, feel free to start a ticket in the category depicted below. There is also an example message. The more the merrier. Let's make sure we are being heard.

>Dear Sir/Madam,

>I have been using your service for a while. It has come to my attention that you have not yet completed the migration of the old GNT token to GLM, as one of the largest exchanges in terms of  daily trading volume.  
>  
>In the Golem community, we get multiple messages per day of people who have bought GNT, and deposited it to an exchange where only GLM deposits are allowed. This results in many funds being lost. As Coinbase Pro, I'd presume you want to be at the forefront of these migrations to offer customers the best experience.  
>  
>You have acknowledged the migration almost three quarters of a year ago. As a member of the Golem community, I speak for all of us if I said that we where waiting for your migration to complete.

I understand that this might not be the most corporate approach but as long as we stay formal, they can have it."
Reasoning why I'm long on Golem (GLM),CryptoMoonShots,o3bguo,2021-06-19 04:33:47,7,0.89,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/o3bguo/reasoning_why_im_long_on_golem_glm/,PSVjasper99,ERC-20 Token,"When speaking of a decentralized super-computer, tons of people would instantly think of ICP and the downfall of that project. [Golem](https://www.golem.network/) is another project within that field and here are some quick facts regarding the coin:

\* ICO in 2016 ([details](https://icorating.com/ico/golem-gnt/))

\* Migration in late 2020 meaning a new token GLM

\* Only 50% of old tokens are migrated ([link](https://glm.golem.network/))

\* Only a $250,000,000 market cap (if all coins are migrated) ([link](https://coinmarketcap.com/en/currencies/golem-network-tokens/)) even though the team behind it has $380,000,000 worth of Ethereum ([wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7da82c7ab4771ff031b66538d2fb9b0b047f6cf9)) + kept 20% of all tokens from the ICO.

\* Golem Foundation with over half a billion in funds remaining looking to increase the value of GLM.

\* This means the Golem creators hold over a billion USD in ETH yet the market cap is only a quarter of that.

Here are some quick facts on what Golem provides:

\* CPU rendering through tasks and services (tasks being one computation once, services being hiring a computer for a longer period of time and giving tasks to it whenever for lower latency)

\* 626 providers at the time of writing totaling 10,233 cores, 17,16 TB RAM, & 127,64 TB storage ([stats](https://stats.golem.network/))

\* Quick-starts for requestors available ([here](https://handbook.golem.network/)) where you can get your first task running relatively quickly.

Here are some things that Golem is working on:

\* Internet access which could mean web hosts & hosting stuff like game servers.

\* GPU integration which could make it possible for GPU mining and GPU accelerated tasks making it truly a decentralized supercomputer.

\* Getting included in the [awesome-repo](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) which has 164,000 stars & 7,200 watching ([link](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/pull/2024)) to submission).

This could bring a lot of developers to the network.  TLDR:   cons: limited features ATM, few competitors (Akash, ICP, iExec)  pros: lovely features coming, active market cap at around $125M, developers have cash, it's an old project still active in the development of the network"

so I just found some GNT on an old poloniex account. The balance shows 0$ and when I try to withdraw the tokens, I'm getting 'You cannot withdraw, deposit, trade, or borrow this asset.'

I found this article but it does not look like the migration happened to my GNTs since my GLM balance is 0 tokens

[https://support.poloniex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057062814-The-Golem-Migration-to-ERC-20](https://support.poloniex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057062814-The-Golem-Migration-to-ERC-20)

any advise how to migrate my tokens? thanks!"

Market Irrationality and comparing Crypto valuations vs. Stock valuations,CryptoCurrency,n32pfv,2021-05-02 05:14:26,14,0.83,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n32pfv/market_irrationality_and_comparing_crypto/,PSVjasper99,COMEDY,"First off, let me start of by saying that nothing in this post is either financial advice, intended as shill or FUD. I am merely attempting to differentiate between the two.

# Stock vs. Crypto valuation

There is a large difference between the valuation of a currency and the stock of a company. Stocks of a company are valuated using a practically infinite amount of parameters such as:

1. Price-to-Book, considering the tangible and intangible assets compared to its market cap.
2. Free Cash Flow, the gross and net profit that is generated by the company by looking at revenue and expenses.
3. Price-to-Earnings, Debt-to-Equity, and more...

There are many more factors such as media influence, hype, infamous Trump Pumps the list goes on *obladi oblada*.

I often notice that discussion here is about the performance of a certain currency and their parent company, e.g. ""If \*they\* manage to grow the company to X members, it will do Y to the price."" There is a large difference between the two as you are buying into a currency, and not into a stock. A stock entitles the holder to a share of a company. This gives rise to completely different liabilities as opposed to currencies. Therefore, technically the term 'investing' in the common sense also does not apply here. Most of the parameters named above do **not apply** to most of the cryptocurrencies that are on the open market. Crypto market are often highly **irrational** which can really work to your advantage if you spot the opportunity, but also goes to show that it can be hit-or-miss as it can be hard to spot fundamentals.

# Example

One of my favourite examples are most of the earliest ICOs. A prime example is Golem. Golem used to be in the top 10 of market cap after ICO where they managed to collect 820.000 ETH in the ICO round. Let's do a simple calculation:

* Golem Factory (responsible for building the product) currently has 181,434 ETH in their [multisig wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7da82c7ab4771ff031b66538d2fb9b0b047f6cf9) . The ETH value is equal to 520.000.000 USD (at $2868 USD per ETH). They hold 50.000.000 GLM at 22.500.000 USD and 26.750.000 GNT at about 13.000.000 USD.
* Golem Foundation (originated from Factory, and is purely focused on increasing value of the GLM token) currently has 118.400 ETH in [their wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3d4530082c3eb60f58af03f79b1ed3f40e591cd1). The ETH value is equal to \~340.000.000 USD. They hold \~28.000.000 GNT at about 13.000.000 USD.
* This shows that approximately 520.000 ETH has been liquidated. Assuming this has been liquidated evenly from mid 2017 through to now at about 300 USD per ETH average, this means that a total of 156.000.000 USD has been retrieved from selling ICO funds.
* The team consists of approximately 40 members, lets assume they all get 100k USD per year. This means they have spent about 16.000.000 USD on the team salaries in the past 4 years. Let's upgrade it to 20.000.000 for the office spaces as well and massage chairs. This means there is about 136.000.000 in the bank excluding a lot of factors.
* Assume a worst case scenario that they spent a lot of budget on popping Dom Perignon during software launches, making expensive marketing, making expensive swag, company trips and talks and cut it to 100.000.000 left in the bank. Stupid assumption, but lets make it.
* Their total (monetary) assets would equal approximately ***1.02 billion USD.***
* Let's even assume they can't liquidate their ETH at this current price/volume. Even if they can linearly sell their ETH through a price drop of 20% against the dollar, it would still amount to roughly ***940 million USD.***

The market cap of all GLM tokens now is equal to approximately ***450 million USD***, leaving a deficit of ***490 million USD***. This example works for quite a few other projects that were one of the lucky ones to do an early ICO.

What can we take from this story? Hell, I don't know. But at least we can conclude that valuing a cryptocurrency based on company and stock valuations does not hold and that a different mindset is apparently needed as opposed to what still a lot of traditionals might think.

Enjoy the sunday!"
Forgotten Golem (GNT) withdrawal,jaxx,n2iamq,2021-05-01 09:25:29,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/jaxx/comments/n2iamq/forgotten_golem_gnt_withdrawal/,ale5ole,,Hi. I would like to make a withdrawal with some forgotten Golam i had in there many years now. The problem is that i don't have gas or Eth so i can't execute the transaction. I can't even exchange GNT for ETH in there for such a small amount. Any other solution?

"Sent some Golem (GNT) to an exchange, seems lost due to not realising Golem now GLM",GolemProject,mvzu36,2021-04-22 03:50:27,8,0.9,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/GolemProject/comments/mvzu36/sent_some_golem_gnt_to_an_exchange_seems_lost_due/,zij2000,,"Not sure if this it he right place to ask, but I have a problem that hopefully someone can help with.  I had some Golem (GNT) in a Coinomi wallet for 2-3 years and decided this week to transfer to an exchange (Poloneix) who do support Golem.  Did the transfer, it got stuck, and their support said that they don't support GNT, just GLM - and it looks like back in November I should have (but wasn't aware) migrated my GNT to GLM...  So my question is whether the Golem I sent to Poloneix is lost forever, or can I get it back in any way?  Poloneix are not helpful!"
"“You can’t lose, if you buy them all!” TOP50 coins by Market Cap, 4 years later.",CryptoCurrency,mv01k0,2021-04-20 16:49:09,1265,0.98,502,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mv01k0/you_cant_lose_if_you_buy_them_all_top50_coins_by/,GroundbreakingLack78,LEGACY,"Recently, I saw a quote from Pokémon here. A quote that can be applied to crypto as well. *“You can’t lose if you buy them all!”*, whether the guys are joking or they’re serious, let’s Iook at the numbers.

I managed to find a [snapshot from 04/23/2017](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20170423/) 4~ years ago to calculate the numbers and percentages, to see where we would be standing, if we invested lump sum of money (20$) into every coin from TOP 50. Is that Pokémon legacy working? Let’s take a look at the numbers.

**NOTE: The numbers that are being used, might not be 100% accurate. If you’re mobile user and you can’t see the %, just swipe on the chart. If you find any mistakes, just let me know and I will correct them :)**

From all of the top 50 coins, 12 are negative in red, or not existent anymore (one of them is still in our hearts, looking at you Carlos), while 38 are positive, up in green! The order of these coins is exactly the same as it was in 04/23/2017, based on their market cap. Some of these coins rebranded or renamed themselves. For example: Zcoin is now Firo. 

I know that hindsight is 20/20, but I found it quite awesome to see and share, how most of the coins are even after 4 years still in green with many Xs. In conclusion, if you tried to follow a *“You can’t lose, if you buy them all!”* or *“Gotta catch ‘em all!”* Pokémon legacy quote, you would be in green. The initial investment of 1000$, spread out at every coin from Top 50, by 20$ each would now be worth approximately ~29.200$

I am not trading a lot nor do I have big crypto funds. But I once bought 200 Golem because I liked the idea behind the project. So the value is something around 65$ or so...   


But I have to claim the new GLM token instead of the keeping the old GNT as the project changed their blockchain.   


Exodus offers me a nice and simple button to just claim the 200 GLM for a fee of 0.05 Ethereum which has a value of over a 100$ right now...   


Well that's not going to happen...   


Is there another way to swap the GNT to GLM without paying these ridiculous fees?

Coinbase holding my 50k GLM (10 ETH worth) hostage,ethfinance,mrbsji,2021-04-15 06:16:22,29,0.76,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/mrbsji/coinbase_holding_my_50k_glm_10_eth_worth_hostage/,water_is_blue,Exchange,"About two months ago I sent around 50k GLM deposit do Coinbase directly from Binance (yes, I know exchange -> exchange sending is not smart, but high gas and huge arb opportunity activated my reptile brain).

Coinbase, however, supports only the old version of the token, GNT, which is currently in process of migration to GLM (see [https://glm.golem.network/](https://glm.golem.network/)).

They claim there's nothing they can do to recover the funds since the GLM token is unsupported atm. Technically they're correct since the tokens correspond to two different ERC20 contracts, but it is kind of in the grey zone if you consider token as utility of the ecosystem and the fact that it has 1 to 1 conversion rate.

They obviously own the private key, so this just makes for bad customer experience.

    

Has anyone found themselves in a similar situation, any advice on how to proceed?

Thanks

"Why not ""migrate"" GNT to GLM by selling on Coinbase Pro and buying on Bittrex?",GolemProject,mns7w8,2021-04-09 18:26:40,7,1.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/GolemProject/comments/mns7w8/why_not_migrate_gnt_to_glm_by_selling_on_coinbase/,ProfessorDave3D,,"Big note, for posterity:

Apparently, Coinbase Pro really is right around the corner from being done with GNT, so if you google this post after April 2021, this information is probably out of date.

-

I'm reading many posts about doing some techy stuff to migrate GNT to GLM. (including having to work out expensive ETH / Gas fees)

But in the meantime, Coinbase Pro is trading GNT for about the same price as Bittrex is trading GLM.

So, why not just sell the GNT on Coinbase Pro, transfer the proceeds to Bittrex and buy GLM there?

Thanks for any help / clarification.

-

EDIT #1.

When I look at the GNT on my Ledger Nano (there since late 2017), it is shown as an ERC20 token called ""Golem (old)."" If I tell the Ledger Nano to send the GNT, it wants to send to an Ethereum address. [EDIT: When I wrote this, I thought my Ledger Nano was saying that GMT was an ERC 20token. Later, I learned that GNT is an Ethereum token, but not ERC20.]

However, when I go to Coinbase Pro and tell it to receive GNT, Coinbase Pro tells me:

""Only send Golem (GNT) to this address. Sending any other asset, including Ethereum (ETH), will result in permanent loss.""

Have I already done something wrong, possibly years ago, which has led to me owning the ""wrong"" kind of GNT?

-

EDIT #2.

I'm reading that Coinbase will automatically migrate GNT to GLM when they switch over:

https://old.reddit.com/r/GolemProject/comments/lgyisn/coinbase_migration/

So, it seems like one option is to send my GNT to Coinbase Pro and then do nothing for a while.

But, again, if it's that simple, why aren't other people doing it that way?

-

EDIT #3.

I didn't get specific answers to a couple questions I dropped in here, so I'll try to answer them myself now.

-

Q: Why not just sell the GNT on Coinbase Pro, transfer the proceeds to Bittrex and buy GLM there?

A: It might be treated as a taxable event? You'd end up spending money just transferring the tokens around, so it might not save you on the costs people are worried about? 

But I was happy to do all the work through official channels, rather than having to learn a single new interface.

-

Q: When I look at the GNT on my Ledger Nano (there since late 2017), it is shown as an ERC20 token called ""Golem (old)""...

Have I already done something wrong, possibly years ago, which has led to me owning the ""wrong"" kind of GNT?

A: TLDR: No, the stuff on my Ledger Nano is the one and only GNT -- the stuff still traded on Coinbase Pro.

(I think GNT was an Ethereum token, but not an ERC20 token, and that was the cause of my confusion as I worried that the GNT on my Ledger wouldn't transfer to Coinbase Pro. It did. I spent about $9 to transfer it.)

-

Q: If [an automatic Coinbase Pro migration] is that simple, why aren't other people doing it that way?

A: I don't know. I didn't do enough research to be sure it would work, but a couple previous threads seemed to indicate that it still would. (see URLs in the replies)

I love this community, especially during February-March when it felt much more discussion was being had. But I’ve been seeing a lot of weird and frankly scam-like tokens plaguing this subreddit. Elongate is literally begging for Elon’s attention. Safe moon is sponsored by some of the fakest people in the media (Jake Paul???). Not saying that either of those don’t have valid tokenomics but the shilling surrounding them is very uncomfortable. This subreddit is also overwhelmed by bots with copy and pasted references to obscure and obviously fake coins (especially daily discussion threads)


Here are some coins that have REAL potential and I KNOW I am being a shill right now and I KNOW that these coins aren’t perfect but I just wanted to clear the air from all these weird and some frankly fake projects.


These will be very brief descriptions to give you the opportunity to DYOR. I am not an expert on these and I’d love for commenters to go into more detail if they can.


(BEPRO): a protocol for building gambling platforms. Think of this as kind of like the Polkadot or Cosmos of gambling tokens/dApps. Not really smart contracts but it’s similar to SDK where they give the framework to build independently on. The best so far to attempt to do this and focus on this. (Available on KuCoin) (Market cap: $45 million)


(CHAIN) gaming: creating a network for hosting games and trading gaming related NFTs with $CHAIN hoping to be the currency used for exchange within that platform. Rumors of fortnite partnership have been circulating for a while with no confirmation.
(Available on Uniswap) (Market cap: $200 million)


SmartLands Token (SLT): Decentralizing real estate ownership. Staking to be released this month with staking rewards as percentage of real life transactions. This implies great staking rewards regardless of SLT value or the entire crypto market. Also being on the stellar network means negligible gas fees or transaction fees. Feel free to swap between SLT and XLM with practically no cost.
(Available on any Stellar (xlm) based DEX, I use StellarX) (Market cap: $71 million)


Circuits of Value (COVAL): hoping to create a vault where you can extract value from multiple crypto’s and NFTs at once for one major transaction. (Imagine having a bunch of ether and bitcoin and wanting to buy an expensive NFT. Instead of converting bitcoin to ether and paying gas fees, this will extract the value of both at once) (available on Uniswap) (Market cap: $33 million)



Here I’m going to list a few medium cap coins that should have a good April:


(PHA)la.network: privacy focused crypto running on Polkadot. Think Monero but with proof of stake. Available on KuCoin and binance. (market cap: $135 million)


(StormX) (hot right now): utility token with crypto back on purchases on major brands like adidas, Nike, Walmart and more. Download the app for more info. Buy on voyager or Uniswap. (market cap $650 million)


Golem (GNT): a storage based crypto that allows easy outsourcing of CPU usage. Kind of like a hybrid of Filecoin/Storj with Ocean.Protocol. (market cap: $640 million)

I know I can Invest in BTC and ETH through some Index funds but that’s at a premium and I don’t own any of the underlying assets.  I can do this via bitwise or grayscale index funds.  

However I have finally found a company with sensible fees that offers me a proper crypto IRA where I own the underlying assets and they are held with a company I trust (coinbase).  

There are a number of companies offering Crypto IRA with a large monthly or yearly fee, and the crypto is held with a company I have never heard of.  For me this is a concern as I don’t know if they will be around when I retire. 

Coinbase is one of the most trusted if not the most trusted company when it comes to crypto, so I know for sure my assets are in a good place. 

You are not limited to BTC or ETH you can buy and sell any assets coinbase supports which whilst doesn’t include a lot I would like to invest it’s a lot more than other companies offer. 

The this crypto IRA works is that the digital assets are owned by the IRA account (kept at Coinbase) and you are the custodian of the IRA.  You can trade crypto (buy /sell) yet take the tax advantages that an IRA gives you.   Whilst you can withdraw to USD it will be the same as a normal IRA withdrawals where taxes may apply, limitations apply. 

 http://www.altoira.com is the company they are US based and this is a proper Roth IRA not needing an LLC as some crypto IRA’s do.  There support is excellent friendly, responsive and helpful which is actually what I need from a company l am using for my retirement. 

In order to buy and sell crypto they use Coinbase’s API.  Any cash held in your account is also coinbase account. 

You do not get a login to coinbase all trades are done via http://www.altoira.com website. 

There are no account opening or setup fees. Alto charges a 1.5% trade fee, which includes all exchange fees, and a fee to have an account, which is $2-$25/month based on the size of the account, and caps out at $25/month for accounts that are over $30,000. The account fee covers insurance and cold storage, as well as the annual IRS reporting for the IRA.

I look at a crypto IRA as an addition to my other retirement accounts just taxed advantaged. 

Just remember crypto is a very volatile market and the above is not financial advice.

when the crypto currencies bubble started to go mainstream, I actually wanted to invest in one with real potential, so i bought GNT early 2017, I then bought more at 0.5 € to ride more heavily the GNT train to the moon, which made my average price so high.

Tthen recently I rebought at 0.05 € to lower my average price.

Now : I put a total of 5k € in golem, now it's valued 20k €, which is a nice amount of money, maybe could pay for terrace and pool, which is actually very nice.

Should I HODL until the real deal and golem goes as mainstream computing power utility and I become millionaire (not happening, let's be honest, it would need GLM at 16 €), which actually I've harder and harder time beleving in ?

Also noticed that Coinmarketcap replaced GNT with GLM (interesting... will the exchanges migrate their GNT soon?), but their Market Cap is also way off, since they take the amount of GNT in circulation for their value.

The Market Cap of GLM is about 104 million USD, not 202 million (Coingecko) or 66 million (Coinmarketcap) and if a Filecoin (FIL) can have a Market Cap of about 1 billion I hope for GLM to go x10 in 2021 some time after New Golem hits mainnet."
GOLEM CIRCULATING SUPPLY QUESTION,GolemProject,ks8f3m,2021-01-07 02:41:19,5,0.73,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/GolemProject/comments/ks8f3m/golem_circulating_supply_question/,nUmbaTrader,,"GOLEM (GLM) currently has a market cap of $238,534,100 and circulating supplied of 348,467,231 tokens according to Coinmarketcap and the like.  Spot price is 0.126 x GLM circulating supply (348,467,231) = $43,906,871, not $238,534,100.  I'm assuming this is an assessment based on GLM plus GNT tokens.  
Should there be GNT tokens that never migrate to GLM, will the market cap still be assessed on a combination of GNT and GLM or will a line be drawn?    


Say only 500,000,000 tokens are moved ever because 500,000,000 are lost for whatever reason, does that not mean the market cap of GLM is actually 500,000,000 x the market price?  GNT is not GLM no?"

Saw that they have ""Acknowledged"" this process through the Golem Migration Tracker, but it has not been started."
