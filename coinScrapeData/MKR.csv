Can Sky Protocol ($SKY) Lead the Next Evolution of DeFi?,altcoin,1i87660,2025-01-23 11:23:15,1,1.0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1i87660/can_sky_protocol_sky_lead_the_next_evolution_of/,Woodpecker5987,,"In August 2024, MakerDAO made a bold move by rebranding to Sky and introducing its upgraded tokens, $SKY and $USDS, replacing the familiar $MKR and $DAI. But what does this change really mean for the DeFi space? With $SKY now serving as the governance token for the decentralized Sky Protocol, the community takes full control, driving decisions and aligning token holders’ interests through rewards. Could this be a step toward a more participatory and resilient ecosystem?  
  
Today, the $SKY token was listed on Bitget, opening up new opportunities for users. With permissionless trading pools, the ability to earn more with the Sky Savings Rate, and SkyLink’s seamless connection between Ethereum and Base networks, is this the beginning of a more accessible and efficient way to engage with DeFi? The listing raises an important question, how far can Sky Protocol go in shaping the future of decentralized finance?

A look back at 2024 on r/MediaMergers....,MediaMergers,1hqq8e5,2024-12-31 18:02:06,24,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/MediaMergers/comments/1hqq8e5/a_look_back_at_2024_on_rmediamergers/,TheIngloriousBIG,,"Oh, what another spectacular year it's been for this sub, especially with an industry plagued with layoffs, twists and turns, Streamers trying to catch up to Netflix, two billion dollar movies from Hollywood's leading studio, and who can forget? An election after which a certain convicted a\*\*hole is set to return to the White House with a vengeance. That doesn't mean that M&A has continued to thrive, albeit mildly. So as 2024 draws to a much anticipated close, let's look back on some of the biggest M&A moments in media this year, and what's to come in the new year, shall we?

# Paramount and Skydance Media merge

Any media buff will probably know going into 2024 that the most vulnerable of the ""big five"" majors was inevitably gonna be Paramount Global, the cornerstone of the Redstone media empire, home to one of the oldest studios in Holywood, CBS, Star Trek, Spongebob, and a storied collection of cable TV brands, but had been trailing somewhat with their own streamer, Paramount+, which was so small Amazon and Apple had it as an add-on subscription.

To this end, as the year began, it was widely assumed that Warner Bros. Discovery would make their game-changing move with Paramount, but they pulled out of the running in February, citing numerous factors including a possible overlapping of Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network, from my own opinion and theories. As the year went on though? Well, enter Skydance Media, a production company with historic ties with the Paramount studio, ran by David Ellison, who is the son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and was apparently mentored behind the scenes by Paramount chairwoman Shari Redstone to one day take her place at the reins (hence why she stubbornly rejected other bids). On July 8, Skydance announced their intention to merge with the media giant, with the hopes of supercharging CBS, ramping up AI efforts on future productions, and giving Paramount an additional line of output in video games, among other ambitious expansions.

With this, Skydance Media has accomplished an unbelieveable feat for a production company on the brink of diversification. While it remains to be seen as to how Ellison's reigime will go, it's a bit unclear if Ellison will intend to pursue m&A deals for New Paramount and revamp Paramount+ big time, unless the new company continues to struggle.

# Lionsgate and Starz complete their split

For a while now, Lionsgate has been considered as being in a vulnerable state, especially given its leading mini-major status. After years of speculation and theories, as well as the infamous distraction that was buying core parts of Entertainment One off the equally struggling Hasbro, the long-anticipated split of Lionsgate created two new entities: Starz Entertainment and Lionsgate Studios.

On the film side of things following the split, things would get worse from there. *Borderlands*. *The Crow*. *Megalopolis*. What do those three movies have in common you ask? They were THREE tentpole movies within Lionsgate's 2024 movie slate, all of whom BOMBED and BOMBED hard. No good, no good at all for Hollywood's leading mini-major studio, especially after the eOne purchase added to the weight.

To me, both resulting companies will struggle going into the first year of their existence. Starz has no in-house IP, from what I've discovered, which is bound to make things more sour. Lionsgate Studios, though? If they continue to struggle, they're gonna be struggling like hell to exist as a mini-major for much longer, so buyers may wanna use this opportunity to rise up.

# NBCUniversal plans spinoff of cable networks

Let's be honest here: Comcast, the proud owner of NBCUniversal and Sky, has had a polarising place in the media industry in recent times. Aside from the second most powerful film studio and a thriving theme park portfolio, it's been more mixed on the TV and streaming front, especially on an international level. Just look at MOST of the cable networks of the company, which have basically been stripped of any original programming since the Peacock streaming service became a thing. This was, in fact, the main reason why Comcast shocked everyone when they announced they were spinning off networks like USA Network, Syfy, E!, Oxygen, CNBC, MSNBC and Golf Channel, as well as NBCU's stake in Fandango, into a standalone public company.

However, this has left me with more questions. What puzzles me here is the fact that Bravo has been miraculously spared - due to the fact its programming was somehow essential to Peacock. Another thing too, there needs to be answers as to the fate of NBCUniversal International Networks, which operates Universal TV in some countries. As it turns out, cable channels are more profitable internationally than in the US, which is irritating given changing viewing habits, and the fact that Disney has been axing channels outside of the US one-by-one as it rolled out Disney+ worldwide. Well, all we can do at the moment is speculate...

# Vivendi (sort of) splits and an independent Canal+ is born

It's amazing how Vivendi has become one of France's largest conglomerates... until the point you realise they spent the last decade, especially after feeding Universal Studios to NBC, they've has varying levels of triumph, depending on the specific asset in its portfolio. The writing was on the wall back in 2016 after it failed to buy Ubisoft from the Guilermots after divesting whatever stake it owned in Activision Blizzard three years prior. And of course, who can ever forget when it foresaked its decades-long ownership of Universal Music as that company would begin a process that culminated in it hitting it big on the stock exchange?

These divestures all culminated in a lengthy process which came to a head when Vivendi announced its intention to split into multiple standalone companies: Canal+, Havas, and Louis Hachette Group, in addition to a heavilly reduced Vivendi, which would focus on investments. This move was clearly inevitable, especially considering Canal+'s recent acquisition spree, and StudioCanal's own growth as a European studio. Now with its place on the stock exchange, we can expect Canal+, as a brand, to get more global recognition it deserves.

# DirecTV acquires Dish Network (AND FAILS SPECTACULARLY)

Ever since streaming became a thing, linear TV has been a hard thing to come by. Dish Network, one of the leading satellite TV providers in America and owners of Sling TV and the Blockbuster brand, learned this the hard way when AT&T defector DirecTV offered to acquire Dish from its parent company Echostar, a deal that was ditched a month later after shareholders from the latter apparently opposed it.

That M&A fail just shows how unrealistic some view mergers, and how customers would react if the worst ever happened. To be fair, linear TV providers are gonna be having a tough time navigating declining users as they embrace cord-cutting. I do remember when I theorised a scenario in which Liberty Global acquired DirecTV instead and brought it under the Virgin Media name, which would have been a tad bit more realistic than what they attempted. DirecTV must have thought that private equity firms like their owner TPG believe that money grows on trees....

# Embracer Group splits into three

In recent gaming history, there have been very few shocking rises and falls than that of Embracer. Once, it went from saving THQ from the brink, and seemed like an unstoppable M&A force, and then... an cash injection from the Saudi Arabian PIF's gaming unit, Savvy Media Group dramatically collapsed, which spelled dangerous repercussions.

In order to save themselves, the once-promising gaming behemoth rapidly descended into crisis mode, as CEO Lars Wingefors scrambled to save money, and in doing so, scrapped games, closed down studios (including Volition, makers of Saint's Row), and even sold off a few assets, including Saber Interactive.

Which brings us to the outcome of months of chaos. So the three companies resulting from this yet-to-be-completed split are...

* Asmodee Group (board games)
* ""Coffee Stain & Friends"" (name not final; AA games and indie games)
* ""Middle-Earth Enterprises & Friends"" (name not final; AAA games and major IP)

In all honesty, I can see those three new companies as sale targets, for example, Hasbro could buy Asmodee, while it should be noted that Amazon has voiced their interest in buying Embracer, or what remains of it.

# Sony acquires Alamo Drafthouse Cinema

Anyone remember the 1948 Paramount Case? That's right, the fallout from this infamous lawsuit forbade major studios from owning movie theatre chains, especially Paramount, which owned the United Paramount Theatres chain. Well, apparently in 2020, the government abolished the Paramount Decree that banned studios from owning theatres, giving hope that conglomerates can one day buy movie theatre chains. Sony was the first studio to put themselves forward and give that freedom a test run, when they bought the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema chain in June. This may give us some renewed hope that Amazon could do the same if they wanted to.

# Fremantle acquires Asacha Media Group

Let's face it, one overlooked arena in media in recent years is the ream of ""super-indies"" non-studio-owned television production studios with portfolios of scripted and unscripted content up their roof. Banijay has undoubtedly been the unexpected driving force of breakneck M&A, but then there's Fremantle, the RTL Group-owned global TV studio, which has been on a rough acquisition spree in its own right. The biggest target it's landed so far, this little France-based studio with additional labels in the UK called Asacha Media Group. Controversially though, Fremantle chose to continue operating Asacha as a satellite company within itself with very little integration. But, that could very soon change.

# Mediawan acquires Leonine Studios

Speaking of ""super-indies"", another one that has gained some recognition globally is another French studio Mediawan, which has amassed a good chunk of TV labels across Europe, and that's not to mention light broadcasting businesses in its native France. Their biggest move so far came this past April, however, when they acquired German mini-major distributor Leonine Studios, which stems from fellow KKR-backed company Leonine Holding (the successor of Universum Film GmbH and Tele Munchen Gruppe). To better understand their synergies, one must learn that they had a JV once known as ""Mediawan & Leonine Studios"".

# Looking ahead...

As 2024 draws to an inevitable close, let's see what the new year has in store for us. I have been informed that nothing much will happen, but in media, it should go without saying, but nothing is predictable, and with that moron returning to the white house, the regulatory atmosphere will probably be less strict - unlike Democrat administrations, which is good news for anybody. Here's what could possibly happen this coming year in the world of media...

* The Paramount-Skydance merger closes, and speculation mounts on what happens next, and whether or not they pursue M&A deals
* NBCU finally spins off most of its cable assets, while Comcast contemplates rolling out Peacock in other territories
* The fate of Warner Bros. Discovery wrests on the shoulders of how James Gunn's Superman performs financially and critically
* Sony continues to search obsessively for more IP
* Media giants seek more M&A freedom from the greedy cult that is the second Trump adminstration
* Disney contemplates shutting down Hulu as a standalone service and moving its content to Disney+.

Looking back at how we've grown as a subreddit, and as one family of users with a common interest at heart, I'd say it's been a swift year of change for the Future of Media Network as a whole. We had to say goodbye to r/AlternateMediaHistory due to a severe lack of moderation, but we've proudly (mostly) reinstated alternate-reality M&A on this sub. And looking back at the September 28 incident which affected several FOM discord users like me, it's clear we need to learn lessons from this and stay safe online so our values are not quashed by the minds of delusional hackers. For the scenario side of things, it's been a wild ride, especially when speculating about Paramount's destiny.

So before we sign off, I'd like to, once more, say a huge thank you to many of the users, along with some new and worthy faces, who have helped this community grow for another year, admins and normal redditors alike. If I've left your name out and made any positive contributions to this sub and the wider future of media network over the past year, I apologise in advance now, but let's take a moment to salute the following users who have given the utmost support to our growing network...

Dai: The Stablecoin Revolutionizing Decentralized Finance,TradingElite,1hlb7wd,2024-12-24 05:53:07,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingElite/comments/1hlb7wd/dai_the_stablecoin_revolutionizing_decentralized/,Maylights,,"Dai (DAI) is a unique cryptocurrency that has carved a niche for itself in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, Dai is a stablecoin—its value is pegged to the US dollar, offering stability in the often volatile crypto market. Created by the MakerDAO protocol on the Ethereum blockchain, Dai has become a cornerstone of DeFi, enabling a wide range of financial activities without the need for intermediaries.

**How Dai Works**

Dai is issued and managed by the MakerDAO protocol, a decentralized autonomous organization that operates through smart contracts. Here’s how it functions:

1. Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs):To generate Dai, users deposit Ethereum or other accepted cryptocurrencies as collateral into a Maker Vault. This collateral must exceed the value of the Dai being generated, ensuring the system remains over-collateralized and secure.
2. Stability Mechanisms:Dai maintains its 1:1 peg to the US dollar through a combination of economic incentives and smart contract algorithms. If the price of the collateral drops, users must add more collateral or face liquidation to maintain the system’s balance.
3. Decentralized Governance:MakerDAO token holders (MKR) govern the protocol, voting on important issues like collateral types, stability fees, and risk parameters.

**Key Features of Dai**

1. Decentralization:Unlike centralized stablecoins like USDT or USDC, Dai is completely decentralized, with no single entity controlling its issuance or management.
2. Transparency:All transactions and collateral levels are visible on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring trust and accountability.
3. Flexibility:Dai can be used in a variety of DeFi applications, including lending, borrowing, and trading, making it a versatile tool for crypto enthusiasts.

**Practical Applications**

1. DeFi Lending and Borrowing:Dai is a popular asset on DeFi platforms like Aave and Compound, where users can lend it to earn interest or borrow against it to leverage investments.
2. Hedging Against Volatility:Traders and investors use Dai as a safe haven during periods of market turbulence, converting volatile cryptocurrencies into stable assets.
3. Global Transactions:With its stable value and decentralized nature, Dai is an efficient tool for cross-border payments, particularly in regions with unstable fiat currencies.

**Challenges and Opportunities**

While Dai offers numerous advantages, it is not without challenges:

1. Dependence on Collateral Prices:The value of Dai relies on the stability of the collateral backing it. Significant drops in crypto prices could strain the system.
2. Complexity:The process of generating and managing Dai through Maker Vaults can be complex for newcomers to the crypto space.
3. Scalability:As Dai’s adoption grows, scalability will be a critical factor in maintaining its efficiency and stability.

Despite these hurdles, Dai’s potential in the global financial system is immense. Its decentralized and transparent nature positions it as a powerful alternative to traditional stablecoins and fiat currencies.

**Final Thoughts**

Dai represents a significant leap forward in the world of decentralized finance, providing a stable and versatile digital asset for a wide range of use cases. Its innovative model of over-collateralization and decentralized governance has set a new standard for stablecoins.

For those looking to analyze market trends or explore trading opportunities with Dai, platforms like [TradingView Premium Free](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingViewFree/comments/1hobjs6/tradingview_premium_ultimate_package_update/) offer invaluable tools. By combining Dai’s unique features with robust analytical platforms, traders and investors can navigate the DeFi landscape with confidence. Whether you're a seasoned crypto user or a newcomer, Dai is a compelling asset that continues to shape the future of digital finance."

why no one talks about this coin? when this coin is third most expensive coin on the all time list below btc and eth and has the lowest circulating supply, which means this coin might have a chance of pump because less supply and even average or low amount of buyers and this coin can go up 10-20% in any scenario

is this coin underrated? will it boom and pump in future? is it worth buying?

i've been in crypto since 6 months but havent seen any youtube video or reddit post about this particular coin and cryptocurrency, why is it so, does anybody know anything about this coin?"

What is an utility token?,CapitalistExploits,1h4ugpk,2024-12-02 08:02:37,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1h4ugpk/what_is_an_utility_token/,kayakero,,"The tokenization of assets is rapidly changing the reality of the investment world. And, in the midst of this new reality, questions arise about what each type of asset is.

In this article we delve into utility tokens: what are they and how do they work?

# What are utility tokens?

Utility tokens are a form of digital asset that represents future access to a product or service provided by a specific blockchain network. Utility tokens are therefore nothing more than a specialized way of representing digital assets, which allow access to a variety of products and services within a blockchain.

Unlike other digital assets such as a security token or a stablecoin, whose value can be backed by physical assets or fiat currency, respectively, utility tokens do not have a direct backing and their value is intrinsically linked to the utility they offer within the blockchain network or platform for which they were created.

Typically, these tokens operate in parallel with the blockchain's native currency. For example, on the Ethereum network, the native currency is ETH or Ether, while utility tokens such as DAI or MKR (part of the MakerDAO ecosystem) offer access to exclusive products and services within that network.

# How do utility tokens work?

Utility tokens operate within a specific digital ecosystem, where they can be used to access exclusive services, products, or features within that platform. For example, a utility token can allow access to premium features of an application, the acquisition of goods or services within a digital marketplace, or even participation in the governance of a decentralized network.

The value of a utility token is determined by the demand and supply within its ecosystem, as well as the perceived utility it provides to users. As adoption and usage of the platform increases, the value of the utility token can increase, providing growth opportunities for investors who are betting on a specific blockchain ecosystem.

With the increasing adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, utility tokens are going to play a very important role in the future of finance and technology.

# Types of utility tokens

Although there is no clear categorization by use, utility tokens could be classified into several types depending on their function and utility within the platforms or networks for which they were created. Here are some common types of utility tokens:

* **Access or membership tokens:** These tokens grant users access to premium features, exclusive services, or special content within a platform or network. For example, they may provide access to advanced features in an app, exclusive content on a digital media platform, or membership in an online community.
* **Operational utility tokens:** These tokens are used as a medium of exchange within a network or platform to pay for goods, services, or transactions. For example, they can be used to pay transaction fees (such as Ether, the currency within the Ethereum ecosystem), data storage costs, or cloud computing services.
* **Governance Tokens:** These tokens give holders the right to participate in the decision-making and governance process of a decentralized network or a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Holders of these tokens can vote on proposals for changes to the protocol, elections of administrators, or important decisions related to the direction of the project. These tokens are already considered a separate category, since although they are utility-granting tokens, their utility is 
* **Utility-specific tokens:** These tokens have a specific utility within a particular context, such as tokens that represent access rights to digital resources such as storage, bandwidth, or computing power. For example, they can be used to access distributed storage services, distributed computing, or decentralized network services.
* **Incentive Tokens:** These tokens are used to incentivize and reward certain behaviors or contributions within a platform or network. For example, they can be used to reward users for participating in activities such as content creation, transaction validation, or contributing to the growth and development of the network.

# Advantages of investing in utility tokens

Including utility tokens in an investment portfolio can offer a number of benefits. Here are some of them:

* **Diversification:** Utility tokens can provide exposure to emerging sectors and technologies within the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, helping to diversify portfolio risk.
* **Growth potential:** By investing in promising projects backed by utility tokens, investors can benefit from the growth potential of new technologies and innovative business models.
* **Access to exclusive opportunities:** By owning utility tokens, investors can access exclusive features or participate in special events within the platforms or networks they are involved in.

# Risks of utility tokens

However, while utility tokens can be a valuable tool for financing projects in development, their use entails certain significant risks, mainly linked to the fact that they are digital assets created by and for a specific project.

In fact, in 2017, during the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) boom, these utility tokens reached their peak of popularity, as part of the investment in blockchain projects. The main problem is that many cryptocurrency projects promised unrealistic goals, added to the fact that these utility tokens operated in an unregulated space (something that is slowly changing, for example with regulations such as MiCA).

This lack of oversight resulted in lost investments for many stakeholders and utility token holders, especially when projects failed to meet their funding goals or failed to offer real utility.

It should be noted that utility tokens, outside of a blockchain project, have no value. The value lies in the value of the project itself and the network economies it generates.

Each type of utility token serves a specific function within its digital ecosystem and can offer different participation and investment opportunities for users and investors, as they can be exchanged within a specific blockchain network.

It is therefore important to understand the nature and utility of each type of token when considering its potential as part of a specific digital asset investment strategy. 

**Some examples of utility tokens are:**

* **Filecoin or Sia**: They allow their holders to digitally store their data on remote computers 
* **Golem**: Allows you to rent computing power 
* **MANA**: It is the native token of Decentraland, an important metaverse 
* **SAND and AXIE**: Used for transactions and interactions in the web3 gaming ecosystem 
* **Cronos (CRO)**: It is a cryptocurrency that can be used for payments, trading and blockchains.

[Blockchain technology](https://blog.netcoins.com/what-is-a-blockchain-a-comprehensive-guide-for-beginners/) has redefined how we think about transactions, ownership, and trust. [Bitcoin](https://blog.netcoins.com/what-is-bitcoin-a-comprehensive-guide/) introduced the world to digital money, but it wasn’t long before Ethereum took that innovation to new heights by enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications. Today, Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and the backbone of countless blockchain-based applications. Whether you’re new to crypto or looking to deepen your understanding, this comprehensive guide to Ethereum will break down everything you need to know about this revolutionary innovation.

# The Basics of Ethereum

# What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is an open-source, decentralized blockchain platform that allows developers to create and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily designed as a digital currency and store of value, Ethereum is a programmable blockchain with broader applications.

Launched in 2015 by a group of developers led by [Vitalik Buterin](https://vitalik.eth.limo/categories/general.html), Ethereum’s primary objective was to go beyond simple digital payments. By introducing a platform that enables complex applications, Ethereum paved the way for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other innovations in the blockchain space.

# Who Created Ethereum?

https://preview.redd.it/eyhsvinuo03e1.png?width=514&format=png&auto=webp&s=be6355f150b898031d8f52ac0873fdc1d1fb1818

Ethereum was founded by Vitalik Buterin, a programmer and crypto enthusiast who was actively involved in the Bitcoin community. Vitalik’s vision for a more flexible and programmable blockchain led to the conceptualization of Ethereum. He collaborated with several other co-founders, including Gavin Wood, who created Ethereum’s programming language Solidity, and Joseph Lubin, who later founded ConsenSys, a major Ethereum development firm.

The Ethereum whitepaper, published by Buterin in 2013, outlined the concept of a blockchain capable of running decentralized applications and executing smart contracts. After a successful crowdsale in 2014, Ethereum officially launched on July 30, 2015.

# The Difference Between Ethereum and Bitcoin

# Bitcoin vs. Ethereum: Purpose

Bitcoin and Ethereum often get compared due to their market positions, but they serve distinct purposes. Bitcoin is primarily designed as a digital store of value—often referred to as “digital gold.” Its main objective is to provide a decentralized alternative to traditional currencies, focusing on security and immutability.

On the other hand, Ethereum was designed to be a world computer. It provides a decentralized platform for running code and applications, allowing developers to build a wide range of decentralized applications, from financial services to digital art marketplaces.

# Technological Differences

The key technological difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum lies in their scripting abilities. Bitcoin’s scripting language is deliberately limited, focusing on maintaining a secure and immutable record of transactions. Ethereum, however, uses a Turing-complete language that enables developers to create complex smart contracts capable of automating tasks and managing assets programmatically.

# Market Position and Utility

Bitcoin’s utility lies in its role as a digital currency and store of value. It’s widely accepted and held by individuals, institutions, and governments. Ethereum, on the other hand, functions as a platform for the entire decentralized ecosystem, hosting applications that range from DeFi protocols to NFTs. While Bitcoin’s value is tied to its role in financial transactions and as a hedge against inflation, Ethereum’s value is linked to the utility of its blockchain and the applications running on it.

# How Does Ethereum Work?

# The Ethereum Blockchain

The Ethereum blockchain functions as a global, decentralized platform for executing smart contracts and running decentralized applications (DApps). Like Bitcoin, Ethereum operates on a distributed ledger technology, where a network of nodes collectively maintains and validates a record of all transactions. However, Ethereum’s blockchain goes beyond simple peer-to-peer currency transfers, introducing a programmable layer that allows for a wide range of applications to be built on top of it.

At its core, Ethereum is a decentralized network that follows the same basic principles as Bitcoin, ensuring that no central authority controls the data or network operations. Each node stores a copy of the entire Ethereum blockchain, which contains all historical transaction data and smart contracts. When a transaction or smart contract is executed, nodes work together to validate the transaction and reach a consensus on its state, updating the blockchain accordingly.

Ethereum’s block time, the period it takes to create a new block, is typically around 12 to 15 seconds, compared to Bitcoin’s 10-minute block time. This faster block creation rate allows Ethereum to process more transactions per second, although it still faces limitations regarding scalability, which are being addressed with Ethereum 2.0 upgrades and Layer 2 solutions.

# Smart Contracts Explained

https://preview.redd.it/wegemctwo03e1.png?width=518&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6a7e776cdccd7d9790e51393e5b3d83008b84a8

One of Ethereum’s most revolutionary features is its support for smart contracts. A smart contract is essentially a self-executing code that enforces an agreement or set of rules without needing intermediaries. These contracts are written in Solidity, Ethereum’s native programming language, which is Turing-complete, meaning it can perform a wide variety of computations.

Smart contracts are stored on the blockchain, making them tamper-proof and transparent. Once deployed, they automatically execute the conditions written in their code. For instance, a simple smart contract could facilitate an escrow service, where funds are automatically released to a seller once the buyer confirms receipt of goods. The potential applications are nearly limitless, from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that allow users to borrow and lend cryptocurrencies to complex supply chain tracking systems.

The execution of smart contracts is validated by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which runs the code on every node in the network. This ensures that smart contracts produce the same result regardless of which node executes them, establishing a universal standard for DApps.

# Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the heart of the Ethereum network. It acts as a runtime environment for executing smart contracts and deploying decentralized applications. The EVM is Turing-complete, which means it can handle complex instructions and perform nearly any computation that a traditional computer can execute.

What makes the EVM particularly significant is its universality. Developers can write smart contracts and DApps in various programming languages, including Solidity, Vyper, and others, and the EVM will execute them consistently across all Ethereum nodes. This consistent execution is crucial for ensuring the integrity and reliability of decentralized applications on the Ethereum network.

The EVM also plays a key role in calculating gas fees, as it determines the computational resources needed to execute transactions and smart contracts. This standardization of execution and fees enables developers to create diverse applications on a secure and scalable platform.

# Gas and Fees

Every transaction or smart contract executed on Ethereum requires computational power, which is quantified in units of gas. Gas is the fuel that drives the Ethereum network, enabling it to execute transactions and run DApps. When a user initiates a transaction or deploys a smart contract, they must pay a gas fee in Ether (ETH), which incentivizes miners or validators to include their transaction in a block.

The amount of gas required for a transaction depends on its complexity. Simple transactions, such as transferring Ether between wallets, require minimal gas. In contrast, more complex operations like executing a DeFi trade or deploying an NFT contract consume significantly more gas. Users can also set their gas prices, with higher gas prices offering faster transaction confirmations during periods of high network congestion.

Gas fees have been a significant challenge for Ethereum, especially during periods of high demand. When the network experiences congestion, gas prices can skyrocket, leading to prohibitively expensive transactions. To address these issues, Ethereum developers have introduced various scaling solutions and upgrades, such as Ethereum 2.0 and Layer 2 technologies such as [arbitrum](https://www.netcoins.com/how-to-buy/arb/).

# Ether (ETH) as Ethereum’s Native Cryptocurrency

# What is Ether?

Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, serving as the lifeblood of the entire ecosystem. While many people think of Bitcoin when they hear the term “cryptocurrency,” Ether plays a fundamentally different role. It’s not just a digital currency, but the fuel that powers the execution of smart contracts and transactions within the Ethereum network.

Ether’s importance goes beyond its monetary value. It’s required to perform any action on the Ethereum blockchain, from deploying a new smart contract to sending a simple transaction. This makes Ether essential for all activities that occur on the Ethereum blockchain, earning it the title of “gas” within the network’s ecosystem.

**How Ether is Used?**

Ether has multiple use cases within the Ethereum network, and each of them contributes to the overall utility of the cryptocurrency:

* **Paying for Gas Fees**: Every interaction with the Ethereum blockchain requires computing resources, which are paid for in Ether. This includes deploying smart contracts, executing functions within a contract, transferring tokens, and more. The cost of these computational tasks is denominated in gas, which users pay for using Ether. The gas system helps prioritize and allocate resources within the Ethereum network, incentivizing miners to process transactions based on the amount of gas fees offered.

* **Staking**: With the transition to Ethereum 2.0, [ETH holders can stake their tokens](https://blog.netcoins.com/how-to-stake-ethereum-in-canada-a-comprehensive-guide-to-eth-staking-rewards/) to participate in the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. By staking Ether, users help secure the network and, in return, [earn staking rewards](https://www.netcoins.com/staking/). This passive income opportunity has encouraged many investors to lock up their ETH, reducing the circulating supply and further increasing demand.



* **Collateral and Lending**: In the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), Ether is often used as collateral for loans and financial instruments. For instance, platforms like [MakerDAO](https://www.netcoins.com/how-to-buy/mkr/) allow users to lock up their ETH to mint [stablecoins](https://blog.netcoins.com/what-are-stablecoins/) like DAI. Additionally, lending protocols such as [Aave](https://blog.netcoins.com/how-aave-is-leading-the-way/) offer users the ability to earn interest on their ETH holdings.



* **Medium of Exchange and Digital Currency**: Beyond its role within the Ethereum ecosystem, Ether also functions as a digital currency. It’s used for payments and transactions between individuals and businesses, similar to Bitcoin. ETH’s liquidity and market capitalization have made it one of the most widely accepted cryptocurrencies across exchanges and payment platforms.

**Market Position of ETH**

Ether’s market position as the second-largest cryptocurrency, next to Bitcoin, is no accident. Its intrinsic utility, combined with Ethereum’s widespread adoption, has solidified ETH’s role as a cornerstone of the crypto economy. With the rise of DeFi, NFTs, and staking, demand for Ether continues to grow.

The broader crypto market often correlates with the performance of Ether, highlighting its influence. Investors view ETH as not only a store of value but also a means of gaining exposure to the booming Ethereum ecosystem. Additionally, major financial institutions and corporations are beginning to recognize Ether’s potential, leading to increased institutional interest and investment.

**Ethereum 2.0 and the Transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**

**The Move from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake**

Ethereum initially operated on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which required miners to solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and secure the network. While effective, PoW came with several downsides, including high energy consumption, scalability issues, and the centralization of mining power.

[The transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with Ethereum 2.0](https://blog.netcoins.com/ethereums-dencun-update-a-deeper-dive-into-decentralized-finance-and-ethereum-2-0/) marks a significant upgrade to the network’s consensus mechanism. Under PoS, validators replace miners, and instead of solving puzzles, they secure the network by staking their Ether. Validators are chosen to create new blocks and confirm transactions based on the amount of ETH they have staked, making the process more energy-efficient and decentralized.

# Key Improvements in Ethereum 2.0

https://preview.redd.it/kaok8j22p03e1.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=f48526e14102719264899e1af317656c13fbbe80

The move to Ethereum 2.0 is expected to bring a host of improvements to the network, addressing the limitations of the original Ethereum blockchain:

* **Energy Efficiency**: One of the most significant benefits of PoS is its drastically reduced energy consumption compared to PoW. PoW requires massive amounts of computational power, leading to high electricity usage and environmental concerns. By transitioning to PoS, Ethereum aims to become a more sustainable blockchain.

* **Scalability**: Ethereum 2.0 introduces sharding, a technique that splits the network into smaller chains called shards. Each shard can process transactions and smart contracts independently, increasing the overall throughput of the Ethereum blockchain. Sharding aims to allow Ethereum to handle thousands of transactions per second, alleviating congestion and reducing gas fees.

* **Security Enhancements**: PoS brings additional security benefits by increasing the cost of attacking the network. In PoS, validators must put their ETH at stake, and if they behave maliciously, they risk losing their staked funds. This economic incentive discourages malicious activity and enhances the overall security of the blockchain.

**The Roadmap and Challenges**

With the successful implementation of “The Merge” and the rollout of sharding, Combined with the growing adoption of Layer 2 solutions like rollups, Ethereum’s scalability has significantly increased. Looking ahead, the next focus areas include refining stateless clients to lower hardware requirements for node operators and enhance decentralization. Additionally, the Ethereum community is exploring protocol-level upgrades to strengthen censorship resistance and improve network security. These advancements aim to solidify Ethereum’s infrastructure and expand its capacity to support even more decentralized applications and innovations.

# Decentralized Applications (DApps) and Ethereum’s Ecosystem

# What are DApps?

https://preview.redd.it/sx58jeq3p03e1.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=49790c274aa80a7a35512ec07d9fc631451645fa

Decentralized applications, or DApps, are applications that run on a blockchain network rather than a centralized server. They are built using smart contracts, which allow them to operate autonomously and securely without relying on a single point of control. This makes DApps resistant to censorship and tampering, as they are deployed on a decentralized network.

DApps can serve a wide range of purposes, from financial services and gaming to supply chain management and social media. They are typically open-source, meaning anyone can inspect their code and verify their functionality. This transparency fosters trust between developers and users, enhancing the integrity of the applications.

**Notable DApps on Ethereum**

Axie Infinity allows players to collect and breed digital creatures called Axies, which can be used in battles and sold as NFTs. Decentraland, on the other hand, offers a virtual reality world where users can buy land, create experiences, and monetize their creations using Ethereum’s blockchain.

**The Role of DeFi in Ethereum’s Rise**

Decentralized finance, or DeFi, has been one of the driving forces behind Ethereum’s growth. DeFi refers to a set of financial services built on blockchain technology that allows users to interact directly with protocols and smart contracts, bypassing traditional financial intermediaries. The transparency and efficiency of DeFi have attracted billions of dollars in liquidity, with Ethereum serving as the primary platform for most DeFi applications.

The rise of DeFi has demonstrated the power of Ethereum’s programmable blockchain, showcasing its potential to disrupt traditional banking and financial services. DeFi protocols offer users a wide range of financial services, including lending, borrowing, trading, and yield farming. These platforms provide individuals with greater control over their assets and enable them to earn passive income through interest and rewards.

# Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Ethereum’s Role in the Digital Art Revolution

# What are NFTs?

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets that are stored on a blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies like ETH, NFTs cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis because each token is unique. NFTs have gained popularity for their role in representing digital art, music, collectibles, and more.

# Why NFTs Flourished on Ethereum

Ethereum’s ERC-721 standard enabled the creation and exchange of NFTs, paving the way for a digital art revolution. The transparency, immutability, and decentralized nature of Ethereum make it the ideal platform for verifying ownership of digital assets.

1. Surplus auction, burns pMKR, gets pDAI

2. Collateral auction, burns pDAI, gets collaterals, e.g. pWBTC.

3. Debt auction, burns pDAI, ​gets pMKR.

But I believe these auctions have not been actively working since Pulsechain launched. Why?

If these auctions are working, pDAI should be pegging to 1 USD."

**Takeaways**

* **Fueled by positive market sentiment, the price of bitcoin exceeded $73,100, just shy of its all-time high:** The Fed’s decision on rate cuts could further fuel a price increase, but bitcoin pulled back Thursday toward $70,000 amid a broader tech sell-off.
* **US spot bitcoin ETFs recorded $870 million in inflows on Tuesday, led by BlackRock’s IBIT with $629 million:** It’s believed that bitcoin’s swelling price might be contributing to investment in these funds.
* **Florida CFO Jimmy Patronis has requested an evaluation of the feasibility of adding bitcoin to the state’s public pension funds:** The state of Florida has typically shown keen interest in crypto initiatives, with Governor DeSantis having made proposals to allow businesses to pay tax in bitcoin in 2022.
* **Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. (HKEX) will launch the “HKEX Virtual Asset Index Series” on November 15, providing reference prices for BTC and ETH during the Asian trading day:** The indexes aim to offer transparency and support for virtual asset investment decisions in the region.
* **Weekly sales of NBA Top Shot NFTs have hit a six-month peak, with 43,600 NFTs sold as of October 27, marking a 94% jump from the previous week:** Renewed excitement from the season opener is driving the surge in activity after a slow offseason.

Among these, RWA appears to hold the most potential, as tokenization is one of the core uses of blockchain technology, originally designed to solve the double-spending problem and enable the online transfer and trading of value.

Currently, the total TVL (Total Value Locked) of [RWA crypto projects](https://botsfolio.com/crypto-portfolios/RWA) stands at approximately $6 billion, up from just $140 million in 2022. However, the market performance of RWA tokens has not matched that of Bitcoin.

Each quarter, Grayscale's research team analyzes hundreds of cryptocurrencies and updates their list of tokens primed for growth.

In their latest top 20 cryptocurrencies, Grayscale included tokens they believe have ""significant potential in the upcoming quarter."" By the end of Q3, six new cryptocurrencies were added to the list of top-performing assets.

""We analyze factors such as network growth and adoption, potential catalysts, the stability of fundamentals, token valuation, supply inflation, and potential risks,"" Grayscale explained.

The newcomers include:

* **SUI**: The native token of the Sui blockchain. After a network upgrade, Sui’s transaction speed increased by 80%, surpassing even Solana's capabilities.
* **Bittensor**: This protocol simplifies the integration of AI and digital assets. In the past month, TAO's price surged by nearly 70%. According to experts, the project has become one of the standout players in the AI sector.
* **Optimism**: A Layer 2 solution on Ethereum, featuring the Superchain framework. Optimism’s development is already being used in Coinbase's L2 Base network.
* **Helium**: A leader in the decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) sector. The project now boasts over a million hotspots and 100,000 subscribers. The platform has generated more than $2 million in network fees.
* **Celo**: This blockchain is transitioning to Ethereum’s Layer 2. Developers are focusing on stablecoins and payment solutions in emerging markets, where the project is growing in popularity. By daily stablecoin transactions, it already surpasses Tron.
* **UMA**: The latest addition to Grayscale’s top 20. UMA is an oracle network utilized by the major prediction market Polymarket.

Other key players in Grayscale’s ranking include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Toncoin (TON), Chainlink (LINK), and Uniswap (UNI). Following the third quarter, some assets were removed from the list, including Render (RND), Mantle (MNT), ThorChain (RUNE), Pendle (PENDLE), Illuvium (ILV), and Raydium (RAY).

Finally, Grayscale analysts highlighted the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies, emphasizing their heightened volatility and urging investors to exercise caution."

I don’t believe there’s much downside left from long-term perspective unless they’re going to zero, which seems unlikely for many. Accumulating some high-cap altcoins and holding them over the next 12 months could potentially lead to a favorable outcome given the current conditions. Anyone else considering a similar strategy or have thoughts on this approach?

MakerDAO Introduces Exciting Governance Token Swap Option for MKR Holders,iotatokennews,1f0j4is,2024-08-24 19:50:48,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/iotatokennews/comments/1f0j4is/makerdao_introduces_exciting_governance_token/,iotatokennews,,"MakerDAO Introduces Exciting Governance Token Swap Option for MKR Holders

Evolution in the​ MakerDAO Ecosystem: Introduction of New Governance and‍ Stablecoin Tokens
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a strategic move⁢ within its decentralized ‍finance (DeFi) landscape, MakerDAO has unveiled two significant innovations: NewGovToken (NGT) ‌and⁤ NewStable (NST), aimed at expanding its protocol and enhancing user engagement in governance.

### Bridging Governance with​ Accessibility: ⁢The Role of NGT

MakerDAO⁣ has launched an ⁤initiative to issue NGT tokens that can be exchanged ⁤by holders of MKR ‌tokens at a conversion rate​ of 24,000 NGT per MKR. This initiative is designed ​to ⁤democratize the governance process within MakerDAO’s ecosystem. Given MKR’s current market price stands ​around $2,084, with ‌the total circulating supply capped at 977,631 tokens, this conversion mechanism places increased voting power into more hands. It reduces​ barriers previously seen due to the limited supply and relatively high value per token.

### NST: A Complementary Stablecoin Anchored to DAI

Alongside NGT, MakerDAO announced the debut‌ of ⁢NST—a robust stablecoin pegged on a 1:1 basis with DAI. ⁣This development ensures that both⁣ DAI and MKR will continue to coexist within the ecosystem while providing users an optional ​pathway⁢ through NST transactions which mirror DAI’s stability.

### Projections for ⁣Stability and Growth‌

Amid these ⁣introductions ⁢as part of what​ has been termed as their “endgame”⁤ strategy—which focuses on widening their services‌ across various fronts—MakerDAO ⁢envisions⁢ a fortified platform where ​new stablecoins could potentially lead to fresh revenue opportunities while simultaneously bolstering governance participation.

In terms of future expectations for these tokens, officials from MakerDAO ⁤indicate ⁢they are slated for continuous operation barring any shifts determined via communal governing consensus. This echoes a wider commitment towards flexible yet sound scalability exercises tailored around comprehensive ⁤community feedback mechanisms.

### Market Reactions & Strategic Analysis

Cryptocurrency analysts⁢ note that such strategies reflect broader⁤ trends where platforms steadily lean‌ towards enhanced user inclusivity in protocol governance ‌coupled with financial stability via⁢ linked assets like stablecoins. However cautious‍ optimism ‌remains advised as broader crypto markets still reel under periodic volatilities⁤ often causing⁢ newly introduced tokens considerable pressures post-launches similar scenarios highlighted by security outfit Immunefi; wherein about 80% percent face declines after intrusion incidents nearly six months on average ​according to recent data.

Not ‍only does this approach spotlight encryption⁢ algorithms stabilizing such frameworks but also underscores profound evolution principles shaping cryptocurrencies into divergent layers catering distinct audience needs spanning routine transactions upto high-stake‌ investments thereby ‌possibly redefining participations metrics across digital landscapes‌ well oriented towards future economic matrices.

This ⁢comprehensive effectuation aims not only at broadening participatory horizons but also⁣ significantly underscored importance holistic‍ integrative measures setting benchmark operational ‌protocols aligned along continual enhancement trajectories sustaining foundational outlook marked throughout evolving​ digital exchange dimensions inherent cryptocurrency domains ‌notably ensuring requisite alignment articulating major pivoting thrusts progressively contextualized well ​defining optimum trajectory paths plight forthcoming generational ledgers endeavor spirits harmoniously synergized zones transactional ecologies elaboratively uniting converged financial⁢ architectures.

A New Breakthrough in the Crypto World: Real World Assets (RWA),DAOLabs,1evlbpe,2024-08-18 18:03:17,11,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DAOLabs/comments/1evlbpe/a_new_breakthrough_in_the_crypto_world_real_world/,trhomeagent,Reddit Tasks,"Today, we're going to talk about Real World Assets (RWAs), one of the most exciting developments in the crypto world that offers investors new opportunities even in times of #MarketDownturn. If, like me, you're looking to improve yourself in this area and seize new opportunities, then this article is for you!

[What is RWA and why is it so important?](https://preview.redd.it/o09g3f3uvhjd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f716f6583eebebc12a79bf47ed8edd5eabc5e67)

First of all, I have to say that my introduction to #RWA goes back many years. I first bought a piece of Banksy's Love is in the Air, which was launched on the Avalanche network. When I look at its current value, I wish I had sold it in the early days. It was a failed experience for me. The second was LTO Network, which I met through DAO Labs social mining. At that time, I was new to social mining and didn't really understand the importance of RWAs. I call it a big misfortune. I really should have done more research and understood RWAs better. Therefore, please review this article carefully. 

Real World Assets (RWA), digitize valuable things in the physical world with blockchain technology. Houses, gold, stocks, even bonds and more... It's all available as digital tokens!

[RWA's best features:](https://preview.redd.it/a16x8jwwvhjd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=589309dd8555cd648ca1b2fd685960ad3b314d8d)

* Increased liquidity: You can easily buy and sell things that are normally hard to sell.
* Accessibility: Even we as small investors can invest in big assets.
* Transparency and security: Blockchain makes everything transparent and secure.
* Efficiency: Transactions are faster and cheaper.
* Diversification: Investors can diversify their portfolios more easily.

So How Does This Work?

Let me talk a little bit about behind the scenes:

* The asset is valued.
* Special tokens are created for this asset.
* Smart contracts come into play.
* Finally, these tokens are traded on exchanges.

What Happens in 2024?

Friends, when I started my article, I talked about the consequences of my ignorance, wrong strategy and not researching the topic in detail. The fact that 2024 is a boom year for RWA projects has caused me to miss out on opportunities that I discovered early on but would have caught early on because I didn't do enough research. I am now doing more research on RWA and trying to refresh my knowledge as much as possible. I am sharing the following reports and analyses for your benefit. Please also check the resource links at the end of the article. 

- According to CoinGecko's report, the market capitalization of commodity-backed tokens has reached 1.1 billion dollars. This figure surprised even me! (1)

- According to CoinDesk, RWAs are performing well despite the volatility in the crypto market. (2)

- And I read on CoinMarketCap that people's interest in RWAs is growing. (3)

Featured News

* ENor Securities will offer Backed's bTokens in Latin America. This is likely to boost tokenization efforts in the region. (4)
* Germany's state-backed development bank is preparing to issue tokenized bonds. Traditional financial institutions are also following this trend. (5)
* Franklin Templeton's $420 million OnChain US Government Money Market Fund is expanding into Arbitrum. (6)
* Ripple to allocate $10 million in US Treasury bonds tokenized on XRP Ledger (7)

Featured RWA Projects

I thought we should also remember the projects that first come to mind when we think of RWA. Here are investors' favorite RWA projects:

* BlackRock's BUIDL: A pioneer in digitizing traditional assets.
* Chainlink (LINK): Bridging smart contracts and real-world data.
* Maker (MKR): An important player in the DeFi world. Uses RWAs as collateral.
* LTO Network (LTO): Used to digitize legal and business processes.

[RWAs and Social Mining](https://preview.redd.it/ddkuemd4whjd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=26dc8cfc314b634304877b9ce4c32e925579c8de)

During my research on RWA, I came across an article shared by DAOLABS on Reddit that illustrates the compatibility between Real World Assets (RWAs) and social mining. 

As DAOLABS puts it, “physical goods and services are the next frontier for the token economy to explore” and social mining can play an important role in this journey of discovery. Please read the [full post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DAOLabs/comments/1ev98iw/tokenizing_realworld_assets_is_it_compatible_with/) 

In conclusion, I have to say that RWAs are indeed taking firm steps towards becoming the investment vehicle of the future. I think it is not far-fetched for experts to say that by 2030, the market share will reach 10 trillion dollars.

So what do you think? Which RWA projects are you following? Please leave your comments on my articles that I share on [Binance Square](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/12350986804289) and [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/post/339018591/).

The scam occurred due to the delegate signing multiple signatures.  
  
The sender address, “0xfb94d3404c1d3d9d6f08f79e58041d5ea95accfa,” transferred 3,657 aEthMKR tokens to the recipient address “0x739772254924a57428272f429bd55f30eb36bb96,” with the transaction being confirmed within 11 seconds.

Wallet: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x739772254924a57428272f429bd55f30eb36bb96#tokentxns](https://etherscan.io/address/0x739772254924a57428272f429bd55f30eb36bb96#tokentxns)

The hacker already swapped the stash for ETH in the following way as we can see in the image:

* 3,657 MKR = 2,502 ETH ($8.7M)
* 2.56M PT Ethena Tokens = 689 ETH ($2.41M)

The MKR swap for ETH caused a 7% dip in the market as we can see

When I see this kind of phishing attacks it always makes me wonder what can we develop or do to prevent this and I always reach the same conclusion. We are on our own and we need to educate ourselves to set walls.

Some things you can do to prevent being scammed are quite basic things:

* Trust no one. Not even yourself. Always verify everything multiple times.
* Don't click email links. Always go to the official source/website and do it there. If you 100% need to click the link ensure 200% that it is legit. Looking for news, the link form, any kind of UI bug or if something is off.
* Always try to use hot disposable wallets to connect to third parties. Set 1 or multiple wallets that will never see the light. They will hold your big stash and only have transactions between your ""public"" wallets.
* Learn about scamming techniques so you can detect them faster. For example, if they are rushing you to do something... super sus.

* Wacom UD EMR
* A type of digital stylus technology designed by Wacom. EMR stands for ‘electronic magnetic resonance’. You can find out how it works [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240502210048/https:/web.archive.org/web/20220127002742/https:/community.wacom.com/us/emr-stylus-electro-magnetic-resonance-how-wacom-pens-work/).
* No batteries are required \* for the stylus functions, including hovering (pressing buttons near the display)\*\*, though some do have supercapacitors\* for additional Bluetooth functionality (currently only a few Samsung S Pens) and there is one that uses batteries for Bluetooth buttons (page turning).
* \*‘Technically’, all EMR styluses have a supercapacitor to store the charge from the grid in the display assembly. These never need changing. Some pens have an additional one for Bluetooth which does require charging.
* \*\*Hovering gesture support is stylus hardware and software dependent. Currently, only Samsung Android devices going back to the original Note support it. :vb-warning: Editor’s note: This needs checking for accuracy. :vb-warning:
* These come in styluses as ‘cartridges’, so it is possible to transplant them into other bodies, including the back erasers.
* Due to using a magnetic field to detect the stylus, magnets may affect stylus performance. For manufacturing this means more shielding is required. For the end user, this means that some cases with magnets may negatively stylus performance.
* The technology can roughly be split into two ‘generations’. The underlying technology is the same, so they are all intercompatible, but ‘1st generation’ styluses will probably not be accurate.
* While Wacom’s professional digitisers do also use EMR, they are not intercompatible with Wacom UD EMR. Currently, no hacks to make them so are known.

* These can be from simply supergluing a whole slim pen (usually an S Pen) into a pen body, to using the EMR ‘refills’/cartridges and 3D printing parts.
* Currently the most popular seems to be to use the Supernote (Ratta) refill (likely due to them being the only ones to sell the refills/cartridges individually to consumers). Please check the subreddit or YouTube for guides. Here’s an important thing to start with though:

* That is to trim the length of the nib and the refill, and fill the nib with thermal free resin, so that there will be no cursor offset
* Moreover, I found that the IAF of ud emr 1.0 pen I used was better than that of Galaxy note 9 s-pen and onyx note 2 pen, and it also had double buttons and tail eraser
* I also found the UD EMR 2.0 pen with three buttons, but it is not the original electromagnetic induction three buttons. Instead, it integrates Bluetooth buttons similar to AES / MPP for the EMR scheme

How to buy Maker (MKR) in United Arab Emirates (UAE)?,cryptoQandA,1cn0wem,2024-05-08 06:05:51,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoQandA/comments/1cn0wem/how_to_buy_maker_mkr_in_united_arab_emirates_uae/,maxikaz19,,"To buy Maker (MKR) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), you can follow these steps:

1. **Research and Choose a Reliable Cryptocurrency Exchange**: Look for a cryptocurrency exchange that supports MKR trading and operates in the UAE. Ensure that the exchange is reputable, secure, and compliant with local regulations.

2. **Create an Account**: Sign up for an account on the chosen cryptocurrency exchange. This usually involves providing some personal information and verifying your identity.

3. **Deposit Funds**: Once your account is set up, deposit funds into it. Most exchanges accept deposits in fiat currency (such as AED) as well as other cryptocurrencies. Follow the instructions provided by the exchange to make a deposit.

4. **Find MKR Trading Pair**: Locate the MKR trading pair on the exchange platform. This could be MKR/AED if the exchange supports direct fiat-to-MKR trading, or MKR/BTC or MKR/ETH if you need to trade using Bitcoin or Ethereum.

5. **Place an Order**: Decide on the amount of MKR you want to buy and place an order on the exchange. You can choose between market orders, limit orders, or other order types based on your preferences.

6. **Complete the Purchase**: Once your order is matched with a seller, the MKR tokens will be credited to your exchange account. You can then withdraw them to your personal wallet for added security if you prefer.

Remember to conduct thorough research and consider factors such as fees, security measures, and user reviews when selecting a cryptocurrency exchange. Additionally, stay updated with the latest regulations regarding cryptocurrency trading in the UAE.
