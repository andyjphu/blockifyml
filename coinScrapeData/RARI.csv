Ok so I don’t like to make Shill posts, but I also love being right. So this is an easy one for me. And since I know exactly what’s going to happen here, I will share with you all.

Full disclosure, I have been trading $RARI since 2022. Since then, I have amassed a nice bag of this selling on pumps and buying back on the dips. I will be holding RARI long term, as I believe this is going to be one of the Top NFT platforms. I made over 6 figures in gains in 2021, so I am not coming from a place of ignorance on this space. 

I stumbled across Rarible by accident in 2021 on the quest for the next biggest NFT platform (I was heavily invested into up and coming NFT platforms in 2021, and that explains my profits). I have never owned an actual NFT. My philosophy: *In a Gold rush, sell shovels.* I am investing into the “Shovel Sellers”, not the Shovels.

What I realized very quickly, is that $RARI is an extremely undervalued asset…..

***What is Rarible?***

Rarible is an NFT platform that allows users to instantly mint NFTs for free, and when it sells they charge a fee to the buyer. The artist pays very little fees. Rarible has an app that’s very easy to use, and connects to most wallets. However, this is not your normal degenerate NFT community. This is a real Artist community with real collectors. Some of their pieces have sold for multiple millions. 

***What is $RARI?***

$RARI is the token that’s used on the platform. When a collector buys on the platform, they need $RARI to do so. Except $RARI is a very limited supply of 25 Million, and about 99% of that in circulation. There is very low liquidity, so when these buyers go to source it, the price will run hard. This is why we see these massive spikes in price when they list a project, as collectors are trying to source RARI to make the purchase.

What’s very interesting about this is that $RARI has a very low Market Cap currently. At time of writing, sitting around a $55 Million Market Cap. In a simple comparison, Dogecoin is a worthless shitcoin with No utility or use whatsoever, and It’s sitting at a $55 BILLION MC right now. That’s 1000X $RARI *(Make it make sense!)*

A 10X from here, and we are still only $550 Million MC. Completely reasonable.

Now I’m not the only one who has found out about RARI. Forbes ranked Rarible as the #2 Platform behind Opensea, based on ease of use and fees. During the 2021 Bullrun, Opensea did a fundraise at over a $13 BILLION evaluation. For reference, a 100X from today’s price is still only $5.5 Billion Market Cap. Less than half that of Opensea’s value at peak. $RARI price peaked at around a $54 ATH in 2021. We have a very long way to go….

***What are NFTs?***

Now this is more for the Newcomers: An NFT (Non Fungible Token), is the technology behind the art that allows for true ownership of the Art. If you only see JPEGS when looking at NFT you are missing the point. Non Fungible just means that nobody can fake this. You can’t knock it off like how you can other art, the code is imprinted to the art. They are one and the same. This allows for users to instantly trade without the need for a broker. 

NFT technology is so much bigger than most realize. This application will change everything for us in the future. They are already working on applications for Music, Film, Art, Gaming, Memorabilia, etc. All of these could be traded via NFT someday and it’s the Most beneficial for the Artist. 

When a creator makes an NFT, they will get a royalty every time that NFT sells, forever…..

This is such a game changer, and one many artists have not realized yet.

Let me explain; *In today’s Collectible Market, the artist gets paid once at the initial purchase. Let’s say they sell the piece for $1000, they only make $1000. If that piece then becomes super popular, and it’s then sold for $10,000, the artist still only made $1000. The collector made $9000.*

With an NFT, the royalty is generally 10%. So that artist will make $1000 every time that piece sells for $10,000. The potential for future profits are so much better with NFT technology.

I believe the NFT craze has literally yet to start. What we saw in 2021 was just a precursor for this revolutionary technology. Rarible will be at the epicenter of this movement when it happens."

I’ve always wandered why people choose to buy highly inflated tokens like doge, Shiba Inu, and other useless memecoins. Theirs so much untapped potential when it comes to low supply tokens like Badger dao, Elastos, Rari token, and Ordi token. 

Badger dao: 21 million coins. (Same as bitcoin)
Current marketcap: $67 million
Current price: $3.35
Ath: $85

Elastos: 28 million coin with 25 million in circulation 
Current marketcap: $47 million
Current price: $2.07
Ath: $93

Rarible: an nft based token with 25 million coins as max supply
Current marketcap: $50 million
Current price: $1.94
Ath: $65

Ordi token: A token part of the Ordi protocol with only 21 million coins as max supply
Current marketcap: $770 million 
Current price: $32
Ath: $96

Now imagine if these tokens had the same market as the highly inflated memecoins. Scarcity breeds more value then holding 10 billion tokens that have a circulation supply of trillions. Why have we chose memes over scarcity. "

Section IV.M.2.a.liii: Rarible (RARI)  
  
Unlocking the Canvas of Opportunity: 🎨💰 Exploring the Impact of the RARI Token on the Rarible NFT Marketplace 🤝🚀  
  
Abstract  
  
The emergence of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has revolutionized the digital ownership landscape, with platforms like Rarible leading the way in providing decentralized marketplaces for buying, selling, and trading unique digital assets. Central to the Rarible ecosystem is the RARI token, an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency designed to incentivize user participation, facilitate curation, and enable governance within the platform. This analysis aims to provide a comprehensive examination of the impact of the RARI token on the Rarible NFT marketplace. The study will delve into various aspects, including the role of RARI in incentivizing user engagement, its function in facilitating content curation, and its significance in platform governance. Through a combination of quantitative data analysis, qualitative research, and user behavior studies, we will assess the effectiveness of RARI in driving platform activity, promoting high-quality content, and fostering community involvement. Furthermore, this analysis will explore the economic implications of the RARI token, examining its market dynamics, price fluctuations, and correlation with platform usage metrics. Additionally, we will investigate the governance structure enabled by RARI, evaluating its effectiveness in facilitating democratic decision-making and ensuring the sustainable growth of the Rarible ecosystem. By synthesizing insights from various sources, including blockchain data, user feedback, and industry trends, this study aims to provide valuable insights into the role of the RARI token in shaping the Rarible NFT marketplace. The findings will not only contribute to our understanding of decentralized digital asset ecosystems but also inform stakeholders, investors, and platform users about the opportunities and challenges associated with participating in the Rarible ecosystem.

There are Shitcoin subs with more action than this. RARI is *the* play. I consider this to be one of the best NFT platforms there is. What am I missing???

A recent article from Forbes ranked Rarible at #2 for all NFT marketplaces behind Opensea. Currently Opensea is sitting around a $13 Billion Market Cap….

The Market Cap for RARI sits around a $60 Million. A 10x from here only puts RARI at approximately $600 million Market Cap. A 100x from here only puts RARI at a $6 Billion Market Cap, half that of Opensea.

I understand that Opensea is valued based on it’s Volume, which Rarible is much less. But still, ***what am I missing here???***

Currently I am balls deep in RARI and only own a few other cryptos. I personally believe RARI will outperform most other coins in this next cycle, once the NFT madness returns. Everyone on this sub who owns this coin should be Jacking their Tits as we speak.

TLDR: This sub is boring, please read my shill post and let’s get the hype going. Jack those Tits!! RARI to the Moon!! 🚀🚀🚀 #RARIboyz"

NFTs are unique digital assets that are verified on the blockchain and can represent anything from art to virtual real estate.

Rarible aims to provide a platform for creators to monetize their digital content by selling it as NFTs. Users can create their own NFTs by uploading their digital content to the platform, and then set a price for others to buy or bid on. Rarible also allows users to discover and purchase NFTs created by other users, creating a vibrant marketplace for digital art and collectibles.

Rarible has its own cryptocurrency, RARI, which is used to incentivize creators and provide governance for the platform. RARI holders can participate in platform governance by voting on proposals for platform improvements and changes, as well as earn rewards through staking and participating in the platform's ecosystem.

Overall, Rarible is a promising platform for creators to monetize their digital content and for users to discover and purchase unique digital assets. Its use of NFTs and decentralized technology make it a potentially interesting option for investors who are interested in the future of digital art and collectibles. However, as with any investment, it's important to do your own research and understand the risks involved before investing in RARI or any other cryptocurrency."

>The development of blockchain technology has led to the birth of NFT, and as the market matures, NFT marketplaces have emerged. In this article, we will rate and analyze 5 major NFT marketplaces, including Rarible, SuperRare, LooksRare, X2Y2 and Blur. We hope to provide some useful information to help our users to choose the suitable NFT marketplace.

## A Quick Overview

Similar to OpenSea, [Rarible](https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/rarible/overview), [SuperRare](https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/superrare/overview), [LooksRare](https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/looksrare/overview), [X2Y2](https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/x2y2/overview), and [Blur](https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/blur1/overview) are all Ethereum-based NFT marketplaces that provide order book trades for NFTs in ERC-721 and ERC-1155 formats. However, each marketplace has its unique focus on NFT trading.

### Rarible

Rarible was one of the first established NFT marketplaces. It went live in April 2018. Rarible supports all categories of NFT and charges a 2.5% fee on all transactions (same as OpenSea). In addition to [Ethereum](https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/ethereum/overview), Rarible has also been deployed to smart contract platforms including [Solana](https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/solana/overview), [Polygon](https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/polygon/overview), and [Immutable X](https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/immutable-x/overview). Additionally, Rarible has developed an open-source NFT development tool called Rarible Protocol, which supports custom NFT creation. 

### SuperRare

SuperRare started in 2020, and mainly focuses on the artwork category. It is designed to help artists earn a fairer income through royalties. SuperRare charges a 15% transaction fee for primary market trading and a 3% fee for secondary market trading.

### LooksRare

LooksRare launched in January 2022. It is one of the new-generation NFT marketplaces. LooksRare hopes to challenge OpenSea by distributing fees to the community. It charges a 2% transaction fee on all transactions and distributes the revenue to LooksRare's native token stakers.

### X2Y2

X2Y2 went live in February 2022. Similar to LooksRare, X2Y2 also distributes transaction fees to its native token stakers. However, it only charges a 0.5% fee on NFT transactions.

### Blur

Blur officially launched in October 2022. Compared to other NFT marketplaces that mainly focus on retail users, Blur places more emphasis on serving NFT traders. Specifically, in addition to the original order book NFT trading, Blur also provides batch shelf and floor-sweeping. Meanwhile, it also integrates NFTs from other marketplaces for buyers to select and purchase. Furthermore, Blur does not charge any transaction fees. (Related Reading: [What Is Blur?

## Underlying Technology & Security

Among these projects, except for Blur, all the remaining projects have made their code base publicly available on GitHub. The open-source code includes project smart contracts, SDK, token smart contracts, and other related technical documentation. In terms of GitHub performance, Rarible has the highest number of Stars and Forks. The GitHub performance of X2Y2 and SuperRare, on the other hand, is relatively poor, with the number of Stars and Forks being almost 40 times lower than Rarible's.

https://preview.redd.it/fhto1b8b09la1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5402e993b40b43cdc72a844552f1701da7d53de

In terms of code auditing, all projects have publicly disclosed audit reports for their smart contracts. Among them, LooksRare conducted the most audits and completed 3 code audits in 2022. According to the audit results, SuperRare had the fewest security issues, with only one low-risk security issue exits. LooksRare and Rarible had relatively more security vulnerabilities. They both have high-risk vulnerabilities existing in their codes. Additionally, except for X2Y2, all projects have launched bug bounty programs.As of Feb 28, 2023, except for Rarible, none of the remaining projects have experienced any security crisis events. According to the news, Rarible and OpenSea suffered a [hacker attack](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2022/01/27/hacker-attack-rarible-opensea-nft-loss/) against their NFT API in January 2022, with stolen assets worth about $1 million.

## Token Economics

In terms of token utility, according to the publicly disclosed information, [$LOOKS](https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/looksrare/overview), [$BLUR](https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/blur1/overview), [$RARI](https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/rarible/overview), [$X2Y2](https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/x2y2/overview), and [$RARE](https://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/superrare/overview) are all used for decentralized governance. Rarible's users can stake $RARI to obtain benefits like transaction fee deduction, private Discord access, etc. Users of LooksRare and X2Y2 can respectively earn transaction fee rewards by staking $LOOKS and $X2Y2. However, $BLUR and $RARE have no additional utility other than decentralized governance at this time.

https://preview.redd.it/657mbeal09la1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff4f3f083ab3f536b22b9d92c10e05b71b0140a3

In terms of token allocation, the percentage of $LOOKS, $RARI, and $X2Y2 allocated to the community is over 70%, indicating a relatively low level of centralization. However, the percentage of $BLUR and $RARE allocated to the core team and investors is close to 50%, indicating a relatively high level of centralization.In terms of vesting plans, the Rarible team has not disclosed a detailed vesting plan for $RARI. The vesting plan for $LOOKS and $X2Y2 is similar, with the share belonging to the core team and investors fully unlocked within 2 years, unlocked every six months. The $RARE tokens allocated to the core team and investors will be locked for 1 year and linearly unlocked in the following 2 years. $BLUR will be unlocked in a decreasing manner over 4 years, with 40% unlocked in the first year, 30% unlocked in the second year, and so on.

## Token Performance

According to [TokenInsight](https://tokeninsight.com/en/cryptocurrencies)'s data, it can be seen that Blur, as a dark horse among the recent NFT marketplaces, has the best secondary market performance among all projects. Although its token has just been listed and the date is less than 15 days, it has already been listed on 24 exchanges, and its 24-hour volume is the highest among all tokens, about $150 million.Based on historical data, the highest 24-hour volume of $BLUR reached an ATH price of about $440 million on Feb 16th. This is almost unheard of among new projects launched this year. Compared with other NFT marketplaces, as of February 27, 2023, the 24-hour volume of tokens from other projects has not exceeded $5 million. Although this is related to the relatively high market cap of $BLUR, its market cap is nearly 3x of $LOOKS and $RARE, but their 24-hour volume is nearly 30x.On the other hand, the performance of $X2Y2 and $RARI is relatively poor. They are currently only listed for trading on 12 exchanges; the 24-hour volume of $RARI is the lowest among all projects, only 190,000 US dollars.

https://preview.redd.it/sfnrhymm09la1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5c934c72012bdbdf8637ef57c495dcb0e54224b

Regarding the price trends, based on the price comparison chart above, it is clear that $BLUR has the highest price volatility. During its initial launch, the price of $BLUR reached a peak of about $4 but quickly fell afterward. However, as demand in the market grew, the price of $BLUR gradually increased over the next few days, reaching a high of around $1.4. But according to the latest data, on February 27th, the price of $BLUR fell back to around $0.84, a drop of nearly 80% from its all-time high price.$RARE and $RARI are similar in that their prices have remained relatively stable. On the other hand, the prices of $LOOKS and $X2Y2 have been on a downward trend. Among them, $X2Y2 has been experiencing a continuous decline in price since its launch, and currently has a drop of nearly 60% compared to February 14th.

## Ecosystem Development

According to statistics, the initial launch of NFT marketplaces always sees a peak in trading volume, and Blur is no exception. Influenced by airdrop incentives, NFT trading volume on Blur reached $70 million in the third week of its launch, almost on par with OpenSea. After $BLUR went live on February 14th, 2023, Blur's weekly trading volume exceeded $360 million, 3x of OpenSea for the same week. In response to the competition from Blur, [OpenSea announced a limited-time 0 transaction fee plan on February 18th](https://tokeninsight.com/zh/news/opensea-announces-0-fee-for-limited-time-moves-to-optional-royalties). This move helped OpenSea's weekly trading volume surge from $100 million to $330 million. However, Blur's trading volume increased even further to $530 million.

https://preview.redd.it/y2etof0p09la1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ae10c49f696c02e137f00d9f20c02023c043bf7

After launching in January 2022, LooksRare's weekly volume quickly soared to $2.9 billion, nearly 3x of OpenSea for the same week. After a significant drop in trading volume on LooksRare, X2Y2 went live and saw its weekly volume increase from $48 million in the first week of April to nearly $200 million in the first week of June, on par with OpenSea's trading volume for the same week. However, as wash traders left, trading volumes on LooksRare and X2Y2 both saw significant declines. In the final week of 2022, OpenSea's weekly trading volume was $72 million, while LooksRare and X2Y2 had weekly trading volumes of $27 million and $40 million, respectively. These data better reflect the true usage of LooksRare and X2Y2.

https://preview.redd.it/td0pgisq09la1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0f7081804941428789f9482d105200617ac1ca7

With the experience gained from LooksRare and X2Y2, we wanted to gain a better understanding of the real usage of NFT marketplaces. Therefore, we chose to compare the number of unique buyers among these platforms. We found out the trading volume on LooksRare is almost unrelated to the buyers. Since the launch of LooksRare, the number of weekly active buyers has remained between 2,000 and 6,000. Although not entirely positively correlated, the volume growth of X2Y2 and Blur almost always accompanies the growth of their user base.For example, Blur's weekly trading volume increased from $10 million when it was first launched to $400 million in the second week of February 2023, with a growth of about 40x. During the same period, the number of weekly active buyers on Blur increased from 6,000 to 30,000, a growth of about 5x. However, in the past week, Blur's trading volume increased from $400 million in the previous week to $650 million with an increase of over 50%, but the number of buyers only increased by less than 10%.In terms of community performance, according to TokenInsight's statistics, as of February 27, 2023, Rarible has the most Twitter followers, nearly 500,000 people. Blur has the most Discord followers, nearly 130,000 people. SuperRare operates most social media platforms. In addition to Twitter and Discord, it also operates Telegram, Medium, Instagram, Reddit, and others.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zj18b63s09la1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=701b2dd2ebc19a557ace02c3832fc6dbbab61f4f

Based on overall product usage and community performance, Blur has performed the best. Currently, Blur has the largest volume and the most unique buyers, second only to OpenSea. Therefore, we believe that Blur's high trading volume will not experience a significant drop like LooksRare. At the same time, Blur's community is also quite active. In addition to having an advantage in numbers, community activities such as AMA and Space are relatively frequent.

## Closing Thoughts

In summary, we believe that among the major NFT marketplaces mentioned in the article, Blur and LooksRare have performed better. LooksRare, as one of the new generation of NFT marketplace, made a big splash when it was launched in early 2022 and once had extremely high trading volumes that could rival OpenSea. Unfortunately, this was caused by trading incentives. The homogeneous product and service that LooksRare offered did not bring the same user stickiness as OpenSea. Moreover, the transaction fees of LooksRare were not as attractive as X2Y2, so the trading volume and liquidity of NFT on LooksRare are showing a declining trend. Therefore, we believe that LooksRare's rating will be downgraded to B or even lower in the future.In contrast, Blur adopted a differentiated strategy and provided users with products and services that differed from OpenSea, which attracted many NFT traders since its launch. Currently, Blur is in its growth stage, and its trading volume has already surpassed OpenSea. We believe that there are also wash trading on Blur, but they are more sustainable than those in LooksRare. As time goes by, speculators will find better opportunities and leave Blur, and then Blur will show us a more realistic usage scenario. At the same time, along with Blur's further development, the richer token application scenarios, the more detailed token vesting plan, and the more complete roadmap will further improve its rating result. In the future, we will continue to monitor the development of NFT marketplaces and make timely adjustments and updates to the rating results.

## Rarible. Supports. Royatlies. 

We have 3 solutions to help NFT creators keep their royalties.

Gm, 

As you might know, royalties have been a huge topic in the NFT space lately. 

It started with some marketplaces acquiring massive amounts of liquidity by making royalties optional. That caused a domino effect, where more and more platforms are now allowing traders to opt out of royalties.

**We think that's wrong.**

Royalties are essential to Web3. They empower NFT artists, creators, communities, and new collections. 

*Optional* royalties, in turn, have created an environment where:   


 Buyers save ETH.   
 Marketplaces process more transactions.   
 But artists, creators, and collections are completely cut out.

It’s a race to the bottom where we all lose. And we think there's a better way.

Our solution to the royalties “problem” has three key components. 

## Solution #1. Community marketplaces

Our [community marketplaces](https://trk.klclick1.com/ls/click?upn=4ve1gRlE-2ButRHi4JYpNKhZBGCcokzYgP4-2Bh-2BAtP0xvVJhMENS1YKsKSyixl6IKz7gvn81baL3HUPK1XaBl-2B0UVAoDoWVxlCl9Sa28UUms096E8464wIEtAA9YznEcG6ZMi3Unr4b4X1JTRgOvKl9QNNBhWgujumJQkNenA1hieACuxdfGb9OErb3VSA7KDzEIqYB0-2BIvfHnjhnsboozT7y1N-2BrcEQMHGI46Vm4i1yL1PD3sarKqB3ElgqqiKRlYRiaIpGQryU5dz8dEmAxp9zCSSGShbCYR120eeLYaV722grlk6mMgYtdHwDR7gTNaqtDFlEyQHAe-2BoRn-2BGTejmBJgFIKfWnlLE2v6riA-2B5yAKSXNxhCQ4iQP0wEIWcWWro1p49S75PG-2FVaUkcaJYn-2Bjg-3D-3DNWbH_-2BmhElkDZM44-2FVWzoF8l-2B9Be-2Fa-2FHduWN-2BBx2d8TOCGJ6eEW-2BHinQM48gUuOGa-2FPx9dRicaRB3rLQ02c7u9CO3VQjGIxW9Rlwcg-2BxMMGNu36GwV9PGY8sXE-2FQz6tjdObizEVQE627w8BRtaI9ON-2FDW0L69vD30iGrMFTZcoX2m0J9Flv0xcWWl6hG2NBMV6kiA2N5UHp09leoUXojo5j1k5w2-2BezKBE9XQPhYIqfJUftmMwozDPbiwNZDjNq-2FKs0DpxBKTSPJBykZxccyT12kd4LHkjb78Fe2X4DEv8oSRBSbhcfAj-2FTRORWXk40iM7uq6Ym-2F5lTWmDXQI8yvduU76kLO8UaYfEaA6BD9ywnl-2FZmuboswKAcwqeE32jBh0WAY1bvx-2Fr-2BMu6VWCpYOj7wPlQ3aFsxwuAKSQ0SH5YItP9l8-3D) honor royalties.

We’ve built solutions that require royalties on items bought within community marketplaces listed elsewhere. So even if you buy an item from X2Y2, for instance, royalties are still enforced at checkout.

## Solution #2. Royalties cash back & $RARI Rewards

We’re incentivizing people to pay royalties by giving them “royalties cash back” in the form of $RARI (up to the amount they spent) on Rewards Collections. [More details here](https://trk.klclick1.com/ls/click?upn=4ve1gRlE-2ButRHi4JYpNKhX1OMjweZ8cOqi-2BnFe3Bs-2F6NAaoTOd7boGb0atLPk38CiQb0-2BPEDzzgSmpedeIcqZXi1RdHNu9bB1d-2B-2Bc0M5C1Ts08BymVKZh-2B6ZxAstON7JDbtu0uKCeQ9GOYkvbWnCa-2B5ZZ7ZGLq9Rd2AFm7ZXP59oX-2B-2FhN4o3E8fXfSrf28NwIO2rIy4nKQZeGt8vYVG-2BLvTpvCzWzzb8GoOxHCC8d1VWlDR7rZ7bidZyuTNaJ9VzfoX9OU9cbcGqKzewzyKOlWPAk-2BLUnG9pTQgBDPPPBP3cN7wvqJlixRjkb9QuknXEYbbK2Zo8EfVrGIi2hqZ5BMF96U2jAMmKDciA8tXEmufM8F5xgBUzIk3omWsGXDSl-tcY_-2BmhElkDZM44-2FVWzoF8l-2B9Be-2Fa-2FHduWN-2BBx2d8TOCGJ6eEW-2BHinQM48gUuOGa-2FPx9dRicaRB3rLQ02c7u9CO3VQjGIxW9Rlwcg-2BxMMGNu36GwV9PGY8sXE-2FQz6tjdObizEVQE627w8BRtaI9ON-2FDW0L69vD30iGrMFTZcoX2m0J9Flv0xcWWl6hG2NBMV6kiA2N5UHp09leoUXojo5j1k5w2-2BezKBE9XQPhYIqfJUftmMwozDPbiwNZDjNq-2FKs0DpT8jiSQEbFXULBRsrb0wht0uvDTveII7RlkgZpoJKF9lZ4-2BNPhvBGttA7IiXlRyqZDjhWWiH8VAL9kBsYhVaU-2FFKeSaBQ2Fb2sFrOCTeFUHwJUv5wo1hzHBLZq7OM7tU42e-2F7817ITQaEDAjx8H4rEfHjU7lJza9yYC3qCZpjVj0-3D).

Doing the right thing has never been easier. 

## Solution #3. Aggregated top-ups

We’re also building a feature for aggregated top-ups. 

If you buy an aggregated listing on Rarible from a marketplace that doesn’t respect royalties, we’ll give you the option to pay royalties anyway.  
 

And we think you should take it.   
 

### Join the conversation. Take action. 

The conversation about royalties is complex, and full of competing interests. But we think that royalties are vital to the space, and should be respected. 

Want to share your POV? Tweet at us u/rarible. Let's keep royalties an essential part of the Web3 space.

Meanwhile, if you own an NFT collection, you can take the first step today and create your own marketplace with enforced royalties below. It takes just a few minutes and requires zero code knowledge.

What Are NFTs Used For?,u_Shivverse_meta,yl3nag,2022-11-03 10:01:36,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Shivverse_meta/comments/yl3nag/what_are_nfts_used_for/,Shivverse_meta,,"  In our previous blogs about NFTs, we discussed what NFTs are & why are they ""the next big thing""? In this blog, we are going to discuss the uses and benefits of NFTs.

Artists and content creators have a one-of-a-kind opportunity to monetize their work which we are making easier for them in our Shivverse, thanks to blockchain technology and NFTs. Artists, for example, no longer have to sell their work through galleries or auction houses. Instead, the artist can sell it as an NFT straight to the consumer available on the platforms like Shivverse, allowing them to keep a larger portion of the profit. Additionally, artists can integrate royalties into their software so that they receive a share of sales when their work is sold to a new owner. This is a desirable feature because most artists do not receive subsequent proceeds after their first sale.

Making money using NFTs isn’t limited to art. To generate money for charity, companies like Charmin and Taco Bell have auctioned off themed NFT art. Taco Bell’s NFT art sold out in minutes, with the highest bids coming in at 1.5 wrapped ether (WETH) — equal to $3,723.83 at the time of writing. Charmin’s offering was dubbed “NFTP” (non-fungible toilet paper), and Taco Bell’s NFT art sold out in minutes, with the highest bids coming in at 1.5 wrapped ether (WETH) — equal to $3,723.83 at the time of writing.

How to Buy NFTs

If you’re interested in starting your own NFT collection, you’ll need the following items:

To begin, you’ll need a digital wallet that can hold both NFTs and cryptocurrencies. Depending on what currencies your NFT provider takes, you’ll probably need to buy some cryptocurrency, such as ETHER, SHIV. Coinbase, Kraken, eToro, and even PayPal and Robinhood now allow you to buy cryptocurrency with a credit card. After that, you’ll be able to transfer it from the exchange to your preferred wallet.

Popular NFT Marketplaces

OpenSea.io: This peer-to-peer marketplace claims to sell “rare digital products and memorabilia.” To get started, simply create an account and browse the NFT collections. You may also sort pieces by how much they sold to find new artists.

Rarible: Rarible is a democratic, open marketplace that lets artists and producers issue and sells NFTs, similar to OpenSea. The platform’s RARI tokens allow users to vote on features such as fees and community regulations.

Shivverse: Shivverse is India's first metaverse & NFT marketplace project which is built with a vision to revolutionize the technologies like metaverse in India. Shivverse holds lots of new and unique things for its users to access.

Bottomline: NFTs can bring lots of fortune but it is not that easy also one has to keep hustling to make it big with these technologies.

**What Is DeFi 2.0, How It Improves on DeFi 1.0 — and How to Invest in It**

The first wave of decentralized finance, collectively known as DeFi 1.0, gave people a way to invest and exchange cryptocurrency outside of traditional, centralized markets. Now, a new generation of decentralized initiatives is taking shape, and it’s already been dubbed DeFi 2.0. This in-depth guide will answer the question, “What is DeFi 2.0?” It will also explain DeFi 2.0 vs. DeFi 1.0 and describe how to invest in DeFi 2.0, giving you the knowledge you need to capitalize on the latest innovations in [decentralized finance](https://learn.bybit.com/defi/what-is-defi/) (DeFi).

What Is DeFi 2.0?

**DeFi 2.0 is a collection of decentralized finance projects that aim to improve on the previous efforts of DeFi 1.0. The movement focuses on making improvements in the areas of liquidity, scalability, governance and security.**

Once we’ve answered our initial question and discovered what DeFi 2.0 is, we need to understand why the movement exists. DeFi 2.0 traces its origins to [OlympusDAO](https://www.olympusdao.finance/), a [decentralized autonomous organization](https://learn.bybit.com/glossary/dao/) (DAO) based on the OHM token. This organization manages the control of its signature token through a system of policies, and the protocol is backed by assets held by the associated Olympus Treasury. Launched in May 2021, Olympus demonstrated a new range of possibilities for DeFi. In the months since its release, a slate of similar DAOs and projects have developed, marking the beginning of DeFi 2.0.

DeFi 2.0 vs. DeFi 1.0

Any investigation of this topic needs to start with the question, “What is DeFi 2.0?” From there, the natural follow-up is, “How is DeFi 2.0 different from. DeFi 1.0?”

While the idea of DeFi 2.0 vs. DeFi 1.0”suggests two separate ideas, it’s worth remembering that they spring from the same general theory. Both DeFi 1.0 and DeFi 2.0 are iterations of a single notion: The idea that blockchains allow for a decentralized finance ecosystem which bypasses traditional centers of financial power.

“DeFi” in general refers to a collection of decentralized applications that use smart contracts and secure oracle networks to conduct finance without intermediaries. DeFi 2.0 remains true to this central premise, but makes adjustments to overcome some of DeFi 1.0’s principal shortcomings.

As crypto enthusiasts flocked to DeFi applications, they couldn’t help but notice considerable limitations. For one thing, liquidity was hard to come by. The fact that providing liquidity required users to lock up their funds led to an undesirable amount of financial rigidity and capital inefficiency. DeFi protocols also had notoriously complicated user interfaces, meaning few beyond experienced crypto traders could navigate the applications. The protocols’ reliance on Ethereum caused further complications, as the blockchain’s increasing popularity produced slower transaction times and higher fees.

When considering DeFi 2.0 vs. DeFi 1.0, you need to remember that DeFi 2.0 represents a concerted effort to overcome some of these central difficulties. While the DeFi ecosystem is still far from perfect, a few key improvements are already apparent. Once you understand them, you’ll be ready to learn how to invest in DeFi 2.0.

DeFi 2.0 Creates Stronger Connections Between Users

If you’re thinking about what DeFi 2.0 protocols are — and how they’re different from more traditional financial applications — DeFi 2.0 protocols are essentially decentralized financial applications that endeavor to connect users who contribute liquidity. These applications promote the types of horizontal connections that foster lasting relationships. This, in turn, will produce a DeFi ecosystem that’s decentralized but still interconnected.

DeFi 2.0 Uses Optimized Governance Patterns

Governance is a key issue in any decentralized endeavor, and DeFi 2.0 is based on better administrative solutions. In DeFi 2.0 protocols, community members cooperate to make decisions and create policies. This democratic process allows frameworks to develop without relying on a powerful arbiter.

DeFi 2.0 Includes User-Friendly Incentive Schemes

Decentralized finance can only survive with liquidity, and DeFi 2.0 projects are employing creative incentive programs to acquire and maintain sufficient capital. Not only do incentives help solve the liquidity problems that plagued DeFi 1.0, but they also foster connections between users, thus helping to produce more cooperative communities.

DeFi 2.0 Promises a More Sustainable Ecosystem

If there’s one thing you should understand after asking what DeFi 2.0 is, it’s that the new decentralized protocols are being designed with an eye toward sustainability. This is also the key factor in the “DeFi 2.0 vs. DeFi 1.0” discussion. The combination of liquidity, interconnectedness and sound governance should create a decentralized ecosystem that can last. This sustainability will allow DeFi 2.0 projects to gather further momentum, attract more users, and redefine finance on a larger scale.

DeFi 2.0 Strengths and Use Cases

You can answer the question, “What is DeFi 2.0?” without knowing how the associated protocols operate. A quick overview of DeFi 2.0 vs. DeFi 1.0 is enough to explain the basic idea behind the latest iteration of decentralized finance, but a more in-depth discussion demonstrates exactly how investors can benefit from DeFi 2.0.

There are several features unique to DeFi 2.0 that make the movement a more appealing target for crypto investors. From smart contract insurance to self-repaying loans, these novel ideas lay the groundwork for a sustainable DeFi ecosystem.

Insurance for Smart Contracts

In the DeFi 2.0 vs. DeFi 1.0 discussion, one of the biggest issues is user-friendliness. DeFi 2.0 protocols often allow investors to take out insurance on their smart contracts. This is a significant source of protection, especially for novice investors.

Many people would love to stake LP tokens in a smart contract but worry that the contract could become compromised. They know that a compromised contract is impossible to rectify on the blockchain, and they lack the technical nous to protect their investments on their own. An insurance policy allows them to stake tokens without any concerns. Not only does this help individual investors, but it also encourages the influx of more capital into the protocol.

Impermanent Loss Insurance

With DeFi 1.0, users who have locked two tokens into a protocol in order to start liquidity mining could lose out if the price ratio between the two tokens fluctuates. This phenomenon is called [impermanent loss](https://learn.bybit.com/defi/what-is-impermanent-loss/), and it’s among the most distressing features of decentralized finance.

DeFi 2.0 projects are introducing new measures to mitigate this inherent risk. Some protocols use the proceeds from fees to insure users against impermanent loss. They can also mint new coins to make up for losses. All of these policies make DeFi a safer option for crypto investors.

Self-Repaying Loans

The DeFi 2.0 ecosystem allows for a remarkable financial maneuver in which loans pay for themselves. A lender can provide a user with a loan in exchange for collateral in the form of a small deposit. This deposit is then invested by the lender, who goes on to earn interest. Once the lender has earned the full price of the initial loan, they return the deposit, and the loan recipient ends up not having to repay the loan.

DeFi 2.0 Risks

Most people who ask, “What is DeFi 2.0?” are also curious about any risks that might be associated with investing in the movement. While this second iteration of DeFi is generally safer than its predecessor, there’s still no guarantee that every investment will prove successful. Even the best DeFi 2.0 projects have inherent drawbacks, and investors should be aware of any potential pitfalls before staking tokens. Once you’ve learned about the main risks, you’ll understand more about how to invest in DeFi 2.0.

The Continued Threat of Hackers

Crypto investors can’t be completely sure that the smart contracts they’re interacting with won’t be hacked. Before staking tokens, always investigate the project thoroughly. Even after you’ve done your due diligence, a surprising hack could occur. Luckily, insuring your smart contracts can help limit the damage in case of illegal activity.

Future Government Regulations

As decentralized finance attracts users and more people learn how to invest in DeFi 2.0, governments around the world will become increasingly eager to get involved. Many governments will try to impose regulations on DeFi 2.0 protocols. As an investor, it’s important to recognize that your future activities might be affected by rules and limitations that don’t yet exist. While this concern shouldn’t scare you off from participating altogether, it’s certainly something to keep in mind as you discover how to invest in DeFi 2.0.

The Volatility of Cryptocurrencies

Decentralized finance can only occur with cryptocurrencies, many of which are remarkably volatile. When prices fluctuate wildly, investors are left dealing with the consequences. Some protocols mitigate this risk by offering users [stablecoins](https://learn.bybit.com/altcoins/what-are-stablecoins-are-they-a-good-investment) to use for transactions. All the same, the inherent volatility of crypto markets will always be a factor in decentralized finance.

How To Invest in DeFi 2.0

We’ve answered our initial question, “What is DeFi 2.0?” We’ve also learned about DeFi 2.0 vs. DeFi 1.0. Now, it’s time to learn how to invest in DeFi 2.0. Decentralized finance involves several types of maneuvers that may be unfamiliar to crypto newcomers. Once you’ve learned a bit about common investment strategies, you’ll have a better understanding of the general DeFi 2.0 ecosystem.

Yield Farming

If you were at all familiar with decentralized finance before learning what DeFi 2.0 is, you might have questioned how the new movement deals with yield farming. This mechanism, a key innovation of DeFi 1.0, has become even more useful for investors in the latest installment of decentralized finance.

As with older projects, DeFi 2.0 protocols use yield farming to get liquidity from users. However, they go even farther by letting investors use tokens as collateral for loans. This twist on yield farming makes the protocols a more enticing option for investors.

Staking

[Staking](https://learn.bybit.com/crypto/what-is-crypto-coins-staking/) is a form of passive income generation as it allows users to become validators for blockchains that operate on a proof-of-stake basis. If you take this route, you can essentially lock your currency on the blockchain and earn block rewards in the process.

Lending

Self-repaying loans represent wonderful opportunities for lenders and loanees alike. Offering loans in exchange for interest payments is a great way to engage in yield farming within a DeFi 2.0 protocol.

Liquidity Provision or Liquidity Mining

Liquidity provision gives crypto holders an easy way to profit from their holdings. With this maneuver, holders pass some of their cryptocurrency to a liquidity pool so that users can trade against it. In exchange, the holder who provides the currency receives a fee. These types of simple, win-win transactions allow DeFi 2.0 protocols to attract liquidity while users earn a profit.

Trading on Decentralized Exchanges

[Decentralized exchanges](https://learn.bybit.com/glossary/dex/) (DEXs) allow users to pursue crypto transactions outside the realm of third-party organizations, such as banks. While some states and countries impose regulations on this type of trading, the decentralized nature of the practice offers considerable freedom. Not only do DEXs often have lower fees, but they also enable margin trading and other appealing types of transactions.

Participating in DAOs

Anyone asking about DeFi 2.0 is likely to be equally curious about DAOs, the autonomous organizations that provide the basis for most decentralized finance. Investors can join a DAO by purchasing the organization’s token. Once you’ve bought yourself into the community, you should have a say in governance. This direct participation represents a motivation for learning about how to invest in DeFi 2.0.

Best DeFi 2.0 Projects

If you want to know how to invest in DeFi 2.0, you need to have a basic understanding of the existing projects. While there are too many protocols to list them all, this guide will introduce you to some of the most important undertakings.

Olympus DAO

If there was a single project you’d heard of when you first wondered about DeFi 2.0, it was probably Olympus DAO. This decentralized reserve currency protocol set new standards in DeFi and became the starting point for DeFi 2.0. Investors can use the project for all sorts of yield farming, from staking to purchasing bonds. The organization is especially famous for its unique, user-friendly bonding model.

Synapse

[Synapse](https://docs.synapseprotocol.com/) is an automated market maker (AMM) with considerable influence in the DeFi 2.0 ecosystem. Its status as a trustless cross-chain bridge makes it an appealing option for a wide range of crypto investors trading in a variety of currencies.

Curve Finance

[Curve Finance](https://learn.bybit.com/defi/what-is-curve-finance/) is a DAO with its own exchange, [liquidity pool](https://learn.bybit.com/glossary/liquidity-aggregator-democracy-and-pool/) and stablecoin. It also provides the basis for the associated yield-farming complex [Convex](https://www.convexfinance.com/), which has been constructed on its platform. As a massively popular DEX, Curve Finance is often regarded as the “[Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) for stablecoins” because of its unique pricing formula.

Rarible

[Rarible ](https://rarible.com/)is a DeFi 2.0 project built around the concept of [non-fungible tokens](https://learn.bybit.com/crypto/what-is-a-non-fungible-token/) (NFTs). It consists of a DAO with its own governance model, allowing for considerable yield generation. Unlike the highly popular NFT marketplace [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), Rarible lets users who are bullish for the platform invest in RARI tokens. RARI tokens give individuals the opportunity to decide the future of Rarible, voting on issues like fee changes and how Rarible’s treasury is spent.

Alchemix

[Alchemix](https://alchemix.fi/) is a DeFi 2.0 protocol on the cutting edge of the DeFi 2.0 movement. While its simplicity makes it especially user-friendly, its variety of novel features is attracting enthusiastic investors. The protocol offers opportunities like self-repaying loans, DAOs and future yield, all of which make it worthy of consideration for crypto holders.

MakerDAO

[MakerDAO ](https://makerdao.com/en/)was one of the first giants of decentralized finance, prompting countless people to ask about DeFi 2.0. It’s managed by the holders of its native stablecoin, DAI, a token that’s been pegged to the dollar. This combination of stability and innovation makes MakerDAO intriguing for investors.

The Bottom Line

For DeFi beginners trying to understand DeFi 2.0, it’s simply a movement that seeks to improve on DeFi 1.0 by freeing up additional liquidity, fostering more connections between users and creating a sustainable financial ecosystem. In considering DeFi 2.0 vs. DeFi 1.0, remember that the latest iteration of decentralized finance represents a major improvement, but it hasn’t been perfected yet. From here, you can employ your newfound understanding of how to invest in DeFi 2.0."
Rarible NFT marketplace adds Web3 aggregation with new version,undeads,y9j266,2022-10-20 23:54:29,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/undeads/comments/y9j266/rarible_nft_marketplace_adds_web3_aggregation/,igorkim89,," The new aggregation feature provides listings and prices of Ethereum-based NFTs listed on major NFT marketplaces across Web3.

Rarible, an Ethereum-based nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace, announced its platform upgrade to Rarible 2 on Oct. 20.

The NFT marketplace says it is introducing new aggregation tools to showcase NFTs from across the Web3 space. This means users can browse and purchase Ethereum-based digital assets from Rarible, OpenSea, LooksRare, X2Y2 and Sudoswap.

Alex Salnikov, the chief strategy officer and co-founder of Rarible, told Cointelegraph that the NFT platforms we have now are “siloed,” and aggregation is the way to change that:

“It creates an open environment where users can access the best prices for NFTs all through one interface.”

This development from Rarible comes after a report from DappRadar, which hinted at impending NFT “marketplace wars.” DappRadar’s report highlighted other major platforms in the Web3 space such as Uniswap and OpenSea, both of which acquired NFT aggregator platforms this past year.

While OpenSea and Uniswap acquired outside aggregators, Rarible simply transformed its services to an aggregation-based model. The report says that such acquisitions could stir up direct competition between platforms.

Rarible also introduced a mechanism in which users can lock up their RARI, the native token of the marketplace, to earn rewards and incentives for ecosystem participation. Salnikov says this is a step toward further decentralization of the platform. 

“Users get to make decisions on where the ecosystem goes next. They have a say in Rarible’s future and that’s something you can’t get with just funds or an NFT.”

The decentralization of NFT marketplaces is a relevant discussion within the Web3 community. Many on Twitter have been calling out market dominators like OpenSea for being too centralized.

Es decir, un tipo único de activo que no se puede cambiar. Por ejemplo, una obra de arte como La persistencia de la memoria de Dalí (los relojes derretidos) puede  tener muchas copias pero solo hay una que es el original. Imagínate pudiésemos descubrir cuál es la original sólo con un pedazo de código...

👉️ Estos tokens se pueden comprar y vender en millones de sitios web y, actualmente, se utilizan principalmente en la industria de los #videojuegos. Con la creciente popularidad del comercio electrónico, muchas personas han recurrido a las NFT como inversión. Pero, ¿cuáles son los tres mercados de NFT más grandes por volumen de ventas?

🧐 **¿Qué otros NTF Marketplaces conoces?** 🧐"
Best NFT Marketplaces,u_tanyaasharma,w3nth7,2022-07-20 10:31:54,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tanyaasharma/comments/w3nth7/best_nft_marketplaces/,tanyaasharma,,"An NFT marketplace is your entry point to taking part in the buying and selling of these digital goods, which range from music to entire virtual worlds. NFT markets can be compared to the Amazon of the internet.

Numerous NFT marketplaces exist, and many of them specialize on a particular market or niche. What qualities should you consider before selecting one, and which are the best NFT marketplaces available? What you should know is as follows.

**Here are a few of the most popular NFT markets at the moment.**

**1.OpenSea**

The pioneer in NFTsales is OpenSea. The platform of OpenSea offers a wide variety of digital materials, and registration and browsing are both free. If you wish to make your own NFT, it also features an easy-to-use approach and helps artists and producers (known as ""minting"").

The platform's name is apt given that the marketplace accepts more than 150 different payment tokens. OpenSea is a wonderful place to start if you're looking for an introduction to the NFT universe.

**2. Axie Marketplace**

The online store for the video game Axie Infinity is called Axie Marketplace. Mythical creatures known as Axies can be purchased, trained, and competed against by other players' Axies to obtain rewards. Players can purchase brand-new Axies, complete lands, and other things as NFTs for use in the game on the Axie Marketplace.

The Ethereum blockchain is the foundation for the Axie Infinity coins, also known as Axie Shards. As a result, they are available for purchase and sale on numerous different NFT markets as well as on a few cryptocurrency exchanges, like Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN).

**3. Larva Labs/ CryptoPunks**

The popular CryptoPunks NFT project made Larva Labs famous. Some CryptoPunks have since sold for millions of dollars even though they were initially distributed for free back in 2017. Other digital art initiatives by Larva Labs include Autoglyphs and other Ethereum blockchain-based app development initiatives.

Although the CryptoPunks NFTs from Larva Labs are sold out, they may still be bid on and purchased through a number of external marketplaces. However, Larva Labs' many initiatives are worth keeping an eye on, including the Meebits, which may be directly bid on through the firm's integrated marketplace.

**4. NBA Top Shot Marketplace**

The National Basketball Association and Women's National Basketball Association's entry into the NFT market is called NBA Top Shot. The world's top basketball leagues provide collectible moments (play highlights and video clips) and art for sale on their marketplace.

Using Dapper Labs' Flow blockchain, the NBA created it as a closed market (you can only purchase and sell on Top Shot). Direct purchases on the Top Shot marketplace website are simple to make after signing up. Even a little cash can be used to buy a collectible moment.

**5. Rarible**

Similar to OpenSea, Rarible is a sizable marketplace for all kinds of NFTs. On the platform, any type of artwork, film, collectible, or musical work can be purchased, created, or sold. To buy and sell in the marketplace, you must use Rarible (CRYPTO:RARI), which is Rarible's own token, as opposed to OpenSea. Built on the Ethereum blockchain is Rarible (although artwork can be managed on OpenSea as well using Rarible tokens).

**6. Superare**

SuperRare is creating a marketplace for digital producers in a similar way to Rarible. The website sells artwork, movies, and 3D graphics, but art collectors may also use Ethereum to buy pieces.

Recently, Ethereum-based SuperRare announced its own currency with the same name. To locate and select fresh talent for the market, tokens will be employed. SuperRare NFTs can be purchased and sold on OpenSea just like Rarible NFTs.

**7.Foundation**

SuperRare is creating a [NFT marketplace ](https://www.monkhub.com/us/our-services/blockchain-services/blockchain-nft-marketplace-development)for digital producers in a similar way to Rarible. The website sells artwork, movies, and 3D graphics, but art collectors may also use Ethereum to buy pieces.

Rarible (RARI) Receives a Very Bullish Rating Wednesday: Is it Time to Get on Board?,Rarible,uv7yr6,2022-05-22 06:07:36,9,0.73,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rarible/comments/uv7yr6/rarible_rari_receives_a_very_bullish_rating/,Bollingdk,,"InvestorsObserver gave Rarible (RARI) the token of Rarible NFT Market which is one of the most popular NFT Marketplaces out there after OpenSea that is the trading place of NFTs like Plastiks which is backed by recycling data and Axie Infinity; a strong recommendation on Wednesday. The cryptocurrency is up 27.74 percent to $4.15, while the overall cryptocurrency market is down 3.59 percent.

Rarible has received a Very Bullish rating on the InvestorsObserver Sentiment Score over the last five days. The Sentiment Score assesses Rarible's performance over the previous five days based on volume and price movement. 

The Sentiment Score gives a quick, short-term snapshot of the cryptocurrency's recent performance. This can help both short-term investors looking to ride a rally and long-term investors looking to buy the dip.

Rarible is currently trading near its five-day high of $4.15443696247213. The crypto is 0.11% off its five-day high and is 87.71% higher than its five-day low of $2.21.

Rarible price is currently above resistance. With support set around $3.1 and resistance at $3.43, Rarible is potentially in a volatile position if the rally burns out.

Rarible has traded on low volume recently. This means that today's volume is below its average volume over the past seven days."
Rarible: Expecting $63.53 Ever Again?,Rarible,unwswq,2022-05-12 05:02:05,4,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rarible/comments/unwswq/rarible_expecting_6353_ever_again/,SwapzoneIO,,"According to CoinMarket Cap, RARI is down almost 80% on its all-time high in 2021. However this all-time high happened during a strong bull-market cycle where we saw RARI go from $2 to $45 in a matter of two months. At the same time investors who brought RARI at the start of 2021 are still up over 300%, even as the token continues to trend downwards. 

Analysts have predicted a maximum price for Rarity of $10.33 during 2022. Moreover, in 2030, RARI is speculated to hit a high of $180, putting it four times over all-time high prices and a massive 3000% return from current prices.

Do you believe it's possible for RARI to be close to $100 mark again?

This in-depth guide will answer the question, “What is DeFi 2.0?” It will also explain DeFi 2.0 vs. DeFi 1.0 and describe how to invest in DeFi 2.0, giving you the knowledge you need to capitalize on the latest innovations in [decentralized finance](https://learn.bybit.com/defi/what-is-defi/) (DeFi).

## What Is DeFi 2.0?

**DeFi 2.0 is a collection of decentralized finance projects that aim to improve on the previous efforts of DeFi 1.0. The movement focuses on making improvements in the areas of liquidity, scalability, governance and security.**

Once we’ve answered our initial question and discovered what DeFi 2.0 is, we need to understand why the movement exists. DeFi 2.0 traces its origins to [OlympusDAO](https://www.olympusdao.finance/), a [decentralized autonomous organization](https://learn.bybit.com/glossary/dao/) (DAO) based on the OHM token. This organization manages the control of its signature token through a system of policies, and the protocol is backed by assets held by the associated Olympus Treasury. Launched in May 2021, Olympus demonstrated a new range of possibilities for DeFi. In the months since its release, a slate of similar DAOs and projects have developed, marking the beginning of DeFi 2.0.

## DeFi 2.0 vs. DeFi 1.0

Any investigation of this topic needs to start with the question, “What is DeFi 2.0?” From there, the natural follow-up is, “How is DeFi 2.0 different from. DeFi 1.0?”

While the idea of DeFi 2.0 vs. DeFi 1.0”suggests two separate ideas, it’s worth remembering that they spring from the same general theory. Both DeFi 1.0 and DeFi 2.0 are iterations of a single notion: The idea that blockchains allow for a decentralized finance ecosystem which bypasses traditional centers of financial power.

“DeFi” in general refers to a collection of decentralized applications that use smart contracts and secure oracle networks to conduct finance without intermediaries. DeFi 2.0 remains true to this central premise, but makes adjustments to overcome some of DeFi 1.0’s principal shortcomings.

As crypto enthusiasts flocked to DeFi applications, they couldn’t help but notice considerable limitations. For one thing, liquidity was hard to come by. The fact that providing liquidity required users to lock up their funds led to an undesirable amount of financial rigidity and capital inefficiency. DeFi protocols also had notoriously complicated user interfaces, meaning few beyond experienced crypto traders could navigate the applications. The protocols’ reliance on Ethereum caused further complications, as the blockchain’s increasing popularity produced slower transaction times and higher fees.

When considering DeFi 2.0 vs. DeFi 1.0, you need to remember that DeFi 2.0 represents a concerted effort to overcome some of these central difficulties. While the DeFi ecosystem is still far from perfect, a few key improvements are already apparent. Once you understand them, you’ll be ready to learn how to invest in DeFi 2.0.

### DeFi 2.0 Creates Stronger Connections Between Users

If you’re thinking about what DeFi 2.0 protocols are — and how they’re different from more traditional financial applications — DeFi 2.0 protocols are essentially decentralized financial applications that endeavor to connect users who contribute liquidity. These applications promote the types of horizontal connections that foster lasting relationships. This, in turn, will produce a DeFi ecosystem that’s decentralized but still interconnected.

### DeFi 2.0 Uses Optimized Governance Patterns

Governance is a key issue in any decentralized endeavor, and DeFi 2.0 is based on better administrative solutions. In DeFi 2.0 protocols, community members cooperate to make decisions and create policies. This democratic process allows frameworks to develop without relying on a powerful arbiter.

### DeFi 2.0 Includes User-Friendly Incentive Schemes

Decentralized finance can only survive with liquidity, and DeFi 2.0 projects are employing creative incentive programs to acquire and maintain sufficient capital. Not only do incentives help solve the liquidity problems that plagued DeFi 1.0, but they also foster connections between users, thus helping to produce more cooperative communities.

### DeFi 2.0 Promises a More Sustainable Ecosystem

If there’s one thing you should understand after asking what DeFi 2.0 is, it’s that the new decentralized protocols are being designed with an eye toward sustainability. This is also the key factor in the “DeFi 2.0 vs. DeFi 1.0” discussion. The combination of liquidity, interconnectedness and sound governance should create a decentralized ecosystem that can last. This sustainability will allow DeFi 2.0 projects to gather further momentum, attract more users, and redefine finance on a larger scale.

## DeFi 2.0 Strengths and Use Cases

You can answer the question, “What is DeFi 2.0?” without knowing how the associated protocols operate. A quick overview of DeFi 2.0 vs. DeFi 1.0 is enough to explain the basic idea behind the latest iteration of decentralized finance, but a more in-depth discussion demonstrates exactly how investors can benefit from DeFi 2.0.

There are several features unique to DeFi 2.0 that make the movement a more appealing target for crypto investors. From smart contract insurance to self-repaying loans, these novel ideas lay the groundwork for a sustainable DeFi ecosystem.

### Insurance for Smart Contracts

In the DeFi 2.0 vs. DeFi 1.0 discussion, one of the biggest issues is user-friendliness. DeFi 2.0 protocols often allow investors to take out insurance on their smart contracts. This is a significant source of protection, especially for novice investors.

Many people would love to stake LP tokens in a smart contract but worry that the contract could become compromised. They know that a compromised contract is impossible to rectify on the blockchain, and they lack the technical nous to protect their investments on their own. An insurance policy allows them to stake tokens without any concerns. Not only does this help individual investors, but it also encourages the influx of more capital into the protocol.

### Impermanent Loss Insurance

With DeFi 1.0, users who have locked two tokens into a protocol in order to start liquidity mining could lose out if the price ratio between the two tokens fluctuates. This phenomenon is called [impermanent loss](https://learn.bybit.com/defi/what-is-impermanent-loss/), and it’s among the most distressing features of decentralized finance.

DeFi 2.0 projects are introducing new measures to mitigate this inherent risk. Some protocols use the proceeds from fees to insure users against impermanent loss. They can also mint new coins to make up for losses. All of these policies make DeFi a safer option for crypto investors.

### Self-Repaying Loans

The DeFi 2.0 ecosystem allows for a remarkable financial maneuver in which loans pay for themselves. A lender can provide a user with a loan in exchange for collateral in the form of a small deposit. This deposit is then invested by the lender, who goes on to earn interest. Once the lender has earned the full price of the initial loan, they return the deposit, and the loan recipient ends up not having to repay the loan.

## DeFi 2.0 Risks

Most people who ask, “What is DeFi 2.0?” are also curious about any risks that might be associated with investing in the movement. While this second iteration of DeFi is generally safer than its predecessor, there’s still no guarantee that every investment will prove successful. Even the best DeFi 2.0 projects have inherent drawbacks, and investors should be aware of any potential pitfalls before staking tokens. Once you’ve learned about the main risks, you’ll understand more about how to invest in DeFi 2.0.

### The Continued Threat of Hackers

Crypto investors can’t be completely sure that the smart contracts they’re interacting with won’t be hacked. Before staking tokens, always investigate the project thoroughly. Even after you’ve done your due diligence, a surprising hack could occur. Luckily, insuring your smart contracts can help limit the damage in case of illegal activity.

### Future Government Regulations

As decentralized finance attracts users and more people learn how to invest in DeFi 2.0, governments around the world will become increasingly eager to get involved. Many governments will try to impose regulations on DeFi 2.0 protocols. As an investor, it’s important to recognize that your future activities might be affected by rules and limitations that don’t yet exist. While this concern shouldn’t scare you off from participating altogether, it’s certainly something to keep in mind as you discover how to invest in DeFi 2.0.

### The Volatility of Cryptocurrencies

Decentralized finance can only occur with cryptocurrencies, many of which are remarkably volatile. When prices fluctuate wildly, investors are left dealing with the consequences. Some protocols mitigate this risk by offering users [stablecoins](https://learn.bybit.com/altcoins/what-are-stablecoins-are-they-a-good-investment) to use for transactions. All the same, the inherent volatility of crypto markets will always be a factor in decentralized finance.

## How To Invest in DeFi 2.0

We’ve answered our initial question, “What is DeFi 2.0?” We’ve also learned about DeFi 2.0 vs. DeFi 1.0. Now, it’s time to learn how to invest in DeFi 2.0. Decentralized finance involves several types of maneuvers that may be unfamiliar to crypto newcomers. Once you’ve learned a bit about common investment strategies, you’ll have a better understanding of the general DeFi 2.0 ecosystem.

### Yield Farming

If you were at all familiar with decentralized finance before learning what DeFi 2.0 is, you might have questioned how the new movement deals with yield farming. This mechanism, a key innovation of DeFi 1.0, has become even more useful for investors in the latest installment of decentralized finance.

As with older projects, DeFi 2.0 protocols use yield farming to get liquidity from users. However, they go even farther by letting investors use tokens as collateral for loans. This twist on yield farming makes the protocols a more enticing option for investors.

### Staking

[Staking](https://learn.bybit.com/crypto/what-is-crypto-coins-staking/) is a form of passive income generation as it allows users to become validators for blockchains that operate on a proof-of-stake basis. If you take this route, you can essentially lock your currency on the blockchain and earn block rewards in the process.

### Lending

Self-repaying loans represent wonderful opportunities for lenders and loanees alike. Offering loans in exchange for interest payments is a great way to engage in yield farming within a DeFi 2.0 protocol.

### Liquidity Provision or Liquidity Mining

Liquidity provision gives crypto holders an easy way to profit from their holdings. With this maneuver, holders pass some of their cryptocurrency to a liquidity pool so that users can trade against it. In exchange, the holder who provides the currency receives a fee. These types of simple, win-win transactions allow DeFi 2.0 protocols to attract liquidity while users earn a profit.

### Trading on Decentralized Exchanges

[Decentralized exchanges](https://learn.bybit.com/glossary/dex/) (DEXs) allow users to pursue crypto transactions outside the realm of third-party organizations, such as banks. While some states and countries impose regulations on this type of trading, the decentralized nature of the practice offers considerable freedom. Not only do DEXs often have lower fees, but they also enable margin trading and other appealing types of transactions.

### Participating in DAOs

Anyone asking about DeFi 2.0 is likely to be equally curious about DAOs, the autonomous organizations that provide the basis for most decentralized finance. Investors can join a DAO by purchasing the organization’s token. Once you’ve bought yourself into the community, you should have a say in governance. This direct participation represents a motivation for learning about how to invest in DeFi 2.0.

## Best DeFi 2.0 Projects

If you want to know how to invest in DeFi 2.0, you need to have a basic understanding of the existing projects. While there are too many protocols to list them all, this guide will introduce you to some of the most important undertakings.

### Olympus DAO

If there was a single project you’d heard of when you first wondered about DeFi 2.0, it was probably Olympus DAO. This decentralized reserve currency protocol set new standards in DeFi and became the starting point for DeFi 2.0. Investors can use the project for all sorts of yield farming, from staking to purchasing bonds. The organization is especially famous for its unique, user-friendly bonding model.

### Synapse

[Synapse](https://docs.synapseprotocol.com/) is an automated market maker (AMM) with considerable influence in the DeFi 2.0 ecosystem. Its status as a trustless cross-chain bridge makes it an appealing option for a wide range of crypto investors trading in a variety of currencies.

### Curve Finance

[Curve Finance](https://learn.bybit.com/defi/what-is-curve-finance/) is a DAO with its own exchange, [liquidity pool](https://learn.bybit.com/glossary/liquidity-aggregator-democracy-and-pool/) and stablecoin. It also provides the basis for the associated yield-farming complex [Convex](https://www.convexfinance.com/), which has been constructed on its platform. As a massively popular DEX, Curve Finance is often regarded as the “[Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) for stablecoins” because of its unique pricing formula.

### Rarible

[Rarible ](https://rarible.com/)is a DeFi 2.0 project built around the concept of [non-fungible tokens](https://learn.bybit.com/crypto/what-is-a-non-fungible-token/) (NFTs). It consists of a DAO with its own governance model, allowing for considerable yield generation. Unlike the highly popular NFT marketplace [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), Rarible lets users who are bullish for the platform invest in RARI tokens. RARI tokens give individuals the opportunity to decide the future of Rarible, voting on issues like fee changes and how Rarible’s treasury is spent.

### Alchemix

[Alchemix](https://alchemix.fi/) is a DeFi 2.0 protocol on the cutting edge of the DeFi 2.0 movement. While its simplicity makes it especially user-friendly, its variety of novel features is attracting enthusiastic investors. The protocol offers opportunities like self-repaying loans, DAOs and future yield, all of which make it worthy of consideration for crypto holders.

### MakerDAO

[MakerDAO ](https://makerdao.com/en/)was one of the first giants of decentralized finance, prompting countless people to ask about DeFi 2.0. It’s managed by the holders of its native stablecoin, DAI, a token that’s been pegged to the dollar. This combination of stability and innovation makes MakerDAO intriguing for investors.

## The Bottom Line

For DeFi beginners trying to understand DeFi 2.0, it’s simply a movement that seeks to improve on DeFi 1.0 by freeing up additional liquidity, fostering more connections between users and creating a sustainable financial ecosystem. In considering DeFi 2.0 vs. DeFi 1.0, remember that the latest iteration of decentralized finance represents a major improvement, but it hasn’t been perfected yet. From here, you can employ your newfound understanding of how to invest in DeFi 2.0."

Best NFT Marketplaces,NFTsMarketplace,tqtsgm,2022-03-29 02:49:48,3,1.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/NFTsMarketplace/comments/tqtsgm/best_nft_marketplaces/,genvieve-leite,:marketplace:Marketplace:marketplace:,"If you want to get in on the NFT frenzy, an NFT marketplace is your ticket to buying and selling digital goods ranging from art to music to whole virtual worlds. Consider NFT markets to be the Amazon of the digital world.

There are hundreds of NFT markets, many of which have a special emphasis or expertise. What should you look for when determining which one to utilize, and what are the best NFT markets available? Here's what you should know.

Top ten NFT markets

Here are a few of the [Best websites NFT ](https://nftinformationcenter.com/2021/10/08/best-websites-to-sell-nft-art/)markets available right now.

**1. The OpenSea**

In terms of NFT sales, OpenSea is the market leader. OpenSea's platform hosts a wide range of digital materials, and it's completely free to join up and peruse the broad offers. It also helps artists and makers and includes a simple approach for creating your own NFT (known as ""minting"").

Because the marketplace accepts over 150 different payment tokens, the platform's name is suitable. OpenSea is a wonderful place to start if you're new to the NFT realm.

**Axie Marketplace is number two.**

Axie Marketplace is the online store for Axie Infinity, a video game. Axies are legendary animals that may be purchased, taught, and then challenged against the Axies of other players to receive prizes. Axie Marketplace allows users to purchase new Axies, as well as whole territories and other goods, as NFTs for usage in-game.

The Ethereum network is used to create Axie Infinity tokens (also known as Axie Shards). As a result, they may be purchased and sold on a number of different NFT markets, as well as other cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN).

**3. Larva Laboratories/CryptoPunks**

Larva Labs is primarily known for the widely publicized CryptoPunks NFTproject. They were first distributed for free in 2017, however some CryptoPunks have subsequently sold for millions of dollars. Larva Labs is also working on additional digital art projects, such as Autoglyphs, as well as Ethereum blockchain-based app development.

The CryptoPunks NFTs from Larva Labs are sold out, however, they may be bid on and purchased on several third-party markets. Nonetheless, Larva Labs' numerous initiatives are worth following, particularly the Meebits, which may be bid on straight via the company's built-in marketplace.

**4. NBA Top Shot Exchange**

NBA Top Shot is the National Basketball Association's and Women's National Basketball Association's first step into the realm of NFT. Collectible moments (video clips and play highlights) and art from the world's top basketball leagues may be acquired on its marketplace.

The NBA created it as a closed marketplace (you can only purchase and sell on Top Shot) utilising Dapper Labs' Flow blockchain. Signing up and purchasing straight from the Top Shot marketplace website is simple. Collectibles may be bought for as low as a few dollars.

**5. Rarible**

Rarible, like OpenSea, is a big marketplace for all types of NFTs. On the site, you may buy, sell, or produce many types of art, movies, collectibles, and music. To purchase and sell on the marketplace, you'll need to utilise the marketplace's own token Rarible (CRYPTO:RARI), unlike OpenSea. The Ethereum blockchain serves as the foundation for Rarible (although artwork can be managed on OpenSea as well using Rarible tokens).

The firm has formed alliances with a number of well-known corporations. Yum! Brands' (NYSE:YUM) Taco Bell has posted art on Rarible, while cloud software behemoth Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has just joined with Rarible to help safeguard the work of NFT artists and producers.

**6. SuperRare**

SuperRare, like Rarible, is creating a marketplace for digital producers. The site features art, films, and 3D graphics, but collectors may pay using Ethereum.

SuperRare has announced the launch of its own coin, also called SuperRare, based on the Ethereum network. The tokens will be used to discover and choose fresh talent for the marketplace. SuperRare NFTs, like Rarible, may be purchased and traded on OpenSea.

**7. Foundation**

Foundation.app was created as a straightforward, no-frills method to bid on digital art. Ethereum is used for sales. Since its inception in early 2021, the marketplace has sold more over $100 million in NFTs.

The Foundation community invites artists to the site, and purchasers just need a crypto wallet filled with Ethereum to begin making purchases. If you're looking for a fast and easy method to start generating your own NFTs, Foundation may not be the greatest place to start, but the marketplace offers lots of artwork that can be seen in a simple style.

**8. Nifty Gateway**

Nifty Gateway has supported the sales of some of the most well-known digital artists, including Beeple and singer/songwriter Grimes. It is a platform for art curation that is enabled by the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini (controlled by the Winklevoss twins). NFTs, often known as Nifties, are based on Ethereum.

Nifty Gateway, in addition to being a curated platform, also hosts any NFTs bought, which means the NFTs are not held in your personal wallet but are instead stored for you by Nifty Gateway and Gemini. While this may not be suitable for NFT collectors seeking more flexibility in their art investments, Nifty purchases and sales may also be conducted in fiat money (e.g., US dollars) without first purchasing cryptocurrency.

**9th. Mintable**

Mintable, which is funded by billionaire Mark Cuban, intends to create a comparable open marketplace to OpenSea. You'll need Ethereum to engage in the purchasing and selling of NFTs on Mintable. The platform also allows artists of various sorts (from photographers to musicians) to mint NFTs in order to market their work as a digital asset.

An ambitious NFT collector or creator must first acquire Ethereum from a cryptocurrency exchange, then link their wallet to Mintable to bid and buy on the marketplace.

**Theta Drop is ten.**

Theta is a blockchain platform designed for the internet's decentralised distribution of video and television. Theta Drop, an NFT marketplace, makes its debut in 2021 with digital memorabilia from the World Poker Tour. The World Poker Tour was an early user of ThetaTV, which it now utilises to broadcast video.

Theta makes use of its own blockchain technology. To participate in the Theta Drop NFT marketplace, you must first acquire Theta Token (CRYPTO:THETA). Theta is supported by a number of crypto exchanges, including Binance, and the tokens and NFTs acquired with them may be saved in a crypto wallet as well as Theta's own crypto wallet software."

Starting from January 16, 2022, weekly $RARI distribution for trading NFTs on the Rarible.com marketplace will end as voted unanimously by the Rarible DAO community. By doing so, the DAO is shifting focus to allocating more funds to next-gen web3 projects building on Rarible Protocol and the long term growth of the space.

Chainalysis Reports on Increased Number of Wash Traders on NFT Platforms,DeFiTeller,smp8rq,2022-02-07 07:36:29,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFiTeller/comments/smp8rq/chainalysis_reports_on_increased_number_of_wash/,TobiramaTheSecond,,"*According to a* [*report*](https://go.chainalysis.com/nft-market-report.html) *by the blockchain analysis firm Chainanalysus, the NFT market is massively targeted by wash traders, however most of them turn out to not be profiting.*

Nonfungible tokens (NFT) emerged as one of the biggest trends in the cryptocurrency world in 2021. Chainanalysis has identified a minimum $44.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency sent to ETH smart contracts connected with NFT marketplaces and collections in 2021, growing from 2020's only $106 million.

However, as it usually happens with new technologies, the NFT niche has been exposed to scammers making NFT trading platforms vulnerable against wash traders. Chainanalysis explains the wash trade as a transaction where the seller is on both sides of the trade to artificially increase the value of NFTs. 

Kim Grauer, head of research at Chainalysis, stated that they have developed software, which detects wash traders’ attempts to self-fund their own crypto wallets to buy tokens. Nevertheless, report findings point that in most cases these fraudulent transactions end up being unprofitable due to high gas fees. Particularly, Chainanalysis indentified 152 Ethereum addresses associated with wash traders, which lost $416,984. 

Due to the rise in attacks, different NFT platforms have started to enforce number of measures to increase user safety. For instance the marketplace Rarible has stopped issuing RARI tokens and launched verification systems, while OpenSea has recently introduced its new NFT Security Group, which will focus on creating safety solutions. Meanwhile the crypto experts raise the discussion about the need of regulations in the NFT industry. However, Kim Grauer predicts the rise of NFT related fraudulent activities even with all these solutions and initiatives in place.

Colexion: As the one of Top NFT marketplace,u_ColexionNFT,sbkjec,2022-01-24 06:55:32,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ColexionNFT/comments/sbkjec/colexion_as_the_one_of_top_nft_marketplace/,ColexionNFT,,"From being a lesser valued digital currency to carving and sculpting the economy of the digital era, Cryptocurrency has displayed its potential and articulated its actual efficiency on the globe. The pace of development is endless. The NFTs, on the other hand, saw a remarkable way to the top. These Non Fungible tokens hold unique value and are rare in nature.

Everything around NFTs is digital assets that are put on Blockchain. Technology has been immersed as one of the most disrupting elements to the whole Creator’s Economy. The power is now given to the artist themselves as they can now hold tangible value to their digital asset. With the growing Digital Economy, NFTs are set to take over the world by storm.

NFT marketplaces are the platforms where users can purchase and sell NFTs. With the growing demand for NFTs, the number of marketplaces has also increased. To keep up with the demand and flow, the Marketplace shall be authentic and well versed with the technologies equipped for it. Let us look at some of the leading Marketplaces in the NFT industry.

**Colexion: Best of NFT Marketplace**

[Colexion ](https://colexion.io/)being the best among them, has come out as a rare platform.

The most promising of all NFT marketplaces is Colexion. It excels in every part possible, from trading magnitude to n number celebrities & cricketers being part of Colexion. Everything falls into place flawlessly, making a market for itself. According to current analyses, Colexion has become the biggest NFT Marketplace in Asia. To exhibit considerable growth in the area. One of the most incredible venues for minting NFTs is Colexion.io, and their listing will certainly entice attention and proposals.

A few more attractive aspects of Colexion is that some of the very well-known celebrities are part of them. They are starting off with a first-ever digital museum, which is again something everyone is loving.

Colexion wants to revolutionize the NFT space with its unique Licensed NFT Marketplace, which is also Asia’s Largest Marketplace to buy and sell Licensed NFTs. This is the first time.

Colexion.io also has the option for the users to buy the NFTs via FIAT. This widens the horizons for someone who doesn’t have a crypto wallet or wishes to buy directly from FIAT currency. Colexion wants to sell the NFTs to the masses via their attempt to enter the favorite industries like Bollywood, Sports, and Lifestyle NFTs to the audience.

The metaverse will let individuals showcase digital art and property records, and NFTs will permit them to set an outlay on that content with evidence of ownership. While NFTs utilize the exact blockchain technology that cryptocurrencies use, they’re not a currency themselves. Each NFT is linked to a specific entity.

**Rarible**

It’s a community-owned NFT marketplace that operates the ERC-20 RARI token as its “right” token. Rarible compensations active outlet users with RARI tokens, which they can buy or sell on the NFT marketplace. When it reaches marketing expenses, it’s Gas fees + 2.5% marketplace expenditure.

**Nifty Gateway**

Nifty Gateway is an NFT marketplace that utilizes drops to allocate collections from notable artists. These displays are only available for a fixed period.

On this NFT platform, you may notice a timer that indicates when the subsequent drop will occur. The royalty cost that artists will bear on secondary sales is entirely up to them, and each secondary sale yields a 20% commission + 30 cents for this NFT platform.

**Decentraland**

Decentraland is an entirely decentralized virtual atmosphere where you may create and profit from your own and create entities. Wearables, estates, names, and additional digital aids are available on this NFT marketplace. In Decentraland, you may buy and sell virtual lands, customize them, and keep them in an Ethereum-based smart agreement.

Decentraland took off with a major success in the year 2021, with brands like H&M and Samsung showcasing their projects inside the virtual reality environment or Metaspace. The digital property transformation for the NFT world has just begun and still has a long way to go.

**There are numerous NFT marketplaces to buy these NFTs**

These NFT marketplaces smashed the crypto narrative in just months, smashing a record that had taken years to build over decades. Individuals are increasingly inquisitive in developing an NFT platform or holding exclusive NFTs.

The real values of the NFTs are provided with the value propositions attached to them. They are not just pieces of any digital assets. They have some unique value; they are attached from the creator of the celebrity front. The craze of the NFTs is still young and energetic.

Rarible marketcap have a huge potential... some questions.,Rarible,sas3kw,2022-01-23 06:55:53,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rarible/comments/sas3kw/rarible_marketcap_have_a_huge_potential_some/,escomosinoexistiera,,"Looking in this website, [https://www.marketcapof.com/rarible/immutable-x](https://www.marketcapof.com/rarible/immutable-x) only with the Immutable marketcap, Rari token would be over $80. Only over 400M more in marketcap. Not billions. About 9X

Could anyone tell me 2022 roadmap? 

Who are the devs? How many people are on the team? 

 Do they communicate with the community? 

What are the future plans? 

What they are looking to implement in Rari token? 

What is missing in Rarible?

The whitepaper is almost nothing and I know they said now the will have the funds to work in web3 because they stop giving weekly rewards.

With only more millions in the marketcap the Rari token will fly.

How Rarible could reach more millions?"
Weekly Staking Review,Yield_Farming,s906t0,2022-01-20 21:54:07,3,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yield_Farming/comments/s906t0/weekly_staking_review/,Getaroombigboy,Discussion,"About your author: CryptoQuestion is an independent platform providing free resources for the cryptocurrency investor.

Let me start this week’s review with a project that got our attention until we quickly realized it was a scam. It is a lesson for all of us.

The project is called [POLAR](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polar). Recently listed. In fact we discovered it the day it was listed. It claimed to be a fork of [RING](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ring-financial). For every 10 POLAR you purchase you will receive 0.5 POLAR every four hours. My calculator doesn’t have enough digits to calculate the exact APR! They claim to have a team of experts who will find the top 30 staking projects thus maximizing earnings and reducing fees.

The reality is, if this was true these staking projects would have to be ultra high risk with pathetically low liquidity to allow POLAR to pay these levels of returns. But if you got in at a low valuation, which POLAR was at the time, and exited quickly then you could theoretically make a tidy profit. And it is that type of thinking that leads to losses, losses that can be easily avoided.

The reason we say that is because with a little more digging you can work out the projects which are likely scams. Remember over 70% of projects listed on Pancakeswap are scams and this is no exaggeration.

The red flags here were:

1. RING is in fact a rug pull itself.
2. POLAR’s team is selling down their tokens in small chunks on an hourly basis.
3. The team is anonymous.
4. The returns are the type you would find in a Chinese Ponzi.

***With the number of scams circulating now we think it is time to avoid projects which have anonymous teams unless the project has an operating platform with happy users and is NOT in the DeFi space.***

Now onto this week’s review of activity in the staking market.

Pancakeswap saw returns looking more conservative compared to previous weeks. It’s highest APR was 238% from CCAR-BNB. CCAR or CryptoCars is a $12 million NFT project. Not something that looks like the next big thing and best avoided.

Sushi saw the APR on its native token reduce from 12% to 7.84% in the last week. For the level of risk this APR is far too low.

It’s highest yield of 3k% from its farm was from WETH-RARI. Rarible is a popular NFT marketplace. Whilst Rarible has lost market share to OpenSea it is still growing its user base and transaction volume and could be a good bet especially with such an attractive APR.

Talking about high APRs and NFTs, Harvest is offering an APR of 5,376% for the latest NFT marketplace to take on OpenSea, LooksRare (LOOKS). Much of its recent NFT trading volume has been inflated by selling the same NFTs multiple times. That is a sign of a project team only in it for a quick buck

OlympusDAO saw its token price plummet yet again, this time by 47%. However that still doesn’t make it good value in our opinion with its value still 4 times its assets held in its treasury.

AAVE’s top APR of 17k% was from Ampleforth, the digital-asset-protocol for smart commodity-money. If you understand what that means you are a better man than me!

Talking about high APRs and NFTs, Harvest is offering an APR of 5,376% for the latest NFT marketplace to take on OpenSea, LooksRare (LOOKS). Much of its recent NFT trading volume has been inflated by selling the same NFTs multiple times. That is a sign of a project team only in it for a quick buck

OlympusDAO saw its token price plummet yet again, this time by 47%. However that still doesn’t make it good value in our opinion with its value still 4 times its assets held in its treasury.

AAVE’s top APR of 17k% was from Ampleforth, the digital-asset-protocol for smart commodity-money. If you understand what that means you are a better man than me!
