Not very many on this list but ANKR is one of them.

If you’ve been paying attention to the incoming administration there has been a great deal of talk about US crypto companies and strategic reserves. Should any of that rumor come to fruition the coins on this list could potentially explode to mind numbingly stupid highs.

I’ve been holding ANKR for years and it has only grown during a pro longed bear market and now lining itself up with all the right ventures (AI, Depin, etc.) at the foothills of an unprecedented bull run. I’m talking out of control gains and a wild craze for crypto that makes all the other bull runs look foolish.

Is ANKR crucial to the adoption of web3?,Ankrofficial,1i5xebf,2025-01-20 13:38:57,30,0.91,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ankrofficial/comments/1i5xebf/is_ankr_crucial_to_the_adoption_of_web3/,Wilberjay,,"Yes, ANKR can be seen as analogous to the “pickaxe in the gold rush” for Web3 because it provides essential infrastructure that supports the broader ecosystem without being a direct competitor to specific applications. Here’s how ANKR plays a pivotal role in Web3 and why it’s important:

1. Decentralized Infrastructure Provider

ANKR specializes in providing decentralized infrastructure, including decentralized node hosting and access to RPC (Remote Procedure Call) endpoints. These tools are essential for developers and dApps to interact with blockchain networks efficiently. Without such infrastructure, Web3 development would face scalability and accessibility challenges.

2. RPC Services for Multi-Chain Ecosystems

ANKR offers RPC services for many blockchains, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and others. This positions it as a multi-chain enabler, allowing developers to build interoperable applications. As Web3 adoption grows, such cross-chain tools will become increasingly indispensable.

3. Developer-Friendly Tools

ANKR lowers the barrier to entry for Web3 development by providing APIs, SDKs, and one-click node deployment services. These tools allow developers to focus on building innovative applications rather than spending resources on setting up and maintaining blockchain infrastructure.

4. Liquid Staking

ANKR’s liquid staking solutions allow users to earn rewards while keeping their assets liquid. This enhances DeFi functionality by providing staked assets that can be used across various financial products, which could become critical as staking becomes mainstream with Proof-of-Stake blockchains.

5. Scalability for dApps

Web3 applications require reliable, scalable infrastructure to handle user demands. ANKR’s services offer cost-efficient and scalable solutions, helping projects avoid bottlenecks. This is akin to providing the tools to scale operations during a surge in activity, like a gold rush scenario.

6. Web3 Accessibility for Enterprises

ANKR plays a significant role in onboarding enterprises into the Web3 ecosystem. Its easy-to-use infrastructure allows companies to adopt blockchain technology without needing in-depth expertise, fostering mainstream adoption.

The “Pickaxe to the Gold Rush” Analogy

If cryptocurrency and Web3 become mainstream, the demand for underlying infrastructure will surge as developers, enterprises, and users flock to the space. ANKR provides the foundational tools—nodes, APIs, staking solutions, and cross-chain capabilities—that enable this ecosystem to thrive. Like pickaxes during the gold rush, ANKR profits not by being the “gold” itself but by being the indispensable tool everyone needs to mine that “gold.”

Long-Term Potential

As Web3 evolves, ANKR’s success hinges on the following:
	•	Sustained demand for decentralized infrastructure as the backbone of Web3.
	•	Interoperability and scalability solutions to bridge the gaps between blockchains.
	•	Innovation in staking and DeFi products to empower developers and users.

In essence, ANKR is poised to benefit as an enabler of Web3’s growth, making it a critical tool in the ecosystem’s development and expansion. If Web3 truly becomes the new internet paradigm, ANKR’s services will likely remain central to its functioning."

The idea was set in motion back in 2017 and **continues active development to this day**.

>*Unlike your average crypto, with the focus on transactions and smart contracts, ANKR does most of its work in the background*.

>Indeed it is, through the words of ANKR’s clients (**Electroneum**): *“The best RPC provider in the world, and the most reliable connection to Web3 available.”*

**Now what exactly is a RPC (Remote Procedure Call)?**

Imagine you are a developer and you are building an application which needs to do some work on a certain blockchain.

RPC’s allow you to simply, through existing API and using existing connection NODES, access blockchain functionality and data.

Without RPC’s every developer would have to manually establish connections to the blockchain, handle data collection, protocols, compatibility, etc.

*Simplified, RPC’s are like using a “Unity 3D” software to make games.*

*Without it, you would manually have to build a game engine from scratch.*

 Lets compare ANKR to its main competition:

>Infura

>Supports 19 RPC chains

> 

>Tatum

>Supports 35 RPC chains

> 

>Alchemy

>Supports 36 RPC chains

> 

>QuickNode & **ANKR**

>**Supports 60+ chains.**

> 

>GetBlock

>Supports 80 chains

But what is **most important** is that through 2024, the **support for chains has grown from 17 to today's 60**.

Of course ANKR does a lot more than just RPC's.   
With rumours of **NEURA** going live, new chains support (3 already added in 2025) and extended functionality - 2025 is looking to be a strong year for ANKR.

>**The token**, used for the payment of fees on the ANKR blockchain, currently **trades under $0.04** with a market cap of almost $400MIO. **Excelent investment opportunity.**

Not financial advice.

Where is ANKR’s most active community? I’ve been following on Twitter daily since 2021 and sporadically on Reddit. Both seem dry. Also have there been AMA’s recently? I haven’t even seen Chandler speak in years? Why? Is there anyone on the team worth following for alpha? Who they’ve partnered with clearly doesn’t appear to be drawing interest. Lastly people have been begging for token utility. Has there been anything on this front? I think the team has made attempts like sponsoring the Kings and giving coins on Coinbase but now what? What’s the strategy?

First a short intro on RPC's from ChatGPT:

**""**

**What are RPCs in Web3?**

In Web3, **Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)** are how wallets, dApps, tools, and traders interact with blockchain nodes. They let you:

* **Connect** to blockchain networks.
* **Fetch data** like balances, token prices, or transaction history.
* **Send transactions** (e.g., executing trades, transferring tokens).
* **Interact** with smart contracts.

For traders, RPCs power trading bots, price monitoring, and fast execution. For devs, they’re the bridge between apps and blockchains, enabling seamless interaction and building scalable Web3 solutions.

""

# 💡 My Strategy and Considerations

* **No Bitcoin Exposure:** I'm a big fan of Bitcoin but decided not to invest while it's under $50k. Instead, I've focused on altcoins with the intention to sell my holdings in 12 months and then reinvest in Bitcoin. I believe this long-term strategy might help stabilize my portfolio after a period of growth.
* **Amateur Investor:** Being new to crypto, I've adjusted my portfolio multiple times as I learn more about different projects and market trends. My aim is to balance between high-risk altcoins for growth and some stability by holding larger projects like ETH and ADA. However, I'm still getting to know most of the projects in my portfolio.

I would greatly appreciate any advice or insights, especially since I'm still learning about many of the projects I hold.
