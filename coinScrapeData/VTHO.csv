VeThor: A Smart Approach to Blockchain Utility,AllCryptoBets,1i7ztxk,2025-01-23 04:43:25,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllCryptoBets/comments/1i7ztxk/vethor_a_smart_approach_to_blockchain_utility/,AntonietteK,ALTCOIN,"I recently came across VeThor ($VTHO), the energy token behind the VeChainThor blockchain, and I have to admit, it’s an interesting concept. Unlike most blockchains where transaction costs fluctuate with market volatility, VeChain uses a dual-token system. $VTHO handles transaction fees, while VeChain Token, $VET focuses on market value. This separation makes fees more predictable, which is something enterprises would definitely appreciate. Plus, $VTHO is automatically generated just by holding VET, which I think is a nice passive earning mechanism.

What really caught my attention is how accessible $VTHO has become. It’s even available on Bitget, which is great for anyone looking to trade it. With its burning mechanisms and dynamic supply model, it feels like VeThor has a solid approach to managing scalability issues without compromising on cost efficiency.

If scalability and cost predictability are what businesses are after, $VTHO might actually be onto something. Have any of you looked into it? I’d love to hear your thoughts!"

VeThor Token is at the center of this growth, acting as the essential fuel for the VeChainThor blockchain. By facilitating transactions and powering smart contracts, VTHO is vital to the VeChain ecosystem. As VeChain’s adoption grows across industries, the demand for VTHO is set to rise, potentially driving its value higher.

Currently priced at just $0.0072 and listed on top exchanges like Bitget, Binance, Gate, and more, VTHO has already shown impressive growth, with a recent increase of 128.69%. As more businesses integrate VeChain’s technology, the demand for VTHO is expected to soar, pushing its price to new heights.

With the growing real world use cases, such as tracking luxury goods and ensuring food safety, the need for VTHO will only continue to increase. As VeChain’s ecosystem expands, so too will the importance of VTHO. What are your thoughts on the future of VTHO and its potential growth?"

Let's Burn Some Thor,Vechain,1i1dzdv,2025-01-14 14:18:26,73,0.97,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vechain/comments/1i1dzdv/lets_burn_some_thor/,kyledotvet,Discussion,"**TL;DR:** I've launched [Thorhead](https://thorhead.com/). The first NFT project on VeChain minted solely using Thor. The mint price will always only be **100 VTHO**. The goal is to provide education about VeChain in a simple, accessible way, all while burning plenty of Thor.

# The Idea

I've written about why I think VeChain is a great project and solid platform in detail in the past (see [here](https://kyle.vet/blog/key-vechain-differentiators)). But the reality is, most people don't have a place to even begin understanding what sets VeChain apart.

I believe that if we as a community can **educate** those outside of crypto by providing a **clear**, **accessible** mental model on which to build future VeChain understanding, then we will be able to **thrive** in the face of any future financial or regulatory adversity.

# The Vision

The vision for Thorhead is simple: Create NFTs that are as **accessible** as possible, emphasize VeChain platform **education**, and broaden the **gateway** into other VeChain projects.

However, if you've spoken with anyone *not* actively involved in crypto, you know that the barrier to entry is high. For starters, there is the massively negative stigma associated with NFTs. They are seen as ""dumb images"" with ""no intrinsic value"" (i.e. ""You mean those stupid monkey pictures?""). And they're not wrong. The NFT space is littered with thinly-veiled ponzi schemes and projects that are just plain bad. On top of that, blockchain in general gets a bad rap for being affiliated with scams and fraud (three letters: F T X).

So, how do we fight and win the uphill battle that others have lost?

By making something that is **accessible** and **educational**, without taking itself too seriously. Thorhead is *definitely* not beating the ""dumb image"" allegations. In fact, its leaning into it. We're not trying to be the next Bored Ape Yacht Club or CryptoPunks. We're trying to be the first NFT that your technology-indifferent grandpa mints. This is some of the reasoning behind why the mint price is so low at only 100 VeThor. Without the burden of financial investment, that any mint can be a fun, educational experience.

# The Launch

Thorhead officially launched on Jan 4. As far as I know, this is the first and only NFT project on VeChain minting using exclusively VeThor.

The reception has been nothing short of incredible. Over 1,500 Thorhead NFTs have been minted and thousands of VeThor have been burned in the process. There is no limit to the number of Thorheads that can be minted, and the project will continue to mint Thorheads as long as there is VeThor to burn.

But this is just the beginning.

Thorhead are now indexed on [VeChainStats](https://vechainstats.com/nft/thorheads/1/) as well as being listed on [World of V](https://worldofv.art/collection/Thorhead) so I'm excited to see what the open market does with it.

# The Future

With the goal of **accessiblity** and **education** in mind, future project expansions and collaborations seem inevitable. The ability to upgrade your Thorhead by burning other Thorheads, sponsoring all transactions for those that have collected a certain number of Thorheads, and integrations with VeBetterDAO to increase accessibility are all up for consideration based on community sentiment and feedback.

Accompanying these expansions will be a continued focus on education. The goal is to provide a clear, accessible mental model for understanding VeChain and blockchain technology. This will be done through a series of blog posts, videos, and other educational content that will be released in the near future.

If you've made it this far, I hope you'll join me on this journey. Check out the [dApp](https://thorhead.com/), mint your first Thorhead, and let me know your thoughts in the comments below! Thanks!"
VeChain: Revolutionizing Supply Chain Management ,TradingElite,1hly04x,2024-12-25 05:00:30,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingElite/comments/1hly04x/vechain_revolutionizing_supply_chain_management/,Maylights,,"VeChain (VET) is a blockchain platform designed to optimize and revolutionize supply chain management and business processes. Launched in 2015, VeChain combines blockchain technology with real-world applications to create transparent, efficient, and secure systems for tracking goods and services across industries. By focusing on enterprise solutions, VeChain has positioned itself as a key player in bridging the gap between blockchain technology and traditional business practices.

**What is VeChain?**

VeChain was initially conceived as a tool to track luxury goods, ensuring their authenticity and preventing counterfeiting. Over time, it evolved into a versatile platform capable of serving various industries, including retail, healthcare, logistics, and food safety.

At its core, VeChain enables businesses to record and verify information about products throughout their lifecycle, from production to delivery. Using blockchain technology, the platform ensures data immutability, enhancing transparency and trust between stakeholders.

**How VeChain Works**

VeChain operates on a dual-token system:

1. VET (VeChain Token)VET is the platform's main cryptocurrency, used for value transfer and staking.
2. VTHO (VeThor Token)VTHO is generated by holding VET and is used to pay for transaction fees on the network.

VeChain utilizes a Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism, which relies on a set of authorized nodes to validate transactions. This approach ensures efficiency and scalability while maintaining a high level of security.

**Key Features of VeChain**

1. Supply Chain TrackingVeChain uses IoT devices such as RFID tags and sensors to track products in real-time. This information is recorded on the blockchain, allowing stakeholders to verify a product's origin, quality, and journey.
2. Immutable DataThe data stored on VeChain's blockchain cannot be altered, providing a reliable and tamper-proof record for businesses and consumers.
3. Smart ContractsVeChain supports smart contracts, enabling automated processes and agreements between parties without the need for intermediaries.
4. Dual-Token SystemThe separation of VET and VTHO ensures predictable transaction costs, making it easier for businesses to budget for blockchain integration.

**Industries Utilizing VeChain**

1. Retail and Luxury GoodsVeChain helps combat counterfeiting by providing digital proof of authenticity for high-value items like designer handbags, watches, and wine.
2. Food SafetyThe platform tracks food products from farm to table, ensuring quality control and reducing the risk of contamination.
3. HealthcareVeChain is used to verify the authenticity of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, reducing fraud and ensuring patient safety.
4. LogisticsVeChain streamlines logistics by providing transparent and real-time tracking of goods in transit, reducing inefficiencies and costs.
5. SustainabilityCompanies use VeChain to track carbon emissions and demonstrate their commitment to sustainable practices.

**Advantages of VeChain**

\- Enterprise Focus

VeChain is tailored to meet the specific needs of businesses, offering practical solutions for complex supply chain challenges.

\- Scalability and Efficiency

The PoA consensus mechanism ensures fast and low-cost transactions, making the platform suitable for large-scale operations.

\- Partnerships

VeChain has established partnerships with industry giants like Walmart China, BMW, and Deloitte, showcasing its credibility and real-world applications.

**Challenges for VeChain**

While VeChain has made significant strides, it faces competition from other blockchain projects focused on supply chain management. Additionally, the adoption of blockchain technology in traditional industries is still in its early stages, requiring time and education for widespread implementation.

**The Future of VeChain**

As blockchain adoption grows, VeChain is poised to become a cornerstone in supply chain management. Its ability to provide transparent and efficient solutions to complex logistical problems gives it a competitive edge. Moreover, VeChain's ongoing development and strategic partnerships suggest a promising future for the platform.

**VeChain and TradingView**

For those interested in tracking the price movements and market performance of VET, TradingView ([Premium for Free](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingViewFree/comments/1hobjs6/tradingview_premium_ultimate_package_update/)) offers a comprehensive set of tools for technical analysis and charting. By monitoring VeChain on TradingView, traders and investors can gain insights into market trends, set alerts for price changes, and make informed decisions about their investments.

VeChain represents a powerful application of blockchain technology, bridging the digital and physical worlds. Its focus on real-world use cases and strong partnerships position it as a leader in blockchain-based business solutions. Whether you're a business looking to enhance your supply chain or an investor seeking the next big thing, VeChain is worth exploring."

Section IV.M.2.a.lxxv: VeThor (VTHO)  
  
Trend Following Analysis of VeThor Token (VTHO) in Cryptocurrency Markets  
  
Abstract  
  
VeThor Token (VTHO), integral to the VeChainThor blockchain, serves as a pivotal case study for trend following strategies within the volatile cryptocurrency market. This analysis delves into VTHO's price dynamics, focusing on its historical performance, technical indicators, and market sentiment as reflected in real-time data and social media insights from X. Over the past year, VTHO has exhibited significant volatility, with a notable peak performance in 2021 and a substantial decline in 2018, highlighting its susceptibility to broader market trends and specific blockchain developments. The application of trend following strategies on VTHO involves analyzing moving averages, particularly the 200-day SMA, alongside volume metrics and sentiment analysis from X posts. This approach aims to capture momentum shifts effectively, leveraging VTHO's role as the fuel for transactions on VeChainThor, which influences its utility and demand. The abstract encapsulates a comprehensive review of VTHO's market behavior, setting the stage for an in-depth exploration of how trend following can navigate the complexities of cryptocurrency investments, focusing on VTHO's unique position within the blockchain ecosystem.

Seeking Reliable Methods to Sell VET/VTHO on Decentralized Exchanges,Vechain,1dsoppf,2024-07-01 05:23:59,12,0.88,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vechain/comments/1dsoppf/seeking_reliable_methods_to_sell_vetvtho_on/,jos_ayy,Discussion,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for advice on the best decentralized methods to sell VeChain (VET) and VeThor (VTHO) without moving my assets to a centralized US exchange. I prefer to keep everything on my Ledger for security reasons and would like to convert my holdings to Bitcoin (BTC) before considering any transfer to centralized platforms.

What I’ve Considered So Far:

	1.	Vexchange: I know Vexchange is a reputable DEX within the VeChain ecosystem, but it doesn’t support direct VET to BTC trades.
	2.	Cross-Chain Bridging: I’m considering using a bridge to convert VET to wrapped VET (wVET) on Ethereum, and then using an Ethereum-based DEX (like Uniswap or 1inch) to swap wVET for WBTC. Does anyone have experience with bridge.vet or other reliable bridging services?
	3.	Using wVET on DEXs: After bridging, I plan to use DEXs like Uniswap or 1inch to trade wVET for WBTC. Are there any other DEXs or methods I should consider?

Key Requirements:

	•	Security: I want to ensure my funds stay secure and under my control on Ledger.
	•	Reliability: I’m looking for methods that have been tested and proven reliable by the community.
	•	Decentralization: Prefer to avoid centralized exchanges until I have BTC.

I’d appreciate any insights or suggestions from those who have navigated similar processes. Specific steps, platforms used, and any potential pitfalls to watch out for would be incredibly helpful!

Thanks in advance!"
What blockchain is vechain on?,cryptoQandA,1dayyck,2024-06-08 05:22:06,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoQandA/comments/1dayyck/what_blockchain_is_vechain_on/,maxikaz19,,"VeChain operates on its own blockchain called VeChainThor. VeChainThor is a public blockchain designed specifically to enhance supply chain and business processes. Unlike many other blockchain platforms that aim to provide a broad range of functionalities, VeChainThor focuses on creating efficient and transparent supply chain logistics, making it a unique player in the blockchain ecosystem.

VeChainThor utilizes a dual-token system to manage and create value within its ecosystem. The primary token, VET, is used to transfer value across the network, while the secondary token, VTHO, is used to pay for transaction fees and smart contract execution, ensuring that the network operates smoothly and cost-effectively. This separation of value transfer and transaction fees helps maintain stability and predictability in the cost of using the network.

One of the standout features of VeChainThor is its governance model. VeChain employs a Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism, which allows for efficient and low-latency block generation. This model assigns a certain number of trusted nodes, known as Authority Masternodes, the responsibility of validating transactions and securing the network. This approach ensures that the blockchain remains both decentralized and efficient.

VeChain has also forged numerous partnerships with leading companies across various industries, including logistics, automotive, and luxury goods. These partnerships leverage VeChain's blockchain technology to enhance transparency, traceability, and efficiency in supply chain operations.

In summary, VeChain operates on the VeChainThor blockchain, a platform specifically tailored to improve business and supply chain operations through innovative blockchain solutions.

1. How does the keystone 3 pro/OKX integration work?  Are all cryptos supported by OKX automatically supported by the keystone 3 pro, or does the keystone 3 pro have to explicitly support a particular network/crypto before you can send/receive it with OKX?

2. Is VET(VECHAIN)/VeChainThor network supported by Keystone 3 Pro?  If not when?

From what I have read OKX supports VET on the Binance Smart Chain, but you need to be on the VechainThor network in order to generate VTHO rewards.

I am currently managing my VET with my ledger and generating VTHO rewards on the VeChainThor network using the VECHAIN VeWorld app linked to my ledger and would like to do the same with the keystone 3 pro.

Sorry for the newbie questions, but I could not find any answers to these questions when I searched the KeystoneWallet reddit :/"

Invitation to Audit and Improve My Solidity Smart Contract!,SoliditySecurity,1b1ui2b,2024-02-27 21:22:21,3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoliditySecurity/comments/1b1ui2b/invitation_to_audit_and_improve_my_solidity_smart/,ImmediateAgent5189,,"Hey everyone!

I'm excited to share with you my latest Solidity smart contract, designed to facilitate automatic swaps between VTHO and VET tokens on the VeChain network. However, before deploying it into production, I'd like to invite all of you to audit the code and provide your valuable feedback.

**Context:**  
VeChain operates as an EVM-compatible network with a unique two-token model:

* **VTHO**: An ERC20 token primarily used as gas.
* **VET**: The native token, which generates VTHO at a consistent rate of 5\*10\^-8 VTHO per VET per block when held in an account or contract.

**Idea:**  
The protocol aims to automate the exchange of generated VTHO tokens for  additional VET tokens by employing a mathematical approach to determine the ""optimal"" timing for the swap. This optimized timing is calculated  off-chain. When determined, a call to the Trader smart contract  (outlined below) is made to initiate the token swap via a decentralized  exchange (DEX).

I'm particularly interested in your insights on:

1. Code efficiency and optimization.
2. Security vulnerabilities and potential exploits.
3. Clarity and readability of the code and comments.
4. Suggestions for additional features or improvements.

You can find the full source code of the contract here: https://github.com/vearnfi/contracts/blob/main/contracts/Trader.sol.

I've had VeChainThor for the last 2-3 years with a moonbag of $VET that's generating $VTHO.

I also was staked in liquidity pools for [Vexchange.io](https://Vexchange.io) after the $VEX airdrop, which completely fell off.  It was suppose to be the UniSwap for VeChain but now looks like VeWorld is?

Recently installed VeWorld for the Coinbase rewards and just confused at what it is.  

Been out of the VeChain universe for a while but slowly been DCAing back in now its on Coinbase.

## Crypto Markets

**Bitcoin neared two-week high trading above USD$26,500** **on Thursday. The move comes as the world’s largest cryptocurrency continued to move away from a recent three-month low. A strong break might lead to a USD$28,800 target signaling a major upswing. Shares of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain companies have risen as Bitcoin hits a two-week high.**

**Ethereum moved away from Tuesday ‘s six-month low, climbing back above USD$1,600 in the process. This latest rebound has increased the possibility of an upward cross, and should this happen, ETH will be trending closer to USD$1,700.**

**The top 200 altcoins traded mixed, with the winners outnumbering the losers, while most tokens traded within ±3% of Tuesday’s prices. VeThor Token (VTHO) was the standout token of the day with an increase of 57% after it was unexpectedly added to Coinbase. Other notable gainers include Storj (STORJ), Galxe (GAL), and Metal DAO (MTL), which increased 10.9%, 9.1%, and 8.3%, respectively. Astar (ASTR) was the biggest loser with a decline of 7.6%, followed by a loss of 5.5% for Akash Network (AKT) and Ribbon Finance (RBN).**

**“The bulls have stabilized prices now but have much more heavy lifting to do in the near term, to suggest a price uptrend can be started,” Wyckoff said. “The bears still have the overall near-term technical advantage as a price downtrend line remains in place on the daily chart.”**

## Crypto Project News

**Asset Manager Franklin Templeton Joins Race for Spot Bitcoin ETF. According** **to filings submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today, asset management giant Franklin Templeton has filed an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF. The fund, which is named the Franklin Bitcoin ETF, is expected to be listed and traded on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Coinbase Custody Trust Company will serve as the custodian. Following companies including BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco, and more, Franklin Templeton is another asset manager to join the race for a spot in Bitcoin ETF. Previously, the SEC delayed decisions on seven spot Bitcoin ETF applications.**

**PayPal is expanding its cryptocurrency services** **with the introduction of an “off-ramp” feature in addition to its existing “on-ramp” service. This new “off-ramp” service allows cryptocurrency wallet users in the United States to seamlessly convert their digital assets into U.S. dollars, which are then deposited into their PayPal balances. Users can utilize these funds for various financial activities, including shopping, sending money, saving, or transferring to their bank accounts or debit cards. PayPal’s move reflects the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies within mainstream financial services, aiming to make digital assets more accessible and functional for its broad user base.**

**Visa Releases a Report Highlighting Solana’s Technical Advantages for Payment Business.** **Visa has published a research report titled “A deep dive on Solana, a high-performance blockchain network”. The report highlights Solana’s unique technical advantages, including high throughput through parallel processing, low and predictable transaction costs, and high resilience with many nodes and multi-validator clients. These factors collectively create a scalable blockchain platform with compelling value propositions for payments.**

## Regulation

**Three Arrows Co-Founders Zhu Su and Kyle Davies Banned from Business Activities in Singapore.** **Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) today issued prohibition orders against Zhu Su and Kyle Davies, co-founders of Three Arrows Capital. Due to contraventions of the Securities and Futures Act 2001 (SFA) and Securities and Futures (Licensing and Conduct of Business) Regulations (SFR), the duo is prohibited from performing any regulated activity and from taking part in the management of, acting as a director of or becoming a substantial shareholder, of any capital market services firm under the SFA.**

**US Court Allows FTX to Sell Its Crypto Holdings;** **On Wednesday, Judge John Dorsey in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware approved a motion filed by FTX, allowing the exchange to sell, stake, and hedge its crypto holdings to pay back its creditors. According to filings disclosed earlier this week, FTX held a diverse portfolio of crypto assets valued at USD$3.4 billion, including USD$1.16 billion in $SOL, USD$560 million in $BTC, USD$192 million in $ETH, and USD$119 million in $XRP. If FTX were to sell the assets, it would need to notify the U.S. Trustee’s office ten days in advance.** "

## Gold Market

**Gold prices are down and hit multi-week lows in early U.S. trading Thursday, following a batch of U.S. economic data that showed an uptick for producer inflation and solid retail sales. Both reports fall into the camp of the U.S. monetary policy hawks, and that’s bearish for the metals. December gold was last down USD$8.90 at USD$1,923.60.**

**In the short term, headline inflation continues to cool, but core inflation remains stubbornly high, and the Federal Reserve is near its cyclical peak. As the imminence of a US recession recedes, these developments give the Fed the opportunity and the obligation to keep rates higher for longer to fight inflation. This will keep real rates elevated, which combined with the currently strong Dollar creates headwinds capping gold prices below or at USD$2,000 to the end of this year on our estimates. Despite the ongoing summer slump in precious metals markets, gold prices are still up close to 5% for the year.**

**Gold miners’ pain may be bullion investors’ gain. The same forces that threaten to bankrupt mining companies paint a hugely bullish long-term picture for physical precious metals markets. It’s all about supply and demand. When gold and silver bull markets do resume in earnest, shares of well-positioned miners will undoubtedly go up as well. Some may even deliver explosive gains.**

Other notable gainers include Storj (STORJ), Galxe (GAL), and Metal DAO (MTL), which increased 10.9%, 9.1%, and 8.3%, respectively. Astar (ASTR) was the biggest loser with a decline of 7.6%, followed by a loss of 5.5% for Akash Network (AKT) and Ribbon Finance (RBN).**

**“The bulls have stabilized prices now but have much more heavy lifting to do in the near term, to suggest a price uptrend can be started,” Wyckoff said. “The bears still have the overall near-term technical advantage as a price downtrend line remains in place on the daily chart.”**

An Introduction to VeChain- A Renowned Blockchain Supply Chain Solution,BlockchainStartups,16rob61,2023-09-25 06:29:46,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlockchainStartups/comments/16rob61/an_introduction_to_vechain_a_renowned_blockchain/,enterprisblockchain,,"One of the most crucial factors that decide the success of an organization is supply chain management. What if this crucial part of the organization is opaque, and inefficient and restricts the user from tracking the movement of goods? It can result in delays and errors. 

In such a case, Blockchain emerges as a game-changer. This distributed ledger technology is known for its amazing traits such as immutability, transparency, decentralization, and automation. These traits improve supply chain management. However, creating [**Blockchain supply chain solutions**](https://www.antiersolutions.com/blockchain-in-supply-chain-solutions/) from scratch can be challenging. This is where VeCahin comes in.

**What is VeChain?**

VeChain is a Blockchain platform designed to improve the supply chain management of an organization. The existing supply chain infrastructure lacks transparency and traceability, which affects the information flow. VeChain provides a trust-free ecosystem in order to ensure the smooth flow of information. 

**Features of VeChain**

&#x200B;

* **Dual Token Economy**: It consists of two tokens VeChain Token (VET) & VeChainThor Energy (VTHO). The VET is used as a medium of exchange just like other Blockchain use their native currency. On the other hand, the VTHO token facilitates the transactions.
* **TurnKey Software**: This Blockchain supply chain software offers a wide range of turnkey software and hardware solutions that help businesses launch their project at a low cost.
* **Fee Delegation Protocol**: VeChain is also widely popular for its delegation protocol feature that uses smart contracts and gas accounts of the user for managing the gas required to handle the network.

**Conclusion**

VeChain is a transformative Blockchain supply chain solution that has the power to revamp the business processes for the smoother flow of information and high-value data transfer. Avail the [**Blockchain supply chain development**](https://www.antiersolutions.com/blockchain-in-supply-chain-solutions/) services of a reputed company to build software like VeChain. "

1⃣ VeChain was founded in 2015 by Jay Zhang and Sunny Lu. The parent non-profit company, Vechain Foundation, has offices in China, Singapore, the EU, and the United States. The mainnet, called VeChain Thor was launched in 2018, with the VEN ERC20 token being rebranded to VET.

2⃣ VeChain executes an innovative Proof-of-Authority protocol, with 101 master nodes (approved validators with 25M+ VET on their balance) facilitating the generation of the new block. Such mechanism is faster and more scalable than Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake.

3⃣ Did you know? Like some dual-token projects ( r/OntologyNetwork , r/NEO for starters), VeChain also powers the dual-token model with VET mainnet and VTHO transaction token earned by miners for actions on-chain. This is a solid mechanism to stabilize gas prices.

4⃣ The goal of VeChain is to combine DeFi and CeFi by building a balanced network with fast transfers and transparent information flows. With VeChain ToolChain, it functions as a Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform for enterprise clients.

Introduction

Binance is the largest cryptocurrency trading platform in the world.2 Because it offers a robust selection of trading options and features, it is not particularly user-friendly. Investors may experience a steep learning curve with Binance depending on their experience and knowledge. 

Through its desktop or mobile dashboards, Binance offers a wide array of trading features, including an impressive selection of market charts and hundreds of cryptocurrencies. Users can also access a variety of trading options including futures and options, as well as several order types. However, many options and features are not available in the United States and only 65+ of the cryptocurrencies are accessible to U.S. customers.

In addition to its tools and features, Binance also offers a comprehensive learning platform, an NFT platform, and more. The NFT marketplace doesn't appear to be available to U.S. customers yet.

Investing in cryptocurrencies, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and other Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) is highly risky and speculative, and the markets can be extremely volatile. Consult with a qualified professional before making any financial decisions. This article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies nor can the accuracy or timeliness of the information be guaranteed.

Company Overview

Founded in 2017 by software developer Changpeng Zhao, Binance is a decentralized crypto exchange that was originally based in China. 

While Binance is currently the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world by trading volume, it’s also facing regulatory issues in several countries. In the United States, it's [currently under investigation](https://accounts.binance.com/ar/register?ref=425477313) by U.S. authorities on allegations of money laundering and tax offenses. The platform has also been banned in several countries. 

Binance offers hundreds of cryptocurrencies for global users. However, it’s important to note that the global Binance platform is different from its U.S. counterpart, Binance.us, which only offers 65+ cryptocurrencies.

Experienced traders may appreciate the variety Binance offers, but users might find this platform confusing given its many features. Additionally, its ongoing investigations and growing list of regulatory issues are also concerning. 

Cryptocurrencies Available on Binance

Binance has more than 365 cryptocurrencies available for trade on its exchange, but only 65+ are available in the U.S. For international users, it also supports a variety of fiat currencies, including USD, EUR, AUD, GBP, HKD, and INR. Depending on your location, Binance has a wide variety of cryptocurrency pairs depending on your location.

Some of the cryptocurrencies available on Binance U.S. are: Binance Coin (BNB), VeChain (VET), Harmony (ONE), VeThor Token (VTHO), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Matic Network (MATIC). Additionally, Binance supports popular cryptocurrencies including:

&#x200B;

* Dash      (DASH)
* Cosmos      (ATOM)
* Compound      (COMP)
* Bitcoin      (BTC)
* Ethereum      (ETH)
* Litecoin      (LTC)
* Cardano      (ADA)

Trading Experience

Binance offers a variety of trading tools, including real-time charting tools with moving averages and exponential moving averages. Users can place trades through the Binance app, Binance website, or Binance desktop app. 

Traders can also use the Binance platform to access their portfolios and trade history, as well as view the order book and price charts. Additionally, Binance provides various order types such as stop order, limit order, stop-limit order, stop-market order, and trailing stop order. You can also choose different trading views ranging from classic to margin and OTC views. However, many of these features are unavailable in the U.S. including margin trading and some of the order types.

Binance doesn’t have its own dedicated crypto wallet, but it recommends Trust Wallet. Generally, a crypto wallet is a relatively secure place to store your assets.

Fees

Binance’s fees are among the lowest in the industry. While U.S.-based users will pay slightly more on Binance.us, its fees are still lower than what you’d see on other leading platforms. Binance employs a [maker/taker fee structure](https://accounts.binance.com/ar/register?ref=425477313), and fees vary based on trading volume and Binance Coin (BNB) balance. In general, higher volume trades are subject to lower fees. 

Users can also get fee discounts for the following:

&#x200B;

* Using      Binance (BNB) coins in trades 
* Referral      bonuses
* Reaching      very important person (VIP) status by trading a certain amount of assets

Binance users may also be subject to other fees. For a quick look at the different fees associated with various withdrawal and payment types, you can refer to the chart below.

Security

Binance’s security features include two-factor authentication (2FA) via the Google Authenticator app or short message service (SMS), address whitelisting, device management, and the ability to restrict device access. The Binance.us platform also provides FDIC insurance on all U.S. dollar balances. 

While these features can help keep user accounts relatively secure, Binance’s reputation remains a cause for concern. Overall their security offerings are about average for the industry.

Opening a Binance Account

To open a Binance account, follow the steps below:

&#x200B;

* Step 1:      Visit the Binance website
* Step 2:      Click on the “Get Started” button in the top right-hand corner and enter      the required information. The registration process can take a few minutes,      as Binance will verify your account information.
* Step 3:      Enable 2FA
* Step 4:      Link your payment method
* Step 5:      Deposit funds and start trading 

Customer Service

Binance offers three basic options for customer support: submitting a ticket, asking basic questions via chat, and reaching out via Twitter. 

&#x200B;

* To submit      a ticket and receive email assistance, users can fill out a form on the      Binance website.
* Binance      has a Twitter account ([@BinanceHelpDesk](https://accounts.binance.com/ar/register?ref=425477313)) for support and      encourages users to tweet their issues to the company.
* There is      also a chatbox on the bottom right corner of the support screen that can      be accessed on the Binance website.

Customer Satisfaction

Binance averages just 2 out of 5 stars across more than 2,000 Trustpilot reviews. Several complaints revolve around poor customer service and difficulty withdrawing funds. However, even with the difficulties some users face, some feedback is positive. Many Binance users mention a favorable, relatively seamless experience with the platform. 

Account Management

Users can access their Binance dashboard through a desktop browser or downloadable desktop application. It also offers mobile apps for iOS and Android that can be downloaded in the Apple and Google Play stores.

Binance’s dashboard allows you to view charts, marketing trends, your portfolio, and your current and past trades. To manage your payment types, simply navigate to the account page and add any credit/debit cards and bank accounts you’d like to trade with. Making deposits and withdrawals is simple and can be done by navigating to the “Spot Wallet”, selecting the asset you’d like to purchase or withdraw, and following the on-screen instructions.

How Binance Compares to Other Cryptocurrency Companies

Overall, Binance offers a wide range of supported assets and trading options for global traders, and its rates are also some of the lowest in the industry. While there are some positives about the platform, its compliance issues are a cause for concern.

If Binance doesn’t sound like the right option, you may want to consider Coinbase Pro, which is one of its primary competitors.

Binance vs. Coinbase Pro

Binance and Coinbase Pro are the two largest exchanges in the world. They also offer active traders versatility in trading options and assets. Here’s how the two platforms compare.

&#x200B;

* Binance      international supports more cryptocurrencies than Coinbase Pro, however,      Binance U.S. supports fewer cryptocurrencies than Coinbase Pro
* Binance’s      spot trading fees are lower than the maker-taker fees on Coinbase Pro
* Binance      offers a rewards program for holding BUSD on its platform, while Coinbase      Pro offers rewards for staking your digital assets on its platform
* Coinbase      Pro users have access to a native digital wallet, while Binance users do      not
* Coinbase      is generally regarded as one of the most stable, secure cryptocurrency      exchanges, while Binance has run into various issues with security and      compliance

Both Binance and Coinbase Pro offer a sophisticated trading experience. While Binance has generally lower fees and more global trading options, the Binance.US platform is more limited with fewer options than Coinbase Pro, which could make Coinbase Pro a better choice for U.S. investors. Meanwhile, citizens of other countries may feel the opposite is true. 

Additionally, while Binance’s fees are lower, they are also having compliance issues in other countries and are being investigated in the U.S. Coinbase has also run into recent issues with U.S. regulators, though the issues are less about the overall platform and more about its Lend program. Overall, Coinbase is regarded as a more stable, secure platform than Binance.

**FINAL VERDICT**

While Binance is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, the ongoing investigations, and the long list of countries banning or limiting its services are cause for concern. Its platform may also be too complicated for new cryptocurrency investors. 

However, if you’re an experienced global trader who’s eager to explore different tokens and trade options, Binance may have the features you’re looking for. Active traders based in the U.S. may find some opportunity on Binance.US, but it offers fewer supported cryptocurrencies than the global platform. Make sure to do your due diligence and compare platforms before getting started with Binance.

VeChain is a blockchain platform intended to upgrade business tasks and supply chain management. Its goal is to utilize appropriated record innovation to speed up the data stream in these techniques for perplexing supply chains (DLT). On the Vechain platform, there are two unique tokens: [VET Coin](https://timesofcrypto.com/2022/09/26/what-is-a-vet-coin-times-of-crypto/) (VeChain Token) and VeChainThor Energy (VCE) (VTHO).

As per VeChain, its mission is to “make a without trust as well as circulated business environment platform that will permit straightforward data stream, proficient cooperation, yet in addition rapid worth exchanges.” As of now, supply chain information for business processes is compartmentalized in storehouses among numerous stakeholders.

The platform, for instance, can be utilized to follow the quality, stockpiling temperature, legitimacy, transportation medium, and the last conveyance of a medication pack or a liquor bottle from the assembling office to the end client. To accomplish this objective, VeChain utilizes shrewd chips or Radio Frequency ID (RFID) labels as well as sensors that broadcast key data onto the blockchain network, which approved stakeholders can access continuously.

The utilization of sensors permits all item boundaries to be continually checked and any issues to be conveyed back to the important stakeholders. On the off chance that a medication parcel is put away beyond a recommended temperature reach, producers and clients are informed, considering administration upgrades as well as better quality control. Another model is that the [VET Coin ](https://timesofcrypto.com/2022/09/26/what-is-a-vet-coin-times-of-crypto/)permits vehicle proprietors to claim their information and use it to haggle better terms and strategies with their insurance agency.

It additionally means to start to lead the pack in dApps, VeChain-based beginning coin contributions (ICOs), and Web of Things (IoT) delegates.

VeChain has laid out strategic alliances with various organizations over the course of the years to help with accomplishing this goal. An arrangement with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) is one of them, permitting VeChain’s blockchain-controlled answers for be utilized by the client base of the bookkeeping firm to upgrade item check and discernibility. VeChain has likewise teamed up with Renault, fostering a computerized vehicle support book which can’t be altered in a joint effort with Microsoft and Viseo, and is the public authority innovation accomplice for Gui’an, a financial improvement zone of focal Chinese Government.

## The Blockchain Platform of VeChain

All in all, exchanges on VeChain’s blockchain including decentralized applications will utilize VET. It is open for venture to the overall population.

The VTHO token, which represents VeChainThor Energy, is additionally alluded to as VeThor Energy. It powers VeChain exchanges and is equivalent to the expense of completing exchanges on its blockchain. Engineers should spending plan for a particular number of hidden tokens (which are imperceptible to the general population) to complete exchanges for one’s decentralized applications, like Ethereum’s ether as well as NEO’s “gas.” The two-token framework was intended for powerful administration and an anticipated monetary model for decentralized application designers, as per VeChain’s white paper.

On the VeChain blockchain, consensus on exchanges is arrived at by 101 expert hubs. Dissimilar to Bitcoin, this framework requires consistent endorsement from all hubs preceding arriving at consensus on an exchange."

Enter the trade at the bottom of peak 6 of Newtons Wave.

Exit the trade around $0.045

Enjoy 3362% Gains :-)

**NOTE** Do not entry the trade based on the time or day. Stick only to the peaks and troughs of Newtons Wave.

The distance between peaks on the sine waves never change, but the timeline can (the distance it takes to travel between peak can, due to dilution, slow frequency of trades e.t.c)


How Do Sine Waves Precede And Dictate The Price In Trading Markets?

Trading is no mystery. The answer lies in the waves - sine waves.

When Newtons Wave reaches the intersection as shown on the chart, then it will turn.

The date and time at which it will reach the intersection, is dependent on human behavior.

The distance between peaks never changes, but the time it takes to travel to them can. This is based on the frequency of purchases and sales. (Like wind in the sails). The stronger the wind, the quicker the distance will be traveled.

Imagine one big ocean. Made up of lots of big, medium and small waves. That is the trading market.

Price movement (up and down) follows the contours of these sine waves.

The big daddy wave is called newtons wave.

As the tide rolls in you get big swells and waves (linear rises, parabolic rises), the tide rolls out you get (exponential decay, bear down phase).

Sine waves allow you to predict price movement.

Are you using sine waves to trade?

"VEED Is Now LIVE On SafeSwap - Securely Transfer To Ethereum, Polygon and BNB Smart Chain!",vimworld,wxf8h8,2022-08-25 10:08:31,5,0.78,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/vimworld/comments/wxf8h8/veed_is_now_live_on_safeswap_securely_transfer_to/,VIMworldGeek,," 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/jn9pyl1s9vj91.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=db75997dd0f4cd4d752cd96d64a34de80ebe99d7)

&#x200B;

VEED is now live on [**SafeSwap**](https://app.safeswap.io/)!

We’re excited to bring our community the ability to swap VEED to other leading blockchains with SafeSwap, however, we’re aware it can be a bit of a confusing process. Not because of the swapping itself, which is very user-friendly, but because wallets on both receiving and sending blockchains are needed and SafeSwap does not yet include Nufinetes wallet on the VeChain side. Below we share a short video tutorial to show you how to safely transfer your precious VEED to other blockchains.

The VEED contract is the same on all three chains (Ethereum, Polygon, and BNB Smart Chain). That address is: 0x16fdd1edb14ac4012395A0617a682D81595dB486. Bookmark the address to ensure you never incorrectly input it. 

To facilitate swaps from VeChain to other blockchains, VEED is sent to a SafeSwap contract. When VEED is deposited via SafeSwap on VeChainThor, the corresponding amount on the target blockchain is subsequently released to the user’s designated wallet. This ensures neither the overall circulating or the overall maximum circulating supply changes unintentionally. The swap process typically takes less than a minute.

SafeSwap does not yet include Nufinetes compatibility on VeChainThor, however Nufinetes mobile editions can be used via WalletConnect on the Ethereum and BSC networks. Accordingly, users will need to use alternative wallets such as Sync2, Comet (current Comet users, new downloads of Comet are currently in maintenance), or Venly when interacting with SafeSwap on VeChainThor. On other blockchains, users may simply use MetaMask, Venly or other compatible wallets.

**Fees**

Users of the SafeSwap platform will be required to pay fees in addition to the blockchain gas fees incurred by approving and sending tokens. Fees are charged on both the ‘source’ and ‘target’ blockchains of a given transaction. These fees are primarily used by SafeSwap to facilitate transactions, but a certain percentage are accrued by Safe Haven and partly shared with their node holders. Fees can vary over time, with VeChain (VTHO) and BSC (BNB) fees being the most stable. Below is an example of the platform fees taken by SafeSwap on the 1st of August 2022:

The latest fees will be displayed when using SafeSwap.

**How will this affect VEED’s supply?**

VEED tokens have been minted on BSC, Polygon and Ethereum. These tokens will remain locked unless VEED from VeChainThor is used to unlock them, in return being locked on VeChainThor. Therefore, neither the circulating or maximum supply of VEED will be changed by this listing.

**Video tutorial**

# وی چین (VeChain) چیست

**VeChain که در سال ۲۰۱۵ به عنوان بخشی از شرکت Blockchain-as-a-a-Service (BaaS) مستقر در شانگهای، BitSE معرفی شد، یک اکوسیستم تجاری توزیع شده است که از فناوری بلاک چین استفاده می کند.** این به طور خاص برای استفاده توسط مشاغل کوچک و بزرگ طراحی شده است. بلاک چین عمومی VeChain VeChainThor نام دارد. بنیاد Vechain در سنگاپور تأسیس شده است و بر توسعه، حاکمیت و پیشرفت اکوسیستم VeChain نظارت دارد.

**برخی VeChain را یک شرکت بالغ در نظر می گیرند، با بسیاری از برنامه های تجاری در دنیای واقعی در حال حاضر در بلاک چین VeChainThor وجود دارد.** همانطور که VeChain Whitepaper 2.0 بیان می کند، “این راه حل ها فقط تئوری نیستند، آنها راه حل هایی هستند که با بیش از ۷۰۰ شرکت مورد آزمایش و بحث قرار گرفته اند و برای بیش از ۱۰۰ شرکت سطح ثروت پیاده‌سازی شده اند.” به بدنه مادر VeChain گواهی خدمات بلاک چین با رتبه ۵ ستاره از TÜV Saarland، یک نهاد صدور گواهینامه اروپایی، داده شده است.

&#x200B;

### وی چین چگونه کار می کند

**بلاک چین VeChainThor مشابه دیگر پلتفرم های بلاک چین برای استفاده تجاری عمل می کند. کسب و کارها از محصول کاملاً کاربردی Blockchain-as-a-a-Service (BaaS) VeChain به نام ToolChain برای ساخت راه حل های مبتنی بر بلاک چین خود استفاده می کنند.** VeChainThor همچنین از قراردادهای هوشمند پشتیبانی می کند. تراکنش های منفرد در بلاک چین VeChainThor می توانند چندین کار را انجام دهند. علاوه بر این، کاربران برنامه VeChain برای انجام تراکنش ها نیازی به نگه داشتن رمز ارز ندارند. این می تواند به جای آن توسط صاحبان برنامه انجام شود، که می تواند تجربه کاربری را برای کاربر معمولی راحت تر کند.

**بلاک چین VeChainThor از اجماع اثبات اقتدار (PoA) استفاده می کند که قدرت را به گره های خاصی در بلاک چین VeChainThor برای تأیید تراکنش ها تفویض می کند.** این بدان معناست که فقط بلوک‌های تراکنشی را از طریق Masternodes Authority عبور می‌دهد که نیاز به نگه داشتن حداقل ۲۵,۰۰۰,۰۰۰ VET دارند.

### VET و VTHO چیست

**VeChain دو توکن مجزا دارد: VET و VTHO.**

&#x200B;

* VET (VeChain Token) برای تراکنش های مالی در بلاک چین VeChainThor و حدس و گمان بازار استفاده می شود.
* VTHO (VeThor Token) “توکن انرژی” است که برای انجام تراکنش ها در VeChainThor استفاده می شود. صاحبان VET می توانند VTHO را برای استفاده در بلاک چین VeChainThor تولید کنند.

### چرا VeChain مهم است

**VeChain به دلیل پیوندهای عمیق خود با چین قابل توجه است – یک بازار بلاک چین حیاتی که ورود به آن برای شرکت های غیر چینی دشوار است.** دفتر مرکزی این شرکت در سنگاپور است، در حالی که دفتری در شانگهای، سرمایه گذاری شرکت چینی VC FutureCap و مدیر عامل چینی، سانی لو دارد. این پروژه همچنین با چندین نهاد دولتی چین، از جمله اتحاد سلامت حیوانات و ایمنی غذایی چین، مشارکت دارد.

این سازمان همچنین دارای شرکای تجاری بسیاری با راه حل هایی است که از قبل در دنیای واقعی، در بلاک چین VeChainThor وجود دارد. **شرکای دارای راه حل VeChain عبارتند از PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC)، Walmart China، Renault، و Shanghai Waigaoqiao Direct Imported Products**.

# موارد استفاده وی چین

**ایمنی مواد غذایی**  
راه‌حل‌های مبتنی بر بلاک چین می‌تواند به اقتصاد مواد غذایی شفاف‌تر در سراسر جهان منجر شود. دستگاه‌های اینترنت اشیا (IoT) با قابلیت VeChain را می‌توان در سراسر زنجیره تأمین، از جمله روی محصولات، وسایل نقلیه و انبارها مستقر کرد. سپس، داده‌های محیطی و مبتنی بر مکان از این دستگاه‌ها را می‌توان به‌صورت غیرمتمرکز و غیرمتمرکز در بلاک چین VeChainThor بارگذاری، تأیید و ذخیره کرد. راه حل هایی مانند این در حال حاضر برای چندین شرکت از جمله Shenzhen Yuhongtai Foods در حال اجرا هستند.

**ضد جعل**  
جعل در بازار کالاهای لوکس یک مشکل جدی است. با اتصال یک تراشه رمزگذاری شده و سپس استفاده از تراشه برای ثبت و ردیابی تدارکات، انبارداری، نگهداری و فروش مجدد، مالکان می توانند از صحت آن اطمینان حاصل کنند. این برای ردیابی شراب لوکس برای کالاهای وارداتی مستقیم شانگهای Waigaoqiao و در آزمایش اجزای خودروی لوکس رنو استفاده شده است.

**سوابق بهداشتی**  
سیستم‌های سوابق مراقبت‌های بهداشتی بسیار قدیمی هستند. به جای استفاده از سیستم‌های ثبت ناکارآمد و ناامن برای نتایج آزمایشگاهی، این داده‌های ارزشمند را می‌توان در بلاک چین ذخیره کرد و تنها بیماران و سایر طرف‌های مجاز به آن دسترسی دارند. یک برنامه E-HCert مبتنی بر VeChain برای بیماران بیمارستان مدیترانه قبرس و بیمارستان Aretaeio در سال ۲۰۲۱ ارائه خواهد شد.

**ردیابی انتشار کربن**  
این راه حل با کاهش کربن با ردیابی فعالیت های منتشر کننده کربن، به مصرف کنندگان اجازه می دهد تا در یک طرح صرفه جویی در کربن شرکت کنند. هنگامی که دستگاه‌های هوشمند مانند خودروها یا لوازم خانگی نشان می‌دهند که مصرف‌کننده کربن کمتری تولید می‌کند، می‌توانند اعتباراتی را برای استفاده در خدمات انرژی دریافت کنند. BYD، یک برند چینی خودروهای الکتریکی، در حال حاضر از یک راه حل Vechain استفاده می کند.

### نحوه ذخیره VET

**می توانید VET و VTHO و همچنین چندین دارایی رمزنگاری دیگر را در کیف پول سبک رسمی VeChainThor در iOS یا Android ذخیره کنید.** کیف پول رسمی دسکتاپ VeChain Sync است که می تواند با Ledger برای ذخیره سازی کیف پول سرد نیز استفاده شود.  
کیف پول های شخص ثالثی که می توانند VET و VTHO را ذخیره کنند عبارتند از Trust Wallet، Cobo Wallet، Atomic Wallet، Arkane Wallet، MySafeWallet، Guarda Wallet، Ellipal و Exodus.

### نتیجه نهایی

VeChain جاه طلب است و در حال حاضر حضور قدرتمندی در بازار چین دارد. با پروژه های اثبات شده از شرکت های بزرگ که قبلاً روی بلاک چین VeChainThor در حال اجرا هستند، این شرکت نشان داده است که می تواند به کسب و کارها در ایجاد برنامه های کاربردی مفید بلاک چین کمک کند.

I got this information from the coingecko API which is super easy to use and doesn't require membership for basic queries [https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation)

Age is an estimate from the oldest year of ath and atl. There's not an age field otherwise.MCR = Market cap rank

I wonder if there's a way to create a meaningful ""score"" from % from ath and days from ath.

As the posts were really liked back then and since we have gained a lot of new people here on u/Cryptocurrency I thought I post them again :). Hope it is usefull!

(Long but informative read)

**What is VeChain (VET)?**

VeChain is a blockchain built to help make supply chain management simpler. It was originally conceived as a way to determine if a real-life product is fake or not - preventing frauds and knock-offs. Since then its been used by major corporations to help track everything from wine production to car manufacturing.

The way it does that is simple: give each product a unique identity, then use sensors to track what happens at each stage of the supply chain. That way, companies can be sure products are handled correctly, and consumers can verify their purchases are legitimate.

The Blockchain used is PoA: “Proof of Authority (PoA) is a modified form of Proof of Stake (PoS) where instead of stake with the monetary value, a validator’s identity performs the role of stake. In this context, identity means the correspondence between a validator’s personal identification on the platform with officially issued documentation for the same person, i.e. certainty that a validator is exactly who that person represents to be.”

**Who invented VeChain?**

VeChain was founded in 2015 by Sunny Lu, the former CIO of Louis Vuitton China. He combined his expertise in luxury goods with blockchain technology to create an IoT (Internet of Things) application for supply chain management. He remains the CEO of VeChain through a non-profit called the VeChain Foundation.

**How does VeChain work?**

You can look at VeChain in three parts. The real-world tech, the cryptocurrency, and the platform.

* **Real-world tech:** VeChain works by giving physical products a unique identity, usually through RFID (radio frequency identification), QR Codes, or NFC (near-field communication). Sensors record information at every stage of the supply chain, and are recorded and linked to the product's identity. These are sensors that VeChain designs, and are created by manufacturers like Bosch and Qualcomm. Since it uses blockchain technology, the recorded data can\`t be changed. This allows for a truthful record of what conditions were like throughout the supply chain. If anything went wrong, like goods being shipped to the wrong place, the blockchain record will show exactly where the mistake happened.
* **The cryptocurrency:** VeChain originally issued tokens (known as VEN) on Ethereum before it released its own platform in 2018. With this new platform came a rebranding as VeChainThor (known as VET). VET is the payment used in VeChain's system. The more VET a person or enterprise holds, the higher priority when it comes to using the blockchain's resources. VET can also be used to generate a second kind of token, known as VeThor or Thor Power (VTHO), to access the supply chain technology. So a company that wants to use VeChain's tracking for their supply chain has to pay VTHO in order to add more information to the blockchain.
* **The platform:** The platform that is used to do all of this, known as a main-net, can also be used by other blockchain projects to launch their own coin on VeChain's system (in a similar manner to Ethereum). This platform has helped move VeChain on from just supply chain into Dapps.

**What can you do with VeChain?**

VeChain has developed sensor chips for physical products that are uniquely linked to its blockchain platform. The system is exclusively geared for mass enterprise adoption. Its real-world tech has been in use since 2015, when it developed NFC tracking chips to be placed inside handbags for a French luxury brand.

Then in 2016, VeChain applied this tech for the Renault car company to track vehicle history. It keeps track of maintenance, mileage, and anything else that has happened to the car from the time it first hits the road. This unchangeable record can be accessed by used car buyers to give them a complete account of the vehicle - a huge boost to tackle issues like odometer fraud. VeChain has also announced partnerships with BMW and other car companies in Europe and Asia. This technology has applicability in several other industries, and VeChain has hinted at other major collaborations in the works.

VeChain has partnered with Walmart China in order to create the Walmart China Blockchain Traceability Platform that is built on top of the VeChainThor Blockchain. The announcement regarding this platform and collaboration between Walmart China and VeChain was made on June 25.

**Decentralization**

A top comment from u/timidpterodactyl on the original post was 'PoA makes the whole thing semi-centralized. Any plans to move to a consensus completely decentralized?'

As u/*TheHalfTruth* correctly replied ' Nope. This network is not trying to be a decentralized p2p transaction system, for which decentralization is extremely important. For VeChain users, those generally being enterprises, extreme scalability, low costs, and high speed is more important. Many companies likely also probably feel more comfortable knowing that it’s companies like DNV and Deloitte validating their transactions and managing their data, rather than random anonymous people from around the world. This is an important point for people who aren’t blockchain savvy and don’t yet trust the tech, which is the majority of people that VeChain markets itself to. '"
"What coins can be staked with cold storage on Ledger, that don’t require blind signing?",ledgerwallet,tusydy,2022-04-02 16:52:56,1,0.67,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/tusydy/what_coins_can_be_staked_with_cold_storage_on/,cellepo,,"Despite the list below, being the coins that [Ledger advertises for staking](https://www.ledger.com/staking) (which don’t require [blind signing](https://www.ledger.com/academy/cryptos-greatest-weakness-blind-signing-explained)), I also think that VeChain \[VET\] [might](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-hold-your-VeChain-VET-offline-and-still-earn-VTHO) not require blind signing in order to receive its [VeThor \[VTHO\] staking rewards](https://www.vechain.org/) while cold stored on Ledger (*even though it not explicitly being advertised by Ledger for staking*).

* [VeChain has a Ledger native app](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007655934-VeChain-VET), but Ledger doesn’t advertise VET staking.
* However since [VET receives staking rewards](https://support.exodus.com/article/1204-vechain-and-vethor-staking-faq) (as VeThor), via the [VeChain network](https://www.vechain.org/) simply awarding them proportionally to wallet addresses on the network, I [think](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-hold-your-VeChain-VET-offline-and-still-earn-VTHO) blind signing is therefore nevertheless not required in order to receive the VeThor rewards (while the VET is cold stored on Ledger device).
   * [example](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-hold-your-VeChain-VET-offline-and-still-earn-VTHO) of claim that blind signing is not required

**Do you know of any other coin that can be cold stored on Ledger, and Ledger doesn’t advertise for staking, but that coin still has some other mechanism (like VeChain might) to be staked without blind signing (while cold stored)?**

[Ledger advertises for staking](https://www.ledger.com/staking) (note no VeChain):
