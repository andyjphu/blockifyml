Ryzen 5 8600G defective drivers?,AMDHelp,1i9x38h,2025-01-25 16:07:59,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1i9x38h/ryzen_5_8600g_defective_drivers/,codertrad,,"I bought a Ryzen 5 8600G about 1 month ago, the setup is as follows:

Gigabyte B650 M plus Wi - End
Ryzen 5 8600G processor
Ram: 2x8 GB Patriot Viper Venom
MSI MAG 80 plus Bronze 650W power supply

It turns out that since day 1 I have had a lot of problems with the computer, first I got a hypervisor error.

I managed to solve it by updating the bios and deactivating the hypervisor from the bios

To play I install the latest AMD drivers with adrenaline and it works but I quit the game and the computer suddenly turns off or starts making black screens. If I am working or browsing the Internet I must deactivate the AMD drivers from device manager because if I leave them activated after a few minutes the PC freezes and goes black or sometimes a blue screen appears Clock Time out.
 Something like that, I've been reading a lot of forums and apparently it's a very common mistake. I don't know whether to send the processor for warranty or sell it, I don't know, but I'm tired of not being able to use the PC in good condition.
 I must mention that I am happy with the performance, it gives me good FPS in games and it is very stable but the problem is its errors and I think they are the drivers. If anyone can help me I would appreciate it very much. "

Everyone wants to talk about relationships, and what they’re feeling, and if I’m upset with them. 
I think I have some unresolved fear of emotions-I deal with pain by trying to crack a stupid joke or losing myself down an internet rabbit hole. Huge displays of emotion are weird and alien to me. Being around people is fine, I enjoy captive audiences, and I’m not shy. 

But the people I’m closest to can’t  understand why I don’t sleep, or know even when I’m trying to focus and give them my undivided attention, some part of my brain will always be remixing music or creating decision trees, and my idea of showing someone I love them is to fix their computers and send them gigabytes of information about something I know they’re interested in. 

I wish I wasn’t constantly questioning why I love someone or asking them what it is about me that makes them love me. Questioning everything is default mode, any line I see, I’ll try to cross on principle. It’s great for higher states of consciousness, but drives emotion dominant people justifiably insane. 

Am I the only ENTP who lives in a sea of Feelers and knows that no matter how much your FxJ mean to you, you’re just going to do something that makes them feel insecure or unloved? "
Upgrading - Ubiquiti or Omada,HomeNetworking,1i9vzct,2025-01-25 15:19:03,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/1i9vzct/upgrading_ubiquiti_or_omada/,Apprehensive_Hand_94,Advice,"Please help me choose

Live in the US and have a 3500 sq foot home built in 2004 with wired Ethernet to most important rooms (office, bedrooms, great room, TV Room), with small patch box in the garage where the fiber internet comes in. House has 3 stories (basement, main, & second floor). I’ve been running Goggle WiFi Mesh since 2016 with wired backhaul. Also run PiHole for adblocking. We are a total Apple family (computers M1 to M3 and a hackintosh desktop that will be replaced with M4 Studio later this year, phones, IPads). I run Home Assistant from a Raspberry Pi and use Zwave for lighting control.

Looking to upgrade because
	-have never really trusted Google, but it was quick and easy to get good coverage everywhere.
	-want better security overall including separating Main, Guest, and IOT.
	-want better speed (have separate Jellyfin server for computers, iPad’s, 2 TV’s).
	-use Nord Mesh to let me connect from work to my Jellyfin server, but it drops frames a lot and wonder if this would help.

Systems I’m considering
	Ubiquiti
		1 - Cloud Gateway Max
		3 -  Access Points U6 Mesh Pro
		Total Price - $876
		(considering the Dream Machine SE, but don’t currently plan on camera’s and it wouldn’t fit in the small patch box in the garage, so I’d have to install an on wall network frame. I could do that but not sure of the benefit)

	Omada
		1 - ER7412-M2
		1 - Hardware Controller 
		3 - EAP655 Wall Plates (WiFi 6 AX3000)
		Total Price - $814.41

Things I value
		- ease of use/GUI
		- reliability
		- uptime

What would you recommend? What else would I need with either system? I’ve thought about just going with an Asus WiFi mesh system, but i think I’d like being able to upgrade the AP’s as the tech changes and not having to replace everything.

Thanks in advance for your help!

2:18 pm. it's been nearly an hour and I still have not received multiple verification codes requested from Roku and never received the password reset. It is just one of the ways they are always trying to let me know that they are going to hack every server I visit and believe they can do this without impunity.

It is just what I expected. That they are interrupting the entire Roku network as, I have requested multiple verification codes to sign in to my Roku account that have not arrived in my Gmail account. Then I check my internet connection and discover that he has interrupted the Xfinity Wi-FI home network yet again to try to prevent me from sending this Reddit message. All of this is in response to seeing The Bible Documentary identifying them as being the modern day antichrist

Interrupting the YouTube And Roku network to the point that the digital clock remains 1 minute late and started at 12:22 pm because all 22's are supposed to be his birthday on 2 April 1965  calling me his ""anointed bride"".

Then he Closed out the draft to this email and interfered with the Gmail app to prevent the truth from being sent about how they are interrupting the digital clock of the Roku net work in response to seeing documentary of the Bible that exposes them to be the antichrist. The picture was taken at 12:25 PM while the Roku network digital clock is showing at 12:24 PM

This is in response to my watching a Documentary on The Bible that includes the clarification that they have become the integral part of the modern day prophesied-antichrist. The remote control is no longer paired with the Roku channel, in which douglas ""mark"" antichrist sanderson, with help from the us branch computer department, have interfered with the ROKU Network's-digital clock that is now 1 minute behind ever since 12:22 pm and it is now 1:15 pm.

It would be one thing if were just a matter of my remote control, in which the batteries were changed to brand new-out of package- batteries. But they are interfering with the entire Roku network that is still behind by 1 entire minute, in response to seeing The Bible documentary that identifies them as being the enemies Of God's Kingdom, the anitchrist and deliberately persecuting me because I refuse to acknowlege that douglas-""mark""-antichrist sanderson is supposed to be ""the christ"" and I am supposed to be his ""anointed bride""

Planning new home network: Let me know what you think!,HomeNetworking,1i9v8j0,2025-01-25 14:46:02,1,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/1i9v8j0/planning_new_home_network_let_me_know_what_you/,Stunning_Ad3203,,"Hi guys,
I am a bit of a network newb, but I have been scouring the interwebs and reddit for as much info as I can, and I think I have a good plan.  I would love to hear what you guys think or where I may have made any fundamental mistakes.  Thanks in advance, and thanks for all the posts so far, many of them have answered my simple questions!  I feel like I have gone down the rabbit hole and need a sounding board at this point.

Background:  
- My dad is building a new home and has asked me to pull all his Cat6 cables and plan his home network and security camera cables.  Now is the time to pull everything and maybe some extra, so I want to make sure Im not forgetting anything.
- The House is in the country, so shitty internet speeds, so I am not worried about 2.5 or 10 gigabit speeds.  1 gigabit is already overkill.  I will use that to drive hardware purchases where necessary
- 3 Story home (basement, main, top) with detached shop away from the house
- approx 1200 sqr ft per floor, in a '+' layout, with stairwell in the middle. Wood frame construction
- Network input is in basement where I have already installed a 42"" leviton SMC next to the electrical panel to house most of the network gear.  There isn't room for a rack, so no rack mounted gear.
- Usage:  He is not a tech guy.  More or less needs his TVs hooked up, a computer, and wifi.  What I am designing may be overkill, but if I design it right once, as our needs grow, it should be easy to change.

PLAN:
- Modem & router in SMC in basement.  Poe switches in the smc
- 1 POE switch - 8 ports to run Access points and TVs.  1 access point per floor.  1 TV per floor.  Plug straight to router
- 1 Poe switch - 8 ports for security cameras.  plug into media recorder and then router? or other way around?? I dont know on this one.
- 1 Poe switch In shop to run access point and security cameras. Plug into router.
CAT6 Runs:
Basement:  1 to TV, 1 to access point in ceiling, 1 to the shop to connect to switch
Main Floor: 1 to access point, 1 to TV, 1 to deck for outdoor antenna/access point
Top Floor: 1 to access point, 1 to TV/desk
Security Cameras: As needed to camera locations, all feeding to basement (overkill, but easy to run right now.  Could be simplified by moving switch closer to cameras)
Any others I should add??

Network gear: 
- Modem (from ISP) & router TBD:  I have no clue here, but would like to stick with same brands as other gear.  Will likely be driven by the brand and type of switch and Access points I buy.
- Access points: Must be ceiling mount: Was thinking TP Link Deco or EAP610 AX1800 
- POE switches: I have no idea what to look for here.  Any recomendations?  Was going to go unmanaged for simplicity, but could go managed if needed.  Once setup I will not be tweeking it

- Outdoor Access point:  No preference at this point.  Likely based on reviews and price.

If you have read this far, THANK YOU!!!
I hope my plan, while it may be overkill, is on the right track. If I made any glaring mistakes, let me know so I can fix them.

He said that wasn’t even the character he was attracted to when he played that game. I questioned him obviously. It was of course some anime inhuman character. Asked him why she was attractive he said “I don’t know demon girl just like it” 

But then he had this smirk on his face while he said it. But he then turned around and said the reason he smirked was because he thought how sexy I’d be if I wore demon horns. And I was livid. I said “so we were just talking about why you wanted this person and now you’re putting me in their place sexualizing me?” 

Hes like “so you don’t want me to sexualize you?” Like he just kept twisting my words and I became so enraged I couldn’t even convey why I was upset. I’m still angry this morning and can’t even stand to look at him. Everything hurts and I’m tired of it hurting. 

Like I can’t stand knowing he wants me to dress up as some character or thing so he can live out some fantasy of fucking some nonhuman thing. But then he will say “I don’t want you to do anything you don’t want and I love you as you are” but that’s not true is it? 

You’re sitting there wanting me to be something I’m not and then just taking things back and twisting it. Everything hes ever been into now feels disgusting because I know it’s something he discovered with someone on the internet he was jacking off to. 

I feel nauseated that sex in general is hard to enjoy even but I do it because I know not doing it won’t help the relationship! I don’t know where to go from here. I feel disgusted and angry and I don’t know how to process any of this. All I have done all day is cry. He’s gone to work and I’m just here crying my eyes out. "

Looking at which option is the best option to boost internet 50 to 75yrds away from the main router.,wifi,1i9utz2,2025-01-25 14:28:27,1,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9utz2,xMontanaGirlx,,"I recently performed a factory reset and updated the firmware on myTp-Link RE330, as it hadn't been done in 2.5 years.

To improve connectivity, I turned off the 2GHz so my TV would stop connecting to it and instead connect to the 5GHz. I also connected my iPhone to the 5GHz. After turning off my TV, I ran speed tests using three different apps, and I’ll share the results below. Unfortunately, I don’t have access to a computer to test the internet connection that way, so I had to download the TP-Link Tether app instead.

I’m considering switching the cable to a CAT 6. Additionally, I’m looking into getting an outdoor access point (AP), but I need to figure out which models would be compatible with T-Mobile Internet. I also know that I need to get a fiber optic cable and bury it in a conduit or seal it with silicone, as another person suggested."
Clean Windows 11 install on ASRock X870 RS Pro with AMD 9700X fails in install process,buildapc,1i9up61,2025-01-25 14:22:44,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1i9up61/clean_windows_11_install_on_asrock_x870_rs_pro/,catzilla_06790,Build Help,"I am trying to complete a clean install of Windows 11 on an ASRock X870 RS Pro with an AMD 9700X processor, installing onto a new NVME drive. All other drives except the CDROM are disconnected until I get Windows 11 installed.

The install runs for a while then fails with a message stating ''Why did my PC restart? There's a problem that's keeping us from getting your PC ready to use, but we think an update will help get things working again.Here's how to get the update."" Then it essentially tells me to make sure I have a working internet connect and then hit next. I have a working ethernet connection to this computer, no WIFI.

I hit next and the screen flashes a few times then comes back to this same error screen. I repeated the process a few times and the install still failed. Hit reset and had the same problem. I hit power off/on and same problem.

I have updated the bios to the latest non beta, 3.15 and updated the Realtek lan driver to 10.071.0425.2024 which claims to be a Windows 11 driver, although ran I ran it it displayed messages that it was for Windows 10. Maybe the same driver is valid for both Windows 10 and Windows 11.

When I got that message, I hit shift/F10 and got a command prompt. I was able to run 'ping -4 google.com' and 'ping -6 google.com'  and got responses from both, so the ethernet connection is working.

I booted the SSD where the old copy of Windows 10 was installed, and that runs fine, no problem etting to the internet. 

So the problem seems to be somewhere in Windows and not the hardware. The CDROM has a 2024 copyright date, so maybe it has a problem with needing a driver that it can't get from the internet so I need a newer install media.

The other thing I read on the internet it it may have downloaded a bad update (Maybe 24H2 which has had problems) and I need to go to safe mode and uninstall some updates and then try to continue the install.

I'm not sure if these are valid ideas to try or if something else is going on. The computer is about an hour and a half from me so it's not possible for me to just try things until next weekend.

Any suggestions?

Since it's pretty clear this is the end of the line, I'll add to the eulogy.

In its final days DSLR was a relic of a long gone, pre-social media internet and clearly on life support for the better part of a decade. Nevertheless, I can't help but feel a ton of nostalgia and no small amount of sadness now that it's gone.

I was never a prolific poster but my account there was just about 25 years old, dating to early 2000. I visited pretty much weekly throughout those 25 years. I recall first stumbling on it as I desperately searched for any information on when or how I might be able to get broadband internet at my parents' home. I was devouring any computer related print media I could find as early as 1998 and DSLR turbocharged me. 

I have a distinct memory of being bored and distracted in a junior high class and killing time by drawing out a BGP mix for my imaginary ISP, no doubt inspired by what I'd been reading on DSLR. Had things turned out differently I might well have become a network engineer - but telecom is a boom and bust business and life took me in a different direction.

I ended up studying computer science and I'm approaching two decades in software development. I feel DSLR played a huge part in teaching me about computer hardware, networking and IT and I owe so much of my professional success to it.

So long, and thank you."

	•	Energy: By optimizing renewable energy production, grid management, and energy storage, AGI could play a crucial role in achieving energy sustainability.
	•	Manufacturing: AGI-powered automation could streamline production, reduce waste, and enhance supply chain efficiency, making U.S. manufacturing globally competitive.

2. Boosting Economic Growth and Job Creation

While fears of job displacement often dominate discussions about AI, AGI’s implementation has the potential to create new industries and job opportunities. By fostering AGI development, the U.S. can:
	•	Enhance productivity: AGI can augment human capabilities, allowing workers to focus on creative and strategic tasks while routine processes are automated.
	•	Create new sectors: Just as the internet spawned industries like e-commerce and social media, AGI could lead to entirely new sectors, driving economic growth.
	•	Upskill the workforce: Investment in education and training programs can prepare the workforce for the AGI era, ensuring equitable access to high-quality, technology-driven jobs.

3. Strengthening National Security and Global Competitiveness

In an increasingly competitive global landscape, AGI offers the U.S. a strategic advantage in maintaining its technological and economic leadership. Nations like China and the EU are investing heavily in AI research, making it imperative for the U.S. to prioritize AGI development. By leading in AGI, the U.S. can:
	•	Ensure security: AGI can enhance cybersecurity, intelligence analysis, and defense systems, safeguarding the nation against emerging threats.
	•	Maintain global influence: A robust AGI ecosystem can solidify the U.S.’s role as a global technology leader, setting standards for ethical development and deployment.
	•	Drive innovation partnerships: Leadership in AGI can attract global talent and foster international collaborations, further strengthening the U.S. innovation economy.

4. Addressing Ethical and Social Challenges

As with any transformative technology, AGI brings ethical and societal challenges that must be addressed proactively. The U.S. can lead the world in setting standards for the responsible development and deployment of AGI, ensuring that its benefits are widely shared. Key initiatives include:
	•	Equitable access: Policies should ensure that the economic gains from AGI are distributed fairly, reducing inequality and fostering social cohesion.
	•	Transparent governance: Establishing clear ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks will build public trust and minimize risks associated with AGI misuse.
	•	Public-private partnerships: Collaboration between government, academia, and industry can ensure that AGI development aligns with national priorities and public values.

5. Strategic Investments to Realize AGI’s Potential

To fully capitalize on AGI, the U.S. must invest strategically in research, infrastructure, and education. Key actions include:
	•	Funding AGI research: Increased federal funding for AGI research can accelerate advancements while ensuring that breakthroughs serve public interests.
	•	Building infrastructure: High-performance computing facilities, data-sharing frameworks, and secure networks are essential for AGI development and deployment.
	•	Promoting STEM education: Expanding access to STEM education and fostering interdisciplinary research will prepare the next generation of innovators to lead in the AGI era.

Conclusion

The rise of artificial general intelligence presents the United States with a once-in-a-century opportunity to redefine its technological and economic landscape. By embracing AGI strategically and ethically, the U.S. can unlock unparalleled innovation, drive economic growth, and strengthen its position as a global leader. The path forward requires bold investments, collaborative efforts, and a commitment to ensuring that AGI benefits all Americans. If approached thoughtfully, AGI could not only transform the U.S. economy but also create a future where technology uplifts humanity as a whole."

A reminder to never take your next video game or console for granted and demonstrate healthy criticism when things arent perfect.
Pretty much everything you know as a video game today is different to how it was in the beginning besides the single fact a video game is entertaining you.

Consoles or computers were bought to compliment the TV you already owned but now someone will buy a new TV to get the best out of a console.

When i say 'the beginning' i can only talk about my own experiences with video gaming. At 45 years old, and one of a dying breed (almost quite literally) i think I'm somewhat an advocate of the past when it comes to our beloved hobby.

Our interest was born in the mid/late 80s, parents were being drilled with the prospect and eventuality that computers were going to be a staple in their kids lives but along with this came a hefty pricetag that my folks couldn't afford, however we had a family friend who was willing to trade a Commodore 64 (breadbin) for all of our now unwanted Lego.
My bro and i had moved onto G.I Joes and Transformers and now our eyes were set on gaming even though the Commodores purpose as far as our parents were concerned was a tool for learning.

Ofcourse without guidance nor the time it took to teach 'code' without any experience themselves, long story short, our parents conceded to us the use of our new gadget as a means of entertainment, which i think benefited them equally in the end, especially when being grounded was no longer a threat, they knew to throw in the ""no computer"" stipulation so if we wasn't going to be good, we had to be good at it!

By my previous paragraph, if it wasnt already obvious my bro and i fell in love with this new device, and so began our new hobby and all the things that came with it.
Whether that be conversation with like minded friends, the lending and sharing of games and gaming sessions in general or even sometimes tell tale signs of a competitive nature that would later be coined as the ""Console Wars"".
Yes they were a thing even before consoles were the dominant force here in the UK, but that could be a story for another time.

We had just moved to a bigger house and while my brother and i were still young enough to share the same bedroom we set the box room up to play our computer games there, we never had a lot of money as a family so we felt extremely privileged to take advantage of the fact a new colour TV downstairs meant we could keep the 12"" black and white one upstairs for our computer games. 
Mystically, we saw all the colours of the rainbow.
 

PRESS PLAY_

The games were predominantly on cassette tapes, so you would be required to enter a command using the keyboard before pressing ""PLAY"" on the cassette player, I've recently found that a harder thing to explain to people than it once was, as the younger generation have no comprehension of what playing music from a cassette tape is like.
It wasnt automatic like it is the modern age, cartridges and CD's or digital software is ready to go, plug and play if you like but back then we had to tell the C64 what we were doing, almost like asking for permission to use it which sounds ridiculous but less so if you're familiar with the term ""SYNTAX ERROR"".
That was basically you being told you're not allowed to play until you've done your chores, it seemed.

Regardless of this, just because you've pressed 'PLAY' that didnt mean you were ready for any such thing.


NOW LOADING_

Yeh this one has made a comeback, many will be familiar with waiting a few short moments before they can carry on where they left off (we'll get to that later) but when i was a kid? Loading times seemed to last an eternity, even more so for a child whose perception of time was stretched.
A 'quick blast while you wait' didn't exist, more like 'wait a while for a quick blast' as games were considerably shorter many moons ago. (More on that later too)
I think a special mention needs to go out to all the games out there that decided not to load afterall, but there wasn't always a sign the load sequence had failed, the TV told you it was loading, the cassette counter would carry on ticking over and although the noises coming from the TV would worry you now, it was a good sign in those days!
The game could fail like this multiple times before deciding you were finally worthy of it.
Maybe it was sick of you literally winding it up, so now it was our turn to be wound up!
At times you may have a larger game, more recently some may remember having to swap out discs to continue playing, in a scenario like this we would have to turn over the cassette tape, rewind it and press play on the analogue tape deck while another portion of the game loaded.
As long as the game appeared to be loading ok, this wasn't a big deal, you were just happy it was working.

However we were blessed in these 'simpler' more complicated times..


PRESS STOP!_

Quite often as your game was loading you would be serenaded with the somewhat sophisticated sound of 'basic' chip tunes, accompanying an image slowly generated akin to a printer creating an picture on your TV usually of the title card while you waited.
If you were lucky there was sometimes a mini game to play thrown in to keep the boredom at bay, i believe it was Ghostbusters that had Space Invaders available during the loading sequence, it didn't take an 80's child genius to know this minigame was better than the title game and upon pressing 'STOP' you would discover that this little gem was still completely playable while abruptly aborting the title game with no remorse. 
It's MY hobby..
These little gameplay 'demos' were few and far between though, and im not sure there was ever any mention of them in the manual, just a free surprise game, no hype.

Additionally, as great as the music could be from these machines we also had to endure quite crass sound effects, not to mention a thing called 'digitised speech' which were very short bursts of a sampled voice effect that probably used up way too much data than it was worth and sounded a lot like a plastic bag being turned inside out, if you could 'see' digitised speech, television static would be the visual equivalent.
But somehow we still understood it, and the implications of hearing any kind of human voice in a video game was mind-blowing having the capability of raising a review score on the basis of technical prowess alone.
All of this was very much of its time and carried the weight of belonging to a single generation in an era that would only have been accepted by the 80's child.
Our immediate ancestors were the living stereotype this industry was once synonymous with and now ashamed of.
We were neither nerds nor jocks, neither were we noobs or hardcore gamers, we were the center of attention and so was our hobby, we adopted eachother and built the very foundation that would go on to rule the entertainment world, and even as 7 year old kids, we knew it would.
The fine line between complex technical wizardry and a child's play thing had truly been blurred.


ALWAYS READ THE MANUAL_

Stuff that! As a 7 year old boy I've waited a good fraction of my life waiting for this game to load so i can play it, and also as a 7 year old boy i think i already know it all!
But we're all well aware about the lack of manuals in video game boxes these days and some of us being fonder of them than others.
As an older kid, buying a brand new video game or even renting one from the stores would have you poring over the manual on the walk back home, we'll never forget the smell of a fresh instruction booklet and we'll forever be thankful to the universe for never raining on this journey home, like, ever.


HIT FIRE!_

Yes, 'hit fire' indeed.
Translated from Ye Olde Book of Bytes this simply means 'Press Start'.
Ofcourse there were no 'start' buttons on your joystick, just a single button replicated numerous times across your means of control with sometimes one of the buttons being a dummy for aesthetic purposes but usually all placed in symmetry meaning whether you were left or right handed you had a fair crack of the whip, was this a thoughtful inclusion? We will never know, there is a modern day equivalent in the Wiimote, but again im thinking this benefit was purely by default.

Anyway! Finally, this is the first chance to use the controller as up until this point it has been redundant and i swear pratting about with it any sooner sometimes interferred with the loading and could cause the game to crash (a paranoid fantasy that has stuck with me to this day) once this was suspected, we would stick the joystick waaay over there until it was necessary to hold it.
When your game was ready to play you'd sit holding your joystick at the base or stuck it to the table via its four suction caps on the underside, gripping the stick and trigger buttons like an ace fighter pilot.
In practice it was always more comfortable to use the base buttons as opposed to pulling the trigger button, but boy how i so wished that was different back then.
We couldn't enjoy ourselves too much however, i lost count the amount of times my dad would have to disassemble the joystick and solder together the little metal pins or connectors that maintained movement of your sprite.
At some point we did discover that the controller ports on the C64 were the same as Sega consoles and those pads worked fine, yes this was a day and age where proprietary compatibility was only a problem when somebody made it one!


THE GAMES_

We were peers. The industry was around the same age as its demographic and just like a kid seeking acceptance our games strived for validation.
The technology was in its infancy by todays standards but the understanding of what could be considered cool or adult orientated was always there, so we were lured in the same as anyone would be today. 

Robocop by Ocean hit the mark for us as we had seen the movie before we hit double digits and it blew our minds, the game resembled it as best as it could and we wasn't naive to the facts but its all we had, hell it was all there was! 
If only it was as good as the Data East arcade game, but once again i suppose that's a story for another time.
It was one of the games that could've done with a modern day patch or update as a later level was so buggy it was practically impossible to beat, thanks to Youtube i was pleasantly surprised to discover later on in life that every single copy of the game was broken. 
And thats the way it was, no patches, no dlc, no tweets and no means of immediate action to complain about it, an old-fashioned case of 'shut up n put up'.

There was no such thing as saving your progress, granted the games were considerably shorter but the idea of playing a game to progress was a different task all together as each time you turned on your system you would start from scratch, turning off your system may aswell have been a factory reset.
This meant that you would get good, a common phrase thrown about to cheaply now but bares no comparison to titles of yesteryear that required a perfect run start to finish to complete a game.
The predetermined algorithm in which enemies attack, levels scroll and items appeared left little margin for error as you remembered more patterns than your grandma could knit.
I'm not sure exactly when passwords became a thing but the idea of using a 34 digit code to jump to the last level always felt uninspired to me.


'POKES' AND CHEATS_

As old as gaming itself discovering a way to enter a cheat code while the game was paused or during a specific point at the title screen would allow you make the game easier.
I don't recall any 'options' in earlier games, no easy setting or a way to increase your lives but you may have been lucky enough to hear of a 'poke' that would help drastically change your performance ingame. 
To be honest, to see the game bend to your will with these newly found powers was something to behold, it felt like you were breaking the law with zero repercussions, you could be invincible, invisible or float over entire levels, i think the modern day equivalent to these would be considered mods, something the PC community would know all about.
At a later stage a way to cheat became a commodity as various companies would produce peripherals designed to aid you do this very thing, but paying to cheat at the cost of a game wasn't an option for me, nor did i care to spoil the design of the games i loved so much, i suppose in essence there is similarities with these devices and today's format of 'pay to win'.


PHYSICAL INTERNET MONTHLY = 75P_

The games weren't the only thing our hobby was built on. 
Each month various magazines were published dedicated to computer games with various features still covered today by other means whether they be reviews, tips, game maps, interviews, a letters page, computer game related artwork and ofcourse, adverts...
This was our way of gathering information, you wasn't drip fed news on a daily basis on command, we had to anticipate the next issue of our chosen magazine released monthly but if you couldn't afford to you'd borrow your friends copy. 
To put this in perspective, imagine only being able to check the Internet for limited gaming news 12 time's per year, no matter how cheap.
Sometimes there were demo cassettes on the front cover at no extra cost, they just wanted you to buy their publication.
At times like these you would've thought there were no such thing as leaks, but i can think of one example where somebody messed up big time! On the 'B side' of a demo cassette freebie somebody had released an entire copy of their next AAA release without realising, i wish i could remember the game and magazine in question (I'm going to say Indiana Jones?) I think that may have even sank the studio but my memory fails me this time. 
There was nothing quite like the news of an upgrade splashed across the cover of your newest issue, once again the rain holding fire as we made that trek home.

I glad we had the rawness of imperfection, there was so much room for improvement, the Atari ST and Amiga were living proof of it. 
That was to be our next step...


PRESS START!_

But it was never to be, as the dawn of the console had crept upon us. 
A machine created soley for the purpose of playing video games, there was no keyboard, no budget games, no freebies, no loading times, more power, more expense, more quality, more action!

We knew it was coming but it happened so fast...
Even when our perception of time was so stretched...
One evening we turned off our computer not realising it was for the last time. 
We were so busy saying hello to a new wave of fun we didnt even look back to wave goodbye. 
We literally traded our past lives for a new one, ignorant to the fact it was the end of an era. 
Unfortunately, unlike the counter on that hearing aid beige tape deck bless it, you can't just press 'REWIND' and watch the numbers dial back.

I liken this to all the new residential estates being put up around our once rural area, we'd play on the building sites and praise having something to do other than hiking through cowpat ridden fields, playing 'kick the can' or 'Run-outs' and picking wild blackberries for Mum. 
Was it all a dream?


GAMEOVER_

There would eventually come a time when our games wouldn't get chewed up (another saying some younger people wouldn't understand) and the blowing into a cartridge ceased.
But will we one day sooner than we'd like to, perhaps be reminiscing of wiping the smears from a disc or checkin for scratches to reassure ourselves the game was fine only to realise that the simplest and most logical explanation must be that the universe has come to collect the dues it saved all those years ago for a rainy day?

I use WiFi currently and would be willing to switch to ethernet, however it would be nice just to stay on wireless. I have used command prompt (ping -n 100 \*default gateway\*) and isolated the fact that the packet loss is between the motherboard and the router. I doubt that this is a router issue, because every other device connected to that router works fine, which makes me belive there is something wrong with the motherboard. I built this PC myself, and it has a Ryzen 5 5600X, a Gigabyte B550M DS3H UD, a PNY RTX 4060, and a 650w 80+ Bronze Powerspec PSU. I've tried updating internet drivers, Realtek audio drivers, restarting my PC, and checking for windows updates. However, while reseating my antennae to make sure that wasn't the problem, I noticed that one of the little golden WiFi connectors was loose and moved around, while the other one was firm and didn't move at all. They both rotate a little, but I think that's normal. If this turns out to be the problem, I can switch to ethernet.

Is Fighting Online Racism Worth the Toll on Your Mental Health?,ABCDesis,1i9rgba,2025-01-25 12:02:31,60,0.94,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/1i9rgba/is_fighting_online_racism_worth_the_toll_on_your/,hfkel,DISCUSSION,"After decades of being able to hide out around the edges, unfortunately it looks like the racism spotlight has finally been fully directed towards Indians in North America. And this time it's not due to generic xenophobia towards having a different culture or being mistaken for being of a different race. This time, it's very clearly due to being from the country of India. Given the incoming conservative governments in both Canada and America, this is likely going to get worse before it gets better.

However, right now it's mostly limited to dumbasses saying dumbass shit on the internet. Turns out, if you turn your computer off, go outside, and touch grass, the world seems a lot sunnier. This seems to be what one camp of this subreddit thinks. The other camp thinks that if we don't combat this racism, then it'll spread further to the point where it will actually effect real-life harassment and even hate crimes in the near future. Don't get me wrong, I agree that if we do nothing, then it'll get worse. However, I'm just not really sure what ""combating racism on social media"" actually does.

 &nbsp;

Here's a question: **Have you ever won an argument on the internet?** Like, you see someone say something dumb, then you respond to them, and then finally they realize their errors and apologize? Hell no. What happens is you call them an idiot, they call you an idiot, this goes on for a while, and then the conversation ends. Sure, you say, maybe I won't change *their* mind, but maybe I'll change someone else's mind who's on the fence reading our argument.

So here's another question: **Have you ever changed your opinion based on an internet argument you saw?** I'm not talking about like, two people arguing about how to make deviled eggs, I'm talking about heated arguments about serious topics. Have you really been on one side of the aisle, read two people yelling at each other on the internet about some controversial topic, and then hopped over to the other side? Probably not. More likely, you were reading the thread rooting for your guy throughout.

 &nbsp;

I'm not saying that fighting racism where you see it is useless. I'm just asking this: **Is the very low chance that your efforts in combating racism on the internet convinces someone that racism is bad worth the serious mental toll it takes on you by involving yourself in toxic spaces full of dumbasses who insult your identity?** I say this because I used to do this. 

 &nbsp;

Back in 2016 when things really flared up, I went headfirst reading articles and posts on r/ABCDesis saying how terrible things were and went on social media fighting people. As a result, I just became very miserable and had a negative outlook on life. But then I stepped back, and thought ""Are things really that different in my day to day life?"". In real life, I had surrounded myself with intelligent, respectful people and avoided those who weren't, so as a result, my life was basically the same. If I were to surround myself with dumbasses, I'm sure they would say a bunch of dumbass shit to me. I realized that I was essentially forcing myself to interact with a bunch of dumbasses on the internet, and as a result was feeling miserable. Given the fact that there aren't really a lot of intelligent, respectful people on the internet anyway, it's just not really worth investing that much time or energy in any sort of negative online communities or discussions.

 &nbsp;

I'm not trying to make a point here. I'm just telling my story in the hopes that it may cause someone out there to reframe how they view this situation. If other people have different viewpoints, please share."

Here is a good post by another redditor on his feedback:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1i8jln3/i\_am\_among\_the\_first\_people\_to\_gain\_access\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1i8jln3/i_am_among_the_first_people_to_gain_access_to/)

Preface: I have a bachelor's and master's in computer science from an ivy league institution (not bragging) and have worked as a software developer in tech and finance for many years. My opinion is based on my experience learning machine learning and applying them in a business context.

My take on the redditor's feedback?

It more or less proves that OpenAI is playing a poker face with their lack of progress in generative AI - namely transformer-based AI techniques.

Where do we begin?

I don't want to get into the technicals of generative AI as I am not an AI/ML researcher, but my understanding (perhaps simple) is that generative AI is based on processing large datasets, turning them into tokens, training transformer-based models with these tokens, and incorporating reinforcement learning with human feedback (i.e., prompting).

It has made significant progress in what I would call ""efficient encoding"" of publicly available data, largely from the Internet.

A ""virgin"" LLM model like ChatGPT will only respond to you based on information it has been trained on. This point cannot be emphasized enough as many mainstream users don't understand the implications of this.

First, it means it cannot provide you with information it hasn't been trained on. A lot of these ""AI tests"" like coding, math, and domain-specific (MCAT for medicine, LSAT for law) are not that impressive when you consider that it's just regurgitating information from Internet data on these topics.

Second, it also means these models can ""hallucinate."" On hallucination, it is a bad term coined by mainstream users as the models are not really ""hallucinating"" in the human sense. It is purely regurgitating bad information from Internet data on these topics.

Do you see the common thread between these two points?

""Generative AI"" is just regurgitating information from Internet data based on an efficiently encoded model.

That's AI in its current transformer-based state.

It's a very good knowledge database like Wikipedia (ideally the entirety of human knowledge), but it fundamentally has no reasoning or creativity in the human sense.

What has been marketed by Sam Altman and other tech influencers as ""AGI"" is nonsense.

If you believe AGI is simply efficient information encoding, sure go ahead and call it AGI.

But if you believe AGI / superintelligence must have reasoning and creativity, let's be honest and stop using the term AGI.

The Operator project clearly proves this point. The transformer-based engine is very good at performing single steps (like those that can be found on guides online), but fails at multi-step processes that are interconnected.

Why?

Simply because it has no reasoning ability to put step 1 + step 2 to arrive at the next logical step 3.

A common counterargument I hear is ""well, you just need to prompt it better.""

This is where we arrive at another major misunderstanding by mainstream users.

Prompting is based on the idea of ""reinforcing learning with human feedback."" I don't want to get into the details (I'm not even qualified), but my understanding is prompting basically updates the model by putting more ""weight"" into the data that matches what the prompt is suggesting.

Essentially, you are just removing (really deemphasizing) data that doesn't fit with the human prompts.

It's like telling a student that his idea about topic A using idea 1 is wrong and he should focus on using idea 2 to understand topic A.

What is the overall effect of this?

Well, that's just another form of data training.

OpenAI has realized this many years ago, as have any qualified AI/ML researcher, and have started generating new data, no doubt with the help of companies like ScaleAI, using experts in different domains of knowledge.

Does this have a limit?

Not really, as long as these experts are providing new accurate training data not available publicly.

But what is the point?

Well yea, you will expand your model's knowledge database.

But the fundamental promise of what Sam Altman is hiding under the rug is generative AI in its current state has no reasoning or creativity and is nowhere near the AGI capabilities he is promising to the undereducated general population.

Why do this?

Well, I leave that up to you to decide.

I don't know Sam or any other AI influencers' motivations, but I laid out what to my knowledge is the true state of AI's current promise by these influencers.

Do you agree or disagree? I would love to hear your feedback.

Thank you."

I'm getting frustrated and I hope maybe some of you could help me. 

I got a new computer and now when I play team games I lag. It definitely isn't the specs because every part is faster now and from the same brand just newer generation.. It should not be the internet because my cabled connection is exactly the same and I don't have the issue with other games. The mods are I think very similar? but not sure if it could be the mods? I play with enhanced graphics pack off. (also previous pc). 

  
Anybody got an idea what it could be?"

7. **Endless Creativity**: Allows for quick experimentation with different design ideas. 
8. **Learning Tool**: Can help users understand design principles through practical application. 

# Cons:

2. **Dependency on AI**: May lead to over-reliance on AI, potentially limiting the development of traditional design skills. 
3. **Limited Control**: For very specific or complex designs, the AI might not provide the level of fine-tuned control that professional design software offers. 
4. **Potential for Generic Designs**: If not used creatively, there's a risk of producing designs that lack uniqueness. 
5. **Internet Dependent**: Requires a stable internet connection to function. 
6. **Ethical Considerations**: As with all AI tools, there are ongoing discussions about the ethical implications of AI-generated content. 
7. **Subscription Cost**: While cost-effective compared to hiring designers, the ongoing subscription cost might be a consideration for some users. 
8. **Copyright Concerns**: Users need to be aware of potential copyright issues when modifying existing images. 

Despite these potential drawbacks, the pros of Phedra AI far outweigh the cons for most users, especially those who aren't professional designers. It offers a level of accessibility and efficiency in design that was previously unattainable for many.

How feasible is gutting a laptop and replacing its guts with third-party hardware?,diyelectronics,1i9qvst,2025-01-25 11:37:56,0,0.43,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/diyelectronics/comments/1i9qvst/how_feasible_is_gutting_a_laptop_and_replacing/,tsar_David_V,Question,"So I have this old laptop lying around. I needed a laptop on short notice regardless of quality so I got the cheapest I could find new. It came with 4GB RAM and an intel Celeron CPU which I would describe as ""technically functional"" as the computer does boot, however for whatever reason it stopped recognizing its SSD months ago. Thankfully I've since upgraded, but I'm hesitant to throw the laptop away.

You see, I've grown weirdly attached to this shit laptop, for as poorly as it did run it kept my head above water in my studies for a good year or so before giving up. Now, I have basically no experience with computer engineering or electrical engineering, or whichever skillset one might need to repair a defective laptop. In spite of that, I've been mulling over an idea:

I would like to buy spare parts from older gaming laptops online (mainboard/motherboard, SSD, GPU if applicable etc) and replace this current laptop's innards with something I could use for development and low-to-mid-spec gaming. It sounds (to me) like an interesting project and buying parts off old laptops is holistically cheaper than buying a new laptop with a similar level of performance. I'm aware of potential compatibility issues, both with the individual parts' architectures and with things like the BIOS, but I am working with that in mind.

My question is: How (physically) difficult is it to change around laptop parts, generally speaking? Should I expect soldering to be involved? How feasible is it for someone with no prior experience to execute this task successfully? I've already opened the laptop up before and for the most part the switching around of parts seemed as simple as doing it on a desktop PC (which I have dabbled in before) but nearly every article I read about it on the internet and every video I watch on YouTube claims that custom-building a laptop like what I'm trying to do is basically impossible. What am I missing?


Quick Edit: will provide further details if it helps, I've kept the details on the brand of laptop and specific specs kinda vague but I doubt they're extremely relevant to the question."

"Why we must accept credible whistle-blower testimonies 100%, regardless of our views or beliefs! By using  Disclosure facts & information we can simplify the UAP topic to help ourselves.  How do we protect Disclosure knowledge during  transition of society towards accepting the new NHI reality?",UFOB,1i9qsb9,2025-01-25 11:33:35,15,0.74,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOB/comments/1i9qsb9/why_we_must_accept_credible_whistleblower/,AAAStarTrader,Discussion,"Following on from my recent post on how we should transition through Disclosure as a community.  
Here in an even longer post (too long in fact, so apologies im advance!), are a few significant Disclosure issues we need to address regarding: credible and verified whistle-blowers and believimg their testimonies, how we can use their information to make life easier for ourselves, and something to think about regarding how to manage the steadily increasing Disclosure knowledge that needs to be protected as ""reference information"" until society transitions into a state where all our institutions, organisations, bodies, etc have accepted the NHI reality and can be trusted to protect UAP/NHI related information from influential deniers and disinformation agents,  if they still are a problem at that time. 

>>>Believing whistle-blowers 100%<<<

It is our collective poor behaviour in  the UAP community,  which needs to change if we are to understand the truth behind the LegacyProgram cover-up. It is illustrated in the Vegas bombing event on 1st Jan. The Vegas whistle-blower stated that China and US have anti-gravity technology and China is using it as a  ""show of  force"" in NJ.  

However the majority, including many in this community, tried to dismiss it because they somehow know better than the special forces operative who had a USAP UAP clearance and was in an excellent position to know!  Even Coulthart dismissed it, without objectively assessing that the explanation given fits perfectly with eyewitness testimonies and would explain the majority of the many strange facts surrounding the NJ incident. 

My point is, that's is absolutely the wrong way to deal with challenging new information. That is difficult to accept or understand. It is not professional nor scientific nor objective. That very brave man gave his life and wanted to ensure the truth was known, and wanted a very serious  national security threat made public. We must take whistle-blowers seriously and be humble in the face of our ignorance. Just because people, who do not have the classified 1st hand experience and are not in a position to know about new information/situations/events, cannot come to accept the facts as stated by credible people telling them straight, does not make these difficult to process disclosures any less true. 

The FBI in a press conference confirmed that email was legitimate, but refused to discuss it in public which is very telling. He was an outstanding military professional stated directly from people who knew him. He was still in active service. Therefore very unlikely to be seriously mentally unstable. 

Reflect on how the media focused on an unstable story, break up of his marriage, etc based on a separate ""manifesto"" ranting about values and politics, and wrote off the event as a tragic mental health issue. How do we know that other manifesto was not hoaxed? Where was it found and can they confirm Berg sent it. Because the style of writing doesn't appear to match the whistle-blower email, 
although need to analyse further. Did he really send that emotional ""manifesto"" about lost comrades at same time as stating soberly that he was not ""under duress"" and raising earth shattering accusations of a serious national threat from China and war crimes in Afghanistan. Ok, he did appear to kill himself, so maybe grief for his comrades and the need to expose serious whistle-blower information drove him to take his life. Or maybe he thought he was a marked man anyway because of Disclosure (as he stated he was being tracked), so perhaps he did this on his terms. 

For both revelations he appears to be a 1st hand witness. Therefore the Vegas case should remain open and we should believe the information unless there is clear evidence to the contrary that demonstrates that it is false in some way.  Only thing is one of the DEA names mentioned in the email who was involved in Afghanistan, is still active duty and his name had to be redacted by Shaun Ryan to avoid a potential deadly compromise of his identity. It seems very unlikely that this and other verifiable information would appear in some made up email. He identified his first car in that email and sent it the day before he bombed Vegas. Verified by the FBI aa coming from his account. This has no evidence of a hoax and lots of evidence it is real and very specific about the facts exposed. Afghanistan checks out because the UN made a statement at the time 2019 about civilisation casualties that occurred as part of Berg's mission there. Plus a news article from 2019 referring to high casualties. So that part of the email is already corroborated along with the DEA agent who worked on the same mission. Hence why would that look like a solid whistle-blower exposé, and the anti-gravity testimony be incorrect? That does not make sense. We believe one part of his testimony but not the other, because...reasons? We don't accept the idea China has anti-gravity technology and is creating a ""show of force"" to intimidate the US government and the Pentagon, because people are so arrogant they forget the world is almost at war. We are on the edge of global war right now. China and Russia are sabotaging power cables and Internet communications in NATO countries. UK had ""dr0ne"" incursions which it tried to cover-up and dismiss, whilst invoking 2 emergency COBRA meetings, which are only for urgent national security threats or matters. Russia media is literally talking about nuking the UK of the face of the map! North Korea is fighting in Europe. Iran has been constantly attacking Israel through 4 different proxies. Rockets most days somewhere along the borders and providing Houthies with large long range ballistic missiles. Isreal is lucky to be in one piece and the Allies could be drawn in to direct conflict by accident while supporting Israel in defence and protecting shipping. So yes, China could absolutely be pressuring the US. 

There is no evidence against China having anti-gravity technology at this point. We know they have a reverse engineering program so it makes sense. Berg also said that the US has it and was first. Personal opinions and difficulties in accepting facts are not evidence. 

Try this scenario: China threatening the US to not interfere when China moves on Taiwan around 2027, and generally threatening against any interference in contested territories e.g. South China Sea. If it is China, then a highly likely reason for Bedminster to be targeted by ""dr0nes"", to threaten Trump directly. Fact: China are currently building a new fleet of highly specialised landing craft with long road bridges over 100-150m in length, that use a suspension design and the ships have huge shore jacks to stabilise the ship when deploying the bridge. This type has never seen before in any Navy. There are 6 large ships rapidly being constructed right now to allow large numbers of troops and large quantities of tanks/armoured vehicles to land without even touching a beach. Analysts highlight that these large ships have no other useful purpose identifiable other than for mass landings. In addition,   they are designed to connect to commercial Chinese roll-on roll-off ferries which are deliberately designed designed and tested to carry the weight of tightly packed full battle tanks and/or large amounts of personnel, vehicles or equipment. Seen the satellite photos and hence this is more evidence to support the assertion that China is seriously preparing for a Taiwan invasion. Therefore it is logical, as they have non-human technology, that they could launching incursions into NJ, to spy and threaten the Pentagon avoid overt conflict in future. In parallel China launched two major cyber attacks end of 2024, compromising the entire cellphone network of the USA (stunning scake of attack) and also accessing certain Treasury Secretary computers and data, which is a major breach. So assuming it has anti-gravity technology then it's absolutely possible that NJ was part of a pressure campaign on the USA to keep the fxxk out of Chinese expansionist activities. 

The Pentagon obviously did not wish to make that public due to public reaction but was obviously aware that it was China trolling the US mainland. Totally explains the disinformation and cover-up surrounding events there. If Chinese involvement was made public the citizens would demand retaliation, and the Pentagon does not wish to escalate because? Danger of escalation into WW3. This theory is borne out by the facts and evidence available and the incursions into the UK airbases housing nuclear weapons, which I initially thought to be Russia, but understand better now since the Vegas bomber revealed China's tech advantage.  Explains why the UK were actively trying to downplay and dismiss the events. China is more likely there than Russia, given Russia doesn't have that tech and due very similar types of events and eyewitness testimonies.  Again WW3 is a factor in not revealing who it was, and also protecting knowledge of the classified anti-gravity technology would be another factor driving secrecy. Just dr0nes but not a threat, lol. Global security is the worst it has ever been since WW2. That is not hyperbole. 

Obviously, this doesn't mean there were no real UAP sightings in UK and NJ. There most likely were but mixed in with human made objects. Can imagine NHI being very interested as usual in movement of nuclear weapons in UK and likely interested in Chinese anti-gravity tech in NJ. 

So, please believe whistle-blowers. Their efforts to expose facts and situations that the public need to be aware of should never be dismissed or undermined. It is better to treat all whistle-blower reports as 100% correct and factual, unless they don't pass verification checks on there identity and background, or only if you individually have 1st hand experience of exactly the events and information referenced, have direct access to the source of such information, and/or have the evidence or verifiable facts which throw significant doubt or negate the assertions in some manner. 

Not liking how someone looks or behaves on camera or how they talk in an interview is subjective opinion and holds zero weight with regards to testimonies and facts that they bring forwards. If someone has given evidence to the Senate Intel Committee and you decide they are not credible then you are the problem, not the legally designated whistle-blower. It is a legal status for most we have seen give stunning evidence so far. That must be recognised as a filter against which people lacking in verification or credible backgrounds are rejected. The Senate does not just invite any old John Doe in for a coffee and a legal testimony. That is instant high crediblity right there. Therefore, we should not question it unless of course solid evidence exists. Neither rumour  nor opinion nor perverse subjective logic - e.g. I can't believe that type of individual could ever be a Biologist. Just accept the testimonies as fact, because 99% of the time that is likely to be true. There may be a disinfo agent or two introduced, but I suspect that they would be quickly identified by ex-insiders in the Disclosure community. But that is not a reason not to believe the testimonies of these brave individuals which will most likely be legally accurate, since again, all major whistle-blowers have legally designated status for their own protection and to be admitted into internal investigations.

Hopefully, this will change how you comment and behave regarding whistle-blowers. They really must have our 100% trust and support. 

>>>Using whistle-blowers Disclosure information to simplify the UAP topic<<<

They deserve that and we must treat their evidence as highly regarded facts that are prime references for the community on which to base understanding, to deduce other information/facts, to build any new hypothesis if needed to understand what may be yet to be disclosed in the longer timeframe or to understand something we know won't be disclosed, and we need to draw conclusions or create a working hypothesis to fill a gap.  

An example, Elizondo published in Imminent a chapter or two on UAP craft and their structure and means of propulsion. This is the best scientific assessment we have from reputable experts. It makes very good sense and fits with 5 observables, and makes sense from a theoretical physics perspective. Now that information should be the new reference for how UAP craft work, why they are shaped as they are. Etc. This should be everyone's reference because it is from a verified and highly credible source, from experts who have direct experience. We should not judge it, and we cannot judge it otherwise we will make no progress in defining the science, technology, composition, artefacts, inhabitants, structure and boundaries of our new reality. 

However, people on these subs are like zombies sometimes, shuffling along spouting their pet theories about say, Magneto Hydro-dynamics or MHD. Which, by the way, does not provide instant acceleration or inertial damping. Therefore cannot be the explanation or method of UAP propulsion witnessed consistently throughout the decades. These users seem to ignore the facts and the information published by a whistle-blower that gives scientific analysis and assessment which I am proposing we should accept 100%, believed and refer to as a factual reference point. We need to weed out posts from people who promote things which are now beginning to be or can be considered as incorrect according to knowledge people with 1st hand experience, through whistle-blower testimonies. This will require us to challenge the likes of the MHD people, and say clearly that theory is no longer valid because we have a reference definition for Faster Than Light propulsion which fits extremely well with the large body evidence we have gathered over the decades. MHD is clearly NOT a valid hypothesis, since it does not explain a number of fundamental behaviours of Non-human craft witnessed repeatedly in many cases. At this point, I would politely ask them to please stop posting about it, because it is essentially misinformation at this point. I would suggest that you begin to think and act that way too if we are to work together to cut out the noise. Not everything should be on the table in the face of strong, evidence to the contrary, especially from people who are professionals, with inside knowledge against keen amateurs, with no qualifications or experience. 

There is an exception. Unless a qualified professional, physicist with solid UAP credentials publishes an alternative hypothesis which explains all UAP behaviours, and better in some manner than published to date. (I'm essentially describing ultimately moving towards the standard scientific approach here.) By publishing papers to be openly challenged and accepted as reference documents, or rejected through peer review. But until we have a body of scientists and technologists who are educated in UAP science, then that approach in standard journals has to wait. Meantime we need to gather and guard the truth as it is made public. And defend it as do scientific journals of, say, their fundamental reference proofs, models and data. 

So I would suggest that we need to start to use the new facts we do know as having truthful weight against speculation or poorly constructed hypothesis based on flimsy references, weak deductions or simply assumptions and not actual facts. Weed out things that don't fit. E.g. Here is a glaring example of how our understanding of reality gets confused. The Legacy Program whistle-blowers refer to ""Non-human biologics"", stated under oath in Congress. Given that fact, we can then use that in assessment of the idea that somehow ""future humans"" are involved piloting UAP. If we only have a Non-human biological assessment of entities recovered over 7 decades. Then how can we give any credence to someones idea of time traveling humans, whos DNA would show up as Human in biological analysis. This is one key argument against Masters who has no scientific framework for time travel (he has not evenattempted it), has no theoretical physics that indicates how any type of manipulation of historical timelines are possible in some way, how a time-machine shaped as a disc or sphere or triangle etc would work in theory 
 and presents an idea that flies in the face of many documented eyewitness testimonies who talk of beings indicating over the decades that they come from other star systems, and are clearly not human physiologically in many respects. Ancient tribes refer to the ""Star people"", but lets just ignore all that evidence. Thus, I would highlight there is no whistle-blower evidence supporting ""future humans"", quite the contrary in fact, and suggest that this ""idea"", because I don't see any solid hypothesis there, is parked and left out of our reference set until some concrete evidence arrived that demands a reassessment. It is mis/disinformation at this point given the whistle-blower evidence. 

Note that I am willing to accept Faster Than Light travel and not Time Travel, although they are both controversial scientific concepts. That's because we have strong evidence for FTL with Lazar,Pais, Alcubierre, others, the flight and behavioural characteristics of UAP, professional analysis by UAP related physicists, logically it makes sense when referring to multiple civilisations who refer to different star systems, the logistics of interstellar travel not suited to chemical propulsion, etc. However, for ""future humans"", there is scientifically analysed biological counter evidence explicity identified as positively ""Non-Human"" entities which are visiting Earth. Plus a significant body of eyewitness testimonies and abductee accounts which confirm the NHI beings refer to their interstellar origins in varying locations and also demonstrate craft that travel in space, and to some witnesses other parts of the galaxy. As well as our military sensor detection of UAP craft coming and going between our planet and space. NORAD has to suppress UAP tracks to avoid confusion with nuclear missile detection warnings. So it is known as a fact that UAP frequently travel to/from space. The eyewitness testimonies do not align with the idea of ""future humans"" due to very significant physical differences. And not one case of any abductees reporting that beings described themselves as future humans, not one. Nor has any NHI demonstrated any capability for time travel in human presence. I'll stop there, but based on the Legacy Program alone we have explicitly Non-human visitors as a scientific fact. Therefore, suggest people start to ignore mis/disinformation not based on whistle-blowers evidence, and also dismiss ideas disproven by whistle-blower evidence combined with a broad range of historic evidence from leaks, documented cases and credible witnesses. So, in my logical assessment, ""future humans"" has to be out as a hypothesis at this point as there is significant evidence against, and no credible evidence in support of, that concept. 

Unless new, credible, better in some way information is published from those involved with UAP, that modifies or changes those reference facts, then our reference set of facts and information won't change. New whistle-blowers will be providing new information, so that needs to be compared with the reference set. (There may be contradictions in future but not as yet.) Otherwise, unless exceptionally you have direct knowledge of the UAP NHI aspects you are analysing and are a professional in a related area capable of proposing alternative analysis, then I am proposing that *any Reddit opinion must hold no weight against whistle-blowers evidence*. Why? Because, we must protect the new emerging truth and facts, and use those to deduce new conclusions based on credible evidence and information.

By being radical in our dismissal of what does not fit with whistle-blower evidence and testimonies, we simplify the UAP topic and begin to discount lots of unsubstantiated ideas, assumptions or understandings that don't fit and no longer make sense. This simplifies the UAP topic and makes it easier for everyone to understand. We must start to take certain incorrect or poorly substantiated assumptions, ideas, theories, hypothesis, received wisdom, off the table. The Phenomenon appears from analysis to actually be a set of discreet elements that we need to identify and describe. Some elements have direct relationships or common dependencies which leads to confusion about their nature and preventing the essential understanding and definition of that element. The sooner we simplify the information space around NHI and UAP, the sooner we will be able to positively identify and describe the elements we witness which comprise the Phenomenon. 

This process of ""taking potential answers off the table"" will start to free your mind of useless clutter and brings focus to those facts and evidence that will lead to faster, clearer, better underpinned understanding and ultimately lead to better decisions regarding how you deal with the whole NHI UAP reality, and also in your life relating to decisions directly relating to specific aspects or elements of the Phenomenon. E.g. do you wish to make contact with NHI directly (credible whistle-blower information might provide newly developed guidance from the Legacy Program not previously available, which given your understanding you decide is likely the more effective reference to use compared with some relatively unknown YT podcasters advice based on personal experience), or another question, will meditation help me access psionic abilities that I would like to explore. Keeping track of the UAP NHI reference facts and information should help people navigate to better answers more easily.

>>>Keepers of the Truth<<<

I may be too anxious about the institutions or mechanisms not being available to manage the information flowing from Disclosure, or over estimate the amount of information we will be given. But I need to express what may be an important problem. 

The question remains, if this approach makes sense, what organisation is going be the intermediate home of the truth when it comes to the Phenomenon. The valid knowledge needs to be governed, curated, qualified, managed, maintained, stored, protected, made available, etc. Until global society transitions, this interim management of the reference data seems to be necessary. Once there are new branches of academia, science, 
technology with qualified professionals who are educated in this new knowledge and don't dismiss or deny it, then the reference information can pass into mainstream reference journals, books, databases,etc and thus can pass into mainstream institutions and structures. This may need to be once mainstream institutions have transformed themselves to be ready to accept Paradigm shifting concepts, science, technology, sociology, medicine, etc etc. 

I don't think we can systematically understand and record common standards and definitions of elements of the Phenomenon,  and study them further if the denial and rejection not been dealt with in mainstream society. Common UAP Community knowledge is not consistent or reliable enough to be trusted as a reference source. Which is why I feel that the leading edge of the Disclosure movement will need to supply appropriate professionals, legal, financial and operational support to provide a service, potentially globally, to have a common repository of the truth and that journalists can access to see the latest validated additions to our new Phenomenon knowledge base. Not entirely sure what needs to be in it aside from whistle-blower evidence, but it needs references for everything that has been identified as a discreet element/aspect of the Phenomenon e.g. what is the definition and description of the 5 main NHI civilisations and their related entity types currently visiting Earth? , 
even if whistle-blowers have not published evidence for that aspect. Plus all the historic government documents e.g. Immaculate Constellation report, reports, news stories, plus all major cases with corroborating evidence, cases with written and video documents e.g. Gimbal, Tic-Tac, Splash, acclaimed UAP NHI reference works such as John Mack's abduction cases, Richard Dolan's historical reference books, Leonard Stringfellow's crash retrievals, etc. Credible and factual documentaries not based on speculation such as I Know What I Saw, Ariel Phenomenon, Moment of Contact, etc. The repository would need to arbitrate on what information takes precedence and is trustworthy, as new information is submitted. This would be an interim service in the until mainstream society is educated, transformed where necessary and professionally ready to take responsibility. This transition period might take a few years until a competent, trustworthy institutional and social structure is in place to migrate that knowledge safely into mainstream and protect it's information currency, validity, security and integrity from bad actors looking to benefit from lack of general knowledge and understanding that could be used in malign or fraudulent ways to wield power, social or business advantage over the general population who could be faced with influence based on falsehoods, misinformation and disinformation about the Phenomenon that could lead to societal harm, physical harm, financial harm, psychological harm, amongst other risks.  

Perhaps we don't need all of this, but without addressing this problem I don't see current society has the equivalent of a controlled, maintained, information source that can be relied upon during Disclosure and during societies transition to accepting UAP and NHI reality across every facet of life that currently provides people with trusted information. Currently information stewardship is spread across government, academia, business, science, technology, 
engineering, institutes, libraries, journals, etc. So knowledge management is dispersed and not centralised. Which means we need many independent bodies to accept and make changes before we can trust they are in a position to act professionally in accepting NHI and UAP information as valid and no different from accepting the factual topic of Mammals on this planet, what they look like, how they behave, where they live, how they communicate, feed, etc.  

Until the science community has formally accepted the new reality and is willing to integrate UAP and NHI information into it's institutions and organisations, and that there are no disruptive actors deliberately rejecting or denying new science or discoveries related to NHI, then I believe we would need some kind of ""Keeper of the Truth"" solution.  

TL:DR Fxxk that was an epic ramble. He is waffling again - even this TL:DR is long!!! Basically believe credible whistle-blowers 100%. They are legally protected, have an obligation to tell the truth because their allegations may result in sanctions or criminal prosecution of those involved with the Legacy Program. Reddit in general is not qualified to criticise their testimonies. Accept and learn our new reality. Whistle-blower information should be used as reference information to identify and remove faulty hypotheses, poorly founded speculations, common misunderstandings that mislead,  the community when trying to understand the UAP/NHI truth and reliable facts or hypotheses. ""Keeper of the Truth"" - as Disclosure progresses and society accepts NHI, there is a transition period where we need to protect emerging facts, data, information and knowledge eg. UAP scientific research, technology breakthroughs, maps of NHI galactic civilisations,  etc, that today's society and institutions would normally dismiss, and likely will manage seriously until they have professionally accepted the new reality. Special organisation required to provide a trusted reference source, secure, maintained, etc? Perhaps, yes, until society is ready across many sectors as an operable whole."
Razer blade 14 2022 (r9 6900 16ram 3080ti) 950€ worth it?,razer,1i9qrjj,2025-01-25 11:32:34,24,0.96,12,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9qrjj,Ill-Masterpiece7014,Discussion,"Wrote the post to another community but maybe here i’ll have more chances meeting blade owners. 
Hello Reddit, my first post ,sorry for my English etc. 
if you don’t want to read my essay here are the questions:
1. Is the reliability that bad? Maybe all the issues were at the start of production which were fixed on late versions? Maybe some inobvious problems or moments you have met?
2. How are the temperatures on it? Has anybody repasted it with something like pt7950(maybe you know some better paste to use?) and thermal putty(what putty to use(AliExpress 18 w/mk any good?))?
3. Can i do some heavy tasks on it with the lid closed in vertical stand? If so, how are the temps in this position? Can i connect a monitor and still use the 3080?
4. How is it in general? Like a laptop, I mean the build quality, screen, speakers, trackpad, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi… Do the key caps fade?
5. Thunderbolt 🤨? On amd?




 
I’m a happy user of Asus g513qm(r7 5800h 16ram 3060) and I have an opportunity to buy a used Razer blade 14 with those specs, but I’m really really worried about issues like battery, dead motherboard, heat issues and others. When I ended up researching it seemed to me that it will be easier to find what is doesn’t break in these. And also I found people who had zero complaints about their blades. The problem is that if it breaks I will end up without computer(no way) and the repair option is not available in my country and also will be expensive.

Also i’m worried about all that power being in 14 inch metal body. I use my laptop with lid closed in a vertical stand 90% of the time with external monitor and peripheral so it is like a desktop with a portable option. My laptop seems like it doesn’t really care because the temps are even lower, it doesn’t have intakes from the keayboard and the body is plastic so it doesn’t get hot which doesn’t affect the screen. But Razer blade is made out of some metal and i don’t if it sucks only from the bottom. 
So if anybody used their blade 14 or maybe another 14 inch metal laptop please share your experience. 

I couldn’t find any good tests of it while gaming with both cpu and gpu stock temps without repasting. So idk maybe if the temps are good I don’t really need all of that ptms and putties

I really like the simple design of it and the performance is better than my current laptop, also Razer blade was my dream laptop when I was like 12🤓.

These firms had their principal officers appointed to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Federal Advisory Council in 1914.

Larry Silverstein ate breakfast every morning on top of WTC. None of them showed up on 9/11. Did Israel messenger service Odigo warn them? Silverstein collected billions on the terrorism insurance on WTC he got months before 9/11. The guy who Bush put in charge of the criminal 9/11 investigation, Michael Chertoff, is a dual Israel-US citizen whose mom was Mossad and worked for Mossad airline El Al. His dad was a Talmud scholar. Chertoff let the Dancing Israelis go, let Lucky Larry Silverstein go, then authored the Patriot Act to crush our freedoms.**

#Corbett Report on Dancing Israelis: https://archive.is/KI8ee

From the Corbett Report:

>Their purpose was to “document the event”? But how could they possibly have known what “event” they were documenting at that point, before the second plane strike when those few who even knew about the situation had assumed it to be an accident or pilot error?

>And when did they arrive at the parking lot to “document the event” anyway?

>The FBI reports show how the men gave confused and often conflicting accounts of when and how they learned about what was happening and when they arrived at the parking lot. Oded Ellner even said they had arrived their shortly after 8:00 AM, which would have been 45 minutes before the attacks even began. This is in line with one of the eyewitnesses that had placed their Urban Moving Systems van at the parking lot at 8:00 AM [see page 33 here]. How could they have been in place and ready to “document the event” unless they knew what was about to happen?

>Anyway you cut it, this story is unbelievable. Men with documented connections to Israeli intelligence and working in the United States without appropriate permits were detained after having been caught celebrating the attack on the World Trade Center at a time when no one knew that the WTC strike was an attack. So surely these men are locked behind bars to this day, right? Surely they were transferred to Guantanamo and held without trial for 15 years as part of the “War on Terror,” weren’t they?

>No. They were immediately transferred to federal custody, held for 71 days, and then deported back to Israel. The owner of the “Urban Moving Systems” company that had employed them, Dominik Suter, was investigated by the FBI, too. They concluded that “Urban Moving may have been providing cover for an Israeli intelligence operation” and even seized records and computer systems from the company’s offices. When they went back to question him again on September 14th, he had fled back to Israel.

>And what about the dancing Israeli’s pictures themselves? The Justice Department destroyed their copies on January 27, 2014.

>And these intelligence agents on an intelligence mission who were there to “document the event” of 9/11 before anyone knew 9/11 was taking place? Don’t worry, they were just spying on Arab terrorists.

When Ahmed was exposed by the Wall Street Journal as having sent the money to the hijackers, he was forced to ""retire"" by President Pervez Musharraf.

#Mossad ran 9/11 Arab ""hijacker"" terrorist operation

By Wayne Madsen


British intelligence reported in February 2002 that the Israeli Mossad ran the Arab hijacker cells that were later blamed by the U.S. government's 9/11 Commission for carrying out the aerial attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. WMR has received details of the British intelligence report which was suppressed by the government of then-Prime Minister Tony Blair. A Mossad unit consisting of six Egyptian- and Yemeni-born Jews infiltrated ""Al Qaeda"" cells in Hamburg (the Atta-Mamoun Darkanzali cell), south Florida, and Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates in the months before 9/11. The Mossad not only infiltrated cells but began to run them and give them specific orders that would eventually culminate in their being on board four regularly-scheduled flights originating in Boston, Washington Dulles, and Newark, New Jersey on 9/11.

The Mossad infiltration team comprised six Israelis, comprising two cells of three agents, who all received special training at a Mossad base in the Negev Desert in their future control and handling of the ""Al Qaeda"" cells. One Mossad cell traveled to Amsterdam where they submitted to the operational control of the Mossad's Europe Station, which operates from the El Al complex at Schiphol International Airport. The three-man Mossad unit then traveled to Hamburg where it made contact with Mohammed Atta, who believed they were sent by Osama Bin Laden. In fact, they were sent by Ephraim Halevy, the chief of Mossad.

The second three-man Mossad team flew to New York and then to southern Florida where they began to direct the ""Al Qaeda"" cells operating from Hollywood, Miami, Vero Beach, Delray Beach, and West Palm Beach. Israeli ""art students,"" already under investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration for casing the offices and homes of federal law enforcement officers, had been living among and conducting surveillance of the activities, including flight school training, of the future Arab ""hijacker"" cells, particularly in Hollywood and Vero Beach.

In August 2001, the first Mossad team flew with Atta and other Hamburg ""Al Qaeda"" members to Boston. Logan International Airport's security was contracted to Huntleigh USA, a firm owned by an Israeli airport security firm closely connected to Mossad â€” International Consultants on Targeted Security â€“ ICTS. ICTS's owners were politically connected to the Likud Party, particularly the Netanyahu faction and then-Jerusalem mayor and future Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. It was Olmert who personally interceded with New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to have released from prison five Urban Moving Systems employees, identified by the CIA and FBI agents as Mossad agents. The Israelis were the only suspects arrested anywhere in the United States on 9/11 who were thought to have been involved in the 9/11 attacks.

The two Mossad teams sent regular coded reports on the progress of the 9/11 operation to Tel Aviv via the Israeli embassy in Washington, DC. WMR has learned from a Pentagon source that leading Americans tied to the media effort to pin 9/11 on Arab hijackers, Osama Bin Laden, and the Taliban were present in the Israeli embassy on September 10, 2001, to coordinate their media blitz for the subsequent days and weeks following the attacks. It is more than likely that FBI counter-intelligence agents who conduct surveillance of the Israeli embassy have proof on the presence of the Americans present at the embassy on September 10. Some of the Americans are well-known to U.S. cable news television audiences. In mid-August, the Mossad team running the Hamburg cell in Boston reported to Tel Aviv that the final plans for 9/11 were set. The Florida-based Mossad cell reported that the documented ""presence"" of the Arab cell members at Florida flight schools had been established.

The two Mossad ""Al Qaeda"" infiltration and control teams had also helped set up safe houses for the quick exfiltration of Mossad agents from the United States. Last March, WMR reported: ""WMR has learned from two El Al sources who worked for the Israeli airline at New Yorkâ€™s John F. Kennedy airport that on 9/11, hours after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded all civilian domestic and international incoming and outgoing flights to and from the United States, a full El Al Boeing 747 took off from JFK bound for Tel Avivâ€™s Ben Gurion International Airport. The two El Al employee sources are not Israeli nationals but legal immigrants from Ecuador who were working in the United States for the airline. The flight departed JFK at 4:11 pm and its departure was, according to the El Al sources, authorized by the direct intervention of the U.S. Department of Defense. U.S. military officials were on the scene at JFK and were personally involved with the airport and air traffic control authorities to clear the flight for take-off. According to the 9/11 Commission report, Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta ordered all civilian flights to be grounded at 9:45 am on September 11."" WMR has learned from British intelligence sources that the six-man Mossad team was listed on the El Al flight manifest as El Al employees.

For Mossad, the successful 9/11 terrorist ""false flag"" operation was a success beyond expectations. The Bush administration, backed by the Blair government, attacked and occupied Iraq, deposing Saddam Hussein, and turned up pressure on Israel's other adversaries, including Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Hamas, and Lebanese Hezbollah. The Israelis also saw the U.S., Britain, and the UN begin to crack down on the Lebanese Shi'a diamond business in Democratic Republic of Congo and West Africa, and with it, the logistics support provided by Bout's aviation companies, which resulted in a free hand for Tel Aviv to move in on Lebanese diamond deals in central and west Africa.

Then-Israeli Finance Minister Binyamin Netanyahu commented on the 9/11 attacks on U.S. television shortly after they occurred. Netanyahu said: ""It is very good!"" It now appears that Netanyahu, in his zeal, blew Mossad's cover as the masterminds of 9/11.

#EVERYTHING You Never Knew About Mohammed Atta – The CIA Trained Asset | The Daily Drudge Report

Finally, if one looks at the affiliations of the attack leader and financiers, one will see multiple linkages to US covert operations and U.S. intelligence allies.
• Mohammed Atta, reportedly responsible for coordinating the attacks, trained his men and himself at the Huffman Aviation Flight Training school. That school was funded by Wally Hilliard, with Oryx Corporation. Oryx was founded by Adnan Khashoggi and Sheik Kamal Adham, director of Saudi intelligence (1963-79). Khashoggi was the individual that brokered the meeting between  terrorists and the Yeltsin Family. Khashoggi was also extensively involved in the following Bush operations: the October Surprise, Iran-Contra, Azerbaijan, Barrick Gold and the Marcos Gold.
• Mohammed Atta during his time in the U.S. remained a close friend of Wolfgang Bohringer, an apparent CIA agent.
• Hilliard, nominal owner of the training facility which acted as cover for the terrorists,  is a significant investor in a small California defense/electronics company (Spatialight, Inc.) with Farhad Azima, another member of the Iran-Contra/Azerbaijan group. Azima’s role had been to coordinate air transportation for covert US intelligence operations for Iran-Contra and Azerbaijan.
• Hilliard is reported as a close friend of CIA agent Mark Schubin, whose father was a KGB colonel.
• Hilliard is also strongly linked to the Jeb Bush political machine in Florida, and has had his commercial transport operations endorsed by that group.
• Mohammad Atta, as can best be determined, received funding from three foreign intelligence agencies aligned with the US: Pakistan, Syria and Germany. His father contended he actually worked for a fourth – the Mossad!
• Director of the ISI (Pakistani) Intelligence director-general Lt-Gen Mahmud Ahmad. The week of September 11, General Ahmad was meeting with Bob Graham, Porter Goss and Richard Armitage. Gen Mahmud Ahmad was responsible for having $100,000 transferred to Mohammed Atta.
• While in Germany, Atta worked as  an employee of Tatex Trading which was owned primarily by Mohamad Majed Said, a former head of Syria’s General Intelligence Directorate.
• In coming to Germany, Atta was funded with a scholarship and employed as a tutor by an organization known as Carl Duisberg Gesellschaft. Subsequent Internet reports linked the Carl Duisberg Society to administration by the U.S. Information Agency, but this had not been verified by any government documentation. There are Internet reports that the scholarship was jointly funded by USAID.  The more interesting aspect of Carl Duisberg Gesellschaft is that it’s Managing Director is Bernd Schleich, the same individual who is Managing Director of InWEnt (Internationale Weiterbildung und Entwicklung). If one investigates the activities and research of InWEnt, it appears to be a commercial intelligence operation that does studies on such matters as money-laundering, weapons trades, drug smuggling, and anthrax control in such places as South America, Central Asia and Africa. Carl Duisberg Gesellschaft has a fellowship funded by Alpha Group, the Russian Bank represented in the U.S. by former George H.W. Bush administrators Ed Rogers and Lanny Griffith.
• Mohammed Atta’s father claimed his son was working for the Mossad. Supporting this view, Atta was reported as having left phone records of calls to a company named “Virtual Prototypes.” Virtual Prototypes Inc. would later change its name to eNGENUITY Technologies.  It seems as though the type of work done at eNGENUITY was of more interest to the Israeli government, than it might be of use to a group such as Al Qaeda, as the Israelis made significant purchases from eNGENUITY three years later.
• Mohammed Atta would be discovered to be a legal business partner to Hassan Erroudani, who through the Moroccan American Chamber of Commerce would be associated with the Allied Media Group, a major recruiter for US Defense organizations and private security firms. Their customers would include:
• USAF
• US Army
• FBI
• US Treasury
• Department of Justice
• Department of State
• CACI
• Young & Rubicam
• Burson Marsteller
Atta and his sponsor’s were not jihadists. As a “terrorist pilot” he spent his last year in the U.S. in the companionship of two CIA pilots (Schubin and  Bhoringer). He trained his team at a facility financed by a known financier for CIA operations (Khashoggi). He was a business partner with a CIA recruiter (Erroudani) and he was funded by four pro-CIA intelligence agencies. In essence, Mohamed Atta was a US intelligence community asset working for the United States government.
For at least four years while liv­ing in Ham­burg dur­ing the 1990’s ter­ror­ist ring­leader Mohamed Atta was part of a ‘joint ven­ture’ between the U.S. and Ger­man Gov­ern­ments, the Mad­Cow­Morn­ing News has learned, an elite inter­na­tional ‘exchange’ pro­gram run by a little-known pri­vate orga­ni­za­tion with close ties to pow­er­ful Amer­i­can polit­i­cal fig­ures like David Rock­e­feller and for­mer Sec­re­tary of State Henry Kissinger. The jointly-funded gov­ern­ment effort picked up the tab for Atta on sojourns in Cairo, Istan­bul, and Aleppo in Syria dur­ing the years 1994 and 1995 and employed him as a ‘tutor’ and ‘sem­i­nar par­tic­i­pant’ dur­ing 1996 and 1997.
Note that Atta’s Ger­man spon­sor­ship may have dated to 1992 (when the elder George Bush was in office, the Project for a New Amer­i­can Century’s blue­print for US con­trol of the Mid­dle East was for­mu­lated by Paul Wol­fowitz in 1992, when he was work­ing for the elder Bush. The pos­si­bil­ity that the 1992 spon­sor­ship of Atta by his mys­te­ri­ous Ger­man bene­fac­tors and Wolfowitz’s 1992 pro­jec­tions are con­nected is not one to be too read­ily dismissed.
More­over Atta’s finan­cial rela­tion­ship with the U.S.-German gov­ern­ment effort may even have extended back to his ini­tial move from Egypt to Ger­many in 1992, after being ‘recruited’ in Cairo by a mys­te­ri­ous Ger­man cou­ple dubbed the ‘hijacker’s spon­sors’ in a recent news account in the Chicago Tri­bune. In the years before he became a ‘ter­ror­ist ring­leader,’ Atta was enjoy­ing the patron­age of a gov­ern­ment ini­tia­tive over­seen by the U.S. State Depart­ment and the Ger­man Min­istry of Eco­nomic Coop­er­a­tion and Devel­op­ment, the Ger­man equiv­a­lent of the U.S. Agency cur­rently super­vis­ing the secre­tive bid­ding race for tens of bil­lions of dol­lars of post-war recon­struc­tion con­tracts in Iraq, the Agency for Inter­na­tional Development.”
The orga­ni­za­tion that appar­ently spon­sored Atta’s trav­els was the Carl Duis­berg Gesellschaft (its Amer­i­can com­po­nent is the Carl Duis­berg Society)—named for one of the prin­ci­pal fig­ures in the found­ing of I.G. Farben.
News that Mohamed Atta had been on the pay­roll of an elite inter­na­tional pro­gram known as the ‘Congress-Bundestag Pro­gram first sur­faced a month after the 9/11 attack in a brief seven-line report by Ger­man news­pa­per Frank­furter Alge­meine Zeitung on 10/18/2001 under the head­line ‘Atta was Tutor for Schol­ar­ship Hold­ers.’ The story quoted a spokesman for ‘Carl Duis­berg Gesellschaft,’ described as a ‘Ger­man inter­na­tional fur­ther edu­ca­tion orga­ni­za­tion,’ as hav­ing admit­ted pay­ing Ham­burg cadre prin­ci­pal Atta as a ‘schol­ar­ship holder’ and ‘tutor,’ as the spokesman put it, between 1995 and 1997.”
But the shock­ing rev­e­la­tion that Atta had there­fore been on the pay­roll of a joint U.S.-German gov­ern­ment pro­gram was con­cealed by the news­pa­per through the sim­ple expe­di­ent of neglect­ing to men­tion that the ‘Carl Duis­berg Gesellschaft’ was merely a pri­vate entity set up to admin­is­ter an offi­cial U.S. and Ger­man gov­ern­ment ini­tia­tive. The U.S. end of the pro­gram is run out of an address at United Nations Plaza in New York by CDS Inter­na­tional. The let­ters stand for Carl Duis­berg Soci­ety, which is also the name of its Ger­man coun­ter­part in Cologne, the Carl Duis­berg Gesellschaft. Both are named for Carl Duis­berg, a Ger­man chemist and indus­tri­al­ist who headed the Bayer Cor­po­ra­tion dur­ing the 1920’s.
CDS Inter­na­tional, states the organization’s lit­er­a­ture, pro­vides oppor­tu­ni­ties for young Ger­man pro­fes­sion­als. ‘These young Ger­man engi­neers earn real world expe­ri­ence and are given assign­ments to con­tribute from the start,’ a pro­gram spokesman enthused in a news­pa­per interview . . .”
Hav­ing pow­er­ful friends in such high places may also explain the curi­ous omis­sions in a sec­ond story about Mohamed Atta’s time in Ger­many which appeared in The Chicago Tri­bune, head­lined ‘9/11 Haunts Hijacker’s Spon­sors; Ger­man Cou­ple Talks , of Liv­ing with Pilot Atta.’ The March 7, 2003 article describes the 1992 meet­ing in Cairo which led Mohamed Atta to move to Ham­burg, between Atta and a Ger­man cou­ple, which the paper does not name, who ran an inter­na­tional stu­dent exchange pro­gram, which the paper also leaves anonymous.
Dur­ing a visit to the Egypt­ian cap­i­tal in fall 1991, said the Tri­bune, the Ger­man cou­ple had stayed with friends who knew Atta’s father, a Cairo lawyer, and his father’s friends had then intro­duced the Ger­man cou­ple to Atta. ‘Atta who had recently grad­u­ated with a degree in archi­tec­tural engi­neer­ing from the Uni­ver­sity of Cairo, told the cou­ple he wanted to study archi­tec­ture in Ger­many, but he had no par­tic­u­lar idea where he should go,’ the paper reported . . .”
In this first con­ver­sa­tion, we sug­gested he con­tinue his stud­ies in Ham­burg and offered him a place to live at our house,’ the paper quotes the Ger­man wife telling inves­ti­ga­tors from the BKA, the Ger­man equiv­a­lent of the FBI. Atta, she states, accepted their offer right away. Why did an (unnamed) Ger­man cou­ple, run­ning an (unnamed) inter­na­tional exchange pro­gram leap at the chance to engage a young man who was not even con­sid­ered promis­ing enough to gain entrance to a local Cairo grad­u­ate school? The Tri­bune doesn’t say.”
After study­ing Ger­man in Cairo, Atta arrived in the coun­try on July 24, 1992, accord­ing to inves­ti­ga­tors’ records, and then lived rent-free for at least the next six months in the couple’s home in a quiet, middle-class neigh­bor­hood. It is more than curi­ous that although Tri­bune cor­re­spon­dent Steven­son Swan­son cites the Ger­man cou­ple for ‘hav­ing played such an impor­tant role in Atta’s move to Ger­many,’ he never gives their names, nor that of the orga­ni­za­tion they worked for. But since just two years later, Atta was on the pay­roll of the ‘Congress-Bundestag Pro­gram,’ it is rea­son­able to con­clude that this same government-funded pro­gram was respon­si­ble for bring­ing him to Ger­many in the first place, under the aegis of an unnamed Ger­man cou­ple. His elite spon­sors are appar­ently pow­er­ful enough to keep the organization’s name out of the news­pa­pers, or at any rate, out of the Chicago Tribune.”

**Good Intentions**

.

Three men in dark pajamas were rappelling from a hole cut in the roof.  That was awfully silly, really.  They could have just knocked, or asked one of the security fellows to let them in.

Ooh, maybe they were robbers!  That would be exciting.  There were lots of things to steal at SuperAdvanTech.  Computers, office supplies, plutonium, really neat chairs.  I had a pretty great chair myself, which incorporated the comfort sensors I invented last year.

One of the men in pajamas was blocking the door with iron bars and welding them in place.  That wasn’t something robbers usually did, as far as I knew.

“The asset is secured,” declared one of them, talking into his arm.  Probably he had a secret radio in his sleeve.  Wow, just like a real spy movie!  I wonder if they synchronized their watches?  People probably don’t bother doing that any more, since everything is connected to the internet.

“Say, fellows, are you robbers or spies?”

“You are Abner Middleton?”

“Oh!  Well, yes I am.  Have we met?”

The man looked at me in a very odd way.  I could not imagine what I might have done to upset him.

One man was going through the computer on my desk.  “Password!” he yelled.

“Hmm?  Oh.  Password.”

“Well what is it?”

“Oh, no, I mean that’s it.  It’s password.  P-A-S-S...”  He actually slapped me!  I wished I knew what had gotten them all so upset.

“Dr. Middleton.”

“Yes?  Oh, just call me Abner.”

“Right.  Abner.  You are the inventor.”

“Well, yes, I have had a useful notion or two in my time.  That’s why the nice folks here at SuperAdvanTech have me working here.  They even let me sleep here.  Isn’t that nice?”  Why does everyone look at me that way?

“I am very curious, Abner.  What do you think you have invented?”

“Oh, well, I’m not one to brag, but… well, there was my IceMaker machine.”

“IceMaker.”

“Yes, you know, it freezes food instantly?”

“Yes.  The Freeze Bomb.  Drops temperatures to near absolute zero for miles.”

“Well, I suppose it could, if used improperly.  And of course there was the DogTracker system.  No more lost puppies!”

“Sure.  The robot that can track anyone by their genetic code, right?”

“Err, well, it was meant to find puppies.  And kitties!”  The other two men were placing little black boxes all over the place.  A litter was being lowered through the hole in the roof, and I could hear a helicopter up there.

“Are you aware, Abner, that you are the greatest threat to human safety and freedom in the world?”

“What?  Well of course not.  I just like to tinker, that’s all.”  Someone was playing a very loud movie outside the door, with lots of yelling and gunshots.

“Yes, Dr. Middleton.  Just your Eradicator alone makes you a war criminal.  Wiping out all life instantly?”

“You mean my Sanitizing Pest Control Machine?  It is very tidy.”  Suddenly I felt a jolt of terrible pain from my chair.

""Oh, yes, your torture device.  The Pain Sensor.  Not so fun being on the receiving end of that, eh?""

It was a Comfort Sensor!  I mean, sure, it *could* be used... oh.

Two of the men grabbed me and strapped me to the litter.

“You’re coming with us, Abner.  You really should be shot, but we need you.  You’re the only hope we have to fight back.”

The litter lifted me up, and below there were a series of explosions.  My laboratory would never be the same.

As we flew away in the helicopter, I wondered if I should tell them about the drones I invented.  I made them invisible so the sky wouldn’t look so cluttered, and their high-powered lasers were only there to warn nearby air traffic.

Nah, they'd never believe me."

My wife is a 1099-NEC contract employee for our local school system.  She provides guidance on rules and regulations and sometimes even subs if they're short staffed.  This is a somewhat new position for her and we were wondering what we might be able to deduct from her home office as expenses this year on our taxes?  We calculate the office area to be roughly 150 sq-ft or  6% of the home.

Also, there's a bathroom off of the office, does that count towards a 'home office' and towards the 6% calculation?

For deductions we have the following:

* Power/Electric
* Water
* Internet
* Cell Phone
* Computer
* Subscriptions (Canva, MS Office, etc)
* Pest Control Services
* Portion of Home Maintenance
* HVAC maintenance
* Portion of Groceries
* Vehicle Maintenance
* Vehicle Mileage

Any other items that we might be missing?

Thanks!"

**1. Electronic voices can be understood as**

* **Unique identifier:** Can be thought of as a barcode.
* **Information:** Data that has meaning or significance for the person receiving it. It is the basis for decision-making and communication. Attention => it is also necessary to take into account that data may not have meaning for you (consciousness), but it does have meaning for the brain (it is data) => that it has ""meaning"" for the brain does not mean that it makes sense (the subconscious does not evaluate logic, meaning) => the emergence of unconscious associations and patterns of behavior.
* Interference patterns

**2. Electronic voices are part of several phenomena**

* Gangstalking
* **Electronic Voice Phenomenon (EVP):** Audio manifestations purportedly originating as communication between spirits and humans via audio devices. Although the scientific community generally does not consider EVP to be evidence of ghosts or the paranormal, the phenomenon remains popular among paranormal enthusiasts and in popular culture. Often referred to as ""noise"" as a means of amplifying voices (it is, of course, a ""backing layer"").
* **Subliminal perception:** The perception of stimuli that are too weak for our conscious mind to notice.
* Synthetic telepathy
* Targeted individual
* Voice to skull (V2K)

**3. Many names for the same thing**

**3.1. Classical, standard, general interpretations**

Or a professional and lay perspective

* Fatigue or too much stress
* Hallucinations or auditory hallucinations
* Depression
* Tinnitus
* Derangement
* **Mysterious sound or noise:** The most commonly used term is HUM NOISE
* ""Who knows what that brain can do""

**3.2. Expert view on phenomena associated with hearing voices**

**3.7. Paranormal phenomena**

* Communication with spirits
* Communication with the souls of the dead
* Souls that cannot find peace
* Souls of the deceased who, for some reason, cannot go to the other world
* Scarecrows
* Voices from beyond the grave

**3.8. Historical interpretations**

The connection with the time when radio communication did not yet exist will be illuminated

* Forest fairies
* **Sirens:** Mythical creatures who, according to legend, lured sailors to their deaths with beautiful singing or sounds
* Witches
* The manifestation of various gods
* Hell, Satan, devils
* Possession by the devil
* God's punishment

**3.9. Conspiracy theories**

Paradoxically, it contributes most to the perception of this topic

* Government conspiracy
* Secret magnetic weapon
* Secret service activity
* Satanists
* UFO
* Subcutaneous chips
* New World Order
* **Activity of secret organizations or societies:** Most often Illuminati, Freemasons, etc.
* and many others

**3.10. Truth**

The essence of everything is not any mysteries or paranormal phenomena, and in the vast majority of cases, neither mental disorders nor hallucinations, but something completely ""ordinary"" - man.

**4. What are electronic votes being abused for?**

* Manipulation, influencing
* Targeted harassment on the internet
* Primitive, perverted fun

**5. Electronic voices: What are they used for in the context of harassment?**

* Entity
* False inner voice or dialogue
* Manipulation of individuals or groups
* Making sounds that only the victim can hear
* Speaking to the victim using voices that only the victim can hear
* Influencing environmental sounds, creating specific sounds (most often voices)
* Rhythmic stimuli

**6. Electronic voices: Insights in the context of gangstalking and hearing voices**

* **This is one of the topics whose solution (disclosure of knowledge) perpetrators try to defend hysterically:** Another such issue is, for example, listening to other people's mobile phones (hacking, radiohacking).

**7. What do electronic voices sound like?**

* **In general:** They can sound like anything (have any color). The natural properties of the brain to constantly search for familiar patterns are often abused => some interference patterns only ""slightly"" or ""slightly"" resemble, for example, the ""noise of trees"" so typical of a stay at a cottage, or the voice of one of your friends.
* Chorus
* COMB Filter
* Flanges
* Hum
* **Regular clicking sounds:** An interesting phenomenon can be mentioned in the context of clicking. When trying to imagine a constantly accelerating clicking that smoothly transitions to a buzzing sound (for example), you will find that it is impossible. At a certain point, the mind seems to ""get stuck"". This is because they are essentially different sounds (interference patterns) => different types of information (sticking to the topic). If you have not ""listened"" (learned, studied) the specific course of the individual phases (and the individual transitions - interactions - between the individual states), it is difficult to imagine them (it is like imagining the voice of a person you do not know and then how they sing or laugh). In the context of electronic voices (and harassment in this way), there is also a constant insinuation (learning) of a specific pattern (distortion of information) => an unconscious conditioned reflex => can be described as a ""rebound from the barrier"" => you are supposed to imagine an accelerating clicking and at a certain moment start returning to a slower one. In this case, a constant tone is used as an underlining (""attention"" is focused on the clicking), which rises smoothly up and then down again.
* Sounds resembling the human voice
* A swarm of bees, flies, or other insects
* Drone sound
* Vuvuzela
* TRUMPET
* Violin
* Wind, breeze, draft
* High-frequency whistling
* Chants
* Endless tunnel passage
* Distant, endless train passing by
* **Uncertain music:** Here I will mention a relatively big problem in the form of ""pareido something"" (searching for patterns), real interference with various electronic voices (e.g. parasitic radio signals) and even natural (and at the same time unnatural due to human activity =. technology, radio networks, electrification network) melodies of the environment.
* **Rhythmically repeating noise:** It may resemble the sound of bells, for example
* A voice that keeps changing
* Low-frequency rumbling
* Impulsive sounds
* Noise

**8. Electronic voices: Frequent appearances**

* **Sensable vibrations in the feet:** This phenomenon is mentioned by too many victims of targeted harassment (gangstalking) to be a coincidence.
* **Whistling in the ears:** Usually interpreted as Tinnitus, or for example fatigue, stress, etc.
* Hearing sounds (most often voices) that no one else can hear
* **Vibration and microvibration:** Which means mechanical waves => audible sound may or may not be produced => here is an additional factor: the threshold of consciousness => sound may be audible, but only to the brain => from the point of view of consciousness it seems to not exist and at the same time sound that really does not exist and only arises, for example, due to the nonlinear properties of the human auditory system => it cannot be captured by any technology and therefore cannot be recorded => yet an individual (or a group showing influence by the same environment) hears it => sound exists and does not exist at the same time! (both sides will be right). After the authors of (my favorite) international diagnostic manuals (i.e. the professional community => authority) also become educated, there will be a change to a similar phenomenon: ""someone is an excellent musician"" and ""someone is not"" => a generally recognized, and also true, phenomenon.

**9. The term electronic voice is mainly associated with communication**

* Entity
* **Roles, characters:** Those the perpetrators pretend to be during the harassment (child, police officer, psychopath)
* **Unique identifier in the context of voice:** Not every victim who hears voices can consciously distinguish (hear) a specific electronic voice (voice timbre). Perpetrators often abuse this, especially with quiet voices (whispers), when it is not clear what one perpetrator said and what the other said => everything seems to be one type of voice => information merges.
* **Emotions:** Psychophysiological reactions of the organism to stimuli from the internal or external environment that influence behavior, thinking, and decision-making.
* Emotional tone of voice
* Contextual information
* **Information:** Data that has meaning or significance for the person receiving it. It is the basis for decision-making and communication. Attention => it is also necessary to take into account that data may not have meaning for you (consciousness), but it does have meaning for the brain (it is data) => that it has ""meaning"" for the brain does not mean that it makes sense (the subconscious does not evaluate logic, meaning) => the emergence of unconscious associations and patterns of behavior.

**10. Electronic voices: General ways of perception**

**10.1. Perception of stimuli from the perspective of the individual**

* **Conscious:** Usually hearing voices or different sounds
* **Conscious => out of attention:** They can manifest themselves similarly to subliminal => influence thinking, emotions without the victim being aware of it.
* **Conscious => misinterpreted:** For example, a false inner voice, inner dialogue, hearing thoughts, communication with spirits, etc. The interpretation (awareness) of such stimuli is influenced mainly by knowledge (the ability to process the stimulus using other - more probable and in the context of related situations much more logical and functional - patterns => the stimulus is perceived as external and not as, for example, an ""inner voice""). Knowledge also allows us to defend the WHOLE (mutual connections, interactions, connections, etc.)
* **Unconscious => subliminal:** The victim is not aware of hearing (perceiving) such stimuli. Even so, they can (and often do) influence behavior, decision-making, emotions, and psyche.
* **Seemingly non-existent:** This is the perception of stimuli that arise only due to subjective properties (for example, nonlinear properties of hearing, etc.)

**10.2. General aspects in the context of the perception of interference patterns**

* **Voices and sounds with unlearned focus:** Such sounds can be perceived (heard) in different ways. Not at all, subliminally, consciously in individuals (for example, due to subjective hearing properties or due to environmental properties), consciously in a larger group of people, only in a certain environment, etc.
* **Voices and sounds that can only be heard when interfering with a specific interference pattern:** A specific interference pattern can be the sound (tone) of the environment, the sound of a specific fan, the sound of air conditioning, the sound of a moving tram, the voice of a specific person, the sound of breathing, the sound of blood flowing in the ears, etc.
* **Voices and sounds intended for targeted harassment:** These are perceived only by the individual or individuals and no one else in the vicinity. These are usually cases where ""someone"" (usually the victim) hears voices that no one else can hear => referred to as a manifestation of a mental disorder or hallucination.
* **Voices and sounds that are to be perceived subliminally:** A person should not be aware of hearing (processing) them at all. Due to limited to low cognitive abilities, of course, many of these ""exclusively subliminal"" sounds can be heard, or some people gradually learn to hear them (and thus become victims; they are already victims of, for example, another perpetrator; individuals who are not directly the target of harassment => ""only"" hear voices)
* **Voices and sounds heard in the context of (based on) expectations:** Goals, intentions, patterns of behavior, knowledge. For example, crossing a pedestrian crossing => a person reacts to the calling of his name, but especially to the screeching of brakes (imminent danger). Much less to the singing of birds nearby (not important in the context of the situation).
* **Voices and sounds perceived in the context of knowledge:** Someone knows that this or that sound is part of a ""diesel generator"", someone else thinks it's a fan, and someone else perceives it as part of the environment. And there are those who know that this or that sound (interference pattern, or for example its sound manifestation) is present (either in the same or a similar sound form) in several (or many) different situations (example: standardized apartment units => ambient tone).
* **Voices and sounds and their perception in the context of attention:** Performing a certain activity and not paying attention to surrounding sounds (e.g. responding only to calling one's name). Varies according to knowledge, their contexts and the connection to the current situation (e.g. targeted harassment by sounds)

**10.3. Various aspects of stimulus perception in the context of conscious influence**

* **Conscious perception: External stimuli that cannot be influenced:** A person perceives electronic voices in the same way as ordinary sounds (hearing voices). If such voices are annoying (which is the basic essence of annoyance) => a person logically wants to change such a state => however, the professional community, according to international diagnostic manuals, labels this state as a ""manifestation of a serious mental disorder"" or a ""hallucination"" (thus exacerbating the problem in a completely bizarre way).
* **External stimuli that can be influenced more or less:** This is an area seemingly full of various uncertainties, ambiguities, paradoxes, evidence and counter-evidence, arguments, conspiracy theories, stereotypical prejudices, etc. etc. This is of course not a coincidence or ""coincidence"" (manipulation of the victim remotely as part of targeted harassment is, for example, one of the factors). However, here too, the same applies => specific information leads to specific conclusions. The topic is discussed in detail in a separate thread (or in the context of this view => in a separate article).

**11. Types of voices in the context of the phenomenon of hearing voices**

**11.1. In the context of persons**

* **Different voice colors and genders:** Male, female, girl, boy, child, etc.
* **Voices with strong intonation or emotional coloring:** Various sequences of sounds resembling words or words themselves. Because it is a ""supporting layer"" (supporting sounds) => the victim is usually not aware of it (he notices it only when the ""content layer"" is missing => at the same time it is also necessary to know the overall context of the situation and the individual connections)
* **They sound the same or very similar to the voices of specific people:** Someone from the neighborhood, friends, family, actors, public figures, etc.
* **Voice of a specific person:** For example, long-term associated with a specific entity.

**11.2. In the context of perception**

* **Quiet, subliminal:** Voices de facto copy the threshold of audibility. As a rule, it is not possible to determine any elements related to voice color, intonation, gender, etc.
* **Rhythmic:** Voices de facto copy the threshold of audibility. As a rule, it is not possible to determine any elements related to voice color, intonation, gender, etc.
* **Unintelligible:** Sounds like mumbling, indeterminate words, word fragments, phonemes (see carrier and content layer above)

**11.3. In the context of localization, the environment**

* **Sounds that seem to originate near the ear or directly in the ear itself:** Can only be observed in certain situations (lying on your side => space between the ear and the pillow), placing your palm against your ear, placing your ear close to a surface, but not completely (e.g. a wall).
* **Voices that originate in the sound of breathing (or other body sounds):** These elements seem to be the most fun for perpetrators.
* **Voices that come from the surroundings or from a greater distance:** Neighbors, the surroundings of the house, reflections on the wall of the opposite building. Unlike most other manifestations - in these contexts they can ""make sense"" => be a natural part of the environment => therefore not everyone notices that these are parasitic sounds (normal city traffic, sounds in apartment blocks). These mechanisms are often the basis for scenarios in the context of inducing paranoid feelings and ideas ""I feel like these people are talking about me"", ""I heard the neighbors saying my name"", etc.
* **Voices whose source (direction of sound) is not easy to determine:** The source of the sound seems to change depending on what the victim is focusing on (or what they think is the source of the sounds). A combination of two phenomena (name) and subjective hearing characteristics (shape of the ears, resonant frequency of the ear canal, etc.)
* **Voices that can be heard in various environmental sounds:** Noise of heating, fan, air conditioning, running water, wind, etc. It is the same principle as with the ears => Use of specific interference patterns (sounds).
* **Voices that are only audible in impulse (impact) sounds:** Tapping a fingernail on a tabletop, typing on a keyboard, etc.

**11.4. In the context of the psyche**

* **Negative, critical:** (here - and only here - the international diagnostic manuals ""went crazy""). They can encourage dangerous actions or cause anxiety and paranoia. These voices can be a source of significant stress and can worsen a person's psychological state. Often associated with mental disorder.

**12. Electronic voices: Basic ways of distinguishing**

* **Sound color:** What most people use to distinguish a guitar from a piano, or to identify which friend has a particular voice (identifier). Individual colors are created by different interference patterns (spectral composition).
* **Voice color:** Voice color can be viewed from several angles => sound color and also emotional coloring. We also ""expect"" an emotional component in the human voice more than, for example, the buzzing of a mosquito or a humming air conditioner (although even in such sounds one can find ""emotional"" - interference - components characteristic of emotions). It is also necessary to take into account the fact that people with musical hearing are much more sensitive to the emotions contained in the human voice.
* **The sound manifestation of a specific interference pattern (now regardless of other factors such as environment, hearing, etc.):** In simple terms, the mechanism by which we perceive one sound as O and another as, for example, U or A. However, this phenomenon can be viewed from multiple angles => ultimately, sounds such as A, E, I, O, etc. are just different colors of sound (interference patterns).
* **Melody:** Melody can be created (or rather is created) not only by ""playing"" different tones (for example, individual piano keys), but also by seemingly static tones. It is created due to the interference of individual frequencies (certain frequencies slowly add up and at a certain moment they cancel out others and are subsequently themselves canceled out => this is repeated over and over again => if there is no cancellation of frequencies and they keep adding up, the well-known phenomenon - ""coupling microphone"" will occur). How ""clear"" this melody is also depends on the speed of individual cycles. It can manifest itself as AEOAEO, AAOAAO, etc. (if you suspect something here in the context of hearing voices - it is ""just"" a logical deduction => it will be specified in more detail)
* **Loudness (audibility):** For simplicity, it can be imagined as whispering and normal speaking. Interesting fact => you cannot sing in a whisper. A whispered voice has its own specific interference pattern, which is always the same (even when we speak loudly) => more precisely the same within the context (some frequencies can be temporarily muted within interaction cycles - interference, melody, color) but the whole remains unchanged (something like when you make a black line across a purple sheet of paper and then erase it => you still know that it is a purple sheet). This pattern arises (among other things) due to the shape of the throat, mouth, etc. This interference pattern can of course be significantly influenced (changed) by the method of recording.

**13. Electronic voices: Basic mechanisms**

**13.1. Electronic Voices: Learning in the Context of Harassment**

* **Learning most often takes place during sleep:** Nighttime peace, less traffic => fewer disturbing signals (stimuli). Also, long-term static position and long-term same position (bed). That is why perpetrators are most active at night.
* It takes a person several years to learn to listen to interference sounds (interference patterns, electronic voices)
* **The victim is overwhelmed by a group of the same sounds and sequences that sound like mumbling or unintelligible speech (similar to a loud television from the neighbors):** These are various interference sequences. The principle is similar to when a person learns to speak. He hears dozens or hundreds of people using his native language => a person (or rather the brain) is therefore sensitive to the finest nuances (we often immediately recognize who is and is not a native speaker). Speech itself is just a sequence of certain interference patterns (sounds => phonetic sequences). If the victim is taught only the same patterns - the result may be a situation where only he and no one else hears a given sound (voice, speech). It is also necessary to take into account that these indefinite sounds can remain the same (carrier sound) and the information content can be different each time (whispering).
* **In an attempt to impose a specific type of ""inner voice"" on the victim, perpetrators often repeat the victim's activity on the computer:** In particular, the text that he reads or writes, numbers or words that he stores in short-term memory (phonological loop). For those who think of questions in the context of ""hitting on specific words"" now only briefly (patterns, illusions, various interference patterns, the way the brain processes information and other techniques => will be written in a separate thread).

**13.2. Electronic voices: Hearing**

* **Everyone can hear interference sounds (electronic voices => interference patterns) differently:** For example, due to the subjective properties of hearing. This is a similar phenomenon to the FLANGER, CHORUS, COMB FILTER effects in the context of interference - mutual interaction - of individual frequencies). If an individual is less sensitive to a certain frequency band (old age, hearing impairment, wearing headphones, tinnitus) => other frequencies may be emphasized (directed attention). In addition, the brain calculates these ""dead spots"" (missing frequencies) itself (but ""only"" based on assumptions => learned patterns) => And this only if it is aware of the fact that some frequencies are missing - i.e. the difference from normal => it processes (evaluates) the input data (stimulus) in this way based on previous iterations (experience, knowledge).
* **They can sound different depending on the environment:** Similar principle as in the previous point. Each place has its own tone (interference pattern => standing waves, resonant frequency of the room, air column, etc.) => ""tone of the place"" also applies to the ear canal (ears).
* **They may sound different during the day and at night:** The basic factor is, of course, the ""city noise"". This is also why some people work so well at night and some think so well early in the morning.
* **To hear electronic voices, a carrier sound is needed:** Such a sound can be basically anything. More fundamental in this context is the division into ""artificially created interference patterns"" (e.g., whistling from a mobile phone, electromagnetic induction, etc.) and natural interference patterns (environment, reflection of city noise from nearby houses, neighbors' refrigerator, drafts)
* Certain interference patterns (tones) are constantly repeated in the context of certain environments (apartment, space in front of the house, sound coming from an open window, etc.)"

Turntable Advice/Recs,turntables,1i9pcnu,2025-01-25 10:30:06,10,1.0,22,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9pcnu,vernonhaskie,,"Hi everyone, I wanted to ask for some recommendations and advice on getting a new (or old) turntable. I recently upgraded my setup from active computer speakers to a marantz 2018 and two Boston acoustics A100s, but now I’m starting to look around for a new turntable. 

Currently I’ve got a Sony PS-LX250H that I bought 20 years ago when I was in high school. A brief search on the Internet has informed me that this is not a great turntable. It still plays, but some of the functions like auto start and auto return no longer work and now that I’ve got a nice receiver and speakers that I like, I’d like to make the jump to a nicer turntable for home listening only.

I’m purchasing in the USA around the Louisville/lexington/Cincinnati area and not opposed to a vintage player, but I’m still pretty new to the hobby. I’m also leaning towards a manual table, as I’m kindof already used to it since the Sony’s automatic functions no longer work. Right now my budget is about 350, but I’d be willing to spend a little more if it’s really worth it. I’d really like something that I won’t feel like I’ll have outgrown in a year or two, so upgradable turntables would be preferred. TIA!"

My Deco M9 mesh network has worked flawlessly up until recently. As of a couple of days ago I no internet speed. I haven’t done any changes to the network besides a software update last week. If I plug my computer straight to the fiber box I have solid 250mbits but through the Deco I have 0,1 mbits. I have always used the Deco as a router with two APs. 
Anyone that also has experienced this and have a work around? 
Currently I need to use my ISPs router wich means a brand new network and I kinda liked my old one. 

Is it better to just keep using the ISP router and use the Decos in AP only mode?

Asynchronous Radio Communications: Bulletin Board Systems (BBS),preppers,1i9oybe,2025-01-25 10:11:19,9,0.92,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/1i9oybe/asynchronous_radio_communications_bulletin_board/,Swmp1024,Idea,"One issue I have had with off-grid radio communications is difficulty maintaining communication with people who might not always keep their radio on, travel out of range, or are not listening  24/7. In longer grid down situations this becomes more obvious and there is a need to be able to leave someone a message. 

Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) were the precursor to the internet and popular in the 80s-90s as a way of leaving messages, chats, sharing files and playing games. Although this tech has fallen out of favor it is still utilized in the ham radio world. It is basically a digital bulletin board and message exchange where we can leave messages for each other. Share files. You can also hop from one node to another and expand your communication range by hopping from one node to the next. 

Essentially this entails taking a ham radio, attaching a sound modem or TNC to it and running a computer with it to host a BBS. This can be done with simple VHF HT radios and a raspberry Pi or with a large HF rig and dedicated computer.

I find this an interesting capability. Certainly the internet is far faster and more robust. But in scenarios where there is internet/grid failure setting up a rudimentary BBS system over radio is not a hard system to build and is a great capability. 

* Yes, this does entail getting your ham radio license. 

* modern ham and techprepper both have decent YouTube videos and write ups that detail the installation and execution of this concept. "

"Ross Ulbricht, founder of The Silk Road just got pardoned by Trump",ClientlessCopywriting,1i9orl1,2025-01-25 10:02:17,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClientlessCopywriting/comments/1i9orl1/ross_ulbricht_founder_of_the_silk_road_just_got/,ClientlessCopy,,"Just a few days ago I wrote about how Epstein, Hunter Biden, Elon and many other rich elites get away with extremely ridiculous crimes that normal law abiding citizens would never get away with and that the underlying reason is they can get away is corruption.

Ulbricht(german for Noble/bright/famous), the prolific poster child of the dark web, unfortunately didn't have such corruption on his side. No friends in high places for him sadly.

Or maybe he just arrested during a time of less corruption.

But Trump gave him his lucky break, despite previously saying drug dealers should receive the death penalty.

If you don't know, President Trump has been signing executive orders immediately upon his inauguration, left and right(do they even have any meaning when he signs them as often as he does?) to the point that memes are being made.

And one executive order of his is promoting Bitcoin and AGI(artificial general intelligence), through Sam Altman and openAi.

Trump wants America to be the world center for bitcoin and A.I

But today, the conversation isn't about trump and his executive order, that's boring political stuff. Instead today, it's about Ross Ulbritcht, founder of Silk road and DPR(Dread Pirate Roberts) himself! And what this all means.

See Ulbricht, graduated with a bachelor’s degree in physics from the University of Texas at Dallas and a master’s degree in materials science and engineering from Pennsylvania State University, and during or shortly *after* university, he became deeply influenced by libertarian ideologies, particularly those advocating for free markets and individual freedoms.

So motivated by these beliefs, he launched **Silk Road** in **February 2011**, at the age of **26**(nearly the same age as me), as a dark web marketplace designed to operate beyond government control.

The platform utilized Tor also called The Onion Router for user anonymity and **Bitcoin** for transactions, rapidly becoming a hub for illegal drug sales and other illicit activities.

Essentially, Tor is a tool that lets you browse the internet anonymously by routing your connection through multiple servers (nodes) around the world, hiding your identity and location. Each server only knows part of the path, making it nearly impossible for anyone to trace your activity back to you. It's commonly used for privacy, bypassing censorship, or accessing hidden websites on the dark web.

It's for these reasons that Silk road drew in almost 100,000 users, made millions(183m) in sales, transactions and sales 13m for Ulbricht himself in just the 2 years and a half years it was open.

Untraceable users with Tor anonymity coupled with nearly untraceable **Bitcoin** for transactions made it a hub primarily for illegal drug sales, counterfeit goods like forged IDs, hacking tools and services, guns, and general Paraphernalia.

But after a **two-year investigation**, Ulbricht was arrested by the FBI on **October 1, 2013**, in a sting operation at the age of **29**, while using a public library in San Francisco.

Operating under the pseudonym **“Dread Pirate Roberts,”** he was charged with multiple crimes, including conspiracy to traffic narcotics, money laundering, and computer hacking.

In **2015**, Ulbricht was convicted on seven charges and sentenced to **double life imprisonment without the possibility of parole**.

Now doing some more research, he *could've* gotten away it, if he had more opsec( Operational security).

Opsec is a method for protecting critical information from adversaries. It's used to prevent adversaries from gaining access to information that could be used to harm people, resources, or disrupt missions.

In our case, Ulbricht could've *completely* hidden his identity.

Instead he accidentally used used his real name on an online forum to promote his site, used stack overflow, which was traced back to him. And reused the username ""Altoild"", which was tied to his gmail. Bitcoin is also pseudo anonymous by design so there are public ledgers, meaning the transaction histories are public.

That's why today, people use other crypto, like Monero, which hides a lot more of the transaction history.

Supposedly Ulbrichts biggest mistake was the IP address of the server for the site being available on captcha.

Regardless, they had enough on him, and maybe some more high tech, some DARPA shyt, that could trace him.

When they arrested him in the public library, they were able to distract him and gain access to his opened laptop, with the master or admin account of the silk road in addition to a wallet with 144,000 bitcoin($28m then) which today, is worth $14B. Yes Billions.

Unfortunately the feds also sold his bitcoin back when they were just worth a few hundred dollars, auctioning them to buyers.

And while rarely anyone argues Ulbricht was a good guy(he supposedly also tried to carry out hits on people, but never got charged for this), his case was controversial due to the nature of his site and polemics, as well his harsh sentencing(2 life sentences), where murders got off with a lot less.

Trump has in addition likely also freed him due to his(Trump's) dislike of the deep state. 

He wants to maintain that image of that drain the swap stuff. Which is totally real, Hunter Biden corruption and all that.

But i personally wouldn't write Trump off as not *also b*eing deep state himself.

These rich folk *all* know each other, it's a small world after all.

Anyway, you might not like Ulbricht, i'm not sure I like him like that, he's like Walter white, but *actually* real. its hard *not* to root for the guy. He's incredibly cool, and not just because he likes The Princess Bride.

But because he was able to live life how *he wanted*, have the *balls* to start his own shyt(silk road), read the market on bitcoin, be fabulously rich *just* off that, and find *his* people to then give them what *they* want; like minded degen hackers and tech guys that buy up weed, shrooms and erotica.

See Ulbritcht was a storyteller, a world-builder. *All his users lived in his world*, just like J.K Rowling's billion dollar Harry Potter empire.

Where people buy up merch, memorabilia and talk about the series *to this day. Rowling* still makes a commission/royalty on the Harry Potter films. And who knows what else she makes on the entire franchise?

Ulbricht sucked you in and made you hate the government and their bureaucracy and control. Libertarians in general want as little government control as possible.

I'm sort of the same.

Because uncle Sam wants his grubby little hands everywhere and it's insane how much we pay in tax and how little we benefit as Americans from the government.

What happened to social contract theory? To the reason why fought the British Crown?

See Ulbricht was an enemy of the state, they didn't like that he wasn't just a lapdog tax payer working his wagie job. 

And his site was a message of his lifestyle and philosophy. That of total freedom and profiteering.

He sent the message to his followers and users, through DPR, that

""every single transaction that takes place outside the nexus of state control is victory for those individuals taking part in those transactions. So there are thousands of victories here each week and each one makes a difference, strengthens the agora, and weakens the state"".

He built this world evocative of the ancient silk road trade routes, where they traded all manner of things without much interference. Where no one governed you.

That's why there's so much controversy about his harsh sentences. 

He tipped the sacred cow.

Now i'm not endorsing you to do anything illegal, but we should all be a bit more like Ulbricht.

We ought to go against the grain and not be afraid to tip some sacred cows ourselves.

Thats where freedom and wealth is.

By *all* metrics, Ulbricht is clientless minded.

Freedom minded.

And who knows what he'll do next.

Supposedly he has $44m locked away in Bitcoin somewhere that the feds haven't touched.

Maybe thats why he's smiling in his release photo.

Bro is scheming. lol.

But even if he lost it all, he could make it all back, because Ulbricht is Ulbricht, he's one of one. His personality makes him an apex predator.

He isn't a sheep.

He isn't the type to lose. He's bred for excellence and you can bet he'll either lay low with his millions(if he has them) and wait for all this to blow over(maybe in a different country) or go all in and maybe end up on Joe Rogan(another clientless operator).

I bet *in jail* this guys mind was racing, learning, thinking of the upside, even if he was resigned to never getting out.

Guys like him are just different.

And you probably are too.

That's why you should be *doing* ***all that can be done*** to change your life.

So build your own shyt,

build a world that people love to be in and hate to leave.

And make it LinkedIn verified and all that so uncle Sam can't take it away.

You'll explore who you are underneath, and probably get rich from it.

A unique offer compounded with time, hard-work and being on the bleeding edge *will* do that.

Your pal,

Fathi"

I have several machines that backup to a remote server (on a different office). Currently I'm using tailscale and SyncBackPro, but I get speeds of about 10-20 MB per second, which is very low considering both locations are connected to the internet using 10 gigabit fiber and the backup server is connected at 10Gigabit (the other location has 5 computers connected using gigabit ethernet). Speedtesting the connections gives me about 700MB / second speed both ways. I think the problem is probably Tailscale, so I was looking for a better solution. It would be very appreciated if anyone could give me some pointers. And yes, I realize hard drives don't support these speeds, and Gigabit lan has a maximum speed of around 80MB/second, but even then the speed should be well over the 10-20MB I'm getting.

Can anyone help me figure out why Word won't open?,techsupport,1i9nif2,2025-01-25 09:00:14,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1i9nif2/can_anyone_help_me_figure_out_why_word_wont_open/,Quantummoons,Open | Software,"This is an on going problem I've had for several years now. Back in college (around 2021) my lecturer sent me a Word document that was corrupted in some way because it would never open. A little dialogue box \[open in safe mode\] would show up if I tried to open it again but it would disappear before I had a chance to click on it. I used to time my clicks to click on the button before it disappeared but that wouldn't do anything (as in it wouldn't open in safe mode). At this time it was only a problem for that specific Word document, but it being COVID, our lecturers sent us lots of notes online and I needed to access that file and others for classes. I would often forget which document from my lecturer was the corrupted one and try to open it by mistake. For my classes it wasn't too much of a problem because I could still view the document on Word Online or in the email preview. 

The problem really only started when I would open that document (forgetting it's the corrupted one) but then Word would fail to open for any other document until I restarted my computer. Sometimes restarting didn't even work and Word would only open after I left it alone for a few weeks.

I don't need to access that corrupted file anymore, but for some reason that corruption has made it's way into every Word document I download from the internet, and suddenly I can't access any Word document at all, even documents that originated on my PC. It even got to the point that I would open a 'safe' Word document for the sole purpose of opening a Word document I downloaded. Word can't refuse to open if it's already open for another document.

Up until now I've been able to handle it and get workarounds, but it's gotten to the point that I want to fix it  and be rid of the problem permanently. I can edit documents in Word Online, but it has limited features and requires opening Word the program to export to PDF. My job requires me to have lots of documents from different programs open at once, so it gets really annoying closing all those programs, restarting the computer and then opening them all again just to find that the restart for a Word document I only needed to look at for a minute, hasn't worked.

I've considered just getting a new PC but I still access a lot of Word documents from around that time. I'm worried a 'safe' document from that time is carrying the corruption, ready to be unleashed the next time I download a Word file from the internet. I know that because this corruption is very persistent. Corrupted files wouldn't open even if I transfered it to my laptop (going on to corrupt all Word files there). The problem persisted even after I not only deleted Word but bought a whole new license. I've even tried force starting Word from the command prompt but it couldn't do anything.

I'd really love it if someone could help me nip the problem in the butt!!"
Help me find a simple PKM for lawyer assembling a knowledge base,PKMS,1i9nga1,2025-01-25 08:57:01,3,0.8,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/PKMS/comments/1i9nga1/help_me_find_a_simple_pkm_for_lawyer_assembling_a/,Impressive-Map-8703,,"I'm hoping this group can save me from a lot of trial and error and online rabbit-holing.  I'm a lawyer in a somewhat niche field and have long wanted to start keeping an informal knowledge where I can dump important dump documents about various developments in my field, maybe even without reading them right away, for potential future reference.  I could use some help figuring out which app to use.  

My work involves a lot of agencies, which are always putting out new policies, updates, rules, reports, alerts, etc.  I have folders where I keep the really important stuff in pdf (e.g., new regulations, statutes, guidance documents), but I want to start capturing more of the ancillary documents that come out.  Managing all of these as pdfs in a folder would be way too burdensome and time consuming.  The use cases I'm envisioning are using this information to help with professional writing and speaking, to have a deeper knowledge base to draw on for developing rulemaking comments and advocacy, being able to flip background packages to associates, and I'm sure I'll find others.  This isn't intended to replace a full-fledged research database like Westlaw or Lexis Nexis for those familiar with the space.  And a lot of what I use doesn't show up there anyway.  This would include only public information or non-client information I generate; I do not intend to store client information here.  

**Main criteria:**

* **\*Very\* low-friction use.**  I'm willing to spend a minimal amount of time figuring out how it works and doing basic setup at the beginning, but it needs to be super-easy to get things into the system.  E.g., direct something into the system, assign a tag or two, and that's it.  I tend to think more in terms of folder hierarchies than search, but in this case, I think tagging and search is what I need.  I don't want to spend any time at all having to put things into a structure or maintaining a structure.  
* **Ability to handle a wide range of files**.  I need to be able to put in pdfs, emails, webpages, screenshots, MS Office format documents.  Ideally I'd be able to view/search these as the contents of the documents in the system, not just for example as a pdf icon attached to the note that I have to click open to see.  
   * Links to the material aren't enough (webpages change over time); need to capture the actual document
   * Audio/video is less important to me, and I'd be willing to find another way to host/link to those if needed
   * Being able to manipulate the files (e.g., highlight, annotate) is nice but not essential.
* **Variety of ways to get things into the system**.  Ideally I'd be able to clip partial or full webpages, add pdfs and other files, and forward emails into the system.  My firm uses the MS Office suite, but it's pretty locked down, so I can't count on using plugins for any office Office apps.  I \*can\* use a Chrome webclipper.  
* **Must have a good web-based interface**.  I work at a very large law firm, which means tons of restrictions in what I can install.  A desktop app I can use on my personal computer is a plus.

Things I don't think I care about:

* **Cost**.  I'm fine with paying for something if it works well.  Free is obviously better but not essential.
* **Complicated graphs and structures and databases**.  I don't intend to back-link, create complicated knowledge graphs, maintain a Zettelkasten system, or anything like that.  I just need a place to dump a bunch of materials and do minimal steps to let me find them again.  Not a problem if these are part of the app, but they can't be critical to its function.  But a good search will help.  
* **Special data security**.  This will all be publicly available information, so while I don't want it available to just anyone, I'm not overly worried about security issues, above and beyond standard internet security needs.
* **Using this program to draft materials**.  I have not enjoyed drafting in any of the note apps I've tried, and I don't intend to do much if any writing in this setup.  At most, it will be writing brief notes about the document, but I think that will be infrequent.  

Things I've tried a little bit:

* **OneNote**.  This is basically what's available to me by default through work.  I actually like OneNote and use it for handwritten notes on my ipad and organizing some client materials, but I think it's too clunky for this use case.  For example, if I save an email to OneNote, I have to manually browse the file structure to show where to put it, and I can't assign tags or leave short notes as part of the saving process.  Plus, for reasons I don't understand, our desktop and web app don't talk to each other.
* **Other MS Apps**.  I have access to a bunch of things through our Teams setup that I'm just not that familiar with (Loop?  What is Loop??).  I haven't pursued further because I don't like accessing things through Teams, I can't tell what our IT views as core to our needs and so am worried about continued access, and I find the interface clunky and unintuitive.  
* **Evernote**.  Tried this years ago for household use and disliked nearly every aspect of the experience.  Something about the way it structured and presents information doesn't jibe with me, and I think it's way overpriced.  
* **Notion**.  Tried this for personal use.  Interesting, but feels too heavy, seems like I'm spending most of my time setting up and organizing the system and databases and clicking through things to get to more things rather than reading through my information.  
* **Capacities**.  Tried this only a little bit.  Feels like it could have potential, but I'm starting to get concerned I'm spinning wheels so decided to put up this post before exploring any further.  Would love thoughts on how to make this work.  
* **Obsidian**.  Tried this a bit for personal use.  Would probably do the job if I could install it locally on my work computer, but I can't.  And I don't want to manage third-party plugins and complicated syncing structures.

In case it helps put more clarity around what I'm asking, here are some potential ways I'd like to use it:

* I'm reading an article online that I want to save.  I click a clipper in Chrome, it saves it to the app and gives me a popup that is optional to complete, where I can add a couple hashtags or notes if I want.
* I find a pdf report from an agency or a research paper I want to save.  If I'm reading the pdf in a browser, I save it using an interface like in the above bullet.  If I have it saved locally, I guess I have to upload it to the app's website, but ideally using a simple drag-and-drop style interface.
* I get an agency alert email that I want to save.  I forward it to a mailbox associated with my account, adding any hashtags I want into the body of the email, and it gets saved.
* I want to read up on a topic.  So I search the app for #TOPIC and get an easy-to-click through set of results, organized by date saved or date of the article (if there's something that can figure that out), and I get quick and readable views of the underlying documents when I'm clicking through (think the file preview function you can get on a mac).

  
**Short version**:  I'm a lawyer who wants a lightweight setup to capture and loosely organize publicly available reference materials.  Has to be web-based, and must be very easy to gets lot of different things into the system with extremely minimal effort on my part.  Want a tagging-like organizational structure.  Not trying to build a complicated system with backlinks, notes within notes, etc.  Did I mention this needs to be really simple and lightweight?

Thanks!!

By delivering high performance with low power consumption, GAP8 ensures that IoT devices can operate efficiently and sustainably, even in remote or resource-limited areas.

# A Step Towards Sustainability

As technology advances, so does the demand for sustainable solutions. GAP8 aligns with this global priority by reducing the energy footprint of edge computing. Its ultra-low-power design minimizes battery usage, reducing e-waste and extending the lifespan of IoT devices. This commitment to sustainability makes GAP8 an ideal choice for applications where energy efficiency is crucial, such as environmental monitoring and renewable energy systems.

Moreover, GAP8 contributes to the broader goal of reducing reliance on cloud-based processing, which often requires energy-intensive data centers. By enabling local processing at the edge, it decreases the volume of data transmitted over networks, further reducing energy consumption. This makes GAP8 a key player in the push toward greener, more sustainable technology ecosystems.

# The Future of Edge Computing with GAP8

GAP8 represents a significant leap forward in edge computing, combining performance, efficiency, and versatility in a single package. Its ability to handle complex tasks with minimal power opens the door to a new era of smart devices, where intelligence is embedded directly into the technology we use every day.

As industries continue to adopt IoT and AI, the demand for solutions like GAP8 will only grow. From enhancing the functionality of consumer electronics to enabling advanced industrial applications, GAP8 is setting a new standard for what edge computing can achieve. By bridging the gap between performance and efficiency, it empowers developers to create innovative solutions that are not only powerful but also sustainable.

In conclusion, GAP8 is more than just a microprocessor—it’s a catalyst for change. By redefining efficiency in edge computing, it paves the way for smarter, more sustainable technology that can meet the demands of a rapidly evolving world. As we look ahead, the impact of GAP8 will undoubtedly continue to grow, shaping the future of edge AI and IoT for years to come."
Can anyone help me figure out what I need to learn to be able to reach my goals with computers?,TransyTalk,1i9mn53,2025-01-25 08:11:44,3,0.81,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransyTalk/comments/1i9mn53/can_anyone_help_me_figure_out_what_i_need_to/,bittercrossings,,"Hey everyone, I know its a stereotype that trans people all work in IT but I guess this is something i only feel safe asking our own community about so if you know anything about computers and can help me out I would really appreciate it. I have just basic user knowledge atm but I'd like to be able to use the internet as anonomously as i can, go on the deep/dark web as safely as I can (not to do anything sus, i just worry about our future and would like to be able to use it in case mainstream trans forums get shut down), know how to use linux and command lines, understand some cybersecurity just out of personal interest, I'd love to fully understand what people like Mental Outlaw and NetworkChuck are talking about on youtube. I've tried looking this up but I'm terrible at search engine optimisation and have no idea where to start. So yeah any help appreciated."
Is there a wireless dongle that exists instead of using wifi? Meta Quest 3,OculusQuest,1i9md9f,2025-01-25 07:56:10,0,0.5,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/1i9md9f/is_there_a_wireless_dongle_that_exists_instead_of/,Unlikely_Setting_719,Discussion,"So I bought the Meta Quest 3 primarily for PC VR on Steam. I'm fine with using it wired except the cable it came with is wayyy too short. I've resorted to using my phone charger to connect it wired instead except that one is too long and is in my face all the time. This is fine but an alternative would be nice.

My headset I use is the Logitech Pro X 2 Lightspeed and that came with a wireless dongle and that works fine, better than bluetooth. I was wondering if the Meta Quest 3 also has something like this? I can't use WiFi cause my room is at the opposite end of the house where the router is, using wireless extenders cuts the connection speed in half and my computer doesn't have a wifi card so I use powerline adapters. There aren't any other internet ports in my house apart from by the door downstairs."

Looking to use Linux on a new laptop - easily compatible hardware?,linuxhardware,1i9lrmc,2025-01-25 07:18:58,1,0.67,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxhardware/comments/1i9lrmc/looking_to_use_linux_on_a_new_laptop_easily/,Moth_metamorphosis,Purchase Advice,"Was redirected here from r/linux4noobs 

This is a long post so the most important bits of context or questions will be in **bold.**

TL;DR: I can't ditch Windows entirely due to school requirements and do not want to dual-boot, so I would like to buy a new laptop to turn into a Linux-only machine. How can I find an affordable laptop that is capable of games like Stardew Valley or Osu (Lazer) that will not be difficult to find drivers for and get set up as a Linux-only machine? I'm not asking for the work to be done for me, but rather pointers for what hardware to look for or avoid.

A couple years ago, I bought an HP Probook x360 435 G7 running Windows 10 which meets my school's requirements regarding OS (Windows) and hardware (a built-in touchscreen and hinges that overextend to convert the laptop into a tablet-like mode and back). Long story short I hate Windows and don't want to fork over even more of my own personal data when I inevitably have to upgrade to Windows 11 in October, so I want to go over to Linux.

Unfortunately **I can't ditch Windows entirely because my school requires me to have access to a Windows device.** I have been planning on dual-booting Windows and Linux for around a year now, doing research on and off, but I have come to the conclusion that **I don't want to dual-boot** due to people struggling to get Linux working properly on the device I have because of driver challenges, and the risk of Windows corrupting something on its own partition being too high for my comfort. I already had enough trouble getting this laptop to work the way it should on Windows. Therefore **I would like to buy an affordable second laptop to install only Linux on and do personal things with,** and use my existing Windows laptop exclusively for my further education. **I don't expect a plug-and-play experience, but I would prefer not to have to worry about using the terminal blindly because my screen isn't being recognized and turned on.**

**My problem is that I'm not sure how to find a laptop that will be easy to set up for a first Linux experience.** I'm considering Pop!\_OS and EndeavourOS as first distros, in case that's relevant. **I'm confident in my ability to learn how a new operating system works, just not confident in getting Linux to run properly on niche hardware like my HP Probook.** I would like this new laptop to be **just powerful enough to play games like Stardew Valley and Osu (Lazer), both of which run very smoothly on my current laptop,** but I don't play big, resource-intensive 3D games on a computer. Other than those sorts of games, I don't need it to be capable of much - I mostly use a computer for word processing, browsing the internet, watching videos and occasionally drawing using Krita. I already have a dedicated graphics tablet for that, so I really don't need a touchscreen.

**How do I find a laptop that fits my specifications and doesn't need any niche drivers that may not have good Linux equivalents? I'm not asking for the work to be done for me, but rather pointers for what hardware to look for or avoid.**"

Other than those sorts of games, I don't need it to be capable of much - I mostly use a computer for word processing, browsing the internet, watching videos and occasionally drawing using Krita. I already have a dedicated graphics tablet for that, so I really don't need a touchscreen.

**How do I find a laptop that fits my specifications and doesn't need any niche drivers that may not have good Linux equivalents? I'm not asking for the work to be done for me, but rather pointers for what hardware to look for or avoid.**"
Help Diagnosing Ethernet Issues After Setting Up Home Network,HomeNetworking,1i9lnem,2025-01-25 07:11:26,1,1.0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/1i9lnem/help_diagnosing_ethernet_issues_after_setting_up/,PurrfectBoots,,"Hello,

I recently changed how the internet is distributed in my home, but I’m a beginner, and my technical vocabulary might be a bit clumsy.

To summarize: after buying a switch (TP-Link TL-SG105), connecting it to my ISP’s box, and linking it to a patch panel in the basement, I’m encountering issues trying to connect my computer from my bedroom.

Here’s what I’ve tried so far:

* **Tested other cables:** My ISP box is properly connected and working in the living room.
* **Swapped cables:** Tried a different cable between the switch and the RJ45 keystone in the basement.
* **Changed ports and keystones:** Tried using another keystone and a different port on the switch.
* **Tested another cable to my PC:** Used a different Ethernet cable between the wall socket in my bedroom and my computer.
* **Tried another device:** Used a functioning Ubiquiti MESH UAP-AC-M 802.11AC device, but it couldn’t connect either.
* **Checked and reassembled keystones:** I disassembled and reassembled the keystones (both in the basement and the bedroom) and ensured that the wires were correctly paired, though I didn’t pay attention to whether they followed T568A or T568B standards.
* **Direct connection works:** When I connected my computer directly to the ISP box using the same cable (since the devices were in close proximity), everything worked perfectly.

All the cables I used are Cat5e. Unfortunately, I don’t know the specs of the in-wall cables.

**The issue:** My computer repeatedly cycles between “identifying” and “network cable unplugged.” What could this mean? Could it be a damaged cable in the wall?

If needed, I can provide a diagram of my home network setup or share some photos for better clarity.

Thank you in advance for your help!"

The computer hacked all my accounts i connected to it, no i didn't click any scams or anything. I noticed something was wrong before i even put my emails on it when i found an app on the computer while i was deleting useless apps and setting the pc up. It was an app that allows someone to control your pc from any device, i deleted it and it somehow popped back up later but i got it gone now. When i downloaded chrome, there was already a pre installed extension that could not be removed that was connected to this app. I was able to remove that after a bit but i thought i had removed it earlier until i noticed my pc being controlled and trying to log into random online banks. All this stuff is scrubbed and i made sure of it, But then all my emails suddenly started getting logged into from brazil and the US.

Razer blade 14 2022 (r9 6900 16ram 3080ti) 950€ worth it?,GamingLaptops,1i9kveu,2025-01-25 06:17:39,7,1.0,12,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9kveu,Ill-Masterpiece7014,Discussion,"Hello Reddit, my first post ,sorry for my English etc. 
if you don’t want to read my essay here are the questions:
1. Is the reliability that bad? Maybe all the issues were at the start of production which were fixed on late versions? Maybe some inobvious problems or moments you have met?
2. How are the temperatures on it? Has anybody repasted it with something like pt7950(maybe you know some better paste to use?) and thermal putty(what putty to use(AliExpress 18 w/mk any good?))?
3. Can i do some heavy tasks on it with the lid closed in vertical stand? If so, how are the temps in this position? Can i connect a monitor and still use the 3080?
4. How is it in general? Like a laptop, I mean the build quality, screen, speakers, trackpad, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi… Do the key caps fade?
5. Thunderbolt 🤨? On amd?




 
I’m a happy user of Asus g513qm(r7 5800h 16ram 3060) and I have an opportunity to buy a used Razer blade 14 with those specs, but I’m really really worried about issues like battery, dead motherboard, heat issues and others. When I ended up researching it seemed to me that it will be easier to find what is doesn’t break in these. And also I found people who had zero complaints about their blades. The problem is that if it breaks I will end up without computer(no way) and the repair option is not available in my country and also will be expensive.

Also i’m worried about all that power being in 14 inch metal body. I use my laptop with lid closed in a vertical stand 90% of the time with external monitor and peripheral so it is like a desktop with a portable option. My laptop seems like it doesn’t really care because the temps are even lower, it doesn’t have intakes from the keayboard and the body is plastic so it doesn’t get hot which doesn’t affect the screen. But Razer blade is made out of some metal and i don’t if it sucks only from the bottom. 
So if anybody used their blade 14 or maybe another 14 inch metal laptop please share your experience. 

I couldn’t find any good tests of it while gaming with both cpu and gpu stock temps without repasting. So idk maybe if the temps are good I don’t really need all of that ptms and putties

I really like the simple design of it and the performance is better than my current laptop, also Razer blade was my dream laptop when I was like 12🤓.
My personal experience with Razer was very small but not bad, everything works still for like 8 years so I don’t know if I should upgrade please help me people from the internet 
Thank you!"

The German banking sector has continued to face challenges in 2019. One of the biggest long-term problems faced by the German banking sector is the proliferation of small lenders. The income of the banking sector of the country continues to be threatened by new global market entrants such as ING, which are minimizing costs by shifting towards an online business model. Germany is lagging behind as compared to other European countries in terms of using internet banking. According to Eurostat study from 2017, Germany ranked 14th out of 28 EU member states for overall internet banking use (56%), way behind Denmark (90%), Finland (87%) and the Netherlands (89%).

DHCP hell on GL-MT6000,openwrt,1i9i55e,2025-01-25 02:54:09,7,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/openwrt/comments/1i9i55e/dhcp_hell_on_glmt6000/,el_jbase,,"I've run OpenWRT on my old Asus RT-N16 for about 6 months and all was fine. A couple of days ago got myself the all-new GL-MT6000, installed the latest OpenWRT, then *https-dns-proxy*. Everything appeared to be working. I have about 15 wired devices (IP cams, computers, PI etc) and \~ 6 wireless on my local network. All wired devices have static IPs assigned via their own settings. I also assigned static IPs to all wireless devices using LUCI ""set static"" option, which is reflected in the */etc/config/dhcp* file.

This morning I woke up and saw my smart home wireless Xiaomi Gateway LED flashing, which meant it had no connection to the router. I started the LUCI and in the list of DHCP leases all wireless items had status ""DHCP Lease expired"". At the same time the LUCI list of wireless clients was showing all my wireless hosts including the Xiaomi Gateway as having an active radio link with the router.

I tried to ping wireless devices and none of them answered. So I started Nirsoft Wireless Network Watcher (it's a small util that runs on your PC and basically does a swing IP scan of the local network to show list of devices and their names), and it showed only wired devices were present. I restarted *dnsmasq* by typing *service dnsmasq restart*, now I could see wireless devices in the list and could ping them, but the Gateway LED was still flashing and it was not available in the Xiaomi Smart Home mobile app.

I rebooted the router. The Xiaomi Gateway reacted by turning off the LED which meant it connected to the router. However, when I started the Nirsoft Network Watcher I was really surprised. The Xiaomi Gateway now had IP [192.168.1.4](http://192.168.1.4) though set to static [192.168.1.230](http://192.168.1.230), while other wireless devices also had wrong IPs, but I could ping them. At the same time, all wireless devices were pingable at their static IP addresses set in */etc/config/dhcp*!! The Xiaomi Gateway is still not available in the smart home app, which means it has an IP, but no Internet access. Macbook has IP [192.168.1.4](http://192.168.1.4) though set to [192.168.1.155](http://192.168.1.155) in */etc/config/dhcp*. I can ping 192.168.1.1 from Macbook, can open LUCI, but cannot ping 8.8.8.8. *Netstat -rn* on Mac shows default gateway set to [192.168.1.199](http://192.168.1.199) which is probably why there's no internet connection.

The LUCI main status page also shows ""No active DHCP leases"". Can anyone please explain what's going on here?"
"A ""small"" project of mine - the Windows Me Update CD, now updated to version 2.3.",windows98,1i9hp35,2025-01-25 02:20:49,43,0.98,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/windows98/comments/1i9hp35/a_small_project_of_mine_the_windows_me_update_cd/,micbr,,"Around 4 years ago, I started documenting and archiving Microsoft updates for older versions of Windows for use on my older machines running Windows 3.x, 95a and Millennium Edition. Eventually I started sharing these update discs with some local retro-computing groups, including the community on the [Overclockers Australia forums](https://forums.overclockers.com.au/threads/showing-windows-me-some-love.1311910/), and started building onto them based on the feedback I received.

One product of this was the **Windows Me Update CD**, a collection of official, unmodified Microsoft updates, hotfixes and patches for Windows Millennium Edition and components like Internet Explorer, Windows Media Player and DirectX. Nothing unofficial or customised, just the essentials needed for tuning up a new Windows Me install.

> The CD contains just about every documented Windows Millennium Edition update and hotfix I could find reference to online, bundled with a convenient installer that automates the would-be tedious process of installing them one-by-one.
>
> It also includes a number of component updates - like DirectX, Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player, among others - as optional installs to provide users the choice of what components they want installed on their system. Perhaps for nostalgic reasons you would prefer to stick with Internet Explorer 5.5 and Windows Media Player 7, or for performance reasons choose to stay with DirectX 8. Or perhaps you would prefer to install the latest supported versions of each. It's completely your choice. And to ensure those components are running at their absolute best, the CD includes every individual update that was available for each of them too, no matter which version you choose.
>
> The installation packages contained on the CD are unmodified, original updates as they were available from Microsoft and Windows Update, and as such, can be installed without needing to disable System Restore or System File Protection first as is common with the various unofficial service packs available out there.

Last December I released version **2.3** (on the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/wmeupd-r2) and [GitHub](https://github.com/bricemci/wmeupd)) - the product of a year-long development effort that involved reviewing more than 6,000 Microsoft Knowledge Base and TechNet articles to find information about updates, scouring the web to track down any lost or forgotten packages, rewriting the automatic installer to make it easier to use and more reliable, testing the update list and automatic installer against a number of software and hardware configurations, taking notes and making adjustments based on testing and public feedback, and writing comprehensive documentation for all of it.

It's massively overkill - like every other software project I've worked on to date - but I'm exceptionally pleased at how it turned out.

I wasn't entirely sure whether to actively tell people about it, or how, especially given that the mention of Windows Me in some communities sometimes doesn't end well. But I saw [in a previous thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/windows98/comments/1el3n4l/a_complete_update_cd_for_windows_98_se_it/) that some people here find these kinds of community projects useful, so thought it was about time I mentioned it."

TIFU: How Trump and the Year of the Cock Put My Marriage in Jeopardy 8 Years Late,tifu,1i9gyvb,2025-01-25 01:28:38,0,0.23,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1i9gyvb/tifu_how_trump_and_the_year_of_the_cock_put_my/,Silly_Mongoose_9071,,"The year was 2016. The US was erupting in Trump vs. Clinton and China was gearing up for 2017 which would be the year of the cock. 

I was living in Beijing working for Apple and having a hell of a time living the expat life. Mostly partying and playing hockey—sometimes looking for ways to strike it rich and leave the world of 9-5. After all, that’s why I studied Chinese and International Finance. 

One day on Wechat, China’s version of Whatsapp, I saw an image that caught my eye. It was a statue of a giant chicken that had an uncanny resemblance to the soon-to-be Commander in Chief of the United States—Donald J. Trump. The Angry-Birds-esque chicken was white with golden hair in the shape of a poop emoji and one hand doing an OK sign while the other was pointing in typical Trump fashion. 

 It was hilarious. I had to have one. I looked everywhere online and found absolutely nothing. Even searching the seemingly endless manufacturing websites where you can almost literally buy just about anything that has ever been produced, probably with the exception of nuclear weapons, I came up short. 

So I did what the people wanted. I reached out to a manufacturer that made resin figurines and sent them a picture of the news article where I encountered this and asked them if they could make me one. Knowing nothing about manufacturing, I was shocked to find out that having one made would cost me $500. But if I ordered 200 of them, it would cost me $8,000, or $40 per unit. I’m not an economist but I love Costco and know a deal when I see one!

I reached out to my brother back in California who is a genius all things computer/internet related and asked him if he thought we could sell these online with a quick shop. That is exactly what we did. And we named it Cocky Trump.

Armed with a Cocky Trump Instagram account and Facebook page ([https://www.facebook.com/cockytrump](https://www.facebook.com/cockytrump)) my brother set up a website to make an easy shop for people to buy their very own for $60 plus shipping and handling. My job was basically to just create content and I was pretty mediocre at that, but it worked well enough to burn through the 200 units before the election and we walked away with a $4,000 profit, roughly. 

**The power of this stupid statue is that it is loved by Trump haters and lovers alike. I had just as many MAGA buyers as I had Clinton diehards. And everyone in between.** 

Flash forward to the 2020 election. Now I’m married, just moved from Spain where I did my MBA and met my wife, we have our first kid on the way, I just started a new job, and once again, Trump is running for re-election. One of my childhood friends now has a copywriting business where he consults for companies and his brother works in startups. I jokingly mentioned we should try to sell Cocky Trump again to see if we can make some cash. 

Unfortunately, they agreed. And this brings me to the bind that I’m currently in. I reached out to my trusty contact in Southern China and asked if they could manufacture and ship me 500 units—of course they were delighted. 

We had a couple of meetings, talked about strategy and decided we would go 50/50. I would front the capital and they would manage the website and the operations to get these beloved cocks to the masses. Then… nothing happened. Life happened. Nobody had time to do anything. 

…

Fast forward to April, 2024. I texted my friend and asked him if the merch was still in his garage taking up massive amounts of space. His response was simple, but not so subtle: “No, they’ve been in a storage facility that has been costing me $500 a month. I’m moving to Texas in 2 weeks so either you need to pick them up or they’re going in the trash.” 

Now you can probably imagine what decision I made and why my wife despises these little Trump chickens more than anything else in the world right now. I have 28 boxes measuring 4’ x 4’ sitting in my garage. We don’t have a big house. Our house is 1,900 square feet and our garage supposedly can fit two mini coopers. Keep in mind that we now have 3 kids who use the garage for their play time and activities, which is no longer possible. 

I am not willing to pay $500 a month for storage but I’m also not willing to throw these things away AND I’m definitely not willing to lose my wife over this. Hence my conundrum. 

**I’m posting this as my first post ever on Reddit because I’m at a loss and need help.** My brother is not interested in putting in the effort to sell more than double what we did last time. My friends are busy with their jobs. I’m busy with my job. My wife is busy raising 3 kids and being a fantastic mother. **I need your help.** 

I’m willing to part ways with these ugly misfits in bulk (I believe there are 500 but I haven’t counted, may be missing 1 or 2). I’m willing to split profits with someone who is smarter than me when it comes to selling online. Or I’m willing to sell these individually to whoever wants them. The best I could do was post them on Ebay a couple of months ago and I sold 4. 

Help me, I’m desperate!

As a side note, my marriage isn’t literally in trouble over this, but my wife is very much not happy about the predicament.

TL;DR: I thought I could sell a stupid Trump Chicken online with the help of some friends and ended up with 500 of them in my tiny garage with no idea of what to do next."
Having someone that you will never have,GriefSupport,1i9gbsc,2025-01-25 00:46:21,1,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1i9gbsc/having_someone_that_you_will_never_have/,Nice_Intention_823,"Advice, Pls","I have never done this before, let alone tell my personal feelings over the internet. Back in 2011-2013 while in high school, I had a few classes with this girl, very pretty, cute and smart. I would have 2 classes with her, all at the end of the day, computer classes. She had her inner group of friends that would sit behind me (She would sit at the far left of the table, where I would sit at the far right). I had developed an infatuation for this girl. I have always thought about her, day and night. I have always thought we would be a great couple and would have a wonderful life with each other, but I would never work up the nerve to talk to her.

I have never had a girlfriend. I have a feeling its because of an incident that I had with this other girl back in Elementary school around 2005. I think she had an idea that I liked her so she started playing with me like a bully in a way and singing that I like her in a sing-songgy voice. This will be another story to tell someday.

Anyway, back to high school. I finally worked up the courage to talk to her. We were just leaving our 2nd period classes. I think I asked her how her day is going and she said ok. I think she said some more, but I dont recall what she said next. I didnt talk to her again (still had classes together though) until the next week, same conversation. I had the feeling that she didnt want to talk much after, so didnt talk to her again.

After graduation, I did check her facebook page. LOOK, I wasnt trying to be creepy, but I wanted to see what her life was like. She doesn't know me from a personal level, only the small talk in the hallway at school is what we had between each other. I did see that she did have a boyfriend when they were at UF in Gainesville, She then went to law school and I lost interest and moved on to other things, BUT I never forgot about her, kept thinking about her a lot. Then a few months ago, I found out she got married to someone else about 2 years ago. That devastated me. Then, this week on her facebook page, found out that she and her husband have a child together. That crushed me, sealing any chances of connecting with her, in my own imaginary world.

I just wished that I was not to nervous to talk to her. Its been nearly 12 years since I last saw her at graduation. Its hard for me to let her go as I dont understand why. I would have been a great guy for her, and I think she would have liked me too. But I started thinking would I be a great fit for her? Would I amount to her likenesses and attributes to being a potential boyfriend/lover? Again, never dated anyone because, well, I think because of -well Im not sure if its possible rejection or being boring to her or -I I dont know.

Right now, I really need some advise on how to put this behind me. Because I dont want to remember her anymore as there is no chance of getting together with her. Just seeing this on my computer as Im typing kinda makes me feel better in a way, mainly because I said that I dont want to remember her anymore.

I would and should have talked to my mother about this, she would know what to say, but I unexpectedly lost her going 4 years now and Its extremely hard to move on without her, in addition to this grief with this girl in high school.

Thank you for any advice. Adam"

And Louis Rossman didn't make the situation better with his bullshit video.

Louis basically called steve an ungroomed nerdy creature that build computers on the Internet.
And said that linus shouldn't be holding Steve to the standards of an columbian university student that works on the financial Times (or whatever)

But this is also one of those arguments that if he didn't go to uni for a Journalism degree he shouldn't be acting like a fucking journalist???

Also all this shit about linus caring tomuch about his image and blaming him for not reporting on the honey scam is one big bullshit story.

Linus is the owner of lmg (with his wife ofc) and they probably have around 80/100 employees at this point. If you really think linus shouldn't care about his image you're an actual idiot.

Also linus wasn't the only ""big"" youtuber who knew about this. If you go back and find stuff about honey replacing cookies multiple people were talking about it. And also a bunch of other channels dropped honey as a sponsor. 

Are we also gonna check who those other channels are? And then blame them aswell?

Honestly this whole situation could have been avoided if Steve didn't make this fucking video and maybe only reported on the fact that honey was/is scamming creators and users. There was no good reason to involve lmg other than the drama and views.

Anyways Steve alrdy showed me that he is just a little snake and Louis is just a fucking idiot who made dumb comparisons and examples why this is all linus his fault.

Also linus ofcourse could have shared it with people maybe in discord we're more creators are in, or other chat groups but then again, who are those others that knew?? 

Anyways f yall and f all this fing drama you nerds."

I am a moron when it comes to IP addresses and networking and I can't figure out how to fix this.

I can get all previously funcitoning devices working via WiFi but only my work computer is hardwired and working now. My Xbox One, multiple switches, 3 different Eero Mesh devices all worked previously but despite power cycling everything, restarting a few times in the apps nothing will connect to the internet via ethernet.

I could of course manually set DHCP but I don't know what to do with that...I mainly have one Vintage MacBookPro that I use for BitTorrent downloading and the XboxOne that are failing to connect...they connect just fine with WiFi so I thought its not the Eero's or my ISP as far as I can tell BUT now it seems like my Eero Gateway that is connected to the Nighthawk Modem may be the problem. 

I have a Gateway Eero Pro Model: 81000113 that is routing LAN from the Modem to the Eero Gateway to the TP-Link switch that connects to the house wall LAN port connecting to the main TP-Link switch which routes to all the wall outlets in the house that have other to-link switches

There are a couple other Eero’s that are just extending the WiFi via mesh network.

I restarted the Eero’s and can’t seem to find any DHCP Eero options after googling that solution.

I definitely need help and am probably barking up the wrong tree turning things on like IPv6 in the Eero app.

I'm not like that at all in real life: Talking to people in person is incredibly enjoyable and there are no worries whatsoever about slipping up my words (which I accidentally do from time to time) during conversation with people that I have never met before at work or beyond it.

Part of the issue is that I feel overwhelmed and frightened by the invisible social strata of forums and ""meeting"" places online. I have trouble maintaining connections that I may have established and feel even more anxious when it comes to getting to know people to develop such connections. Somehow, all I feel that I know about the online world is that it devolves into either time, money, or a combination of both. That's all that people online seem to want from you and everything else is a means towards obtaining it: The niceties and pleasantries are only there for some temporary entertainment and the cashflow between goods and services or the advertising thereof beforehand. 

If anything, I want to be proven wrong. Yet, the odd sense of desiring belonging seems attached to the outward worth that you present on the internet. It's always the bigger the number provided by the number of people who click on a button next your username on social media sites, what skillsets you can provide to those who do not have such, and what purchased goods you can show off to the rest of the world. It all feels very facetious and surface-level. And I do not feel comfortable taking part in such escapades at all, but what else can be done? The largest social conglomerations happen online. Unless it is something that you have poured years of your life into, there seems to be no attachment to obtain towards something that may be a person sitting in front of another computer somewhere else in the world. So I tremble at the idea of having to put my best face forward as a complete internet nobody instead of just being comfortable being me."

Broke screen during battery replacement,Pixel4a,1i9bv76,2025-01-24 20:34:28,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pixel4a/comments/1i9bv76/broke_screen_during_battery_replacement/,Kotze_203,,"With the $50 from Google, I ordered the iFixit battery replacement kit. Of course, I broke the screen during its removal, inserting the pick between the glass and the display instead of the body and the display on one corner. I only realised this after putting it back together completely with the new battery. The phone vibrates when I hit the power button or the fingerprint sensor, but the screen just flickers a bit showing some glitch art. I opened it back up and double checked the screen connector, and there are no bent pins, so it must be the display itself that is broken.

Now, the decision will be if I buy a new screen for another $100. I am pretty confident I didn't break anything else and the internet seems to say that the screens are so fragile they almost always break when removed. Installing a new one seems very easy. But there is also the slight risk that it is something else that is broken (maybe in addition?) leaving me with another $100 lost. 

I could also salvage the brand new battery, sell it for a bit of a loss and just use my old 5X for now or put it towards another phone. I really don't want to buy another Pixel after this and the iPhone 16E will take a couple more weeks to release.

In that case, because I can't turn the phone off without a working screen, would a brand new battery be damaged by me leaving it in the maybe powered on phone to drain? Or should I disassemble it immediately to remove the battery? 

I am not actually even sure if it is powered on or off. When I hold the power button (while it is definitely on because the screen is flickering) to turn it off, it stops flickering after a while. Touching the finger print scanner won't make it vibrate anymore, indicating it has turned off. However, when I plug it into my computer, it prompts me to ""connect to Pixel 4a,"" which means it must be on, right?"
Help me uninstall Gamban for the love of god!,software,1i9bo6e,2025-01-24 20:24:40,0,0.29,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1i9bo6e/help_me_uninstall_gamban_for_the_love_of_god/,TheCream123,Looking for software :macOS: :Searching:,"Hi,

I am a profitable full time stocks, futures and crypto trader.

Last week I deposited a small sum to a crypto casino, lost it and got mad at myself for even trying it out.

Then I stumble upon Gamban software that prohibits you from accessing any internet casino, including bitcoin casinos. Without consideration I thought the software idea was great and installed it using the 7 day free trial period.

Then, all of a sudden my crypto trading wallets, sites and also VPN apps are suddenly disconnected. I start thinking ""what is happening, are they all under DDoS attack""?

No, of course, this f\*\*\*king Gamban app prohibits access to my CRYPTO WALLETS! I cannot any longer access my wallets and do my trading, buy or sell via my computer.

I've e-mailed Gamban but I cannot wait for their response. I have tried looking for a solution to get rid of this software via Reddit and YouTube, but there is not even ONE video or instruction on Google/Reddit/YouTube on how to get rid of it. How is that even possible?

I do not want to reinstall my whole computer. I've even read that that might not even work.

I think it's super shitty that you can install the app without them even giving a warning that you won't be able to access crypto sites or VPN.

I am so irritated right now. Luckily I was able to monitor and close some of my large positions through my phone.

Is there anyone that can help me? Is it the support that are the only ones that can help me? Will they even help me or will they think im a super degen gambler?

It feels like I've given away my computer to an hacker, honestly, and that I no longer have control over it.

I guess it will stop working in 7 days when the trial is over - but I didn't ask to not be able to work for a week..."
the only flaw in the book (the little monster never dies),EasyPeasyMethod,1i9blv2,2025-01-24 20:21:28,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/EasyPeasyMethod/comments/1i9blv2/the_only_flaw_in_the_book_the_little_monster/,No-Commercial-1361,,"Hey everyone,

Here's the issue that i'm facing: i've read the easypeasy method, put up porn blocks on my computer and i was completely free and happy. i've had streaks of 31 days, 40 days etc. just stopped counting basically. i had my brain fully rewired to not watch porn etc, but that's because in a way i was cheating. i hadn't killed the little monster. i just blocked him from seeing the images. i was just so happy to not have ED anymore and it felt amazing (cc: SR benefits) to have all this semen in me.

Here's my issue: because i had blocked any possible trigger, now that my attractiveness has gone up a lot (as it does once you stop gooning entirely), i'm attracting a lot of females, females that are exactly the kind of girls that my little monster used to fap to. so he came back. i'd get their instagram, and he would rob me of my sexual experiences.

albeit we are all free from the slavery due to the big monster, the little monster ""gooning monster"" is literally just a chemical reaction that you developed as a kid. i know that masturbation has 0 benefits, like not even one not even the pleasure. cue also the whole ointment story from the book.  
all of my life i could have had girls like this but my little monster always robbed me of those sexual experiences, 5 times in my life i've had the exact kind of girls i like in bed and wasn't able to perform... because i had M'O""d to them the night before.  
another thing too that leads to those relapses is the fact that my little monster spent hours of time trying to bypass those filters. i never killed the little monster, i just stopped the supernormal stimuli. now the supernormal stimuli that i'm really getting in real life are triggering this looser chemical reaction. it's like i'm not conscious. like a seperate entity takes control of me.

I hate this so much. it's like my child self is still in me and won't let go. has anyone ever had a problem like this before? Please let me know. what i'm asking for **concretely is how do you come accross sexual content on the internet (which you will inadvertedly) and not let the old little monster come back? this i think is the only flaw in the book. and there HAS to be a solution.**

Best wishes to you all."

My first homelab journey,homelab,1i9bcm5,2025-01-24 20:08:44,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1i9bcm5/my_first_homelab_journey/,Luis_0tavi0,LabPorn,"Hello, everyone! I've reached the 90-day milestone with my homelab and wanted to share my progress, challenges, and what I've learned along the way.

# Background

I’m studying Informatics for the Internet at a federal high school in my country (Brazil), and I decided to build a homelab to practice Linux, virtualization, and running services 24/7. While it’s not yet perfect or fully complete, it’s working well for my needs right now.

# How It All Started

It began with my Ender 3, which I bought in December 2023. It’s not the most reliable printer out there, but it’s been good enough for my projects. Although I don’t use it as much as I’d like (you can see the broken filament, that needs to be replaced), I’m planning to print a case for my server and an ergonomic keyboard as I dive deeper into the keyboard hobby.

In March 2024, I upgraded my Ender 3 by adding an SBC to run Klipper and NGINX Proxy Manager.

[My Ender 3](https://preview.redd.it/p8ji7sx9w0fe1.jpg?width=2296&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6090f258112f6fb60a6bc7fc108eabc58bbe3b52)

# The next steps

In September 2024, I bought a domain and updated NPM to use it instead of DuckDNS. Then, in October 2024, I got lucky when a family member gave me an old computer they were going to throw away. The PSU was faulty, but after buying a new one and swapping it, I got it running. I also added a 512GB NVME SSD and an 8GB RAM stick I had lying around, which brought my Proxmox server to life.

# Current server specs

* **CPU**: i5-7400
* **Motherboard**: Gigabyte H110M M.2
* **PSU**: MSI MAG 650W
* **Storage**:
   * 1TB Toshiba HDD (for TrueNAS)
   * 512GB NVME SSD (boot drive + VM storage)
* **RAM**: 12GB (4GB + 8GB sticks)

I plan to upgrade to at least a 16GB RAM stick and add storage redundancy for TrueNAS.

# Challenges

* Power Issues: Thunderstorms cause outages that shut down my server, and I’m looking to fix this with a UPS to ensure at least a graceful shutdown.
* Router Damage: During a recent storm, one of my routers got water damage, and its reset button shorted, causing it to endlessly reset to factory defaults. Luckily, my ISP replaced it and let me keep the old one, which I’ve repurposed as a wireless access point by removing the reset button.

# Networking Setup

* Main Router: TP-Link WR740N (behind the ISP-provided WR840N).
* Access Point: The old WR840N mentioned above.

I plan to upgrade my networking to gigabit, which is one of my top priorities. This will make the TrueNAS share more reliable and faster for daily use.

# Here’s a screenshot of the software currently running in my lab.

[Ignore the TrueNAS alerts, they’re just for updates and scrubs](https://preview.redd.it/qy3mme3j01fe1.png?width=1171&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7a15b6d8b4d11145731d46e4113904da4748651)

This is my homelab, and I consider it officially 90 days old because that’s how long it’s been running non-stop. The SBC on my printer is usually only powered on when I’m printing, but I plan to convert my Ender 3 into a Voron-like printer, which would allow me to keep the SBC powered on full-time. This way, it could also serve as a redundant part for essential services in my lab, like Pi-hole.

Another plan I have is to add a Raspberry Pi with some batteries to act as a mini-UPS for critical services.

Sorry for the long post, but I wanted to share my setup and progress. If you have any tips or advice, I’d love to hear them!"

There was pushback and those comments didn't include any Data to back their claims rather only to say I was wrong, and didn't know what I was talking about. My posts Flair labels are as Discussion for a reason as it is ultimately up to you what you wan to do with your device, and I offer reasoning and data to back my claims. I will ALWAYS INCLUDE DATA. So, I want to clear up a few things so people can have more information, and so you are able to see all sides of a discussion so you can make better more informed decisions on what to do with your devices and so you can cut through the clutter of misconceptions and misinformation that many seem to spread out of either innocent ignorance, or willful ignorance. 

  
[NVMe SSDs](https://www.crucial.com/products/ssd/nvme-ssds) are made up of a controller chip, a DRAM chip, and NAND flash memory chips:

* The controller chip acts as a CPU to manage all the drive's data read/write activities
* The DRAM chip serves as a cache between the SSD and any connected devices
* The NAND flash memory chips store your data

The more data you transfer, the harder each of these components will work and the hotter they will get. This will happen when you're: 

* Doing a lot of things simultaneously, like having a lot of programs open or keeping a large numbers of browser tabs running
* Moving large files around, which writes data in a new location while erasing the data from the original location
* Running data-intensive programs, such as photo/[video processing](https://www.crucial.com/articles/external-ssd/external-ssd-for-video-editing)  software or games

It will also take time for heat to dissipate once the SSD has gone back to being idle. 

If your SSD's controller chip gets too hot, it will throttle to prevent damage. It does this by capping its data transfer rate, which will limit your drive's performance. 

So having a passive/active way of cooling your SSD's controller chip is a good idea, as it allows your drive to safely transfer data at its maximum speeds. 

It is true that the NAND chips on SSD's need a variable amount of heat to perform effectively, and if you are a user that uses their laptop for mainly basic functions that aren't intensive, such as mainly video streaming/ internet browsing/spreadsheets/document writing, heat sinks are not necessary. However if you frequently game with medium to high settings, use video processing software, like to browse with multiple tabs open, and multi task with multiple apps and additional desktop windows open heat sinks are a good investment in order to extend the longevity of your SSD and to reduce any kind of throttling that would happen otherwise. 

If you’re concerned about your SSD’s temperature, check it frequently to see if it regularly runs above 65°C (149°F). If it does, you should consider improving your computer’s ventilation, updating or adding fans, or adding an NVMe heatsink.

[https://www.crucial.com/articles/about-ssd/do-you-need-an-nvme-ssd-heatsink](https://www.crucial.com/articles/about-ssd/do-you-need-an-nvme-ssd-heatsink)

There's also a case to be made that too much cooling can also negatively impact overall SSD health, and this is a case where its prudent to understand the differences in heat sinks, whether your motherboard already has an enclosure (which seems some Victus's do have while others like mine do not), and if you are just using your laptop for general use and not intensive gaming (which were talking about a gaming laptop here so I surmise most of you all are intensive gaming) where some heat is beneficial for the NAND chips. For heavy use some form of passive cooling is a must. 

This is where slim copper shiv/heat sinks and/or thermal pads come into play like the option I chose, they offer ways to passively cool while allowing the NAND chips to continue performing at their optimal temperature ranges. And again it is ultimately up to you what you want to do with and for your device, unlike others I will not make a claim that you need to do something I just like to present options for those that may otherwise not know there are options.

The NVMe port itself the SSD's plug into are also know to get very hot and if there is no cooling the heat generated will raise the controllers internal temps triggering thermal throttling. This makes another case for using a heat sink. 

For the layman SSD's require heatsinks to maintain optimal performance and prevent throttling due to overheating. SSD's do not need to be overheating for the throttling to kick in, it will actually kick in if their is a quick spike in temperature or when it begins to approach a temperature range close to the overheat limit which is usually within 10-15 degrees of the limit. 

Download CrystalDiskInfo and in the function tab and under Auto-refresh set the limit to bewteen 1 minute to 3 minutes, and under advanced features auto detection to 30 seconds. This will give you a real time temperature reading of you SSD's temps and maybe play a game, download a large file, or just something intensive so you can monitor the SSD's temps. The Windows tool will not give you real time readings, only an average based on 5 minute intervals. If your SSD's temps reach 65 degrees Celsius and above like mine did then using a heat sink would be beneficial because if its reaching those temps although still safe it is still throttling as the controller chip is designed to do so to help prevent overheating. and any kind of Thermal Throttling does negatively affect performance because its actively lowering the performance of your SSD to maintain lower temps. 

Every bit of data read or written to an SSD requires electricity to pass through the device to one of its trillions of NAND flash cells. As electricity always produces heat, the rapid access speeds of NVMe and PCIe Gen4 mean SSDs are getting fiercely hot. 

Above a specific temperature, an SSD will need to throttle its performance to protect its internal components. Thankfully, this ensures users won’t fry their device. But if you’ve invested in the latest, fastest, data-gorging M.2 SSD, having it underperform when you need it most is unacceptable.

Therefore, SSD heatsinks have become inescapable in use cases like gaming, video, or design workflows that see sustained read and/or write operations. Want to expand the storage of your PlayStation®5 (PS5) console? You’ll need a heatsink, [according to Sony](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd/).

“A heatsink is about making sure Your SSD never slows down,” explained Jared Peck, director of product management at Western Digital and part of team working on WD\_BLACK. WD\_BLACK was one of the earlier SSDs to introduce heatsinks for gaming and other workloads.

# What is thermal throttling?

Whenever your computer is taxed, either by an application or game that requires lots of processor power or by the use of multiple applications at once, the components generate heat. The harder a PC works, the more heat is generated. The machine tries to cool the components using internal fans, which blow the heat out of the enclosure via vents, but fans can only do so much. You can tell there’s a problem when the case feels warm to the touch and the fan is constantly on. If the system overheats completely, it will either freeze or shut down to protect itself.

Thermal throttling is designed to cool and protect CPU and GPU chips in response to heavy workloads, but there’s one caveat: Although thermal throttling protects the hardware, it can cause game lag.
