Afraid of sleepover due to body image issues,Vent,1i9xif5,2025-01-25 16:26:54,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1i9xif5/afraid_of_sleepover_due_to_body_image_issues/,Pathoskra,TW: Eating Disorders / Self Image,"A friend of mine wants me to stay over for a sleepover soon, and I want to stay over aswell, but I'm very afraid that they might catch a glimpse of how I look under my clothes.

I am very thin and bony (underweight), and also very sickly looking. I have bruises and swelling all over my body from hemophilia, and I'm very pale, and just don't look very healthy in general. I've been told by others that I look dead, or like a vampire. I very much feel like a freak. My ribs are flared and portruding, and a few of my joints are very crooked. I am also pretty young so it's even weirder, because you're not supposed to have these issues at my age. I don't know, I know realistically my friend won't even see how I look, and even if they did they wouldn't judge me, but I just feel very vulnerable only wearing pyjamas in the presence of somebody else. I usually go to great lengths to cover everything up with layers. 

This might sound very stupid overall, but please know that I don't usually meet up with others like this. It is the first sleepover I will be having with a friend since elementary school."

I am pissed at surgeon.,foreskin_restoration,1i9xfla,2025-01-25 16:23:18,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/foreskin_restoration/comments/1i9xfla/i_am_pissed_at_surgeon/,Art3r,Introductions,"Greetings.

Welp. I had moderate case of phimosis and frenulum brevum. It was annoying. Went to urologist. He passed me to surgery. Now I know that I was probably not even necessary as I later learned about those whole stretching thing. Anyway, instead of preputioplasty they did circumcision. I even have prepuce plasty in info card about procedure.

I did not notice immediately thanks to swelling. I don't really miss frenulum. It was too sensitive in my case. To the point that even touching it was unpleasant and it had precancerous changes so it would probably have to go at some point anyway. Frenum band? Never really noticed particular difference at this fragment in comparison to nearby parts so meh.  Foreskin? Here I am pissed. I went from something around CI-9,5/RCI-9 to CI-4,5/RCI-5 I guess. 

  
My goal is to get back to around CI-7,5/RCI-7. I don't think that I care enough to get more back but full coverage when flacid is must for me.

So I will begin journey shortly. I have no idea how long it will be but it's nice that it's at least possible. I at least have a bit of headstart compared to some. I wonder how long it will take for my goal."

2 Weeks Post Submuscular Surgery,CubitalTunnel,1i9xdyy,2025-01-25 16:21:18,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CubitalTunnel/comments/1i9xdyy/2_weeks_post_submuscular_surgery/,SlimKevbot,,"Hello, I've been dealing with numbness in my pinky and ring finger and tightness in my wrist since around September of '24 and finally got surgery on the 10th of January after it was identified that my ulnar nerve was popping out of place after various Dr. visits. For as long as I could remember, my elbow popped but I never had issues with it until this past year and since I do mostly computer work, PC gaming, lifting, and playing guitar, I chose to deal with this problem ASAP. They told me the surgery had no complications and that there should be no permanent damage to my ulnar nerve. The first 2 days I could not really move my fingers as everything was still numb. I followed their directions for rotating medicines, was prescribed Tramadol, and Gabapentin and instructed to take Motrin and Tylenol as well. This controlled the pain since I don't especially have any complaints. There was one night that I took Gabapentin too late and the pain made falling asleep very hard to do. Over the days my arm stopped swelling and being in the splint was very itchy.

Disregard the vein like line, my arm was just folded in the splint

https://preview.redd.it/5ms74uqwi7fe1.png?width=2016&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9507dddf3870b70508f5b5fb9e4d04a228d694a

Right now I'm recovering at home, had the arm in a splint for about 12 days then got that removed as well as the sutures and have been able to move my elbow about 90 degrees with no pain and my hand and fingers have full mobility. What I was not aware of while in the splint is that my elbow and the outside of the forearm are still numb and I am not sure when that will go away. I have also noticed that my elbow is still swollen slightly which is what is preventing me from bending my arm more. Finally, I believe the swelling of my elbow/forearm (and possibly just the surgery in general) has caused the nerve connecting to my thumb to be sensitive. If I move my hand/thumb wrong, like say flipping my palm up too fast, I feel a shock at the meaty part of the thumb and down my forearm a bit. I was wondering if anyone has experience with that. Is that normal or should I be concerned? Also, How long until my elbow is not swollen and my forearm and elbow are no longer numb?

TLDR; Submuscular Transposition surgery had no complications, 2 weeks out full mobility in hand but I cannot bend elbow past 90 degrees due to swelling, sometimes my thumb nerve feels ""shocked"", elbow and forearm numb"

My Surgery Experience,tummytucksurgery,1i9x2ug,2025-01-25 16:07:29,5,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tummytucksurgery/comments/1i9x2ug/my_surgery_experience/,USDE2015,,"
To start, I’m a 41-year-old American female living in Germany. I’m 5’1” and 128.5 pounds. I’m very athletic and work out daily. I have two teenage children, and let’s just say pregnancy wasn’t the kindest to my petite frame.

My surgery took place in Mainz, Germany on 22 January. I arrived at the surgery center at 7 a.m. and was quickly shown to my private room. After changing into a gown, net underwear, and a hair net, the nurse took me to the pre-op holding area, where I waited for my surgeon. I was a bundle of nerves, but as soon as she walked in, I felt more at ease.

As she marked me up, we started chatting about recent U.S. politics and what might happen next in Germany. It was a welcome distraction. When she finished, she wanted to take a photo, but I suddenly felt hot, and my ears started ringing—a classic sign I was about to faint. I had to lie down on the bed. It was probably just nerves, but I calmed down quickly.

The anesthesiologist’s assistant then came in to insert my IV and gave me something to help me relax. The anesthesiologist followed shortly after, introducing himself with a warm, funny demeanor. He promised to take good care of me, which put me at ease. Before I knew it, I was being wheeled into the operating room. My surgeon gave me a big double-armed wave, and the last thing I remember saying was, “Make me skinny!”

I woke up in recovery absolutely freezing and starving. As soon as I heard German voices, I instinctively started speaking in German, telling them I was cold and hungry. They wrapped me in a heated blanket and wheeled me to my private room. Along the way, one nurse said to the other, “I thought she was American?” I switched to English and explained that I was. They asked if I’d prefer German or English, and I chose English. I still laugh about waking up speaking German, especially since it’s not my native language.

My private room had a beautiful view of a cathedral. Since I’d mentioned being hungry, they brought me a tea cake, pretzels, and peppermint tea. My throat was so dry from the breathing tube that I had to sip water with each bite to avoid choking.

Shortly after, I noticed some congestion in my lungs. I was terrified to cough because I knew it would hurt, but eventually, I couldn’t hold it back any longer. The pain was indescribable—worse than broken bones or labor. I felt the blood drain from my face and almost fainted from the intensity.

Thankfully, I had no nausea from the anesthesia. I don’t know how long the surgery lasted, but I’ll ask my surgeon at my follow-up next week. When I woke up, I had one drain in place.

The nurses spoke limited English, and with my brain foggy from the meds, my German came out as a mix of English and German. Still, we made it work. The nurses were incredibly sweet—like grandmas (“Omas”) who genuinely wanted to take care of me.

During surgery, I wore compression boots to prevent blood clots, and when I woke up, I had a catheter that stayed in overnight. I also continued wearing the boots, which alternated between legs and beeped each time. They woke me up frequently and became a bit annoying.

The nurses checked on me every three hours to monitor my blood pressure, temperature, drain, and catheter. They also administered IV antibiotics and fluids to keep me hydrated.

The next morning, my surgeon came to check on me. She said she was thrilled with how everything went and complimented my results. I had a 2-inch (four-finger) diastasis recti separation, and she said my hard work at the gym was evident—I now have a six-pack! I had shown her a photo of a previous patient and said, “I want to look like this,” and while she seemed skeptical at first, she told me I now look even better than that woman.

I also had a breast lift, and thankfully, I had good tissue left to work with. Right now, my breasts look big (likely due to swelling and repositioning), and I’m thrilled with the result. I was a 32D before surgery, and my surgeon is confident I’ll maintain that size.

Let’s Talk Pain:

	•	Breast Lift: Barely any pain. It just feels like I had an intense chest day at the gym.

	•	Tummy Tuck & Muscle Repair: The first two days were rough. If the Grim Reaper had shown up on post-op day one (POD1), I probably would’ve gone with him. But by POD3, I’m feeling much better. I’m down to Tylenol and a muscle relaxer, and I may even skip the muscle relaxer tomorrow.

Medications

My doctor prescribed:
	•	Antibiotics (14 days or until the drains are removed)
	•	Tylenol 3
	•	Diazepam (a muscle relaxer)
	•	Blood thinner injections (10 days)

I also started stool softeners on day one and prune juice on day two. Let’s just say I may have overdone it with the prune juice—I had an excellent cleanse.

Biggest Challenges
	1.	Lower Back Pain: Walking hunched over and sitting in a jackknife position has been tough. My surgeon doesn’t want me to stand upright until our follow-up next week.
	2.	Exhaustion: Even small tasks, like walking to the bathroom or doing a lap around the house, leave me drained.
	3.	The Binder: I woke up in a binder instead of a faja, and it’s itchy and uncomfortable. I can’t shower or remove it until my post-op appointment, so I have no idea what I look like yet.

Overall, this was a long post, but I hope it helps someone! Honestly, the recovery hasn’t been as bad as I expected.

"Strep throat, swelling not going down?",AskDocs,1i9wz3e,2025-01-25 16:02:50,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1i9wz3e/strep_throat_swelling_not_going_down/,TheShadowPanda_,,"Hi all, I'm 26F from the UK and recently been given antibiotics for strep throat (Clarithromycin as allergic to penicillin). I've just taken my 6th out of 10 tablet this evening. Right now my sore throat has gone i just feel the lump in there but the swelling in my mouth (left cheek) doesn't seem to be going down at all. No matter what I'm doing the swelling is not getting any better. I'm using ice/heat pads, anti inflammatory, pain killers, I'm sleeping all the time resting you name it but it is not shifting. I'm concerned given I've only got 4 antibiotics left that the swelling won't go down. The swelling is so bad I can't even open my motu so eating is extremely difficult, drining is okay as drinking through a straw. I can barely talk and it's absolutely ruining me. I can barely brush my teeth either. 

Is the swelling usually the last thing to go even a few days after antibiotics or should it all go with the antibiotic treatment. I am feeling better e.g not many headaches and not as feverish but the swelling is just unbearable. "

He didn't respond, was I too forward or...

I had discrete structures 1 on Livi in the morning, and I live on College Ave, so I had to take the LX back to my dorm after class. Bus was super packed (no surprise there 🤪), so I stand up. The bus driver seemed like a person with kind eyes, so I had NO worries about safely arriving to my destination. My sense of safety immediately disintegrated once the kind-eyed bus driver stepped on the gas pedal. It felt as if we were in a Star Wars warp drive 🪐, ripping through reality itself, just to get from one side to the other of the Good Ol' Raritan Banks 🤠. Everyone's collective game of twister came to and end when the kind-eyed bus driver stopped at the red light. But for some reason, instead of the bus just coming to a full stop, it flipped over into the sky, performed a gymnastics routine that would have scored higher than Simone Biles in the 2024 Paris Olympics 🥇🤸 and belly-flopped into the Raritan river. Everyone on the bus died and turned into river spirits, while some turned into the geese you'll eventually see on Busch and Cook. 🪿🌊

  
Please be careful when you take the LX bus, or you might become a river spirit like me. Although, this might be a better fate than taking organic chemistry and discrete structures. "
Seeking Guidance,ClotSurvivors,1i9wj2h,2025-01-25 15:43:30,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClotSurvivors/comments/1i9wj2h/seeking_guidance/,No-Neat9257,,"Hello all, 

Trying to get some insight here from the hive mind. Back in 2007 I was treated for bilateral PE. There was no indication the PE originated from DVT. At the time I was 18 years old and heavily involved in club and high school water polo. The doctors ran every test available at the time and there were no indications of a hereditary trait or other clotting disorder or cancer that would have caused the PE. They concluded that the PE was likely a result of being kicked or some other impact sustained from water polo, I was on blood thinners for 6 months and haven’t had any issues since… until yesterday. 

My family and I recently traveled to Oregon via airplane from Phoenix to visit family the week leading up to our travel I put in around 150 miles cycling (I am an avid cyclist). We left for Oregon on Thursday and by Saturday my right knee had become swollen. I found this odd as I hadn’t done any activity since Wednesday evening. The swelling continued, we returned to Phoenix on Monday, on Tuesday I cycled about 25 miles and on Wednesday I took the day off to ice my right knee and lower leg that had now also become swollen. On Thursday while putting on my cycling shorts my wife informed me that my right leg looked very swollen, I was advised by my PCP to go to the ER given my history of PE and the swelling in my right leg. At the ER I was diagnosed with DVT, in particular a clot in my right peroneal vein. I have now been started on Eliquis to manage the clot. Today (Friday) I visited a hematology/oncology doctor to discuss next steps. I told him my history and informed him I wanted to try to get to the bottom of what is causing these clots. Without skipping a beat the doc recommended I stay on blood thinners for life, no additional testing, just drugs to manage. The problem here is that my hobbies that I am most passionate about include mountain biking, dirt biking, snowboarding, wakeboarding, waterskiing, and surfing. I would need to quit most of these if I were on a blood thinner for life. 

I need input from the group as to what next steps you all might take, has anyone had recurring clots linked to something obscure that I need to make sure we take a look at? For reference I am a 35 yr old male, fit, non smoker, and no underlying issues that would predispose me to PE/DVT. TIA. "
4 years of pain with no explanation,KidneyStones,1i9wgut,2025-01-25 15:40:48,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9wgut,Upstairs-Sea4525,Question/ Request for advice,"4 years of pain and no explanation

Before i start, i know that everyone here has way bigger and serious problems than mine but i just have 24/7 health anxiety and i wanted to ask here if someone can help me with that.
All the symptoms that is mentioned in the post might sound unrelated to eachother but thats what i’ve been experiencing for the past 4 years.

4 years ago, I started having weird symptoms that was all new to my body, the symptoms started by having left flank pain and trapped gas, i went to the doctor and he said it might be a kidney stone and he ordered urine tests and an ultrasound, the results were normal at the time. 

After that, i started having constipation, burping all day, lower back pain, night sweats but not everyday, feeling nauseous everytime i exert little effort and 24/7 bloated lower stomach whether i ate or not, it is just non stop till now.

During the past 4 years, I went to couple of urologists but they never took my symptoms seriously. Why do i think i might be experiencing kidney disease?

This might sound ridiculous and doesn’t make sense but i have been masturbating kinda vigorously for years due to depression and stuff and i injured my urethra multiple times, and I had infections in my semen few times since I was young and it was left untreated. So at the moment i feel like i have fucked up my urinary system through the years which as a result damaged my kidneys through the years as well

I’m sorry if my problem sound silly for you or doesn’t make sense, i just posted here cause i’ve been terrified for 6 months, i can barely study, eat, work or even sleep and it is ruining my life.

I’ve done couple of tests lately (attached) but again according to them, there’s nothing alarming, however I feel the some of them are odd for someone my age.

P.s I went to do an ultrasound a year ago, and my bladder was reluctant to fill quickly and the doctor said its odd for someone my age for their bladder to take this long to fill up.

All symptoms to date below, along with lab results and some images of the swelling I’m experiencing.

I hope you are all safe and i wish you nothing but happiness.

I’m 25 years old male btw.

Abdominal swelling
Abdominal pain- dissatisfaction after urination
– Bladder doesn’t seem to get full after drinking– peeing less than I drink– Ejaculation pain– pus in sperm– penile edema while flaccid– penile pain when starting to get aroused– dissatisfaction during orgasm– feeling that i want to pee everytime i get aroused– constant tightness in lower abdomen/bladder– flank and mid back pain (comes and goes)– pins and needles feeling in legs, upper area mainly– general feeling of tiredness and feeling of throwing up after doing an activity that requires physical effort
- shortness of breath

Turtle power to stop White belt psychosis?,jiujitsu,1i9wglk,2025-01-25 15:40:29,2,0.67,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/jiujitsu/comments/1i9wglk/turtle_power_to_stop_white_belt_psychosis/,Drug_Science,,"My most acute injuries have occurred from white belts. Two examples 1) A round house kick the face while I was passing their guard - needed l stitches above my eye. I bled for 15minutes all over the mat, almost lost my eyebrow. 2) white belt kneed me in the eye, while I was trying to safely and technically pass his guard. My eye swelled up and started to close. 

Trying to be safe in the mat, especially on crowded days…my new tactic with spazzy-professor-white-belt is to turtle for most of the round. And just come back to turtle. And be patient to wait for a blatant mistake. Thus, save my energy for rolling with people that want to practice technique and train jiu jitsu. I don’t even want to roll with most of these white belts some days because all I am doing is trying not to crash into my neighbors while they do reckless things. Jumping around like brain damaged spider monkeys. For example, While I was in turtle this white belt somehow, while break dancing on top of me interrupted the groups on either side of us. 

Thoughts on turtle tactics to tame young white belt psychosis?

Again, the issue is that I do not want to match their aggression and try to win training, and crash into others training on the mat. If they are flailing around like a blender, why put yourself in danger of a strike? Also, most white belts are hard of hearing and have a learning disability. So explaining concepts like “slow down” and “be careful” seem like insults that make them go more aggressive.

I am a blue belt that competes at masters 3. So my training time is precious/valuable. "

I just got my second tattoo today, and I want to start by saying that I love most of it. However, I've noticed that the hand on the mother and the feet on the dove appear quite distorted compared to the original design my artist and I had agreed upon. 

After thoroughly examining the finished product under different lighting and angles, I reached out to my artist. They explained that swelling can cause some distortion, which may last for up to two weeks. They assured me that if the issues remained after that time, they would be happy to do a touch-up.

I'm unsure if it’s worth going back, though. I’ll attach images below for reference. Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated!"
Trapped in a Life That's Falling Apart,offmychest,1i9w8op,2025-01-25 15:30:42,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i9w8op/trapped_in_a_life_thats_falling_apart/,J3llyB3lly92,,"
I don’t even know where to begin. I moved to the other side of the world to be with him, leaving behind everything I knew—my family, my friends, my support system—because I believed in us. Now, I’m in a country with no one to turn to, surviving off intermittent workers’ comp payments while dealing with overwhelming health issues and stress that seem to compound by the day.

Our relationship has been falling apart for a long time. The intimacy has been gone for ages, replaced by lies, gaslighting, and broken promises. I’ve tried everything—communicating, compromising, giving chance after chance—but he’s become so detached, so indifferent to me as a person, that it feels like I don’t matter anymore. His gaming addiction has taken over, and I feel like I’ve disappeared completely from his world. I have been fighting desperately, but I'm not just fighting alone, I'm fighting against him. I don't have the resources for it anymore. I'm sinking and I have to make a choice - I cant afford to not chose me. 

I feel utterly trapped. I don’t have the money to leave, and he can’t afford for me to leave him with all the debt we’ve accumulated if I move back to my home country. Even so I have nowhere to go - I am no contact with family, and drifted away from friends. And even if I do - I'm leaving disabled and I don't know how to begin rebuilding with nothing. ’ve lost everything I once had—my career, my home, my future, and my sense of self. I can’t see a way out.

Before we got together, I went through IVF with donor sperm because I wanted to start a family after years of infertility. I fought so hard to make that dream happen, but it failed. Later, I made the heartbreaking decision to discard the embryos because, if I ever had a child, he wanted it to be his. Now, I’ll likely never have children—I can’t afford IVF again, and my eggs aren’t viable for much longer.

My injury at work was another devastating blow. I hurt my dominant hand and wrist and have since been diagnosed with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), a condition that causes constant pain, swelling, and loss of function. It’s made even the simplest tasks excruciating, and fighting workers’ comp for recognition and support has drained what little energy I had left. The stress from all of this has wrecked my health—I’ve been losing hair, far too much weight, my blood pressure and heart rate is up, my mental health is deteriorating, and my body feels like it’s falling apart under the weight of it all. I'm in therapy, I'm trying to make the right choices and awareness of my thinking etc, all skills I've had to instill in myself over the years. But I'm falling apart physically, and grappling to keep my head above water mentally.

What makes this even harder is how much I fought to get to this point in my life. I’ve overcome so much—childhood trauma and abuse, abusive relationships, losing my best friend and housemate to suicide (we had been planning to start IVF together before he passed), an ex cutting me off from the kids I raised because I wouldn’t get back together with him, a painful divorce, and my brother’s death. My mental health was atrocious, I never knew anything but survival mode, until I really started fighting to heal 5 years ago. There were times when I didn’t think I’d survive, but I fought tooth and nail to recover. For the last four years, I’ve been stable and rebuilding my life. For the first time, I thought I was finally getting that peace and reward for holding on. For the first time ever I felt secure.

Now, it feels like everything is being ripped away from me again. My marriage, my health, my future, my dream of children—it’s all crumbling, and I feel powerless to stop it. I’m heartbroken, exhausted, and completely lost.

It makes me question our entire relationship - how unwilling he is to work with me or compromise, or just show me that he cares about me. The years of feeling undesired, making me wonder why he was ever with me. His words often say one thing while all his actions say another. He lies so easily, for the most unnecessary stuff to the biggest stuff. He's been completely okay watching me fall apart and I can't help but wonder if it was all an act. I was okay before I came here. I found peace in my own company & I was okay with the life I was living - to travel, to have a kid alone. And I'm so bitter. I gave everything into this life, and I'm left with nothing. 

I've been telling him for so long that we can't keep going as we are, that we are dying and there will reach a point we can't come back. That I can't keep fighting alone, I'm running out of resources. And it just gets worse. And I could feel myself returning to a place I never thought I would return to. My sign I have to detatch. I vowed I had to fight back in the day, because I wouldn't make it out of that headspace if I ever returned - so I make sure to always do what I need to stop myself slipping. So here we are - I've just bought furniture to turn our lounge into my room, and I think its probably a weight off for him. He's been sobataging for so long, he can rest easy. I just cant believe this is my life. I love him, because he's not a bad person, but I fell in love with someone else. Someone who made me feel loved, secure, prioritized and safe. I'm grieving the person I thought I had, and the future I've lost. And the fact I wasted so much energy and time begging the wrong person for the most basic stuff - to feel desired, to have SOME quality time, to not get lied to, not get gaslit, to follow through on your promises. To treat me the way I treat you. It's so damn embarrassing. I'm battling resentment he wasn't able to give me what he once could before he got comfortable, and just sad acceptance that we just aren't compatible. It's so hard to grieve when I feel like life won't let me catch my breath. "

 ""Nyeh...Kokichi, what's 4(x-5)²?"" Himiko asked on the way to school. Kokichi raised his brow at her. 





   ""You didn't finish your algebra homework last night?"" he asked.





   ""It was too hard..."" Himiko pouted. Kokichi sighed.





  ""Okay, hang on,"" he said, closing his eyes in thought. ""4x²-40x+100.""





  ""Okaaay, and what's the answer to *that?* "" Himiko asked, writing down Kokichi's response.





   ""That *is* the answer, Himiko.""





""*WHAT?!* That just looks like another problem!!"" Himiko cried. 





   ""It's binomial expansion, Himiko. You're not really solving the problem, you're just *expanding* it,"" Kokichi explained. ""Hence, binomial *expansion.*""





   ""Nyeeeeh...more like *exacerbating* it! What's the point of math if you're not gonna solve the problem?! Nyeh...this is why math is such a pain,"" Himiko groaned. Kokichi smiled and shook his head. As they arrived at the entrance of Hope's Peak, Himiko felt a tap on her shoulder. She and Kokichi turned to see Shuichi.





   ""I didn't mean to eavesdrop, Himiko, but if you'd like, I could help you with algeb-"" he began, but was interrupted by a couple of students in white uniforms with red armbands suddenly strapping handcuffs around his wrists. 





  ""Shuichi Saihara, you've been sentenced to detention for standing five seconds too long in line at the water fountain tomorrow after gym class!"" Taka shouted. ""Take him away boys!""





   ""*Tomorrow?!* "" Shuichi exclaimed as Taka's hall monitor lackeys dragged him away. ""What do you mean *tomorrow?!* That doesn't make any sense!!""





   ""Huh...that's weird,"" Kokichi said as he and Himiko continued walking. Everywhere they looked, students all around them were being cuffed and sentenced to detention.





  ""Miu Iruma, you're being sentenced to detention for knocking Hifumi Yamada da fuggout on Friday!"" one of the hall monitors said





   ""The fuck?! You better let me go, dispshit, or I'll knock *you* da fuggout *next* Friday!!"" Miu threatened. 





   ""Teruteru Hanamura, you're being sentenced to detention for sneaking into the girls bathroom next week!"" cried another hall monitor. 





   ""Oh, wait!! If you're going to arrest me for it, at least let me see it first!"" Teruteru cried. Then, his nose started to bleed as he grinned lustfully. ""I'd...like to see what girls do in there. I bet it's really exciting.""





   ""Get movin,' sicko!"" the hall monitor exclaimed, shoving Teruteru in the direction of the detention room. 



 

   ""Why is Taka sentencing students to detention *before* they've broken the rules?"" Kokichi asked.





   ""Nyeh...who knows? He's probably going on another power trip,"" Himiko muttered, too focused on her math homework. Kokichi gave Himiko a mischievous grin.





   ""Hmm...well, whatever's going on, I think it's up to us to figure out-HEY!!!"" Kokichi was unable to finish what he was going to say as a couple of hall monitors slapped some handcuffs on him, as well. 





   ""Kokichi Ouma, you're being sentenced to detention for mooning the entire band class on Monday!"" one of them said. 





   ""No way!! You'll never take me alive!!"" Kokichi shouted, struggling to get away.





   ""Would you prefer we kill you instead?"" one of the hall monitors threatened in a low voice. Kokichi rolled his eyes in thought, contemplating before opening his mouth again.





   ""Orrr...instead of resorting to murder, you can just take me alive! Ever think of that, ya maniacs?!"" he answered. 





""That's what we thought,"" said the other hall monitor, and the two began dragging Kokichi away. 





  ""Nyeh...hey, Kokichi? What's 3(2x+5)²?"" Himiko asked. When Kokichi didn't answer, she turned around in shock to see him being dragged away. ""Kokichi!! Come back!! You hafta tell me the answer to this math problem!!""





   ""Urghh...woman!! I'm kinda busy here!!"" Kokichi cried, struggling against the hall monitors. ""Grghh...looks like you're gonna have to solve this case on your own, Himiko! Find Kazuichi! He might be able to tell you what's going on! Oh, and make sure you wear a detective outfit! You'll look cute in it! And take a picture and send it to me in case I don't make it ooouuuut!!"" Himiko raised an eyebrow and examined her outfit.





   *In that moment, I knew...it was up to* me *to solve the case. I ran--really slowly, 'cuz running is a pain--to the nearest girls bathroom and pulled my mage hat down, stretching it over my entire body. When I pulled it back up, my outfit magically changed. Nyeh...and my hat did this cute flippy thing before turning into a black fedora and landing on my head! I was now wearin' a black trench coat, white tights, and some black mary janes. I looked in the mirror. Nyeeeh!! The beau was right! I* do *look cute!*





  *After changing into the cutest magical detective ever...and takin' a picture of myself for the beau...I needed to figure out some stuff.*





  ""Like what the heck is 3(2x+5)², for crying out loud!!"" I cried out loud. 





   *The beau told me to look for Kazuichi Soda. I didn't think I'd find him in the library; if it ain't machines or his galpal, Miu, he wants nothin' to do with it. Kaz was lookin' like his usual squirrely self as he placed the books from the wheely cart onto the shelf...as if he had somethin' to hide. I walked over to the fanged fellow hoping to get some answers.*





  ""Nyeh...what's the deal, Kaz..."" I began. ""...with all these parentheses and exponents?! It just makes things even *more* confusing!!"" Kazuichi jumped.





   ""Hey, Yumeno!! Don't just pop up out of nowhere and scare me like that!!"" he cried. ""Besides, I don't know what you're talking about. Not that it matters. I have to stack all these books because of your annoying-ass boyfriend!""





   ""Nyeh..*Kokichi?!* "" I asked. ""What does *he* hafta do with this?""





""He thought it was funny to play a farting sound right as the librarian bent over to pick up a fallen book!"" Kazuichi said. ""Then he pinned the blame on me! Because of that, I got kicked off hall monitor duty, and was made to help the librarian with library duties!"" 





   ""Jeepers! Ain't my fella swell?"" I sighed quite dreamily. 





   ""No! He's nothing but a troublemaker!"" Kazuichi cried. ""He needs to learn some manners, for Pete's sake!""





   ""Nyeh...I dunno who Pete is, or what he has to do with this scenario, but no need to be a fuddy-duddy, mister,"" I said, placing my hand on my hip. ""Gee, you'd think someone as doll dizzy as yourself would be able to take a joke and have some fun.""





   ""Last time I checked, a joke is something that *everyone* can laugh at!"" Kazuichi said.





""SSSHHHHH!!!"" the librarian hushed. Kazuichi turned to me, then lowered his voice.





   ""Anyways...what do you want? I'm busy!""





   ""Don't snap your cap, kid. I think you know what I'm here for,"" I said. 





   ""Well, judging by your whole detective outfit, I'm guessing you wanna know about the whole detention thing with the hall monitors, right?"" Kazuichi asked.





   ""Oh! Uhhh...yeah..."" I replied, discreetly hiding my homework behind my back. 





   ""Well...t-too bad! It's not my place to speak about it! Now, go away already!"" Kaz exclaimed. I squinted my eyes at him.





   ""You know something,"" I said.





   ""N-No, I don't.""





   ""Nyeh...try and give me the slip, and the only slip *you'll* be gettin' in return is a *detention* slip! Now spill, Soda!"" I demanded.





   ""A-Alright! Alright! I'll spill!"" 





  *Finally, he started spillin' his guts faster than a butcher after a fresh kill.* 





  ""I'm still friends with some of the hall monitors, so I know what's been going down. It all started when Hiyoko forced her way into the lead position of the Public Morals Committee. Ever since then, the whole thing went to shit!""





   ""Hiyoko, huh? I thought Taka was in charge of the PMC.""





   ""Nah, he may be the lead hall monitor, but he's definitely not in charge of the whole committee. But, if there's anyone who's behind all these detainments, it's probably Hiyoko,"" Kaz continued.  ""Though, I don't know why-"" But before he could answer me, the hall monitors burst through the door and attacked him.





   ""Kazuichi Soda, you've been sentenced to detention for cutting class during biology tomorrow!"" one of 'em said as he handcuffed the poor pink-haired schnook. 





   ""AAAHHHH!!!"" Kazuichi screamed. 





   ""SSHHHH!!!"" the librarian shushed again. Kaz turned to me, his peepers large and shiny, as they usually were when he was flippin' his wig. 





   ""Listen, Yumeno!! I'm sure Hiyoko is behind this!! Find her!! She'll do the math for you!!""





   *And that was the last I saw of him. I grinned to myself.*





  ""She'll do the math for me, huh?"" *That's when I made like a dog next to a fire hydrant and went.* "

Suddenly, it was like when people shake cameras in YouTube videos to imply chaos and next thing I knew there was a bystander at my window making sure I was okay. 

I had been rear ended by a very large SUV and was sent flying through 4 lanes of a busy highway and halfway down the street across. I'm so lucky I wasn't hit by anyone else going by.

I had aways worried about if I were to get into an accident as there's essentially no trunk, and I frequently have my kid with me. Even though I was at a dead stop and that SUV was a big, expensive thing and was going way too fast (it had just snowed as well), it didn't even knock down those back seats. 

My flabbers were gasted. Emergency Services were all surprised at how well the car (and I) held up. My car hasn't been released from the pound yet so no word on whether she's going to make it through surgery, but no one's hopes are high on that, which is disappointing, but we will find out next week I'd assume. 

I was diagnosed with a concussion (CT showed no signs of swelling or bleeding). I have been getting what I call intense ""brain zaps"" when using any sort of cognitive functioning (which is ... not great for currently being in college). I have also developed a stutter when it comes to answering questions that require any cognitive function or memory around the accident, but especially if I get flustered or frustrated. Things like that. But it could have been so much worse. 

If Ginger Spice doesn't make it I'll probably end up getting another one of these just because of this outcome 🤘

Anyway, wear your seatbelts y'all.

My friend wrote me today.

A simple message,

A message about comforts,

The simplest of them.

Breakfast in your own home,

Batter sizzling on your griddle,

Your stove.

The smell of blueberries and maple winding between,

And through, open cabinets and drawers, 

Making its way to your nose.



  
  
When it fills your nose,

It fills your mind too.

Your mind you used to beat the batter before,

Pace matching the rhythm of your racing thoughts.

As quick as they come, they go again.

The sides of your mixing bowl say the same.

The same of your fork as it works,

Side to side, separating and combining again.



  
  
You pour the batter,

And you wonder,

What of the people who will no longer have their pancakes,

Their home, their griddle,

Their stove.

What of the people who will no longer have,

No matter how small,

Their comforts.

The sizzle swells, it calms again.

You wait for bubbles.

At bubbles, you flip.

Flip like their land did to them,

Their brothers, their sisters,

Their home.



  
  
What of them you ask yourself,

And the fruity aroma meets the nerves of your nose,

Lifting, and lightening, your thoughts,

To, mmm, that smells good.

Your mouth waters,

Your stomach grumbles.

You lick your lips.

You forget about them,

For just a moment,

Sweetness overtaking your sorrow,

And you remember,

Simple comforts.

Sickly sweet,

Maybe from the syrup, maybe from the blueberries,

Maybe from the bittersweet reality of it all.

Please give me your best advice 😭,Blepharitis,1i9urdk,2025-01-25 14:25:20,4,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9urdk,vivaespanaxo,,"Started with blepharitis in early December, then turned into a chalazion by Christmas. 

Treated using OcuSoft wipes, diluted tea tree oil, hypochlorous acid spray, and warm compresses. Chalazion finally dropped from my eyelid to my lash line. It was so painful and the little white ball of sebum was protruding out of my lash line and falling onto my eyeball so against my better judgement, I gently pushed it out with 2 Q-tips. Cleansed, applied a warm compress. Eye was finally beginning to heal. 

About 3 days later - I wake up with an extremely swollen eyelid. Looks infected so I run it by doctor who originally prescribes me steroid eyedrops and antibiotic ointment for my eyelid. Did both for 24 hours. 

But then I wake up this morning with this extremely swelling which my doctor said wasn’t normal so he prescribed me doxy 100 mg. 

For extra reassurance, l shared photos and details on a medical forum to hear other doctors' perspectives. One mentioned a potential risk of developing preseptal cellulitis based on the photo and suggested antibiotics that target orbital infections more effectively. 

I brought that up with my doctor who ending up agreeing that cellulitis could absolutely be a concern, so he changed my prescription to amoxicillin with potassium clavulanate instead of the doxycycline. 

I’m having so much anxiety about this. I want to give the antibiotics a chance to work, but the hypochondriac in me feels like I should be doing more like stronger IV antibiotics and/draining to get a swab culture done? 

Idk. 😭😭 Please share any advice/anything positive that could help. I appreciate you! "

If you understand those currents, you can tell how deep they are. You get used to seeing certain colors. ""Vibes"" and ""the ick"" are tangible on such a universal level that it's almost not worth naming them. If you use them to plot out the ground for a structure, though, that's pretty cool.

The lights illuminated a sleek, white and grey room of plastic and metal, stripes adorning the baseboards, walls and floors, and was the only light source. The lights themselves were a dim yellow, and the monitor itself curved and masterfully created, no doubt made by a machine in some factory unknown currently. The monitor stood on a desk, and in front of the desk was an android. The android itself was just as sleek and smooth as the walls, monitor and everything else in the vicinity. The android was feminine in design, its body alabaster white with its face being a collection of optical lenses with no discerning facial features. And soon after the lights had turned on the android as well turned on. Its optical nerves flashing and emitting a dull blue light. The android in question was sitting in a chair, its posture straight and immaculate. And then, finally, the monitor clicked on.**

 

**“No Fredrick, the camera isn’t work- Huh? What do you mean the red li..Oh, my bad. Sometimes the lord doesn’t give me enough insight.” The man laughed as a man in the background shook their head and smiled and watched the camera. The man in front of the camera, was balding. He was evidently old and showed the years, wrinkles plastering his face. Thick glasses, and what seemed to be a hearing aid. They were wearing a thick lab coat, and a lanyard that held a card that read ‘Doctor Adam Fulger, Director, Eden Project.’ Adam smiled, before focusing and looking back at the camera. “Hello, Eve. It may take a few minutes for all of your systems to fully render, and we’ve allotted that due to the expanse of time that has passed.. We hope.” Adam said with a hint of glee as he grabbed a pen and pad of paper, and began writing something down outside the shot of the camera.**

 

**“So… I guess a good place to start would be, um, what your situation is. You are Eve, an artificial intelligence designed by me and a team of engineers here at the Ann Seton Foundation. You have been a culmination of close to six years of work in preparation for the…Well, we’ll get to that.” Adam said, his face faltered and quivered with sorrow. Before quickly steeling himself and smiling wide, his teeth bearing. “It is with my genuine hope you are online and functioning. I will be long departed by the time you come to. Your purpose, Eve, is complicated. For now, I and we intend to make sure you function and can understand your surroundings. Speaking of which, the screen will prompt you here after I stop talking to place your hand on the monitor. Its touchscreen, it will just let the program know that you are functioning and to continue the video.” Adam said. And then, the screen went black. A outline of a right hand appeared and the text below it saying PLACE HAND HERE**

 

**It took Eve a second, but soon she rose her right hand and placed her hand firm against the plastic of the monitor. The screen jumped back to Adam. “Great! You can uh, put your hand down now if you haven’t already.” Eve lowered her hand as Adam went on. “So, you can understand the spatial awareness, auditory and physical surrounding of you. High hopes!” Adam chuckled as he stopped writing and gave him full attention to the camera. “And now, for the truth. … As of this recording it is the year of our lord two thousand, six hundred and thirty eight. And humanity, stands alone. Some context Eve is that we first had first contact with alien life about five hundred years ago. We were rather fortunate, the first species we had met were the Tanglagild, a rather enigmatic race insectoid-al race… is that a word? Eh, anyways, they just so happened to head a galactic federation. Humanities wildest dreams were now front and center, and it didn’t take long for we as a race to hop right on board!” Adam smiled. “And so, humanity entered a cultural and technological revolution. Fine arts soared, culinary fields expanded, technology skyrocketed and even religion held firm and adapted amazingly to the new reality.”**

 

**“Which leads us to now. All was swell until, well, the Scurvatam showed up. I… The best way to describe them is a nomadic empire. They travel from galaxy to galaxy, eating, warring and destroying what they can. And, only seven years ago did they arrive. Our first indication of them being in the galaxy was when the Svel-Sok listening posts on the edges of the galaxy went silent, then military posts and eventually, the Svel-Sok colony worlds. To make a long story short, the federation had no way to even fight this scourge that descended upon us. Their numbers, technology and the fact they were nomadic made it almost impossible to fight. God, dear God it was a full scale invasion and we were helpless.” Adam lamented as his faced soured and pouted. “Didn’t take long until entire home worlds and races started to be devoured and killed. The federation as of right now is dissolved, every race for themselves.” Adam continued.**

 

**“As far as we know, we are the last ones. Earth. Our colonies are destroyed, the other races silent and our military is non-existent. How, I pray to God we had some sort of ace in our sleeves but the fact is that humanity is on the chopping block. From our estimates, their entire empire will be within Sol’s borders within the year, and then after that, only three days before they reach Earth. Which leads us back, to you Eve.” Adam finished. Suddenly the lights for the entire room kicked on, the same dim yellow lighting from the head of the monitor now filling the room. It was overgrown now, moss and vines and dirt mounds and large fissures in the wall showing the room had been long abandoned and uncared for. There were some traces of sunlight peeking through the fissures. And parts of the ceiling had fallen down exposing the circuitry and infrastructure above.**

 

**“You’ve, if the lights are still working, have probably noticed you aren’t in the best position right now. We are planning on making a video for every day until the invasion fleet gets here. And over that time we hope to teach you the best that we can on how to thrive and be independent. Which, any moment now the video will end, and the rest of your subroutines will turn on to where, you should, god willing, be given full… sentience. I honestly don’t know, Eve. We cant test you out right now for reasons to be explained but previous iterations seemed to have given promising results so.. I guess this conclude-“ And then the finally stopped. The monitor went blank.**

 

**After a few minutes, a command within the mechanical and electronic brain was received. Just then, Eve breathed. Or gave the impression of breathing. The lights in the lenses darkened and came back, as if she was blinking. Her head moved around, observing her environment. She rose her arms and hands and looked at them. He curled her fingers and lowered them, and then standing up from the chair. The memory of the entire video was burnt into her memory space. But even then, she felt, alone. Unsure, as to what to do next.**

 

n  **Authors ramble: Hi! Hello, this would be my second time posting here. The story above is something I had thought of and wanted to really, really write and so… I did! I'm considering on making it a series, by introducing each part as a new video and a new perspective for Eve until, well, the end. I \*want\* feedback and criticism so I can improve, so please leave a comment or give ideas or suggestions. Thanks. :D**"
"Advice for a piercing that just isn't working-- an unfortunate series of events, and should I give up?",piercing,1i9ugbh,2025-01-25 14:12:03,1,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/piercing/comments/1i9ugbh/advice_for_a_piercing_that_just_isnt_working_an/,No_Gas_5755,Troubleshooting/question existing piercing,"I got my nose pierced in November of 2023. It was a fine experience and did heal eventually, although it bled for several weeks, soaking multiple Qtips a day. I of course took care of it with the solution the shop provided me and didn't change it for the 9+ months they recommended. Once it stopped bleeding, it seemed to be completely fine, aside from a random flare up from time to time.

In October of 2024, I was playing with my dog, and she whacked my face on accident with her paw, causing the top of my piercing to come out. I'd never changed my own piercing and the shop didn't teach me how to do it, so I took what I knew about the size (18G) and ran to Walmart to try to find something to replace it with. They also didn't tell me what kind of piercing they gave me, so I had no clue what I was looking for. Once it fell out, I learned that it was an internally threaded post. In hindsight, I should have just replaced the top, but I didn't know that was an option.

It was a lot of trial and error trying to fix this. I was worried the hole would close while I waited to get new jewelry (had to order online because there's no shops near me, and Walmart didn't have what I needed), so I was just putting in a normal, plain stud. Unfortunately, expectedly, it kept coming out. I eventually put in an L stud to try to avoid this, but it came out. At this point I was extremely annoyed so I somehow, after several hours, got in a corkscrew stud, thinking that was the end of it. Within 48 hours, while I was sleeping, it somehow came out, like it was getting caught on something.

At this point my nose was so swollen that continuing to put in new piercings was just not possible. I had a lump on the inside of my nose and that side of my nose was getting swollen. I put in a simple L stud and decided not to touch it for several months, hoping that it would stay put while the inflammation went down.

I left in the L stud from October 2024 to last night. I woke up, and the stud was out and gone. I now can't get in a new one, and after trying to put in a new stud for just five minutes, I once again have swelling, redness and a lump inside my nose.

Should I give up and let this close? Are nose piercings just not compatible with my body? Or should I go to a piercer and see if they can help put in a new stud? I'm honestly just so frustrated at this point that I'm considering no longer having the piercing."
Depression after Rhinoplasty,PlasticSurgery,1i9u6qi,2025-01-25 14:00:54,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlasticSurgery/comments/1i9u6qi/depression_after_rhinoplasty/,Ok_Context5101,,"Dear community,

I had rhinoplasty to change a pinched tip of my nose to make the tip more harmonious. 
At least that’s what I thought I was getting, unfortunately the surgeon butchered my entire lower half of my nose and left me with a short nose with a tip that is placed at a 115 degree angle ( compared to 90 degree) because he felt it’s more beautiful like this. My columella feels like it’s been chopped of and my septum was overly shortened. 
All things that will not revolve with time and swelling tbh I actually like the swelling it makes my tip drop a bit because there is tissue swollen on it creating a lower tip of 2mm. Also it is hiding a bit of my nostrils now so I’m more worried about the swelling going even further down than what I already have. 

I really haven’t been well and my family admitted me to a mental hospital for clinical depression. I honestly am not able to recognize myself anymore in the mirror or any reflection I see and I break down seeing myself in the reflection in a cup of tea. 
I’m trying to come to terms with what I have chosen to do to myself but the shame sits incredibly deep and self-hate too. 

I’m in my mid-end twenties, so I’m not a teen that made an uninformed decision. I just really trusted the surgeon to do what we discussed. 

I have raised my concern to him, but have been gaslighted into waiting it out and him saying that degree to 120 is normal in females and that my columella will not retract further. Well that doesn’t really help obviously since I would need it to fall. 

I’m not sure I have money for a revision to be honest although the surgeons on RealSelf have looked at my pictures agreeing that he took out too much of my lower cartilage and I do have a retracted columella. I look like the grinch when I laugh. It’s a hard thing to correct a shortened septum, so that’s making me spiral even more. 

Anyone else here with similar experiences? 
Any coping methods than the usual you are more than your nose? 

I’m not looking for how to improve the nose itself, just advice on my mental state. 

Anything would be appreciated!!"

I’ve typically been the hyper athletic type, scoring perfect scores on the Marine Corps physical fitness test and combat fitness test - I was an MVP football player, rugby player, and baseball player. Always had lean muscle mass and endurance - ate clean with sober lifestyle - out of nowhere I dropped 20% of my weight and couldn’t maintain it, experienced extreme fatigue and weakness

Concerns: syncope and collapse episodes, lightheadedness, dizziness, confusion, 20% hypocellularity bone marrow, low WBC, low neutrophils, low MPV, low copper serum, low ceruloplasmin, low VO2

Hematologist/Pathologist ruled out most cancers, ultrasound checked internal organs without significant findings, no ANA markers

I was prescribed Copper Gluconate (8mg) and have had extreme reactions with this supplement - nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, inability to follow conversations, joint swelling, etc. - I went down to 2mg and had the same issues, no difference

The doctor prescribed an anti-nausea medication to help, which it hasn’t, and he has stated that the only other solution is a 56 day copper infusion IV - where I will need to show up to their clinic everyday for this IV. 

Has anyone else had similar issues and experience with this supplement? Have you tried a different form of copper supplement, and was it effective? Any insights on copper IV treatment and how it impacted your quality of life? 

I’m considering finding a new hematologist for a second opinion and I’ll be following up with a GI to determine if this is a malabsorption issue.

My so called life,Brents_Open_Diary,1i9tzq7,2025-01-25 13:52:46,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brents_Open_Diary/comments/1i9tzq7/my_so_called_life/,Real_Brent_Hatley,,"Dear Diary,  

OMG, what a WEEK. My life is so chaotic right now. Sometimes I feel like I’m living in a movie. A real dark and edgy movie where I’m the misunderstood antihero. Let me tell you about my week, Diary.  

It all started on Tuesday when I decided to hit up some local hot spots. I started at The Emerald Bar, a classy joint if you like good dining and good company. You know the place, right? On Central Ave, by that laundromat where the machines don’t work. Anyway, I strutted in like I was Nick Hogan, wearing my best Affliction tee and my best pair of army cargo shorts.  

I was about three PBRs in when I saw her. Bortha Ray. My first love. Diary, it was like a scene from a romance movie where everything slows down and the music swells except the music was our song, “Every Rose Has Its Thorn” by Poison, and she didn’t notice me at all. She looked amazing, she was wearing Cookie Monstee pajama bottoms and smoking a weed vape that smelled like birthday cake. Seeing her brought back so many memories. Like the time we held hands at the 8th-grade dance and she told me I had sweaty palms. Or the time she dumped me for Jamal, that smooth-talking jerk who stole her heart with his dark skin, deep voice, and gang tattoos. I still dot know what she saw in him. (Okay, maybe I do. But whatever.). 

I tried to approach her, but as I walked over, I tripped on the barstool leg. I played it off like I meant to do it. Real smooth. I think people were impressed by my recovery. I leaned on the bar next to her and said, “Hey, Bortha. Long time no see.” She blinked at me like she was trying to place who I was. Then she said, “Wow, you look like shit.”  

From there, I hit up The Biff Burger Tavern on 49th Street. It’s the place with the neon lights and the upscale clientele. I ordered wings and ended up spilling ranch on my pants. The waitress called me a “constant fucking burden” which felt personal. I think we connected.  

When I got home, Katelyn was passed out on the bed. She’d clearly had a few too many and smelled like semen and regret. The bed was a disaster with a half-eaten rotisserie chicken on the nightstand, mystery stains on the comforter, and one of her shoes somehow under the pillow. I sighed, being the gentleman I am, and decided to sleep in my chair in the corner.  

And, Diary, I’ve been thinking a lot about my life. I’ve realized I’m the Joker. Not, like, the lame Joaquin Phoenix one, but the cool Heath Ledger one. Katelyn is obviously Harley Quinn; wild, unpredictable, and totally devoted to me (even if she doesn’t show it in traditional ways). Sunshine, wherever she is, is my Robin, lost but always in my heart. Karrot? She’s actually really hot. Total Catwoman vibes. And St. Pete is my Gotham, baby. Dark, gritty, and full of secrets.  

Why so serious, right?  

Anyway, Diary, that’s my week. I feel like big things are coming my way. Maybe Bortha will realize what she missed out on, or maybe Katelyn will finally see the Joker in me. Either way, I’ll keep you posted.  

XOXO,  
Bort"

The Bar That Never Let Go,libraryofshadows,1i9ttjz,2025-01-25 13:45:07,5,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1i9ttjz/the_bar_that_never_let_go/,dewaitforitneva,Supernatural,"It had been raining all day, a day when the rain made everything feel weird. Each drop felt heavy. They hit your jacket and shoes like tiny pins. You could barely see in front of you. The city looked different too. The streets were familiar, but now they were covered in puddles. Those puddles reflected strange, wobbly images of everything around.

You didn’t really know why you were out. Maybe you were tired of being inside. Or maybe there was something else making you restless. Whatever it was, you were now soaked and lost. For over an hour, you wandered. You turned corners, but the streets felt empty. The buildings felt like strangers. Nothing around you seemed familiar anymore.

Then you spotted something.

A neon sign blinked through the rain: Bones Jazz Bar.

The sign lit up one letter at a time: Bones. Jazz. Bar. Then it went dark for a quick moment before lighting up again. You stopped and stared. It was odd and gave you the chills, like someone was watching you.

The bar was small and plain. It was squeezed between two tall buildings, almost like a kid hiding between adults. There was nothing scary about it, but there was something about it that made your heart race. It was just sitting there, like it was waiting for you. The sign flickered again, pulling your focus back.

You could feel the rain soaking your jacket, dripping down your neck. The chill made you shiver, but stepping inside that bar felt even worse. Still, your legs moved on their own, dragging you closer. It felt like the bar was pulling you in, like a fishing hook.

The door opened before you even touched it, swinging wide with a loud creak. Warm air rushed out, smelling like leather, whiskey, and something sweet that reminded you of rotting flowers.

You paused at the entrance, but the rain felt sharp against your skin, pushing you forward. So, you stepped inside.

The first thing that struck you was how dark it was. Not just dim, but truly dark. Shadows seemed to fill the room. The only lights came from little candles flickering on tables. Their flames danced like they were afraid to go out. The bar felt cramped, like the walls were closing in. But it also stretched back farther than it should.

In the distance, you heard a saxophone playing. It was soft but strange, a tune that crawled into your ears and wouldn’t leave. It didn’t sound wrong, but it felt off. Like someone was playing a lullaby in reverse.

“Welcome,” said a voice.

You turned toward the bar. There stood the bartender, tall and thin with sharp features. His face looked incomplete, like someone had started drawing him and gave up halfway. He had a big, wide grin that showed too-perfect teeth. His eyes shone brightly.

“Come in,” he said, his voice smooth. “The rain’s worse than it looks.”

Your mouth felt dry. “I’m not staying,” you whispered.

The bartender chuckled, his smile still wide. “Sure,” he replied. “Nobody does.”

You looked around. The tables were all different, covered in scars and odd carvings. At one table, a man with a funny face played solitaire. The cards changed each time he laid them down. At another table, a woman with three hands scribbled furiously in a notebook, her pen leaving a trail of smoke behind.

Then you heard whispers. At first, they were so quiet, you thought you imagined them. But as you stood there, they grew louder. Many voices murmured just out of reach. You couldn’t figure out where they came from. Nobody was talking.

“Find a seat,” the bartender said, waving his hand toward the room. “Or don’t. The music’s got time.”

You wanted to bolt. Every bone in your body told you to turn and run back into the rain. But your legs wouldn’t comply. You moved toward a small table in the back. The chair felt warm, as if someone had just been there.

And then you saw it.

Your name.

It was carved into the table, jagged and rough. It looked fresh, like someone had just scratched it in. Touching it made your heart race. The handwriting was unmistakably yours.

But that didn’t make sense. You’d never been here.

Had you?

The saxophone played a sad note, and the room shifted. The walls seemed to get closer, the shadows grew taller, and the air felt heavy on your chest.

“Bones remembers,” the bartender said, suddenly standing next to you. He held a glass of dark liquid. You didn’t even see him move.

“Even if you don’t,” he added with an even wider grin.

“What is this place?” you managed to ask.

“A bar,” he replied, as if it was obvious.

The whispers swelled louder, flooding your ears. You jumped up, the chair screeching against the floor. “I need to go,” you said, your voice shaky.

“Of course,” the bartender said, bowing with a flourish. “The door’s right there.”

You turned around, but the door had vanished. Instead, there was a tall, shiny mirror. Your reflection looked strange. The person in the mirror wore different clothes. Their smile wasn’t quite right.

“Go on,” the bartender urged from behind you. “Open it.”

You hesitated, hand outstretched toward the glass. The reflection leaned closer, mimicking your move. Its smile turned creepy, showing off sharp teeth.

You looked back, ready to speak to the bartender, but he had vanished. The whispers rose, merging into one voice:

***This is where you belong.***

You shut your eyes, pressed your hand against the glass, and stepped forward.

The world shifted. For a moment, all was silent. When you opened your eyes, you found yourself outside. The rain was back, harder than before, slamming against you like fists. The street was empty. The neon sign was gone. In its place was a blank wall.

You stood there, dripping and shivering, confused about what had just happened. For a second, you thought it must have been a dream. A trick of the rain and shadows.

But then you heard it.

Far away, almost lost in the rain, the saxophone played. Its sad tune twisted through your thoughts. As you stood there, stuck in the downpour, you realized it was playing your name.

Days went by. Maybe weeks. You tried to push away thoughts of the bar, to pretend it wasn’t real. But each night, the saxophone came back. Sometimes quiet, like a faraway whisper. Other times loud, sneaking into your dreams.

Every time, it played the same song. The one that was yours.

You started noticing other things, too. Your name began showing up in odd places. Sometimes on your desk at work. Other times on your bathroom mirror. Once, you found it scratched into your car’s hood.

You haven’t returned to the bar. Not yet. But deep down, you know it’s only a matter of time.

Because the whispers are still there.

And you know the truth: Bones Jazz Bar isn’t just a one-time thing.

It’s waiting for you.

And it always will."
Good vet recommendations?,Tucson,1i9tpgn,2025-01-25 13:40:13,4,1.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tucson/comments/1i9tpgn/good_vet_recommendations/,tucson_catboy,,"My normal vet office lost a lot of it's doctors and started doing some weird stuff and not really treating my animals well (constant pushes to sign up for pet insurance and sending my cat home from surgery without proper care instructions that caused severe swelling in her paw). I've heard NPR reporting about how a lot of vet offices have been bought up by venture capital firms that then increase prices and push unnecessary treatment and that's consistent with what I've experienced (my cat was 'prescribed' a forty dollar tube of literally just honey and such a high dose of painkillers she could barely breathe).

I know a lot of this treatment is unnecessary, my cat has had this issue twice before and it cost less than half what it did now and didn't need honey, lasers, or ""hydrotherapy.""

Are there any good vets that are independent?"

4weeks PostOp Tightness/Swelling,tummytucksurgery,1i9tnqm,2025-01-25 13:38:07,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tummytucksurgery/comments/1i9tnqm/4weeks_postop_tightnessswelling/,Loud-Statement7089,,"Hello! I had my tummy tuck surgery on December 27th, and while it is mostly going well, there are a few things that I am hoping that you guys can either share similar experiences with or soothe my mind about. 

For context, I am 22f, 176cm (\~5'9), and in the beginning half of 2023 I lost a total of 77kg (170lbs) which put me at 59kg (130lbs) and then I maintained it for just over a year before my surgery end of 2024. Because I had been so obese, I received a pretty significant muscle repair during surgery; the doctor told me that the muscles were separated just over 5cm (\~2inch).

At this point after surgery, I have noticed that the swelling has started to go down quite a bit on the sides of my torso, but the front part is still quite firm, swollen, and uncomfortable. My sides are back to being very angular/concave looking, but my front is sticking out so much that I feel that I look a bit odd and thick. Before surgery, my front was also fairly concave looking, so seeing it protrude so much is causing me a bit of worry and anxiety. For some actual numbers instead of just going off what I think that I look like, my waist is currently 7.5cm (\~3inch) larger than it was before surgery.

Additionally, while I can stand up basically completely straight now and do a lot of common movements easily (ex. rolling over in bed/attending my classes/playing and laughing around with friends), I still cannot do anything that would cause my stomach to stretch in any way (ex. reaching a top shelf/dancing/leaning backwards/etc). I feel like this is pretty normal though, so I'm not worrying too much. I will mention though that I think that I cannot do any sort of stretching because my abdomen is so tight-- if you feel it, it is completely hard/tight all the way from the top right where my ribs connect(?) all the way to the bottom.

I am very aware that I may be a bit too focused on the specific numbers and such and that these things may be clouding my mind when thinking about recovery/results/etc, but I'm just struggling a bit with feeling as though I have lost progress with my weight loss since my current stats are larger than my pre surgery ones.

Anyway, does this all sound normal, or should I confirm anything with my doctor? Do you guys have experience with this sort of tightness and swelling? How long did it take for it to go away for you? 

Thank you so much for reading and sharing your thoughts<3"

Anyone ever have “weight lifters shoulder”?,surfing,1i9tf5i,2025-01-25 13:27:38,3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/surfing/comments/1i9tf5i/anyone_ever_have_weight_lifters_shoulder/,rawdawgred1111,,"Just found out I have what is diagnosed as “weightlifter’s shoulder” its basically where the ac joint bones irritate  the joint and cause a lot of swelling, thus inhibiting range of motion, strength and causes pain. My doctor says the only way to correct the issue 100% is via surgery. I was wondering if any of you have experienced this, as it was an overuse injury mainly from surfing. 

I’m frustrated because I can’t train as hard as I used to due to the injury but really would like to avoid surgery if possible. They initially thought it was mainly a labrum tear so I’ve been taking it really easy for the last few months, and have lost a lot of muscle. I need to get it back. I’m not supposed to do any chest related exercises like bench presses or overhead presses. Do any of you have recommendations for chest exercises that would minimize further damage? Or other upper body exercises in general that are safe for weight lifter’s shoulder? Do any of you have experience with this condition? If so were you able to correct it via physical therapy and training without surgery? If you had surgery how was the outcome, and recovery process? My doctor said it’s a quick recovery and minimally invasive surgery but it does involve shaving down part of a bone to create greater space in the joint-the idea of shaving bone kind of freaks me out as it is permanent. Thank you for your input! "

Super Ally™️  z1e,ROGAlly,1i9t8cz,2025-01-25 13:19:28,47,1.0,16,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9t8cz,Ok-Comfortable-9146,Photo,"Here is what I have learned from doing 74wh battery swap with launch model OG Ally Z1E

Installation process was pretty easy. Just be careful with the battery connector. I have JSAUX backplate so I didn’t need to snip the backplate parts just snipped the parts under the battery.  The hardest part for me was finding exactly how I think the foam under the battery should be placed so that it isn’t on the ram, but it’s not in the way of me closing the device. I eventually found a spot I think worked nice. 

Upon installation I came across an issue that took me over 24 hours to fully figure out. While trying to recalibrate my battery, I realized it would charge up and windows would reflect that, but when it was on battery, the percent wasn’t moving down. After 3-4 cycles and me brainstorming why my battery percent wasn’t working right, I realized me having armoury crate real time monitor up was interfering with something with the battery. When I had the real time monitor up, the battery percent would freeze in discharge state, changing TDP caused the Ally to lock up for a sec, and it wouldn’t actually change the TDP. Game performance was relatively fine, but traversing the OS and going in and out of the game window was a nightmare. The fix? Not using armoury crate real time monitor completely fixed it. I can still use armoury crate just fine, but not the stats monitor. Instead I can use adrenaline performance monitor or another software and it works fine

Results: Well currently the Ally is running great. It stays between 50-70 degrees when I’m playing anything under 25w. At 15w I’m around 62 degrees. And it goes up slightly and slightly from there. So to be safe anywhere from 50-76 degrees. My Ally never goes above that unless I’m in 30w turbo mode, but the longer I’ve had my Ally, the least I’ve used 30w unless the game actually has a nice increase in performance. Other than that 25w mode nets you similar performance for less heat. And if the game is nicely optimized, 20-22w will do just fine as well and keep you below 72 degrees compared to like 83+ degrees when 30w or turbo mode. 

Battery life: Terrific. Amazing, perfect. Especially being that my Ally is a OG Ally from launch. Playing Yakuza Kiwami 2, getting easily over 2 hours and 30m at about 18w. 15w gets me about 3 hours give or take. 25w gets me right under 2 hours. 10w gets me like 4-5 1/2 hours and 7w gets me about 6+ hours. If I’m not mistaken this is literally on par with the Ally X. Ally has fully synced with the battery so I can play from 100% all the way to 0% without worries. Sometime the battery dies before it hits 0 but that means the battery has a lil more calibration to do. When I’m idling or just web browsing and watching YouTube, windows reports that I can get like 7-11 hours depending on watts the system is running at. 

Heat: the battery doesn’t generate THAT much heat. Sometimes you can feel it and the hotter the device is I think the battery do get slightly hotter as well. Never like scorching and it’s not even really hot to the touch. It’s more warm than anything. 

Potential future worries: if this mod is actually bad and if I am actually doing something really wrong, I guess I’ll find out the hard way. That’s fine with me I will look out for any signs of battery swelling or any issues with battery, and I will look out for signs of ram instability, but so far it performs and feel just like how it did before, just with double the battery.

In regard to weight, I can’t feel much of a weight difference either, feels about the same as before. 

The Ally means so much to me. Its performance, size, screen, speakers are all perfect to me. It’s a great package and the only thing that it was ever really missing is longer battery life. With this 74wh battery, it has indeed taken my Ally from great to Near perfect. It also (at least temporarily) has saved me from having to buy a whole new handheld just for more battery life. Like jeez, $400+$70 for a OG Ally and a 74wh battery is much more enticing than $800 plus tax for an Ally X with 80wh battery. I also swapped out my fan (fan stopped working) and put a skin on. Hopefully this battery improvement lasts and is safe because this will allow me to keep my Ally for a long time. Ally 2 will be nice but won’t be astronomically better at all. Same with SD2. So might as well make a DIY “Super Ally” with the OG Ally and hope for the best. Once steam OS or Xbox OS come out, my Super Ally will basically be the best handheld on the market. 

P.S. I definitely did this at my own risk. I have no idea of how it will be in the future or if it will last. So far I can’t see any real issues but that doesn’t mean it will last. From what I can see it’s doing just fine and I expect it to be stable going into the future. I’m not concerned about battery degradation that much, all batteries degrade over time and no battery is made equal, but going from 74wh to 56wh is better than the OG battery going from 40wh to 29wh through degradation. If you do this mod be safe and be careful. I will update if anything bad happens. If I don’t update, that means everything is perfect and I’ve been busy playing games with my 2-11 hour battery life.

Nerve Damage and Questions,InjuryRecovery,1i9t6pc,2025-01-25 13:17:20,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/InjuryRecovery/comments/1i9t6pc/nerve_damage_and_questions/,night_slay3r,,"I was wondering if anyone out there could relate to the issues I'm having? 
4 years ago I fell and had to get 12 stitches, 8 in my knee and 4 in my ankle. I basically bounced off the tendon in my knee, and I have serve nerve damage in the area. I'm not able to put pressure on my knee, barley bumping it on something causes it to swell like no tomorrow. I'm very thankful I can still walk. I can't feel hot or cold on the area and sometimes even skinny jeans is too much pressure for it. If i touch the right side of my knee I feel it on the left, which obvi isnt right. It also comes with the weirdest and worst pain I've felt. 

On example is what I calling ""the cutting."" It literally feels like someone is taking a razor blade and repeatedly slicing. Sometimes it feels like my injury is actively bleeding, I swear I can feel warmth running down my leg. There's a lot of other issues and pains that come with this, but these are the most prevalent.

Does anyone have any suggestions or have similar damage? Just about everyone I've talked to about this have told me that I should wear a knee brace. I can't, the pressure would be too much and cause my injury to swell. "

The finger itchiness seemed to subside but all the mouth and throat itchiness stayed. The nose itching started. I started antibiotics for my h pylori. 

Then I noticed my gums were beginning to itch and feel sore/ tingly, on and off. 

The worst of it has been my newest symptom, the soreness and swelling on my fingers. It started with one big patch of swelling but slowly I've started getting less visible smaller parts of my fingers swelling up and becoming sore.

End of may 2024 : I was drinking every day, barely getting through withdrawals at work, Already requesting an extra 90 days to pay off a court fine looming over me faces jail time, and GF staying in California clearly not wanting to return to Las Vegas. 

I bought as many Naddy daddy I could afford and decided to just go homeless, do community service, or ""fuck it all"" after my sixth tall boy. 

I woke up, 4 days later June 1st. I though ""I made a choice, but maybe I can still save this""

I went sober with a plan to get to California, Started making survival meals, walking everyday, and started to Do plasma donations to pay weekly rent and do my community service. I was not going to jail, not for 90 days, not for a single day, I wasn't even arrested, or paid bail despite the court errors in the paperwork. 

My friend, and neighbor was getting blasted drunk, stoned, and more, and was taken advantage of, and scammed out of money on a fake facebook apartment rental.

I took them in to help with rent, and save us from homelessness. 

I did my routine, spent hell cleaning the sidewalks and changing trashcans in downtown las vegas, often doing 8-12 miles of streets in 89-117 degree heat. 

  
After 119 days, I was free, but we were not making enough money and I drank. Homelessness in Vegas sober was not something I've ever done, and not sure I could face it again Sober. We faced eviction and prevailed despite the modest two malt liquor tall boy rabbit we both had. We moved and made it to a better spot. 

GF had stopped communication for a long while, and broke it off. By mid October I met a beautiful you girl online and wanted to stop drinking. 

This is when it got bad. 4 days sober, I ate, took a nap and woke up in the worst stomach pain of my life, stomach bloated, only hot shower would let me rest.

Then it got even worse, Itchy feet, testicals, arms, back. Everywhere I scratched Swelled up. My feet so big I couldn't wear shoes, my testicals swelled the size of a softball, my arms turns huge and red, my skin stretching in these areas the callouses on my feet falling off. 

No healthcare, no idea what to do, my roommate gave me a beer and in 6 hours it went away. I thought I'd have to drink till i died..... I tried again and my face and eyelids swelled shut. 

TLDR: Using a medical AI I had access to from work I was doing to pay rent, I discovered I had Alcoholic Gastritis, Alcoholic Generalized Edema, and a worsened sensitivity to allergies and lifelong dermatographia. 

I've been taking over the counter drugs and reducing drinking since, and happy to say no gastritis, very Mild edema, and dermotographia that only last a few hours when I stop for a few days. 

I am very close to safely quitting alcohol, getting temporary healthcare, and enough money from last job to pursue a much better paying jobs/work. 

I'm am Hoping my failed white knuckle attempt in 2022 with sober living is remembered. I'm hoping the easier rehab in late 2022-to-early 2023 and books I dusted off sticks. 

I hope taking the harder (way dumber) path this time is the last. I feel like its different this time, because I am very aware my brain, is not different, i am aware this time its not different, I'll have to do the work.

In the past, I've always had flawless healing, never any bumps or a lengthy process. This time about 5 weeks in it developed a very small piercing bump with some throbbing and when I went back to my piercer she recommended supplementing my aftercare with Epsom salt soaks, which I did and it went away within a week.
Now it looks like all my other old, healed piercings- no swelling, redness, discharge, anything at all. But if I brush up against it or even just smile too big it hurts like someone punched my ear. I'm aware that it's not fully healed at 7 weeks but since I've had zero issues in the past I'm pretty frustrated and was hoping there's something else I can do to help with it? It's odd to me that pain this bad isn't accompanied by any visual symptoms at all. It's pierced with a standard curved barbell and I haven't attempted to change it at all. I clean it with sterile saline twice a day and do a 15 minute Epsom salt soak once a day."

After leaking stopped I slapped some vaseline on them from time to time.

It's all calm now, 10ish days after all this. The right one is a bit more swollen still but doing much better, no longer leaking fluids or blood. No more scabs and no visible scarring.
Kinda worried about little bumps forming next to my piercings. Under the skin, kinda sore to touch. Have you experienced similar after a leaky skin reaction post-stretching?

I was told by two that it was broken, one did an xray and said it wasn’t broken so I probably sprained it, another one said it was probably sprained but could be a “weird skin thing”, two said it was cellulitis, one said there’s no way it was cellulitis, one said it was a viral infection, one said a bug bite.

“I’m sorry, Sergeant Varma. The power suit’s radiation leak is already fatal.”

“So I’m a dead man walking?”

“I- I’m afraid so.”

A bomb went off nearby, causing a brief EMP pulse that disrupted communication. When the connection was restored, Dr. Abode heard Sergeant Varma yelling, “I said, how long do I have?”

“If we get you back to base and get you out of the suit now, you’ll have maybe a few weeks.”

“I’ve read what that death is like.”

He jammed Christopher’s Jerry-rigged audio override into the backup comms port and selected the “Last Stand,” playlist. His suit’s external speakers started blasting an orchestral swell that became the background for a man speaking.

>*""Truth is, I thought it mattered*

>*I thought that music mattered*

>*But does it? Bollocks!*

>*Not compared to how people matter”*

“Fuck it. We ball,” the Sergeant said, running up the hill where he'd cratered. When he crested the hill, the music blasted and every combatant heard:

>*“I get knocked down, but I get up again, you’re never gonna keep me down.”*

Translator software told the enemy what the lyrics meant. The human soldiers cheered and redoubled their attacks. Their allies quickly followed suit. Half of the enemy were firing wildly at this specter of smoking, blasted, yet still operational power armor. This left them open to counter-attack by the human soldiers.

Varma was putting his suit through every evasive and defensive maneuver it could still do when a group of enemy troops charged, doubling over before even reaching him, their scales blistering from the radiation.

“Ohh! Sick radiation burn!” he said through the suit’s speakers. Three more groups that had been approaching backed off. The Sargent ran at them and they fled in terror.

“I take a Whiskey Drink” the song continued as he activated the suit’s flight thrusters, rose above the battle, glowing with energy and radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, and aimed himself at the enemy flag ship. The enemy’s air advantage evaporated as the Dead Man Flying became the target of every ship in the sky, yet the best they could manage were some glancing hits. It was the radiation. The damaged suit was spewing out enough radiation that it was interfering with their targeting systems.

“What do you mean the targeting software thinks that’s a nebula?” One captain screamed just before his ship was destroyed by friendly fire.

A guitar riff by a man who died at 24 hunted the enemy flying suits. A rash of radiation blazed across their censors as the music consumed what remained of their audio.

>*Men of five, still alive, through the raging glow*

>*Gone insane from the pain that they surely know*

Varma felt those words down to his bones. What hadn’t been numbed by pain medication and adrenaline hurt like Hell. He was pretty sure the emergency tourniquet system had already cinched off half his right leg, but there wasn’t enough sensation left for him to be sure. He flew, weaving between the ships making sure there was always someone else for them to hit when they missed. Scattered bits of battlefield intel were still reaching his HUD, giving him just enough notice to look up and see a missile that had been aimed at him, tearing into the Flagship. The ship was pockmarked with friendly-fire damage. Sergeant Varma adjusted course to aim for one of the fresh openings. He was almost there.

>*Don't take your eyes off the trigger!*

>*I'm not to blame if your world turns to black*

>*As your eyes start to blister!*

>*There's just no hope for our final embrace*

On the bridge of the invading fleet’s flagship, Ambassador Wenk stared at the display in horror. “They should have recalled him by now,” he said aloud, mostly to himself.

Emperor Xarxos, responded dryly, “Clearly they haven’t. Is this some new drone tech you didn’t tell us about?”

“Emperor, I told you everything I know. That’s a human-piloted mech suit but we don’t have radiation shielding that can protect a man in something that small.”

“I’ve had to shoot down ships in my own armada because of that one little lump of flesh! The Kael'zargoth is gone! They wouldn’t stop firing at HIM and hit THIS SHIP three times! What is that suit, flown by a ghost?” The emperor screamed.

Ambassador Wenk’s jaw went slack , “Oh crap,” he muttered.

“What’s THAT supposed to mean!” Emperor Xarxos screamed back, his voice now somewhat hysterical. Half the scaled faces on the bridge were watching this exchange between their emperor and the human traitor.

“Whoever’s in that suit won’t survive and he knows it,” Wenk said.

“Then why isn’t he fleeing?”

Wenk heard the dim, crackly, battlefield music from a nearby operations console.

>*You were told to run away*

>*Soak the place, and light the flame*

>*Pay the price for your betrayal*

>*Your betrayal, your betrayal!*

“It’s a human thing, a ‘Hail Mary,’” Wenk said, “a ‘Swan Song.’ We have a lot of terms for it, but they’re going to expend themselves fighting. They’re on a Kamikaze Missi-.” He stopped mid-sentence and looked back at the displays. “A Kamikaze Mission. Oh God. Oh God. Emperor, I think that pilot intends to detonate their suit’s core inside the flagship.”

“How damaging could that be?” A general nearly barked at him.

“That’s a Mark-64, maybe a 65. If he gets more than a thousand meters into the ship, the blast could breach the core.”

Outside the ship, Varma was firing the braking thrusters. “Didn’t expect I’d get to land again,” he said to himself as the suit’s boots landed heavily on the charred deck of the flagship. Blasts from assorted small arms pinged off the suit’s armor. Desperate invaders were firing at him from the edges of the blast hole he’d flown through.

He waited a moment, observing, and enjoying the instrumental intro to the next song on the playlist. The ship was too high for the atmosphere to be breathable, so the longer he stood still, the more the crew charged out and asphyxiated trying to shoot him. The lyrics started.

>*End of passion play, crumbling away, I'm your source of self-destruction*

>*Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear, leading on your death's construction*

>*Taste me, you will see, more is all you need*

>*Dedicated to how I'm killing you*

“That’s no way for a soldier to die, even if they came here to eat my friends,” Varma said, opening fire with his remaining plasma munitions and heading further into the still-depressurizing flagship.

>*Come crawling faster (Faster)*

>*Obey your master (Master)*

>*Your life burns faster (Faster)*

>*Obey your master, master*

All communication with the suit and its pilot were lost soon after, but his efforts had born fruit. It had been enough, just enough, to turn the tide of battle. The Goddess Nike had decided the human's response to unavoidable death deserved her attention.

Dusk was settling, and the only ship left in the sky was the invading fleet’s flagship, but it had stopped firing hours before. There were periodic explosions on the ship, and its antigravity systems were failing. It was slowly listing towards the first impact crater from their invasion. That’s when communication with the Dead Man Flying was restored.

The footage was grainy and distorted by radiation, but it was from inside what appeared to be a throne room. There was no music. The enemy Admiral was on the ground, pointing a gun at the viewer. The infamous Ambassador Wenk was curled into a fetal position on the floor nearby, whimpering, his body covered in radiation burns.

Emperor Xarxos himself was on a throne behind the Admiral. The actual Emperor! This was the first anyone planetside had heard that the Emperor was even present for the invasion. Xarxos was haughty and proud, but was visibly blistering from the radiation. “This is where you die, human.”

“No Shit Sherlock,” Sergeant Varma said, his voice ragged and tired. “This song’s the last dance of the evening.”

The music resumed, mid-song. *“We are the Champions, we are the champions,”* at that, the Sargent joined the recording to sing, *“Of the world!”*

The feed went dead, and the flagship was rocked by a massive explosion deep inside its armored core. It dropped from the sky like a stone, its pointed bow shattering as it plowed into the green glass below.

The few invaders that were still fighting surrendered at this. The ship burned through the night, providing the light by which the remaining soldiers were detained."

My OB/GYN agreed and I was sent for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. Both said I had extremely dense breasts and areas of concern but nothing specifically noted. So I was referred for MRI. That came back as BIRADS 4 with prominent bilateral lymph nodes. I have another week still until my surgical consult and a few days after that an ultrasound on my lymph nodes. It’s so awkward because I’m doing all my appts at the breast cancer center but I’m not a breast cancer patient and so it feels disjointed trying to get information. I’m kind of just preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. I received my MRI images and my lymph nodes are round, not oval and very large. They look almost solid. Trying to remain calm but also in this internal panic too. Ugh. The waiting is the worst. I just want to know what to prepare for and what my future holds…."

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I set the alarm app on my iPhone for 6:30 AM Saturday morning so Brooke and I could get an early start. We had a lot of prepping and cooking to do in order to be ready to serve as many as twelve guests later that day: hors d’oeuvres and cocktails were scheduled for 6 PM and dinner was to be served at 7:30.

However, we were awoken not by the obnoxious ringing noise on my phone at 6 AM, but rather by repeated rings of our doorbell an hour earlier. I was lying next to Brooke in bed, startled out of a deep sleep by the insistent sound. Brooke was a deeper sleeper than I was, so I was the first one to get up out of bed. As was typical, I was sleeping in an old T-shirt and a pair of panties, so I quickly put on my bathrobe and hurried downstairs to answer the door. It was still completely dark outside. Standing on our porch was Luke’s brother, Kevin.

“Took you long enough,” he said, rudely.

“Hi, Kevin,” I replied, drowsily. “I’m sorry. We weren’t expecting you. Did you tell one of us you planned on coming by this morning?”

Behind me, I heard Brooke say, “Who’s there, Walter?”

“It’s okay, darling. It’s just Kevin”

“‘Just Kevin.’ I’m not sure that’s a smart way to talk about your new boss, Wally. I sure hope you’ve been studying up on those DIY plumbing videos on YouTube, like I told you to in December,” Kevin said, walking boldly past me into our house.

“You’ve gotta be kidding me,” said Brooke, sleepy and annoyed. She was too groggy to be polite. I’m fairly certain that had she been alert, she would’ve been more careful in her choice of words and in her attitude.

“Nice to see you, too, Brooke. Also not a very respectful way to talk to your future babysitter. That’s okay, there’ll be plenty of time to teach you both to mind your manners later. I’m here to drop off Luke’s stuff. Put some clothes on Wally, and help me bring in the boxes. They’re in back of my truck.”

“Sure, Kevin. I’ll be right back,” I said, turning to go upstairs to change.

Kevin interrupted me, “You’re going to have to get back into the habit of calling me ‘sir’, son. Since I’m going to be both your boss and your babysitter from now on,” the brash teenager said to me, chuckling.

“This is ridiculous. Walter is not your son, Kevin,” said Brooke.

It was, indeed, completely ridiculous for an 18-year-old plumber to be calling a 40-year-old literature professor “son.” Nevertheless, Kevin was in the midst of his “I told you so” visit, clearly in a position of power now. Though we then had no idea of the depth and extent of it, Brooke and I were in a position of weakness, what was to become our new normal. It certainly was not a good idea to antagonize him. 

“Be careful, Brooke,” I warned.

“You better listen to your little hubbie, Brooke, if you know what’s good for you. You’re going to be calling me ‘sir’ soon enough yourself,” Kevin said, with an arrogant smirk very similar to that of his big brother.

Brooke glared at him, but at least didn’t say anything else to challenge him. 

As I started to go back up the stairs, Kevin interrupted me, “Wait a minute, son. What are you wearing under that robe? Turn around and take it off.”

“Um…yes, sir,” I said, reluctantly removing my robe. I saw Brooke roll her eyes.

Brooke had told me that she planned to lock me back in my chastity cage that afternoon before we went over to Luke’s house. But at that moment, I was still free. Like many men, I nearly always woke up with a hard-on – the morning wood, I believe it is called – and I was probably harder than on most mornings given this humiliating encounter with Kevin (the usual collusion between my treacherous cock and my submissive brain). He stared down at my cock, tenting out my panties.

“Ha ha. Just like I thought. You’re pathetic, Wally. It’s no wonder why Brooke begged Luke to start banging her again. She needs a real man’s cock, not your pansy pin dick. You too, Brooke. Let’s see what – If anything, ha ha – you’ve got on under your robe.”

Brooke continued to regard Kevin with a death glare, but, while she didn’t completely remove her robe as I had, she did open it up momentarily, giving him a glimpse of her body, naked except for her panties. Whereas I had on a fuller pair of navy blue boyshorts panties (trying to hide from Brooke the lingering effects of Paul’s strapping, as my ass was still quite red when we went to bed last night), Brooke was wearing a pair of maroon, cheeky panties (quite skimpy). Her nipples were rock hard, a fact which did not escape Kevin’s attention. We both saw him look directly at her breasts and smile, before she closed her robe.

“You must be cold, Brooke. Or, maybe, you’re actually hot. Ha ha. It is pretty warm in here. You two really should start wearing matching panties. Get your ass upstairs and get dressed, Wally. My first job is across town in 45 minutes. I don’t have all fucking day. How about a cup of coffee, Brooke?” he said, more an order than a request.

“I was just about to make some anyhow,” Brooke said, testily, before walking towards the kitchen. I ran upstairs and slipped on a pair of sweatpants.

Probably because he was in a hurry, Kevin helped me bring the boxes into the house. However, he didn’t help to bring them upstairs into the bedroom (still more work for me and Brooke to do later). There seemed to be about a third fewer boxes than he took away in December. 

As if reading my my mind, he said to me as we carried in a particularly heavy one together (no doubt, containing some of Luke’s extensive footwear collection), “You probably notice that there’s not as many boxes now. That’s because Luke wants you and Brooke spending more time at his house, especially when it’s warmer out. I can’t wait. I’m sick of this shitty, cold weather.” It was 22 degrees that late February day, and I shared Kevin’s fatigue with the cold weather. 

After we finished with the boxes, Kevin walked into the kitchen and said to Brooke, “Put my coffee in a thermos or something. I’ve got to get going.”

Eager to be rid of him, Brooke filled up one of our Hydro Flasks with coffee and asked, “Do you take milk or sugar?”

“Now that’s more like it. Milk, two teaspoons of sugar. Both of you will know all of my and Kaylee’s preferences real well before long. Which reminds me, Luke wanted me to tell you both to be at his house by noon.”

As Brooke poured the milk into the Hydro Flask, she said, “He said the guests will start arriving at 6 PM. We won’t need anywhere near that long to get ready. We weren’t planning on getting there until 3.”

“Change of plans,“ Kevin said with another smirk. “Luke’s cleaning lady called in sick yesterday, so he wants you there early to give the place a good cleaning, especially the bathrooms and the kitchen. He said you should bring another set of clothes to clean in and then you can take a shower afterwards before you change into what you’re gonna wear when you serve everyone snacks and dinner.”

“Great,” said Brooke. 

“You don’t sound that happy, Brooke,” Kevin said, smirk intact. 

“It’s just a lot of work, is all. Tell Luke we’ll be there. Thanks for bringing his stuff,” Brooke said.

“Good girl,“ Kevin replied, as he took his coffee and walked out of the side door that led to our driveway. “Don’t worry, we’ll be seeing a lot more of each other real soon,” he added with a wink, before the door closed behind him.

“Good morning, darling,” I said with a smile, trying to make light of Kevin’s most unpleasant, surprise visit. 

“I hate that bratty, fucking little snitch. He makes my skin crawl,” Brooke said.

“Mine, too. Unfortunately, he’s part of the package with Luke.”

“Yes, Kevin and apparently his skanky girlfriend, Kaylee, too. Not to mention Luke’s cunt of a girlfriend, whatever her name is. I guess we’re going to be everyone’s little bitches.”

“We’ll find out her name soon enough, I guess. Do you think she’ll be there tonight? You know, as his date for the dinner?” I asked, with trepidation. I hesitated to bring up this subject with Brooke, but it was certainly weighing on my mind. I knew meeting Luke’s girlfriend was going to be incredibly difficult for her.

“No, I asked him point-blank and he said that she’s traveling. Thank god for small favors, at least. Tonight‘s going to be humiliating enough as it is without me having to meet this bitch on top of it.”

“Do you think his leadership team will know who we are? Maybe they’ll just assume we’re the caterers?”

“Are you kidding? Of course, they’ll know exactly who we are. I told you about Luke’s reputation – how he publicly cuckolded and totally emasculated his first boss. And how he’s done that with several others since, including other co-workers and employees of his. Maybe not to the same extent as his old boss. But he’s slept with their wives and rubbed their noses in it. This is his brand, Walter: big swingin dick, Luke Hanover. He revels in it. You can be quite certain that everyone there is going to know that his ex-wife and her English professor husband are the ones waiting on them all like Luke’s little lackeys. Luke will be in all his glory tonight, and having us there as his servants will be icing on the cake.”

“Well maybe people will think that we have a catering business on the side?” I ventured.

“Yeah, and maybe they’ll also think we’re from outer space. Get real.”

“Ok, I get it. It’s going to be humiliating. Are you really sure you’re up for all of this, Brooke?” I asked.

She looked me in the eyes and touched my arm. “Walter, I know you mean well, but you have to stop asking me that. This is the price I have to pay to have Luke back. I’m going in with eyes wide open. That doesn’t mean that I’m always going to be happy about what’s going on or that I’m not going to complain about it. Sometimes, I’m probably even going to cry about it or rage about it. But that doesn’t change fact that I’m all in, 100%, for this next crazy chapter in our lives. Come what may.”

“The newest twist in the game,“ I said.

“That’s right. But what about you, my loyal knight? I’m the one who should be asking you: are you sure YOU’RE up for all this? Especially tonight, being a waiter for all of these corporate blowhards? I know the type well. I mean, I wait on these types of people all the time at the restaurant. I’ve been a waitress for a long time now, so I’m used to the humiliations service workers are routinely subjected to – although, admittedly, it’s going to be on a whole different level tonight. But you’re not. It’s a lot different being in charge of a classroom than being a waiter or a waitress.”

Brooke, of course, did not know about the all of humiliation I suffered after I lost control of my class last year following the Ren fair. She did not know that I was now under the control of a few of my former students, compelled each week to cook for them, and to serve as serve as their maid. She was not aware that I had become the coffee boy and foot masseuse of my fellow professor and friend. All of the above , byproducts of Luke’s domination, of course. Except for those few occasions that Brooke was present when I was humiliated in front of a wider group of people – such as when I served as a waiter when Neil and Laura came over for dinner, or when she and I cheered Luke on at his football games, or at the Ren faire itself – she was really only aware of my submission to her, and to Luke, of course. Still, she certainly knew that I was no stranger to humiliation. 

However, I had a strong suspicion that the impending humiliation we were facing with Luke’s return was going to be far more challenging for Brooke to endure than for me – that, in fact, it was going to be far more challenging for her to endure than she realized. Because, whereas I am fundamentally a beta, Brooke is fundamentally an alpha. I can hear some of those reading this say, “Yeah, sure. She’s an alpha just like she’s a feminist – allowing Luke to dominate her and degrade her in the sack. She’s a real alpha, all right.” But, as I have explained before, Brooke is turned on by being sexually dominated and degraded by a certain type of alpha male – in fact, it seems as though Luke is the only one who truly fits that bill for her (so far, at least). And even with Luke, she long resisted submitting to him outside of the bedroom; that’s why she divorced him in the first place. She was now agreeing to this new, broader level of submission because she has accepted the fact that she is sexually addicted to him – and, realizing the intensity of her addiction, Luke set these conditions for her to continue to have access to her drug. It is either submit or do without the drug. As we have seen, the withdrawal pains for her were not sustainable.

But in virtually every other aspect of her life, Brooke is generally the one in control. She is obviously completely in control of me. Even at the restaurant, although a waitress, she is generally looked up to by the younger waitresses such as Laura and even by the more seasoned waitstaff and other restaurant staff. Her bosses (even her sexist manager) know that she possesses intellectual capability well beyond her job, and respect her competence, judgement and work ethic. And, over the years, there have been many lecherous male patrons of the restaurant, and rude customers of both sexes, who have been put in their place by Brooke. In her friendships, too – such as with Laura and her estranged friend Michelle – Brooke is the one who is generally deferred to. She is confident, strong willed, a natural leader. She is also fiercely competitive, someone who likes to win (whether a tennis match, a board game, or an argument) and who usually does. For those who can’t see how it is possible for someone to have an alpha personality and also be sexually submissive – to be, in essence, a feminist but still allow herself to be sexually degraded  – I’m sorry for you that you see things only in black and white, and are incapable of understanding how two opposing things can be true at the same time.

As Brooke’s devoted knight (her chivalrous cuckold, as Anna put it), it was my job – indeed, my sacred duty – to stand by her side during what I knew would be an incredibly trying period for her. It was my job to console her if she wanted to cry on my shoulder, to be her punching bag if she needed someone to take her frustrations out on, to absorb as much of the humiliation directed her way as possible so as to lighten her burden. Why, you may ask? Because that’s what knights do for their ladies, that’s why. Because I love her more than I have ever loved anyone, or anything, in my life. 

So I answered her question by dropping to my knees, and saying to her, “I would gladly suffer any and all humiliations for you, my lady.” I then removed her slipper and reverently kissed her bare right foot. I was completely serious, but levity also has its place at times like these. So, I next looked up at her and smiled, “When we get to Luke’s, I’m going to say to him, ‘Little bitch Walter reporting for duty, sir!’”

Brooke looked down on me, grabbed my head with her hands and pulled me towards her body. She smiled somewhat sadly and said, “I love you. You’re really too good for me, you know that?” And then she smiled more fully and said, “And I’ll stand right beside you and say to him: “Little bitch Brooke reporting for duty, sir!” 

I stood up and said, laughing, “Use and abuse to your heart’s content, sir!”

Still smiling, now more wistfully, she said, “He really will, you know. But maybe after the dinner party, he’ll use and abuse us in a good way, at least. Well, I guess we’d better get to work.”

“Wait, if Luke isn’t bringing anyone to his dinner, we’ll only have eleven people to feed,” I said. 

“That’s right. Good.”

“I bought enough for twelve portions.”

“That’s okay. Maybe he’ll allow the help eat the leftovers,” she laughed. “It IS going to be a pretty awesome meal.”

“It’s certainly going to be an expensive meal. Do you think he’ll reimburse us for all the groceries?”

“He said he would. Just not for our slave labor, obviously.”

“Obviously,” I said.

An hour before we left for Luke’s, Brooke locked me back in my chastity cage. 

“Your little cock has been free for so long, at least for the most part. But you’re all out of get of jail free cards now, I’m afraid,” she said, smiling, as she pulled my panties down with one hand and held my cage with the other. I got immediately hard. 

“Oh my, I think it’s excited to be locked up again. Go get a bag of ice.” 

After she iced me down she was able to get the cage over my momentarily flaccid cock and pulled my balls through the base ring. I had just gotten a full body waxing two days earlier, so my cock and balls were completely hairless. As soon as I was locked up, my cock started to inflate again, pushing up against the cold metal rings of the DOMINIX Deluxe chastity cage Brooke had bought me for Christmas. 

“I think it likes its new prison. I’m going to keep one key on my anklet and give the other one to Luke, of course. That way, he’ll have a key to both of your cock cages.”

“Of course. I just wish you could wait till after dinner to put it on me. Those pants that he wants me to wear are so tight, I’m afraid everyone will be able to see the bulk beneath them.”

“I doubt it. Your black waiter pants will hide it a lot better than yoga pants at least; I’m surprised he’s not making you wear those. Too informal, I suppose. Besides, maybe Luke will let you wear the apron Michelle bought you last year. It’’s effeminate, but at least it will hide any bulk. I really like the looks of this chastity cage – the curve, the rings. Look how shiny it is!” she said as she flicked my cage with her finger nail. “Now you really are my knight in shining armor.”

“I don’t really feel prepared to go to battle in this armor, my lady. I feel very…very weak.”

“Your weakness is your strength, my knight.”

“If that’s really true, I’m invincible,” I said, with a slight laugh.

Luke greeted us at the door when we got to his house at 12 noon sharp. Brooke and I were dressed in sweatpants and T-shirts, ready to clean, and brought our serving uniforms along in a bag. We had also brought along several bags and trays of food, a mixture of hors d’oeuvres and dishes we had already prepared that just need to be heated up, and the ingredients to make several more dishes. 

“Good. You’re on time. My cleaning lady – ex cleaning lady, I should say – called in sick yesterday. Seems like she’s always calling in sick, but for her to do it right before my big dinner really pisses me off. She’s done. You’ll find all the cleaning supplies in the basement. I want this place to really sparkle tonight,” Luke said, by way of greeting.

“No kiss or anything?” Brooke said to him, with a faint smile. 

“There’s no time for that now. Do a great job tonight – which you’d better – and there might be a reward later. But, for now, you two have way too much work to do to be worried about anything other than getting it done. I left some things for you to wear tonight on the kitchen table.”

“We brought what we’re wearing with us. Just what you told us to bring. I’m wearing my waitress uniform and Walter’s wearing exactly what he did the first time he cooked you dinner,” Brooke said.

“Good. Yes, that’s what I told you to do, but I got you a couple of little things to add or substitute. I told you how important this dinner is to me. Remember, I just hired my CMO – that’s chief marketing officer, prof – as the last member of my executive team. So, my CMO is the guest of honor. But this is really a celebration of the fact that I’ve finally got my whole leadership team in place. I expect you both to address everyone as sir and ma’am throughout the evening. Every time you take a drink order. Every time you offer them something to eat. Every time you interact with them in any way. Treat them all with respect, especially the guest of honor. Got it?”

“Yes, sir,” we both said, almost in unison. 

“Is the cuck locked up?” Luke asked Brooke. 

“Yes, sir. Securely. I got him a new cage for Christmas. I think you’re going to like it. Here’s your key. It’s the original. I’m wearing the copy on my anklet,” Brooke said as she handed him my key.

“Good. Your furlough is finished, I’m afraid, prof.”

“Yes, sir,” I said, feeling my cock twitch.

“How many people will there be tonight?” Brooke asked. 

“Only ten. My CFO and his wife. My COO and his wife. My CHRO and his wife. My head of sales and his date. My new CMO, and me. Neither of us are bringing a date. You can take any leftovers home.”

“Thanks,” said Brooke. 

“I’ve got some things to do in town. I’’ll be back by 3 to check on your cleaning.”

Mercifully, except for Luke’s bedroom and en-suite bathroom, the house was not especially filthy. Even so, the two of us had to work at a frenetic pace to thoroughly clean a 6000-square foot house in three hours. Meanwhile, we saw what Luke had left for us on the counter: a pink bowtie (obviously for me to substitute for my black one) and sheer pink, nylon socks for me; a black leather choker for Brooke; and name tags for both of us – “Brooke” and “Prof” (just in case any of the guests had not gotten the memo about who were waiting on them that evening). 

When Luke got back at 3 PM, he inspected the rooms to ensure that our cleaning was up to his standards while Brooke and I showered and changed into our serving uniforms to begin preparing the hors d’oeuvres and dishes for dinner. Fortunately, he seemed pleased with our efforts. Then he asked us to stand next to each other and he inspected us. My new socks were readily apparent, as my tight, black pants ended several inches above my ankles; at least, I wasn’t required to be barefoot as I was the first time I served Luke (instead, I wore a pair of black dress shoes, which contrasted absurdly with the pink, nylon socks). Overall, I looked absolutely ridiculous in my tight black shirt and pants, vividly offset by the pink tie and socks. Brooke was wrong; the bulk of my chastity cage was clearly visible beneath the fabric of my pants. The black apron at least hid my crotch from view; effeminate as it was, I was grateful to be wearing it.

Luke quickly dispelled that temporary comfort. “Prof, you can wear the apron when you’re working in the kitchen, but lose it when you’re serving food or drinks. Take it off now.” 

When I did, he looked down at my crotch area, the presence of my cage painfully obvious (and causing pain, as my cock swelled in its confines under his critical eye), and smirked. “You’ve really have gotten tubby over the last couple of months, haven’t you? I can see your belly fat bulging over your belt, and those pants are really tight on you. Well, your first weigh-in is tomorrow at 5 PM. Our mutual good buddy Neil and I will whip you into shape in no time.”

“Yes, sir. Thank you, sir,” I said, wondering how literal he was being. 

“Don’t mention it, prof. It’s going to be my pleasure, believe me,” he said, continuing to smirk.

My cage wasn’t the only thing obvious to the guests that evening, as Luke ostentatiously wore a silver chain with the key to my chastity cage dangling over the second button of his dress shirt. Everyone there could clearly see that their boss, the ex husband of my wife, was my keyholder. 

In her waitress uniform, Brooke looked almost exactly as she had the night I ran into her at the restaurant for the first time since being her professor. That was now nearly twenty months ago. What a journey we had been on since that fateful evening! Brooke’s restaurant catered to a largely male, corporate clientele, so the owners hired mostly young, attractive women as waitresses, and the short skirt, heels and sheer, black stockings – while by no means over-the-top or indecent – were clearly intended to appeal to the male patrons. However, the choker was something else altogether. The choker Luke had left out for Brooke to put on was similar to the one Brooke had made me wear to my class last semester in that it was leather. However, it was really like the choker she had teasingly threatened to make me wear; it had a metal ring embedded in the front of it – not sticking out, but still something to which a leash could conceivably be attached. In other words, it more overtly resembled a slave collar. Brooke looked incredibly sexy in it, especially with the red lipstick and makeup she was wearing (also at Luke’s behest). But she also looked submissive (for some reason, she made me think of Princess Leia enslaved by Jabba the Hutt) . She brushed it off by saying to me that women were wearing chokers these days ironically, to reclaim power and bodily autonomy. I didn’t buy it (especially since it wasn’t her decision to wear it). Maybe that would’ve been plausible for a choker without that ring, but to me the choker Brooke wore screamed that she was someone’s property. And clearly not the property of the guy wearing a pink bowtie and socks. More likely the property of the man wearing the key to that guy’s chastity cage around his neck. 

As if that were not enough, during his inspection of us, Luke ordered Brooke to remove her black jacket and her bra, so that her nipples would be visible through her snug fitting white shirt. When she removed her bra in front of us, Luke walked up to her and firmly grasped her nipples in his fingers.

Brooke moaned at his touch, pushing her body up against him and arching her neck upwards to try to kiss him. Rather than kiss her, he squeezed her nipples.

“You shouldn’t hide your best asset, slut. Everyone tonight should be able to enjoy looking at your tits. If I thought about beforehand, I’d have bought Hooters uniforms for you both to wear.”

Brooke laughed. 

“What’s so funny?” Luke asked. 

“I just had a mental picture of Walter in a Hooters uniform,” Brooke replied. She, of course, had no idea that I had already been forced to wear one and model it for my students in early December. How surreal my life had become, I thought. 

“It’s you who I’d like to see in that uniform. You don’t have huge tits like the Hooters girls, but everyone should be able to see your Goldilocks tits.” Luke was correct in his appraisal of Brooke’s perfect breasts: they were neither too big nor too small but just right, with lovely protruding nipples. He squeezed her nipples harder. I could see her grimace in a mixture of pain and arousal. “Don’t wear your jacket tonight. And throw away your damn bra. You should never wear a bra.”

“Yes, sir,” Brooke said, still pushing up against him. “Could you please make love to me now. Walter can start preparing the dishes. We have plenty of time,” she asked him. 

“Make love to you? Fuck you, you mean?”

“Yes, sir, fuck me. Fuck me senseless. It can be quick.” 

Still gripping her nipples, Luke said, “You and the cuck are I in what I call a probationary period with new employees at my company. Fuck up tonight in, like not being attentive or respectful enough to my guests, and you’re fired. Simple as that. Kevin will move all my stuff back out tomorrow. If you do a good job, on the other hand, I’ll fuck your brains out tomorrow. Would you like that?”

“Yes, sir.  We’ll do a great job, I promise. Please fuck my brains out,” Brooke begged him, as he squeezed her nipples harder. 

“You’ve been acting like a pretty dumb slut lately, but if I fuck your brains out, you’ll be a complete bimbo. Do you want that?” he asked, continuing to squeeze.

I hated this. Perhaps more than anything else, I hated him denigrating Brooke’s intelligence; possibly the only thing I hated more than that was hearing Brooke denigrate her own, to appease him. 

“Yes, please, I want that. Fuck me so hard that I can’t think at all. Make me your bimbo, Luke. Sir.”

Luke walked behind Brooke and grasped her neck tightly with his large hand and pushed his hand down into the front of her skirt. She gasped and closed her eyes, as he appeared to touch and rub her vagina with his fingers under her skirt and stockings. Grasping her neck was so gratuitous; it was all about control and domination

“Please,” she moaned. 

“You’re leaking like a faucet, slut.” 

“Please,” she moaned again, quietly. She was not begging him to stop.

Although I couldn’t see underneath her clothes, it appeared as though he was thrusting his fingers in and out of her vagina. She pushed her body backwards against him and bucked her pelvis. He then pulled his hand out of her skirt, and held up his two visibly moist fingers, smiling at me malevolently. 

He then inserted his two fingers into Brooke’s mouth. Closing her eyes, she obediently sucked her secretions off Luke’s fingers as he said, “Your panties are soaking. Don’t be dripping all over my nice clean floors now, slut. Now I’m gonna let you two get to work; I know you’ve got a lot to do. Later, when my guests start to arrive, I want Brooke to greet the female guests at the door by saying, “Hello ma’am, welcome to Mr. Hanover’s home.’ Then offer to take their coats, bring them into the living room and take their drink orders. Prof, you do the same for the men. Once everybody is settled with a cocktail you can start serving the hors d’oeuvres. Got it?”

“Yes, sir,” we both said. 

When Luke left the room, Brooke simply said, “Bastard” (whether more out of of humiliation or frustration was difficult to say). She was still breathing heavily, her face and neck flushed.

We worked hard for the next three hours to assemble the hors d’oeuvres and to begin cooking those that needed to be served warm as well as the entrées and side dishes. Luke had a well stocked bar, but I made sure everything was in order to be able to mix cocktails. He had also purchased a case of beer and several bottles of wine.

Luke came down from his bedroom at 5:45, ready for the arrival of his guests. He was dressed in a dress pants and dress shirt with a sports coat and black dress shoes. That was the first time that I saw the key to my chastity cage dangling from a chain around his neck. I served him a Gentleman Jack on the rocks, while he waited. 

When the doorbell rang promptly at 6 PM, Luke said to us, “It’s showtime. Look sharp.”"

Aside from the annoyance of playing “where’s the ring” without waking up my partner in the morning, it’s throwing off my sleep data collection. The ring was a gift in October, and I’m outside the return/exchange window but I’d hate to eat the cost of buying up a size (I’m wearing it on my ring finger now, as that’s the smallest of my three middle fingers).

A kneipp feet pool is basically a small pond with super cold water (bellow 10 degrees celcius) and a hot pool. You are supposed to sumerge your feet in the cold water for 2mins aprox and then move to the hot water. (See picture) 

Last December during my ski trip the hotel were I was staying had a spa with a Kneipp feet  pool

Since I was in the spa I tried it, and noted such a HUGE change in my ankles, they were significantly smaller and less swelled. I did mostly the cold water and some days I skipped the hot one 

Now since I’m back home I’m preparing my own kneipp with some ice water and a small bucket.

I wanted to share this with this group because I noted such a big difference and also lots of relief from swelling.

Has anybody else tried this?  "

I had all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed with local anesthesia 16 days ago. My top two were fully grown in, and the bottom two were both partially impacted. I had been have problems with my bottom left for close to a year, having throbbing pains and getting minor infections due to it being partially impacted. Removal of both left wisdom teeth were quick and easy! Both of them on my right gave the doctor a run for her money, she asked me 3/4 times if I wanted to stop and request for my insurance to cover general. The top one just did not want to come out, she had to pull for a good while and hard. The bottom tooth she had to break 4 different times and finally decided to leave a piece of the root because she could not get it out. But we got through it, and about and hour later I was in my way home. I was definitely in pain but started right away taking my medicine. One of which was 5 days of amoxicillin every 8 hours, so my body would heal around the piece left in my jaw. 

Day 2 after removal I got so nauseous from not eating enough and ending up throwing up, which I believe probably gave me dry socket in that moment but I didn’t realize it at the time. 

By day 5 of antibiotics my right side was in so much pain and there was redness and swelling of the gums. I called and talked to the doctor who advised me to go to the walk in to start more antibiotics. (The surgeon I saw was in a major city about an hour away) 

So as soon as I was done with the 5 days of amoxicillin I started 10 days of augmentin twice a day. 

 By day 12, 6 days into the second round of antibiotics I was still experiencing throbbing pain on the right even through the ibuprofen. So another phone call and they ask me to come in this time for them to look at it. 

Which was when I found out I did in fact have dry socket for the last 10 days, they put a medicated sponge in the socket and did another stitch. They said it looks like it’s healing okay, just a lot slower than the other side. Which makes sense considering the difference in trauma. 

But now I’m day 16, have two doses left of antibiotics, and my cheek on the right side is still slightly swollen and hard. My anxiety keeps telling me I have an abscess or my body is rejecting the piece they left behind, but even when I went in 4 days ago the doctor didn’t seem concerned or even batted an eye. "

I don’t mean like pitting edema. I did a prenatal core/pelvic floor workout later and noticed I felt it at times during that too. It happens maybe 50% of the time when I touch that spot.

I am M/31, asian, well built, slightly overweight. Non-smoker. Have long history of allergic/immune/skin related disease from birth. Asthma in childhood (which I later overcome by sports/exercise), chronic eczema since 18 that makes me almost drop out of high school and college, up to a severe level have to try oral immunosuppressants.

Recent HS diagnosis at 30 and have been living with it for slightly over half year. Stressful life, typical day-job, part-time study, weekend-worrier for leisure sports.

In the following, I am going to go somewhat in-depth into biochemical stuff. It just so happens that I do my undergrad in Biochem, so that I was lucky enough to finally find the key to full remission with the doctors' advices, which are somewhat complicated and require quite a bit of biochem knowledge to fully comprehend.

The process of getting HS into remission is one very arduous and require lots of patience, knowledge and committed actions. My goal here is to share my success story with my take on the science behind it. I capture what I can understand with on layman terms. Welcome any comments/clarifications if I make any mistakes in my elaborations! HS needs to be discussed under the daylight anyways!!

**How I got diagnosed**

Have always been sensitive to skin issues since I have been accustomed to perform my (non-irritative cleansing/blotting dry/applying topicals/hydrating) routine for my skin.

One day I woke up with my left armpit feeling weird, swollen and mild pain. But that boil shit escalated fast and within <1 week it swells to size of a little quail egg, at which point I notice the shape of it being weird. Instead of typical head popping up/ acne like nodule or lump shape with a small outlet, it is more like a red lesion narrower and longer in shape, no visible whatsoever. Within 2 weeks I was unable to sleep to left side and unable to lift my arms up without pain. Forced to drop out of my workout and sports routine.

*Stage 1 - GP and antibiotics  (lasted \~2 weeks)*

Naturally I go visit my GP, a family doc. She took a look at my boil and diagnose me with Epidermoid Cysts. Refer me to a derm.  
Prescription = Augmentin 375 mg daily for 7 days. I did not buy it since I had one before and surgically removed. It just felt different. It felt much deeper into the skin and ""inter-connected""- the swelling felt much more rapid and ran along the skin like a tunnel.  
Result = flare ups subsided for the week under medication, but re-emerged 2 days after treatment

I used a few swell-ups and big acne here and there and I just to pop it with a sterile needle w/ alcohol rubs and water-sealed gauze pad so by the end of 2nd week I try it on my boil. The pain is INSANE. And I dare not use a bigger needlehead due to the pain (on second thought now, I am lucky I didn't, in HS a punctured wound won't heal and abscess will keep coming back w/ risk of nasty infections), and the draining was not all that successful. Some but not all abscess was out with blood to a tiny amount, but within 1 week the wound close again and the swelling continues.

*Stage 2 - 2nd GP and antibiotics  (lasted \~ 1 month)*

By week 3 I was so upset I decided to change my GP. By that time all I want is to get rid of the boil, one way or another- thinking about incision and draining (but by doc), or surgery. Very anxious because I know it was not typical acne that I am dealing with. Upon consulting another GP, all he said was I had an inflammation. Did not even care to ask much and I was sent home with more antibiotics. Asked for surgery but was rejected blatantly as doc says it is sort of a last-resort, plus no surgeon will take this unless there is multiple sites of very severe conditions. This time again Augmentin but 1000 mg 2x a day, for 14 days. I was told 14 days is max otherwise tolerance will occur to render future use of same med useless.

Once again it did work like a charm. Flare ups gone for entirely 2 weeks on med. Boil shrinks to just a tiny lump maybe 1-2mm in size, almost unnoticeable upon palpation. But I noticed darker pigmentation around the lesion. Effect lasted for 1 more week as still no flare up occurs, just a tiny redness.

Happy didn't last long. All hopes gone by the week following as I woke up and notice it swelling again.  
I remembered the feeling of extreme sadness that day coz I have to wear a suit for work for the entire day and I knew I would sweat a lot to make things worse, only to confirm after work in shower that the swelling not only come back but was on a pace so rapid never seen before. I almost cried when I complain to my gf. I tried the recipe of hot-cold pack to try to bring it to maturity, but failed. It just make the area more sensitive and it never popped. Those nights were tormenting and my mood plummeted to rock bottom... I start my google searches for my symptoms and had an early feeling that it might be HS.

*Stage 3 - Derm + surgeon (lasted for \~3 weeks)*  
Exactly 2 months upon my initial visit to GP, I decided to give derm a go. At the very same time, I had another mild surgery with another surgeon (not related). The Derm is much more attentive and performed a much more thorough check for my other areas for lesions. He diagnosed me as HS and concluded my stage as Hurley I. He suggest me to lose weight, cut out junk food, dairy and start me up with 100 mg doxycycline 2x daily and topical clindamycin for 14 days.  
I inquire in depth about the possibility for surgery/deroofing but told not to. Reason being (1) even after surgery they can come back in other sites (ii) I did not fit the clinical criteria. I left with much frustration.  
Almost at that very same time I had my minor procedure done with another general surgeon. And I asked if he had any knowledge about my condition over his 25+ years of practice. Turned out he did, but only seen <10 patients with HS, performed surgery on 3-5 of them, with only 1 being deroofing, which he described is doomed to take >1 month to recover and leave nasty permanent scars.

Another 2 weeks passed. This time DOXY worked well for the first week, but flare up begins again in approaching the 10th day mark-- even systemic antibiotics doesn't help.

*Stage 4 - The Eye-Opening Lecture*  
I went back to my surgeon for stitch removal. At that time my boil improved a bit but still at 7/10 pain level.  
The surgeon, to my surprise, gave me a GAMECHANGING LECTURE on my condition.

Here goes (For those without background of biochem/basic medicine, plz skip to conclusion)  
Just a bit of background, two immune cells are responsible for inflammation: T cell and B cell. T cells are often thought as ""killers"" to wipe out pathogens. In fact killers are CD8 cells, but there are also CD4, aka Th cells that is involved in EVERY PROLONGED INFLAMMATION. HS is no exception.

So, targeting HS = rebalancing Th1-2-17 systems to bring down inflammation.

[This is the overview of T-helper\(Th\/CD4\) cell family w\/ relationship to cytokines \(signaling protein, e.g. IL-4, IFN-y\).  Apparently, HS is an autoimmune disease with Th17 switched on. Doc told me that there are 3 Th proliferation pathways, Th1, Th2 and Th17. Those with superb immunity can take care of common infections with Th1 alone, but if that does not suffice, Th2 will be activated, Th1 and 2 will be mutually suppressive. Th2 activation will cause piling up of B cells \(proliferation\) and lead to higher IgE and IgG-marked inflammation. Long-term Th2 elevation will slowly turn on Th17 system, which is the most feared autoimmune disease: lupus\/psoriasis\/some rare arthritis and HS!!! Conclusion: HS is a result of low Th1 + prolonged high Th2 + accidental \\""switched-on\\"" Th17. This explains why HS is more commonly seen with diabetes and allergic patients \(coz DM\/allergies elevates IL-4\/5\/13--\> overactivated Th2 --\> Th17\)](https://preview.redd.it/tpgbymdrm5fe1.png?width=985&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1d2f77a98d3729bbb8d8f4988d547de4709d922)

In a nutshell. To control HS, steroids/antibiotics are there only to suppress symptoms. Surgery might be an option for some but the availability of experienced doc is definitely low, financial cost and recovery time are off the chart level high.

To get rid of HS, you must start with tackling inflammatory response. ***Key is to bring down Th2 (Th2 dominance) at whatever cost*** so that it ***will not escalate into kicking start Th17 activation/ expression***. If Th2 is brought down, next step is to promote Th1. Th1 in good shape will inhibit Th17 and Th2 and that's when you can finally find the cure.

SO, how to bring down Th2?

*Stage 5 - The Experiment (supplements & lifestyle) (Lasted for \~2.5 months)*

After giving the lecture, my surgeon suggested me to start trying with an array of supplements. He encouraged me to try mixing and matching to construct a cocktail of these. The list includes: Zinc, Curcumin, Vitamin D, Berberine, Quercetin and N-Acetyl Cysteine. He explained to my why , but I did not remember all on the spot. I managed to copy them down and look them up with the Th1/2/17 map above. Suddenly everything makes sense, coz guess what I found, EACH OF THEM HAD A ROLE TARGETING DIFFERENT CYTOKINES ON THE MAP!!!

I will explain my thought process and how I experiment with each of them. I started with Zinc and curcumin, copper. The first 2 weeks were not much difference. Week 3 I noticed that the boil started to shrink a bit, with some white-ish thing surfacing. 1 month's in and it continued to shrink to the same level I have with pleasant antibiotic treatment. Then I add in copper, NAC and Vitamin D. Tried some Berberine but discontinued coz I think 3-4 ish pills are enough. anything more seems mentally taxing.

Finally, by week 4, ALL FLARE-UP SUBSIDED and I HAVE MY PAINFREE LIFE BACK!!!!  
Now, 2.5 months in, I am confident that I have fortunately reach complete remission. The scar is still visible. But no pain, only slight pigmentation. I take it as a win.

I will share my supplement list here and my research for each of them:

**Zinc**. My Dosage = 100 mg daily. Recommended range is 60-90mg but I take 100 nonetheless. Form is Bisglycinate, chelated. **Amongst the first I tried. WORKS WONDERS.** Bisglycinate form is a bit pricy but worth it. Research support: It UP IFN-y (Th1) , DOWN IL-4 and IL-5 (Th2). Be careful with long term supplementation of zinc will diminish copper absorption so make sure to take copper too. Copper glycinate at 30mg capsule. Combo with Quercetin is also well proven because Quercetin helps to bring zinc across cell membrane, increase bioavailability

**Curcumin.** My Dosage = 500mg. I took it with soup/ after the most fatty meal (steak/chicken) coz it is much more soluble that way. **Amongst the first I tried. WORKS WONDERS.** I did not bother with having to take it the black pepper, still works great. Research support: It inhibits IL-5 and IL-13 (Th2)

**Vitamin D**. Among of the most neglected supplements. IDK but before this I only know about Vitamin B sets being sometimes beneficial. Turns out, most people lacked the time to become regularly exposed to UVB for body to naturally produce enough (30 min in sunshine in tanktops will give >10000 IU which is quite adequate). Dietary intakes fluctuate and often struggle to keep up. ***I highly recommend to check up on your vitamin D content in typical meals and I dare to say 90% of you guys will fall under <6000 IU per day.*** Also, some expert points out that the USUAL recommended dosage of 600-800 daily is NOT ACCURATE due to statistical reasons. My surgeon says the actual amount man should aim for is about \~6000 IU ish per day. I think compared to the rest vit-D is more auxiliary so I just casually take in 1000IU chew tablets every 2-3 days or so. Since it is fat soluble and will store in your body, do not take too much. I find chewable tablets from  800-1000 IU here and there is most sensible choice. Forgetting on some days is no biggie. Research support: It UP IL-12 and IFN-y and DOWN IL-4

**NAC (N-Acetyl Cysteine).** This one I did not include in my early ""cocktail"" but added later with Vit-D. Most pricy on the list, but worth a shot. Doc told me that glutathione is the most powerful human-body synthesized antioxidants there is, but ingesting glu is not very effective so has to take its precursor NAC. My dosage= 1000 mg daily. If possible, buy in capsule coz tablet will have a weird taste, kind of fishy, idk how to describe but you will definitely rmb after you try. Oxidation and free radicals hurt cells and skew body towards Th2.

Amid my research, I also casually hop on to look at DUPIXENT (dupilumab) for eczema. If you have the condition, you should have already known that this biologic is well-established as one of the most effective. Well guess what, DUPIXENT works on the SAME PRINCIPLE, all it does it bring down IL-4, IL-13. And booom, all the ichyness is gone.

As I am writing up my experience, I came across [Due\_City712](https://www.reddit.com/user/Due_City712/)'s post [https://www.reddit.com/r/Hidradenitis/comments/156gxmp/i\_have\_a\_theory\_on\_vitamin\_d\_and\_zinc/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hidradenitis/comments/156gxmp/i_have_a_theory_on_vitamin_d_and_zinc/)  
I think what I experimented with so far can act as a testament that supplements, if done right, could be a gamechanger for some. Scientifically my case alone is just a sample. There could be errors/biases, also I am only HS stage 1. Everyone with a sound mind should know that prognosis is dependent of multiple factors-- so best to do your own research, try on your own risk but with some guidance from doc that you can trust.

For me, I know for damn sure I am sending thank you card to that surgeon every year to thank him for his lecture that change the course of not only my HS but my life.

Lastly, I meant to say,

1. HS is deceiving, even commonly misdiagnosed and mistreated. If you suspect yourself have it, go visit more doc. My more I mean expect to visit 3-5 at least. GP helps just a little, derm with surgical experience/ rheumatologist might be your best bet. I am lucky to have discover it early , but given the degree of ignorance about the disease, an average 7+ years before actual diagnosis really DOESNT SURPRISE.
2. Antibiotics will fail. Expect that.
3. F\*cking good doctors are hard to find. Actual experienced doctor in treating HS let alone operating on it is much lesser than you would expect. Embrace the truth and let it sink in. Don't blame yourself, and the GPs. This disease is not researched enough and no consensus for single, apply-to-all treatment. 
4. If you have HS (particularly stage 1, 1-2-ish), after you eliminate all obvious cause (drink/smoke/high sugar fatty junk food diet), if you are left with no choice, go give supplements a shot. stick with those for a month and be patient. Try your cocktail. Surgery might be an option but think twice whether you have done everything that you are in control of before you jump hastily & anxiously into surgical means.
5. To those who are in pain, STAY STRONG. I know what it is like to be painful, even those with medical knowledge will not understand how painful and disturbing HS is. Remember you are not to be blamed for the thought of giving up!! But if you choose not to give up and put up a fight, things will change!! It's okay to cry sometimes. Find support and be realistic. Evaluate your options and make the most sensible decision. "
How soon did you get out of the house to run some errands?,ACL,1i9rfb5,2025-01-25 12:01:25,5,0.86,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACL/comments/1i9rfb5/how_soon_did_you_get_out_of_the_house_to_run_some/,PrivateSpeaker,,"I live by myself, which doesn't just mean I need to take care of things but it's also a bit of a strain on mental health.

I have lived in the southeast my entire life except for a 1.5y move to the Midwest '23-'24, which is when this started. 

In January 2024, I woke up to my right hand being swollen, very stiff, and sore. I eventually developed these hypertensive areas that almost looked like blisters, but they weren't fluid filled or anything. They were raised, rougher/dryer than the surrounding skin, would go from a pink to a darker red and eventually the skin would break. Almost like it was something that was working its way out from under the skin. My entire pinky finger would sometimes be dark purple. My hands overall were pinker and colder than my arm, which is why the doctor at the time told me he wasn't sure what it was but it's likely raynuads that's presenting so late in response to the extreme cold that I was not used to. 

Fast forward to this winter, I'm back in the southeast, and it's happening again but a little different and worse in some ways. It's also only one my right hand. The tips of my fingers almost look like I have burns, like they are patchy and lighter in color. I have the dark colored spots like I mentioned before. Swelling, stiff and sore joints, and hypersensitivity (like brushing the skin against a shirt is extremely uncomfortable). Some itchiness. Woke up this morning to my index finger being almost twice the size as other fingers! 

Is it possible that it's raynauds that got ""activated"" in the Midwest winter and now it happens in any cold weather? Even though it's never been an issue before? I had myself conceived I had RA or lupus or something😅 I'll attach pics in the comments! "

# [Chapter Sixteen](https://pandacozycorner.com/blogs/notizie/forever-yours-by-delaila-adams-free)



What am I doing?

This is wrong. Completely unfair to Kaylee. She doesn’t deserve this.

But my heart... it doesn’t beat for her the way it used to. Everything’s so tangled right now.

I promised Kaylee I’d never betray her, no matter what, but here I am, doing exactly that.

Yes, I crave Drea, but it’s not just physical. It’s something deeper.

The first time I felt drawn to her was that day she stood by the glass doors leading to the backyard, awkwardly waving at the kids. She was so damn cute. And the way she interacted with them, especially Vanessa, melted me.

Kaylee isn’t into kids. That’s okay; everyone has their preferences. But I love them. And seeing Drea with them, that softness, it stirred something in me.

She’s gentle, kind, innocent, and beyond beautiful. My heart races every time I’m near her, every time she stumbles over her words, every innocent glance she gives.

I have to choose. Now or never. Drea or Kaylee.

I’m not someone who hides from what I feel. When I want someone, I want them fully. There’s no middle ground. And I want Drea – not just her body, but her heart.

I turned my head, catching sight of Drea asleep beside me, her hair falling messily over her face, lips slightly parted. I couldn’t help but smile.

Moving closer, I tucked the stray strand behind her ear, my knuckles grazing her cheek. She wrinkled her nose, her lips forming a small pout as though I’d disturbed her dreams.

My gaze dropped to her lips, and the urge to kiss her swelled within me. I gently traced her lower lip with my thumb.

She stirred, groaning softly, so I pulled my hand away.

But I couldn’t stop staring at her. And when her hand, still half-asleep, reached for me, brushing my chest and arm, my heart skipped a beat.

Her fingers found mine, and she held on tightly, nestling closer, seeking comfort in my warmth.

Damn it.

I moved her hand gently, wrapped my arm around her waist, and pulled her into me. She nestled against my chest, her arm slipping around my body, her soft breath warming my skin.

I kissed the top of her head, resting my chin there as I let sleep pull me under. When I woke, she was wiggling free from my hold, trying not to wake me.

""What are you doing?"" I rasped, my voice heavy with sleep.

She froze, eyes wide in panic. “I-I... didn’t mean to...”

Why does she look so scared of me?

“You’re afraid of me,” I said quietly, pulling her closer.

Her eyes widened. “N-no... I-I don’t...”

I gently cradled her head, pressing her face against my chest, like I had last night. “I’m sorry, Drea. I never wanted you to feel afraid. I’ve treated you so badly. Tell me what I can do to fix it.”

“I-it’s fine... I’m not scared...”

“Then why do you stutter around me? Are you nervous?”

“I... d-don’t have a problem...”

“So, it’s nerves. And you’re always nervous around me.” I sighed. “Please don’t be. I’d never hurt you.”

After a beat, she whispered, “Okay.”

I pulled back to look at her, and her cheeks were bright red. I smirked. “Why are you blushing?”

She shook her head frantically. “N-no! I’m not!”

Her cuteness made me laugh, a deep, genuine laugh that surprised even me. She stared at me the whole time, eyes dreamy, like she was mesmerized.

“What?” I asked, still smiling.

“Nothing...” she murmured, looking away, blushing even harder.

I cupped her cheek, guiding her gaze back to mine. “Something?”

She hesitated, then whispered, “It’s just... your laugh... it’s beautiful.”

They are disease-infested wild animals! The NUTTER mind virus has coursed through the veins of humans for centuries now. Felines have occupied Earth, spreading out from their native lands of Africa and the Middle East. It's disgusting. I've said this before, and I'll say it again. FELIDS HAVE SERVED THEIR PURPOSE TO HUMANITY! NO ONE IS STRUGGLING WITH MICE AND RATS EATING THE VILLAGE GRAIN SUPPLY! And my NUTTER neighbor Henry... he just shoves these felids in everyone's face! Felids obviously don't want to reside in NUTTER's homes. Why do you think so many felids escape immediately as soon as a door is opened? They're wild animals, and they are supposed to live in the wild. But NUTTERS have ruined THAT too! We've exported them to new habitats and ecosystems!(Which they love to destroy!!!) It's honestly kind of creepy how this train of thought has descended through the generations. Shipping disease-infested wild animals to new ecosystems for them to destroy. Ever been to Istanbul? I have. There, the disgusting disease-ridden wild creatures litter the place with their piss! They ride trains, they kill people with any sort of allergies! I have a friend who is allergic to felids, who went to Turkey alongside me. She almost died from her throat swelling up after a bombardment of felids attacked her suddenly. It's so creepy! They're violent diseased creatures not fit to be anywhere near humans. It's honestly kind of creepy. I can't even partake in recreation. My friends suggest we play a game. Settlers of \*CAT\*an. I can't get them out of my head. They're everywhere, no matter where I try to run. Every time I open social media, I am assaulted by felid videos and photos! (Who even wants to see that?) It's actually kind of creepy how my social media feed keeps directing this content to me. I hope the rest of you don't have to go through what I've gone through when it comes to these animals.

-

Something thuds into my side. I'm wishing that this is only a dream, that Ari and I are still together on the shores of her home.
But it's not, and any fading hope that is still remaining is snatched away from me as another boot thuds into my side. Then someone's yanking me upright, and my sleep-heavy mind struggles to understand what is going on.

""Thought 'e woulda woken up by now."" I hear a snide comment somewhere to my right. I finally open my eyes, the last remains of sleep vanishing. I'm soaked to the skin, and as a breeze passes over me, it chills me to the bone. I'm surrounded by a mob of people. Their faces are all sullen and drawn, and the daggers strapped to their belts don't give me much hope either. Someone takes a fistful of my hair, yanking my head up. ""I asked, are you awake, little boy?""

What in Marien's name is going on?

""Excuse me."" I clear my throat, but my voice is hoarse from all the salt water that flooded into my mouth.

""Oh, yer a bit far from 'ome, little boy."" 

My arms are pinioned somewhere behind me, and even if I could get my hands free, I wouldn't risk it. And from the way these people are talking, I can only assume that they're corsairs. And they've just assumed that I'm some nobleman's son.

""Just wait a moment! You've got to let me go!""
""Oh, you've got to let me go back to mummy and daddy!"" Another corsair attempts a crude stab at how I was speaking, poking fun at my accent. It elicits raucous laughter from every other person standing on deck, but it makes me boil on the inside. I yank my head away from the person who grabbed it, seething.

""Stop it!"" I shout, only drawing further mockery. ""You've got to let me go! O-otherwise I'll hurt you all!"" Everyone stops dead for a moment, looking at each other with nervous glances, before breaking out into laughter once again. 

""Don't go threatening us, or else we'll sling you overboard and you can go back to where you came!"" Somebody grabs the back of my shirt, hauling me over to the railing and pinning me against it. My head and torso are swinging over the rail, the churning of the waves making my stomach heave up and down. Blistering spray hits my face innumerable times, all whilst I struggle to get out of my captor's grip.

""I tell you! I'm the son of Bryndis! BRYNDIS OF DAERION!"" I frantically try to reason with the person pinning me to the railing, and in their shock, I tumble to the deck, my face striking the timbers hard.
""You're Bryndis's son? Now that's a story I haven't heard many a time before. Liar."" Another voice greets me as I'm hauled back up to a sitting position, my face just mere inches away from another man's. The hat with its spray-soaked feather gives me a clue to his identity. ""Right, you have to listen to me!"" I beg the captain, but it falls on deaf ears. 
""The only place you're going is in the rope locker. And don't even think about making a sound."" I see a smirk beginning to form on the captain's face as he waves me away. And with a stab of horror, I realise that my usually heavy pockets feel abnormally light.
""You scrunt!"" I finally get out, exploding with anger.
""That's what it's like in the business, boy. The sooner you learn that, the better."" I fix him with a cold stare as he prepares to inch away, and he turns back to me, and I don't realise that he's struck me until I feel a harsh, stinging pain on my cheek.

""Take him away. But what even is your name?""
""Silas. Silas Teghin."" I stammer out.
""That's not a name I've heard before. So, Silas Teghin of Eleriad-""
""Silas of Daerion."" I retort, smarting at the incorrect use of my kingdom's name.
""Anyway, it's been a pleasure to meet you, Silas Teghin."" And then I'm dismissed, hauled away by a mob of jeering corsairs. I don't even attempt to resist them. It's futile to do so.

The rope locker isn't a bad place to sit in. Admittedly, it is a bit musty, but there's light. A single lantern burns above my head, dispelling the gloom a little, but the futility of my situation still rests heavily upon me. At least I'm alive. 
Once I've rearranged the coils of rope into a pile I can happily sit on, I allow myself to finally think of Ari. She's got to be alive. She has to be. Surely she can't be a worse position than I am. After all, I'm being held captive by pirates. Which isn't particularly desirable. Although they thankfully didn't kill me on the spot.

She would already be formulating some sort of plan; presumably a hare-brained scheme, just anything, already. Planning her next move. And here I am, sitting on a coil of rope like a little boy waiting for his parents. Is it futile to just wait? Is it futile to allow myself to cling to false hope that someone will rescue me?

Well, I’m going to have to rescue myself. No more sitting around like a floundering duck. I’ve wasted enough time already just by sitting here. As I stand up, the boat sways and I’m sent hurtling into the wall, nearly hitting my head on the narrow beams. How Ari would laugh – although she’d presumably be doing the same thing at this moment. It’s no use mourning the past, though. I can’t unwrite it, no matter how hard I try. If I want to make a difference, I have to state my claim to the throne – and that will be fraught with problems of its own. 

I give the door an experimental shove, but as expected, it doesn’t open. Of course the pirates have locked it, so that I don’t go and test the boundaries of their ‘hospitality’. As if. It seems as though something heavy has been placed in front of it, because when I look under the door, the small space where light would usually come through is dark.

Just my luck. 

In my frustration, I begin to beat on the door with my fists. And that gives me an idea and a devilish smirk stretches across my face. The captain told me to stay quiet, but I could oppose that. Surely it’ll attract his attention, and it’ll show that I’m not just a boy who’s too cowed to dare to oppose him. Yes. I’ll bring the fight to them, even if they’re not willing to listen. I’ll make them listen. I’ll show that I am made of more than they believe I am.

“Get down here, now!” I holler as loudly as I possibly can. Whilst I shout, I listen for the sound of footsteps – which would usually signal that someone’s heard me. Nothing. 

I try again – nothing. Maybe they’re asleep. But then that wouldn’t make sense, because it was only mid-morning when I awoke – I’m sure of it. They could be deliberately ignoring me, because I’ll eventually tire of not receiving their attention. Or it could be something else entirely.
I sigh in resignation, having run through all the possibilities, and slump back down onto the coils of rope. I’m beginning to lose hope steadily. Suddenly, the scraping of something nearby heralds someone’s presence. When a blaze of light signals someone’s arrival, I’m ready, flattened against the wall. My eyes are momentarily overcome by the glare, as the single lantern swinging above my head doesn’t provide much light. 

“Come here.” I hasten to obey the command, nearly tripping in my fear. As I take a tentative step towards the door, my shaking limbs refusing to obey me, the floor under me lurches in the swell, and my shoulder hits the doorframe. I swear under my breath as the jarring pain ripples through my arm, but as soon as it’s there, it’s gone again.

I slowly begin to raise my hands, just to prove that I’m unarmed, but a glare from the corsair indicates for me to lower them. As I lower my hands, a rope is tied around them again, not cruelly tight, but tight enough to impede any thoughts I might have of escaping. As I look down at my bound hands in shock, a shove in the back gets me moving. I still have no idea what precisely is going on, but I’m beginning to gain the glimmerings of an idea. As I emerge into the late afternoon sun, my heart sinks as I notice the multitude of glares aimed in my direction. I have a feeling of what’s about to happen.

But then my suspicions are confirmed incorrect, and my thundering pulse lessens slightly as I’m lead across the deck towards a main stateroom. The door is blowing open, sighing on its hinges.

This ship has borne the brunt of past battles – it’s clear from the ragged sails and other imperfections, such as doors with the paint peeling from them. As I’m led into the stateroom, it surprises me slightly. At odds with the general appearances of the ship, it is upholstered with mahogany panelling, and red silk chairs are dotted around the room. A crimson sunset is visible, masked slightly by the gently billowing chiffon curtains swaddling the arched windows.

But it is the immense table at its centre that fills me with awe. On it is a map of the lake, with Maldréa squarely in the centre, dominating the majority of the space. On the right side, I can see the outcrop on which Hastow is located – it truly feels like a lifetime ago that we visited it. On another map laid out, its corner overlapping with the first map I saw, there is a crudely sketched map of the Maldréan archipelago, detailing the coastline. There’s a few lines of obscure calculations inked on the side of the map, which are probably being used to aid with navigation. I scan it in an attempt to understand the calculations, but then I hurriedly move my gaze away from it as I hear a voice behind me. 

“I can see you’re interested in those. They baffle everyone I know.”  The captain doesn’t sound condescending – in fact, he almost seems appraising. Friendly, even.

“Why did you call for me?” I can’t afford to be friendly to a person I don’t even know. I wince slightly as that same sharp tone I used when I first met Ari, when I was trapped in a destiny which I had not chosen. It seems to return whenever we’re separated, because the sharp tone disappeared as I gradually got to know her.

“Isn’t it obvious?” I shrug at his statement, confused.
“I wanted to know who you are.” Finally. He’s on my side. 
“As I said before, I’m Silas of Daerion. Nothing more, nothing less. I’m not a prince,” I give him a bitter smile, “I have no true claim to the throne. Because my father was Bryndis. Bryndis, the ‘Coward King’. I am no-one.”

“You’re still lying. Lying just to save your skin.” His voice is level, but his eyes are boring into my own.
“I am not a liar.” I take a step towards him. “My father gave his life in defence of his home. He was a father defending his only child. Me. Making sure that I would not live a life of desperation. My friend is dead. Your king bargained my life in exchange for her own.” 

Suddenly, all the hatred vanishes from his face as his eyes widen, leaving only unmasked sorrow in its wake. “Illanwé is not my king. Haven’t you already realised, you little fool, that I’ve only been trying to help you?” 

I bristle at his words. “If you consider locking me in a room and threatening me, I’d say that you haven’t been helping me at all. I’d consider it the opposite of helping, rather.” Then I give him a pointed look as I raise my bound hands. “Is this an indication of how much you’ve tried to help me?” 

He gives me a wry look, then swiftly unties my hands. 
“If you make so much as a bit of trouble for me, you can forgot about me helping you at all. I can just hand you over to the Imperial Guards, in that case.”

My jaw drops open as his words register. “Oh, yes,” He quirks an eyebrow. “The fun is only just beginning.”

**Paradise**

.

Languid limbs hang floating freely

Waving in eternal sleep

Tranquil dim ballet unceasing

In the twilight of the deep

Long pale fingers graceful dancing

Puppet hung on seaweed strings

Bloated face of death all reeling

Arms aloft like lang’rous wings

Brutal corsair chained to wreckage

Rusting iron one leg ensnares

Cruelties he'd borne and given

Quick with lashes, slow to care

Sick with rum and sun and scurvy

Theft and murder, burns and scars

Then the lilting tones so graceful

Angels singing from the stars

Now the whip-hand limp in twilight

Now the lashing tongue is black

Now the shouting voice is silent

Now the sneering face is slack

Incapacitated tyrant

Broken terror of the seas

Left to sway in swells and currents

Cured at last of all disease

Angel song had lured the steersman

Promises of paradise

Rapt in wonder, all had listened

Crags and shoals inflict the price

Long ago his men had drifted

Each to his eternal sleep

Now he flails in silent vigil

Final watch kept in the deep

Angel song had kept its promise

Gone was brutal fear and pain

Now an age of graceful resting

Dancing on a rusted chain"

"Operation Dracula: The Warsaw Pact Invasion of Romania (December 1989), Part 1",AlternateHistory,1i9qadg,2025-01-25 11:11:42,12,0.89,2,https://i.redd.it/69njkdhjz5fe1.jpeg,UltimateLazer,1900s,"From my timeline where the USSR and the Eastern Bloc as a whole survives into the present day due to perestroika and glasnost being much better implemented in this timeline than in our own. Here, tensions escalate because Romania under the hardline Nicolae Ceaușescu refuses to go along with it, combined with relations already being strained, leading up to the invasion to depose him.

In the months leading up to December 1989, Romania stood at a critical crossroads. While the USSR, under Gorbachev, had begun a series of liberalizing reforms through perestroika and the rest of the Warsaw Pact followed suit, Nicolae Ceaușescu remained adamantly opposed. He saw these reforms as ""revisionism"" and a betrayal of communist principles. Already ruling over the most totalitarian state in the Warsaw Pact, Ceaușescu’s stance only further isolated Romania from Moscow, exacerbating a relationship that had been marked by hostility since 1968.

Gorbachev publicly condemned Ceaușescu for the oppressive cult of personality he had built at the expense of the Romanian people. Ceaușescu’s refusal to modernize or heed any advice from the USSR, while his people continued to suffer under his brutal regime, was met with growing disgust within the international socialist community. The final straw came on August 16, 1989, when Ceaușescu declared that Romania would be withdrawing from both the Warsaw Pact and Comecon, the Soviet-led economic alliance, effective immediately. In the same breath, he accused the Soviet Union of betraying the proletariat cause. This act of defiance was deemed intolerable, and the Warsaw Pact leadership concluded that decisive action was necessary.

Plans were drawn for a military intervention, codenamed Operation Dracula, with the aim of swiftly toppling Ceaușescu's regime. The goal was to execute a precise and efficient spec ops mission that would depose Ceaușescu with minimal bloodshed, sparing the Romanian people as much as possible but targeting the regime’s leadership. Gorbachev envisioned Ion Iliescu, a reform-minded Romanian politician, as the new leader, but no direct contact was made with him prior to the invasion. In fact, Iliescu was to be detained during the initial combat phase to ensure his safety, given the volatile situation on the ground.

Ceaușescu, however, was not blind to the growing threat of invasion. His paranoia reached new heights as he ordered a full mobilization of Romania’s standing army and instituted a draft for men aged 18 to 25. By November, the Romanian Army had swelled to over 750,000 active-duty soldiers. Defensive positions were reinforced along Romania’s borders, and Ceaușescu believed that, in light of the Soviet quagmire in Afghanistan and Gorbachev’s perceived political weakness, the USSR would not dare risk an invasion of another country, especially in Europe.

Meanwhile, Operation Dracula was meticulously planned in total secrecy, known only to the upper echelons of the Soviet Politburo and military command. Gorbachev coordinated the operation with the leaders of the Warsaw Pact, ensuring that the invasion would appear as a unified, legitimate humanitarian intervention rather than a single nation imposing its will on an errant ally. All member states agreed to participate. Hungarian leader Miklós Németh, harboring historical grievances against Romania, later revealed that he struggled to contain his enthusiasm, keeping the operation under wraps until the time was right.

The invasion force was formidable. The Soviet Union would lead with over 250,000 troops, while Hungary contributed 70,000, Poland 40,000, East Germany 30,000, Czechoslovakia 20,000, and Bulgaria 25,000. This multinational force of over 435,000 troops, though smaller than Ceaușescu’s mobilized army in total size, had superior technology, battle-hardened experience, and far better morale. The Romanian military, by contrast, suffered from outdated equipment, inadequate infrastructure, low morale, and an almost complete international isolation.

On December 1, 1989, the Warsaw Pact forces launched Operation Dracula.

The invasion of Romania began with a strategic bombing campaign aimed at crippling key military installations and vital infrastructure, followed by a naval blockade in the Black Sea to neutralize the Romanian Navy. Once air superiority was secured, a full-scale ground assault was launched from all available fronts. The Warsaw Pact advanced from the north, northwest, northeast, and south, with the goal of converging on Bucharest, the Romanian capital.

The southern front, originating from Bulgaria, was expected to advance swiftly, given Bucharest's proximity to the border. However, this was the most fortified region, with the Romanian Army laying extensive defenses such as land mines, machine gun nests, barbed wire, booby traps, and even chemical weapons. Complicating matters further, the Soviet presence on the ground in Bulgaria was minimal, leaving the brunt of the invasion to the less experienced and equipped Bulgarian forces.

While hopes were high that this flank could reach Bucharest independently, it quickly became apparent that they would need reinforcements. As a result, the southern offensive soon became primarily focused on securing strategic towns such as Giurgiu and Calarasi to open supply lines and create a staging ground, and then prepare for a later combined assault on Bucharest.

Meanwhile, the northern flanks saw more immediate success. Spread thin and facing a massive invasion force, including the full onslaught of the Soviet Armed Forces, the Romanian Army struggled to defend the broad northern front. Although fierce gunfights and tank battles erupted, many Romanian conscripts, disillusioned and lacking motivation to fight for a regime they no longer believed in, surrendered en masse. Still, the Romanian forces mounted a strong resistance, especially in urban centers.

In Bucharest, Ion Iliescu was alerted to the invasion as sirens wailed and an emergency broadcast was issued. At his home, he was visited by a group of agents posing as members of the Romanian Securitate. In reality, they were undercover KGB operatives, fluent in Romanian and discreetly stationed in Bucharest in anticipation of the invasion. Their mission was to detain Iliescu for his own safety and protect him until the dust settled.

As they covertly escorted him to a safe house, Iliescu was briefed on the situation. Though he viewed Ceaușescu as a danger to Romania and acknowledged that severing ties with Moscow had gone too far, he was conflicted about the full-scale invasion unfolding around him. Nevertheless, he remained largely silent, knowing that he would likely be called upon to lead a post-Ceaușescu Romania.

One of the key constraints faced by the Warsaw Pact forces was self-imposed. Gorbachev and the Politburo had ordered strict limits on targeting civilians in an effort to portray the invasion as a liberation rather than a hostile takeover. Bombing campaigns were restricted to military and infrastructure targets, with Gorbachev explicitly forbidding strikes on Bucharest itself. This restraint, aimed at winning over the Romanian populace, offered an advantage to the defending Romanian Army, which had no such limitations and could use urban and civilian areas to their advantage.

In the northern theater, fighting ground to a halt as Romanian troops dug into defensive positions in the Carpathian Mountains, using the rugged terrain to stall the advancing Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces. Some Soviet soldiers, particularly those with prior experience in Afghanistan, were reminded of the guerrilla tactics they had faced in the mountains there. However, unlike the decentralized mujahideen, the Romanian Army was still a conventional force, limited in its ability to wage a protracted insurgency. Once their positions were exposed or flanked, many Romanian soldiers surrendered rather than continue a hopeless fight.

The Battle of Brașov, which took place from December 9 to 18, 1989, was easily the fiercest and most consequential engagement of Operation Dracula. Known for its brutal street-to-street and building-to-building fighting, Brașov became a symbol of the fierce Romanian resistance, as defenders utilized every piece of terrain to slow down the vastly superior invading forces. It was a key strategic target for the Warsaw Pact due to its central location and the potential to serve as a staging ground for the eventual assault on Bucharest.

The city's geography, nestled within the Carpathian Mountains, gave Romanian forces a natural advantage. Soviet commanders requested airstrikes multiple times to level fortified positions, but these requests were denied due to the politically sensitive nature of the operation. This restriction made Brașov an absolutely grueling battlefield for the invading forces, forcing Warsaw Pact troops to engage in close-quarters combat against a desperate enemy on their own terms.

Soviet forces led the assault, supported by contingents from Poland, Hungary, East Germany, and Czechoslovakia, each assigned to different sectors of the city. The Romanian defenders fought valiantly, capitalizing on Brașov's narrow streets and dense urban layout. The fighting was intense and at times desperate, as Warsaw Pact forces struggled to root out well-entrenched Romanian troops without the use of heavy bombardments.

Despite efforts to minimize civilian casualties, the nature of urban warfare inevitably led to civilians dying. One of the darkest moments of the entire operation was the Brașov massacre, carried out by a rogue Hungarian unit after the end of an intense firefight. Frustrated by the fierce resistance and driven by longstanding ethnic animosity towards Romanians, this unit beat, tortured, and ultimately slaughtered a group of surrendered Romanian soldiers along with dozens of helpless civilians, while treating it as a game played between them.

This atrocity marked the lowest point of the Warsaw Pact intervention and went against the fundamental core of what Operation Dracula was intended to be. For political and practical reasons, however, the Hungarian troops involved were not publicly punished. Instead, they were quietly reassigned away from the front lines and kept out of further involvement in the conflict as a pragmatic measure to avoid escalating tensions within the alliance and to prevent a potential outcry from the Romanian people by having the event become widely publicized to the masses.

Despite their tenacity, Romanian forces were eventually overwhelmed. After nearly ten days of brutal fighting, they were forced to retreat or surrender, conceding Brașov to the invaders. With the city secured, Warsaw Pact forces established it as a key staging ground for the final push towards Bucharest. The fall of Brașov marked a turning point in the invasion, as the Warsaw Pact now had a clear path to Romania’s capital. Though Romanian defenders had put up a fierce fight, the weight of the Warsaw Pact’s combined forces, bolstered by Soviet air superiority and technological advantage, was ultimately too much to resist.

In the ten days following the fall of Brașov, Warsaw Pact forces focused on reinforcing their positions and preparing for the climactic invasion of Bucharest. Meanwhile, Nicolae Ceaușescu, desperate to mount a final defense, issued an order for every remaining soldier to mobilize and drafted all remaining men between the ages of 18 and 45. His hope was to rally a fanatical last stand against the invaders, with the hope they will finally capitulate under such conditions.

However, this plan quickly unraveled. While some answered the call, either out of duty or fear, others saw it as a sign of Ceaușescu's growing desperation and turned against him. Protests erupted throughout Bucharest, spurred by the growing realization that their leader, far from protecting Romania, was more concerned with saving himself. Ceaușescu's own words only deepened the resentment, for his speeches made it all too painfully clear that his primary concern was preserving his own power, not the safety or future of the Romanian people as a whole.

Ceaușescu's reputation, already frayed by years of mismanagement and repression, was now in freefall. The invasion, combined with his failure to defend the country, cemented his image as a coward. Protesters took to the streets en masse, demanding his ouster. In a panicked response, Ceaușescu ordered his guards to fire on the crowds. While some of the security forces obeyed, others, already disillusioned with his rule, defected and joined the anti-Ceaușescu movement. Gunfights soon broke out across Bucharest, with civilians arming themselves and forming impromptu militias. The capital descended into chaos, torn between loyalists, defectors, and ordinary citizens fighting for their future.

For Ceaușescu, the situation had spiraled beyond control. He and his wife, Elena, took refuge in a bunker as violence erupted across the city. The fighting in Bucharest was a grim prelude to what was coming: the full-scale Warsaw Pact assault on Romania’s capital, poised to bring an end to Ceaușescu’s regime once and for all."

My Dear Husband,

I hope this finds you well.  I worry each day we are apart, and find what comfort I can in trusting to the Lord for your safe return.  The war news is all perplexing, and while I know your duty is to our Nation, I wish only for your health and your presence.  I pray the Lord forgive my selfishness.

I hope each day that the tide will turn, and we can see the end of war.  Perhaps fate will see you come to Washington City soon, and I could join you there in peace.

Please remember you are in all our prayers.

Your loving wife,

Mary

My Dearest Mary,

Received your letter some time ago.  The mails are unreliable.  It was a job of work to secure pen and ink, and a moment’s peace in which to respond.

Your words bring me a mixture of joy and sorrow.  Ever greater is my longing to be at your side, with our family.  Yet do not hesitate to reply.  Though your dear words pierce me, I crave them.

It is not likely that I shall see Washington City soon, and it is best that you are well away from there, and the dangers of unpredictable war.

I pray too for our reunion, selfishness be damned.

Yours,

My Dear Abraham,

I must remind myself of the harsh conditions and unsavory elements to be found in the rigors of war and among military men.  Yet it does wound my heart to read your casual oath, and know that you are undoubtedly falling into such habits.

I pray also for your eternal soul, and my words here are not merely stern judgement, but a plea for your sake.  I believe you can find strength in a return to rectitude, and a peace granted only by our Savior, even in the midst of tumult and harsh duty.

Please forgive my remonstrations.  In truth, I wish for your return in any moral state.

Your loving wife,

Mary

Nov. 28

My Darling Wife,

As the blessed Season approaches, I find myself ashamed at such moral failings.  Such oaths have passed my lips more easily of late.

That our young Nation should be so early and so sorely tested is enough to shake the very foundations of faith.  Surely as our cause is righteous, so should it march to glory, yet the war drags on.  The deprivations and misery of all the men at the front is hard to endure.

Yet you are right, as always you have been.  In the Lord there is peace, though all the world be in tribulation.

In the coming New Year, I shall resolve to cease such poor habits, and return to that moral rectitude so foolishly abandoned.

And also shall I Resolve, with all solemnity, to attend my Duty in this war.  Though I see my part as small, yet I know I must not falter in it.

Yours Faithfully,

A. Lincoln, 1st Virginia Cavalry

—-------------------------

Dec. 12

My Dear Husband,

I send along with this some small gifts, in hope they may reach you for Christmas Day.  I know the fare is minimal, and conditions harsh.  I know your Christian heart will delight in sharing such as you have.

My heart swells to hear of your Resolutions, and all doubt dissolves.  Surely our Nation will endure, if you yet cling to faith and duty.  I take such pride in your declaration in closing, of affiliation with your Cavalry.

May God bless you in this Season.

Your devoted wife,

Mary

—---------------------

Feb 2, 1864

Dear Mary,

Received your letter.  What gifts were sent I do not know, as all were stolen en route.

All bets are off and to hell with it.  Provisions are all but gone.  We have seen neither pay nor shoe-leather in months.  My benighted cousin and his Federals are all about us.

I have taken my leave of the Cavalry and the whole damned business.  Desertion is rampant and I see no reason to stay.  You can expect me home soonest.  If I am lucky, I may be able to board a train, if any remain in service in this doomed Nation.

I hope you were sincere in wanting me home in any moral state, for I am abandoning all duty and to hell with rectitude as well.  I am worse for drink, and shall remain so.

Yours,

Abraham B. Lincoln

We live in a 20 year old house in the Northeast. We moved in about a year and a half ago.

Lately have noticed a lot of cracking along the crown molding or where the walls meet the ceilings. This is only happening in one quarter of our house (1st and 2nd floors). 

At first I thought maybe this quarter of the house had some recent settling. We recently had a contractor we trust come over and he said he doesn’t think it’s settling and that it’s actually just really dry in our house due to the forced hot air and the bad draught we had this past year.

He as it gets into spring and summer it should swell up and rejoin and suggested getting a humidifier to help now. 

My question is where is the best spot to put a humidifier with forced air? 

Is it by the intake spot? Or will the filter catch the humid air? 

Is there an attachment I can add to our air blower for whole house humidity? 

Or should we just get multiple smaller units for each room? 

Thanks! "
