# What are stablecoins? 🔍

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are created with the aim of maintaining a stable value, as opposed to assets like [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/bitcoin) whose prices are [highly volatile](https://www.kraken.com/learn/crypto-market-volatility). 

Broadly speaking, there are two main types of stablecoins:

1. Collateralized stablecoins, backed by real world assets and crypto. 
2. Algorithmic stablecoins, managed by algorithms and smart contracts.

Through a variety of methods, stablecoins harness the benefits of blockchain technology while allowing users to park capital in assets that attempt to hold their value.

However, achieving price stability has proved challenging for many, and not all stablecoin projects have succeeded in this endeavor, as we’ll explore below.  


# Why are stablecoins important? 🚨

Stablecoins have been heralded as [‘Crypto’s Killer App’](https://blockworks.co/news/stablecoins-are-cryptos-killer-app-so-far-just-not-terra) and offer a range of functionality in and out of the crypto sphere. Here are some of the main use cases:

* **A bridge:** Stablecoins offer a bridge between the world of traditional finance and DeFi, reducing the operational friction for businesses and individuals to interact with the cryptocurrency space. 
* **Trading:** Stablecoins are considered by some to be the lifeblood of cryptocurrency markets, enabling investors to trade in and out of more volatile assets. Most cryptocurrencies are arguably too volatile to act as a reliable medium of exchange, but stablecoins attempt to resolve this issue. Further, in derivatives markets, futures contracts margined by a [USD-pegged stablecoin](https://cryptoslate.com/insights/decline-in-crypto-margined-futures-signals-shift-towards-stable-collateral/) now account for a sizable proportion of the overall open interest, while Bitcoin-margined futures are in decline. Stablecoins allow traders to trade a range of instruments with superior volume at exchanges where there is no option to trade in fiat currencies.
* **DeFi:** Many of the largest DeFi platforms use stablecoins for collateral, lending assets or providing liquidity, and investors are attracted to using a stablecoin for these purposes. This is evidenced by the huge growth in DeFI [total value locked (TVL)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1272181/defi-tvl-in-multiple-blockchains/) since 2018, which is forecasted to grow from $59b billion in 2023 to [$337 billion by 2030](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/decentralized-finance-technology-market-107823).
* **The Unbanked:** If you reside in a nation where your local fiat currency is being debased or you don’t have access to reliable financial services, stablecoins offer a lifeline. Through the use of peer-to-peer exchanges, crypto ATMs and decentralized exchanges, anyone with a smartphone and an internet connection can interact with this digital economy. Borderless, programmable with faster transaction times and lower fees, stablecoins are also used for remittances, offering a cheaper alternative to [traditional remittance services](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/education-centre/stablecoins-for-remittances-a-potential-game-changer/). 



# What are the different types of stablecoins? 📚

As mentioned above, broadly speaking, there are two types of stablecoins. First, let’s examine **collateralized stablecoins**, which are crypto assets backed by reserves of different assets, such as fiat currencies, commodities or cryptocurrencies. 

# Fiat and commodity-backed stablecoins

# Fiat-backed stablecoins operate in the same way as other digital assets, except that they aim to be pegged to real-world currencies on a 1-to-1 basis. 

Stablecoins exist on multiple different blockchains, and can be [bridged between chains](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-blockchain-bridge). This enables users to seamlessly move capital around as they might with other assets.

Because of the transparency afforded by blockchain technology, every stablecoin can be easily accounted for, which in some cases has resulted in [assets being frozen](https://therecord.media/tether-freezes-29-million-crypto-connected-to-scam-marketplace). 

The lifecycle of fiat-backed stablecoins typically follow the same five steps:

After completing KYC, an individual or entity deposits fiat currency into the issuer's bank account. 

1. The company then issues the stablecoins to the entity’s supplied wallet address. 
2. The stablecoins then enter the digital asset ecosystem for people to use. 
3. Users can redeem the stablecoins back into fiat currencies at their discretion by returning them to the issuer.
4. The stablecoins are then removed from circulation, returning the corresponding amount of fiat back to the holder’s bank account.



Note that fiat-backed stablecoins are not the same as central bank digital currencies, which are issued by central banks and not companies.

Fiat-backed stablecoins [dominate overall stablecoin activity](https://www.forbes.com/digital-assets/categories/stablecoins/?sh=5a068fd01cd0) for a few reasons:

* Despite [adverse media](https://cryptoslate.com/exclusive-inside-tethers-battle-with-fud-and-financial-resilience-reveals-ceo-paolo-ardoino/), they have performed their function reliably over a sustained period (Tether launched in 2014), which has engendered a robust sense of stability and trust. 
* Fiat-backed stablecoins are incredibly liquid and widely adopted by a huge variety of decentralized and centralized platforms. This allows traders to interact with these coins knowing that there will always be sufficient liquidity to swap them for other assets. 
* Unlike other variants of stablecoins, how they work and how they are backed is much more straightforward compared to their algorithmic equivalent. 
* Tether and Circle are required to [comply with regulation](https://coingeek.com/stablecoin-regulations-eyed-what-does-it-mean-for-tether/) and employ independent auditors to verify that the issuers combined assets exceed their combined liabilities.

A less popular variant of collateralized stablecoins are backed by fungible commodities such as gold, silver or oil. 

Rather than being pegged to a dollar or a euro, commodity-backed stablecoins represent a unit of a specific commodity, such as one Troy ounce of gold. 

As with fiat-backed stablecoins, the companies issuing these coins are expected to publish regular independent audits of their physical reserves to ensure holders that they can redeem their tokens for their equivalent value of the underlying asset. 

For those seeking exposure to commodities, these stablecoins enable users to do so without having to consider storage or portability. They are typically highly liquid, can be fractionalized and are issued by reputable firms.

There have been attempts to collateralize [oil](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/oilcoin-the-worlds-first-legally-compliant-cryptocurrency-backed-by-oil-300569307.html) and [agricultural commodities](https://www.santander.com/en/press-room/press-releases/2022/03/santander-and-agrotoken-join-forces-to-offer-loans-secured-by-cryptoassets), but these projects have so far failed to gain any meaningful traction.

# Popular examples

Fiat and commodity stablecoins are backed by a 1:1 reserve of real-world assets, but how they are backed can differ slightly depending on the coin. The largest and most liquid examples are:

1. [Tether (USDT)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/tether): with $123b in circulation, USDT is [backed by](https://tether.to/en/transparency/?tab=reports) a mixture of USD reserves (83.89%), secured loans (5.36%) precious metals (3.95%), Bitcoin (3.81%) and other investments (2.97%), at press time.
2. [USD Coin (USDC)](https://prices/usdc): with [$36.8b USDC in circulation](https://www.circle.com/transparency), backed by the equivalent value of US dollar denominated assets, totalling $37b, at press time.
3. [Tether Gold (XAUT)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/tether-gold): issued by Tether, this gold-backed coin allows holders to redeem their tokens for physical gold which Tether states it will deliver to[ any address in Switzerland](https://gold.tether.to/).
4. [PAX Gold (PAXG)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/pax-gold): Regulated by the New York Department for Financial Services, one PAX Gold token represents one fine Troy ounce of a gold bar. PAXG has significantly more [volume](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pax-gold/) than its competitors. 

Some other noteworthy examples are: 

* [Gemini USD (GUSD)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/gemini-dollar)
* [Paxos USD (USDP)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/pax-dollar)
* [Mountain Protocol USD (USDM)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/mountain-protocol-usd)
* [First Digital USD (FDUSD)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/first-digital-usd)
* [Maker DAO’s DAI](https://www.kraken.com/prices/dai)
* [TrueUSD (TUSD)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/true-usd)
* [Frax (FRAX)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/frax)

# Associated risks

In December 2023, S&P Global published its ‘[Stablecoin Stability Assessment](https://press.spglobal.com/2023-12-12-S-P-Global-Ratings-Launches-Stablecoin-Stability-Assessment)’, where it rated several prominent stablecoins, examining factors such as quality risks, collateralization, legal and regulatory framework, and redeemability to name a few. 

The findings of the report made the following stability assessments of the major stablecoins, from strongest to weakest::

1. USD Coin: 2 (strong)
2. Gemini Dollar: 2 (strong)
3. Pax Dollar: 2 (strong)
4. Dai: 4 (constrained)
5. First Digital USD: 4 (constrained)
6. Tether: 4 (constrained)
7. Frax: 5 (weak)
8. TrueUSD: 5 (weak)

Looking into the report, there are a few common risk factors that are assessed:

**Systemic Failure:** A depegging event occurs when a stablecoin’s value deviates from its underlying real-world asset. 

This has happened many times over the industry’s history, with perhaps the most recent major event being in March 2023, when USDC depegged in part due to [its exposure to Silicon Valley Bank](https://blog.ledn.io/en/usdc-depeg). As with many similar events, the situation was partially rectified by arbitrage traders who quickly bought up the distressed asset at a discount. 

**Regulation:** Fiat-backed stablecoins have come under considerable scrutiny over the years, and the degree to which punitive regulation can damage trust and stability is an ever-present concern.

**Counterparty Risk:** Something that has dogged Tether for many years is the alleged lack of transparency with regards to their reserves. In 2022, Tether was ordered by a U.S. judge to produce financial records relating to the backing of USDT. One of the great risks inherent to all stablecoins is that users may someday find themselves unable to redeem their crypto stablecoins for the fiat collateral.

**Centralization:** Many of the major stablecoins are issued by centralized companies, which users have to trust to maintain sufficient reserves and act appropriately. Stablecoin transactions are not necessarily permissionless - companies have cooperated with law enforcement to [freeze assets on occasion](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/08/circle-confirms-freezing-100k-in-usdc-at-law-enforcements-request/).  


# Cryptocurrency-backed stablecoins

# Cryptocurrency-backed stablecoins operate very similarly to fiat-backed stablecoins with a few key differences. 

Due to the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, these stablecoins are often over-collateralized, meaning more cryptocurrency is held in reserve or “pledged” than the stablecoin value issued. 

For example, a $1 cryptocurrency-backed stablecoin might require $2 worth of cryptocurrency in reserve. This means that even if the reserve currency backing the stablecoin were to decline by as much as 50%, it should still be able to maintain its peg. 

Maker DAI is an open-source platform that allows users to take out loans in the form of DAI, which is pegged to the value of 1 US dollar. DAI is collateralized by cryptocurrencies. 

Here’s how DAI works:

1. Users wanting to acquire DAI must first lock up their Ethereum or other assets into a smart contract. Over collateralization enables the stablecoin to hold its peg. 
2. Fungible DAI tokens are then generated, reflecting the amount of collateral pledged. The user is then free to deploy the DAI in any way that they see fit. 
3. If users want to recover their collateralized assets, they must return the DAI issued and pay a stability fee. 

Automated smart contracts known as Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs) dynamically manage supply by creating or burning DAI, and by liquidating positions where there is insufficient collateral. 

If you want to learn more about DAI, [this article by Kraken Learn](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-dai) offers a more detailed explanation. 

# Popular examples

In addition to DAI, here are some other popular examples of crypto-backed stablecoins:

1. [Synthetix USD (SUSD)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/susd)**:** Using its native SNX token as collateral, users can lock SNX tokens as collateral to mint sUSD, maintaining a collateralization ratio of 500% or higher. This high over-collateralization ratio is supposed to help absorb price fluctuations in SNX.
2. [Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/wrapped-bitcoin): WBTC is a 1:1 representation of Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Each WBTC token is reportedly fully backed by an equivalent amount of Bitcoin held in custody.
3. [Decentralized USD (USD)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/usdd): Introduced in May 2022, USDD is an over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin pegged to 1 U.S. dollar.

# Associated risks

**Systemic risks:** There have been many instances where stablecoins have run into trouble from systemic failures, resulting from some form of exploit. 

Stablecoins depend on smart contracts, oracles and blockchain networks to work efficiently. A failure, bug, exploit or other issue with these smart contracts may lead to a failure in their ability to allow tokens to be redeemed for any underlying collateral, which could cause the stablecoin to de-peg. In March 2020, [‘Network congestion and high gas prices’](https://blog.makerdao.com/the-market-collapse-of-march-12-2020-how-it-impacted-makerdao/) led to the theft of $8M in MakerDAO collateral. The destabilization of other stablecoins can have a knock-on effect; when USDC depegged in 2023, it also [resulted in the depegging of DAI](https://www.spglobal.com/_assets/documents/ratings/research/101590839.pdf). 

Depegging can sometimes be resolved by smart contract-driven corrective measures which manage the supply, but this is not always the case. 

**Regulation:** The lack of a regulatory regime for decentralized applications, of which there is no centralized custodian, presents its own unique challenges and risks. It is unclear exactly how DeFi platforms will be regulated in future, and there is a great deal of uncertainty as to how punitive or restrictive any policies might be.

**Collateralization:** Because crypto-backed stablecoins use collateral that is highly volatile, there is always the possibility that a very sharp move down in price could cause liquidation—particularly when a single asset represents a significant portion of the overall pool of collateral. For example, USDC represents a significant portion of DAI’s collateral. If USDC de-pegs, or the issuer of USDC freezes USDC, this could cause DAI to de-peg. This is much less likely due to mandatory over-collateralization, but the risk always remains.   


# Algorithmic stablecoins

# Algorithmic stablecoins employ a variety of smart contract-based mechanisms to maintain a stable value by responding dynamically to supply and demand. 

Unlike asset-backed stablecoins which have reserves that act as collateralization, algorithmic stablecoins typically mint and burn coins to maintain a peg and are not backed by real world assets. Additionally, these may include a secondary bond token which can be bought and redeemed for the underlying stablecoin to assist with stabilizing its price through arbitrage.

Additionally, these may include a secondary bond token which can be bought and redeemed for the underlying stablecoin to assist with stabilizing its price through arbitrage.

Note that while DAI uses smart contracts to manage the supply and adjust the stability fee, it is not an algorithmic stablecoin because it is fully collateralized. Algorithmic stablecoins are fully dependent on algorithms to manage the peg. If demand for the token increases and exceeds $1, the supply is increased. Conversely, if demand falls, supply decreases.

**Popular examples**

Perhaps due to the unprecedented failure of Terra USD (UST) and the inherent complexities of algorithmic stablecoin, there are fewer coins of this ilk with any meaningful adoption. 

* [Ampleforth (AMPL)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/ampleforth) is an algorithmic stablecoin that “...is a price-stable but supply volatile cryptocurrency that targets the (2019) CPI-adjusted dollar.” Via a non-dilutive process known as ‘rebasing’, supply is programmatically increased or decreased using data feeds from [Chainlink (LINK)](https://www.kraken.com/prices/chainlink). Therefore the supply is constantly expanding and contracting, with holders balances fluctuating on a daily basis. As a result, the stablecoin has repeatedly managed to return to its target price despite [challenging market conditions](https://docs.ampleforth.org/reports/ampleforth-network-durability). 

For a more detailed explanation of how Ampleforth works, [check out this guide](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-ampleforth-ampl) by Kraken Learn. 

# Associated risks

**Systemic Failure:** The greatest risk of using algorithmic stablecoins is that the rebasing system is unable to maintain the peg or completely fails. In May 2022, the $18b algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) had a catastrophic meltdown. In what appeared to be a targeted attack that preceded a miraculous [series of events](https://www.nansen.ai/research/on-chain-forensics-demystifying-terrausd-de-peg), the UST stablecoin fatally depegged and the native LUNA token lost 96% of its value in a single day, erasing $28b from the Terra ecosystem. 

In summary, it is hard to overstate the significance of the role that stablecoins play in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Stablecoins act as a bridge for traditional finance, facilitate cross-border payments and offer a fully collateralized, crypto-based medium of exchange with a stable value. The several variations of stablecoins are the lifeblood of decentralized finance, but investors should carefully consider how they work and the attached risks before deploying capital into them.

The main reason here is that traditional stock market as we all know operates only on weekdays and off on weekends, with the RWA’s trading (buying, selling) will be 24/7 

Note: the big institutions were and still not a big fan of crypto but they can see the real uses of blockchain and how they can be even richer, but time will change their mindset 

Now you can imagine the inflows to start flowing into Ethereum and why you should be extremely bullish on ETH for the long term"

Important Update: Synthetix V3 Migration Begins with Synthetix Treasury Council,synthetix_io,1eby9r8,2024-07-25 11:50:23,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/synthetix_io/comments/1eby9r8/important_update_synthetix_v3_migration_begins/,tradersinsight,,"The Treasury Council has begun the L1 staker migration to V3. Key changes for Ethereum L1 stakers:

* Liquidations now occur immediately when crossing the liquidation ratio threshold. No more 8-hour delay.
* Liquidated debt & SNX distributed directly to stakers on V3, not escrowed.
* V3 stakers (currently only Treasury Council) absorb liquidated SNX and debt.
* Liquidation Ratio: The Spartan Council is currently debating lowering the liquidation ratio to 120% with SCCP-343, due to the above update.

Staker migration expected to open in 2-3 weeks. No immediate action required. **Upcoming in Phase 2:**

* Suspension of minting/staking/issuing sUSD on L1
* Suspension of self-liquidation & account merging on L1
* sUSD to V3 sUSD bridge implementation
* Suspension of L1-L2 debt bridge

Users will not be force migrated. Optional migration UI coming soon. Read more [https://blog.synthetix.io/synthetix-v3-migration-treasury-council-initiates-transition/](https://blog.synthetix.io/synthetix-v3-migration-treasury-council-initiates-transition/)"
"SNXweave Weekly Recap - July 24, 2024",synthetix_io,1ebwdih,2024-07-25 10:32:27,4,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/synthetix_io/comments/1ebwdih/snxweave_weekly_recap_july_24_2024/,tradersinsight,,"*The following post contains a recap of news, projects, and important updates from the Spartan Council, Core Contributors, and Ambassador Council from last week.*

#### 👉TLDR

-   L1 Migration to V3: Legacy markets were launched on L1 last week! The Treasury Council was the first account to migrate and will continue to back sUSD liquidity on V3, as well as the new L1 Perps Market, which will help scale the new product.
-   Second phase: Migration will be open for all stakers, which will change how liquidation happens (see below for details). There will also be a suspension of sUSD minting and staking on V2X on Ethereum to encourage stakers to move over to V3, the bridge to move debt from V2X on L1 to L2 will be suspended, and there will be a bridge available to swap sUSD for the new snxUSD.
-   [*SIP-398*](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-398/?ref=blog.synthetix.io)*: Chainlink Data Streams for Synthetix V3 on Arbitrum *presentation recap (see below)

#### Spartan Council and SIP updates

*Present at the July 17, 2024 Spartan Council Weekly Project Sync:\
Spartan Council: Afif, cyberduck, Jackson, Millie, ml_sudo, Snax Frens, snxmaximalists\
Core Contributors: 0xMithrandir, 0xrobin, Fred, jz, Kaleb, meb, Mike, pixelperfect, troy*

Last week the team launched the legacy markets on L1! This means there is now a new market connected to V2X (similar to the Spartan Council market on Base) that will hold the Treasury Council position. The TC was the first account to migrate and will continue to back sUSD liquidity on V3, as well as the new L1 Perps Market, which will help scale the new product.

In the second phase, likely ready in the next two weeks, migration will be open for all stakers. This will change how liquidation happens --- let's get into how:

-   Currently there is a 6-hour waiting period after positions are flagged for liquidation
-   In the new system, liquidations will happen immediately and are socialized to all V3 staking positions (V2X will no longer be a part of the socialized liquidation pool)
-   Self-liquidation will no longer be available in V3
-   Liquidation rewards will no longer be escrowed either --- instead, stakers who receive those rewards will be able to sell the SNX or use it to strengthen their c-ratio

Also in the second stage, there will be a suspension of sUSD minting and staking on V2X on Ethereum to encourage stakers to move over to V3. The bridge to move debt from V2X on L1 to L2 will also be suspended, and there will be a bridge available to swap sUSD for the new snxUSD.

Next, there was a SIP presentation last week: SIP-398, presented by Raoul from Chainlink, which proposes integrating Chainlink Data Streams into the Synthetix V3 deployment on Arbitrum to bolster the protocol's security and performance. Let's recap the presentation:

[*SIP-398*](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-398/?ref=blog.synthetix.io)*: Chainlink Data Streams for Synthetix V3 on Arbitrum*

-   Raoul explained that V3 was designed to be oracle agnostic and this SIP proposes adding the option for integrators to choose between Chainlink or Pyth
-   He suggested a test phase where Synthetix would integrate the Chainlink oracle on 10 markets on Arbitrum to further assess performance compared to alternative providers
-   Chainlink Data Streams boasts the following attributes:
    -   Reliability: Data Streams is secured by the same decentralized infrastructure and professional node operators that secures most of the TVL in DeFi
    -   Accuracy: Data Streams tracks markets extremely closely, usually within half a BIP, and this is verified through Chainlink data as well as by third parties
    -   Security: Due to the commit reveal architecture, the price is not revealed until the trade is committed to. This architecture also allows for hypothetical trade execution with bid/ask data which protects the protocol from frontrunning
    -   Low Latency: Data from centralized exchanges is translated to Chainlink pricing very quickly (usually within 1 second, compared to competitors' 2--4 seconds)
-   Chainlink has also offered to take on a great deal of the integration work on their end, which would reduce the integration burden for Synthetix CCs
-   The cost (paid to Chainlink) will be 1.5% of the fees generated
    -   This will likely be pushed to end users in the form of higher transaction costs to use these low latency oracles
-   Chainlink is also working towards being able to spin up price feeds faster than in the past (hopefully, within 24 hours of a token launch)
-   They will be providing full API access for keepers in the Synthetix ecosystem
-   Burt brought up an issue regarding use of multiple oracles on the same network
    -   Raoul confirmed that there wouldn't be anything *technically*prohibiting integrators from using multiple oracles on a single network
    -   Burt flagged that with the differences in price reports, use of different oracles would likely require different market listings, which wouldn't be ideal from a UX perspective"

Additionally, the firm also provided the details of the respective development.

In a recent blog post on its official web portal, the company pointed toward the likely increased real yield. It mentioned that the former version V2 chiefly focused on providing incentives for participation via SNX’s inflationary minting. On the other hand, the latest version V3 transitions from the respective model. It rather focuses on the distribution and generation of real yield through trading fees. The respective yield goes to the liquidity providers.

1. **Research and Choose a Cryptocurrency Exchange**: Start by researching and selecting a reputable cryptocurrency exchange that supports SNX and operates in Saudi Arabia. Look for platforms that offer SNX trading pairs with fiat currencies or other cryptocurrencies.

2. **Sign Up and Verify Your Account**: Once you've chosen an exchange, sign up for an account and complete the necessary verification process. This typically involves providing personal information and verifying your identity to comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations.

3. **Deposit Funds**: After your account is verified, deposit funds into your exchange account. Depending on the exchange, you may be able to deposit Saudi Riyals (SAR) directly or you may need to deposit another cryptocurrency like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) and then exchange it for SNX.

4. **Place an Order**: Once your funds are deposited, navigate to the trading section of the exchange and place an order to buy SNX. You can choose between market orders, which execute immediately at the current market price, or limit orders, which allow you to specify the price at which you want to buy SNX.

5. **Withdraw Your SNX**: After your order is filled, your SNX will be credited to your exchange account. For security purposes, consider withdrawing your SNX to a personal cryptocurrency wallet that you control, rather than leaving them on the exchange.

By following these steps, you can buy Synthetix (SNX) in Saudi Arabia and start participating in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

Synthetix (SNX) to protokół finansowy zbudowany na blockchainie Ethereum, który umożliwia tworzenie i wymianę zdecentralizowanych syntetycznych aktywów. Dla inwestorów poszukujących tego aktywu, istnieje kilka platform, na których można dokonać zakupu Synthetix (SNX).

1. **Giełdy kryptowalutowe:**
   Giełdy kryptowalutowe są popularnym miejscem, gdzie można kupić Synthetix (SNX). Platformy takie jak Binance, Coinbase Pro, Kraken czy Bitfinex oferują szeroki wybór kryptowalut, w tym SNX. Warto jednak pamiętać o prowizjach i ograniczeniach, które mogą mieć wpływ na koszt zakupu.

2. **Dezentralizowane giełdy (DEX):**
   DeFi (Decentralized Finance) stało się coraz popularniejsze, a wraz z nim wzrosła popularność dezentralizowanych giełd. Platformy takie jak Uniswap, SushiSwap czy 1inch Exchange umożliwiają zakup Synthetix (SNX) bez konieczności zakładania konta czy weryfikacji tożsamości. Wadą może być jednak wyższy spread oraz koszty transakcyjne.

3. **Protokoły rolnictwa dochodu:**
   Dla bardziej zaawansowanych inwestorów istnieją także protokoły rolnictwa dochodu (yield farming), które umożliwiają zarabianie dodatkowych tokenów SNX poprzez dostarczanie płynności do odpowiednich pooli na platformach takich jak Curve Finance czy Balancer.

Wybór platformy zależy od preferencji użytkownika, biorąc pod uwagę czynniki takie jak dostępność, koszty transakcyjne oraz bezpieczeństwo. Zawsze warto dokładnie zbadać wybraną platformę i upewnić się, że spełnia ona oczekiwania.

Problem is, there is almost no dex liquidity on this chain. 

Since i can't re-deposit these tokens onto kucoin, i'm not sure what to do.

Any ideas? I may attempt to make a swap contract just to allow someone to buy these tokens from me for KCS. I'm hoping to get my funds into KCS or transferred to another chain with more liquidity"

Let's kick off with Polkadot, the versatile multi-chain platform, and it's DOT token. With scalability being the buzzword in the DeFi world, Polkadot’s interoperability could be the lifesaver that many projects need. With parachains and cross-chain transfers, it has proven to be the Swiss army knife of blockchain technology. Plus, with its governance features, DOT is a token with both utility and prospects for growth.

2. Chainlink (LINK)
What’s behind Door Number 2? Oh, it’s Chainlink - the 'oracle' of the DeFi world. Well, maybe not an oracle, but the LINK network is piping off-chain data onto the blockchain and providing reliable information to smart contracts. It’s like a DeFi data waterboy. No bull run can ever take off without this speedster hitching the ride.

3. Cardano (ADA)
How could we leave out DeFi’s very own tortoise, Cardano? With its slow and steady academic approach, it has won many hearts in the cryptoverse. ADA, Cardano's native token, has proven to be one of the most sustainable cryptos in the market. It’s like the calm sea before the killer wave, and it might just be the right time to dive in.

4. Uniswap (UNI)
Imagine a crypto Starbucks; a platform where you can exchange any ERC20 token for another. That’s Uniswap for you. With its permissionless interface and decentralization, UNI is making strides in the DeFi world. As long as there are new ICOs on ETH network, Uniswap's gonna be serving cups of joe to the early birds.

5. Synthetix (SNX)
This one’s for those who love to invest in assets, real or synthetic. Synthetix is a DeFi protocol that allows users to mint and trade synthetic assets representing real-world commodities. The SNX token, therefore, is a gateway to the world of virtual commodities. Riding this wave could be more adventurous than you think.

6. Aave (AAVE)
You thought money markets were only for the traditional financiers, didn't you? Think again. As the backbone of DeFi loans, AAVE is your ticket into the fast-paced world of lending and borrowing without those annoying bank suits. You can stake, lend, and earn, all on AAVE.

7. Compound (COMP)
Looking for more action in the lending battlefield? Check out Compound. Just like AAVE, COMP is a DeFi lending protocol, but here's the twist - borrowers can also earn COMP, just like lenders! That's got ""investment opportunity"" written all over it!

8. Maker (MKR)
Debts can be lifelines, and nobody knows this better than MakerDAO. With its unique concept of collateral debts, MKR token, and stablecoin DAI, Maker is reinventing financial debts. Plus, its community-based approach keeps the power in the hands of the people. Saddle up for an interesting ride!

9. Yearn.finance (YFI)
Don't let the nerdy name fool you. It's a DeFi protocol that will automate your investment stints with yield farming. Imagine a smart broker with a smarter algorithm, on the hunt for the best yields. That's YFI for you. Load up the spaceship with the rocket fuel!

10. Rebellion Protocol (REBL)
Last but definitely not the least, Rebellion Protocol or REBL. This beauty is a crypto-focused venture capital (VC) fund run by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). It's one of the first Investment DAOs, and let me tell you; Investment DAOs are expected to go parabolic this year. With experienced people at the helm, this investment fund promises to be more lucrative and more fun than any ordinary VC firm. Its motto “You don’t need a suit to run Wall Street” rings loud and clear. Check out Rebellion Protocol’s homepage for more.

Conclusion
The cryptocurrency world is chockfull of gems waiting to be unearthed. These are just ten of the countless promising altcoins out there. Just remember, these aren't fortune cookies, and I am not a fortune teller. Do your due diligence before you dive into any investment opportunity.

While crypto investments can be the rocket boosters to your portfolio, they can also be the black holes. Don't just follow the herd! Crypto markets are volatile, and prices can dip faster than you can say ""Bitcoin"". Hence, it is crucial to do your own research before going all-in. Your investment choice should be based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and the time you are willing to commit.

Synthetix questions,synthetix_io,1asgyre,2024-02-16 14:16:58,9,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/synthetix_io/comments/1asgyre/synthetix_questions/,Inkriegel,,"I have spent the last few days leraning about synthetix as it got my attention. Some questions came to my mind as I read the litepaper and the documentation. Appreciate any help understanding theese better:

1. If synths are backed by SNX, what happens if the SNX price crashes heavily below what the collaterization ratio would protect against? Suddenly users would no longer be able to sell synths as they will not be properly backed. (Obviously missing something)

2. Why do I get sUSD when staking SNX? SNX price fluctuates, so am I essentially selling my SNX and am no longer exposed to it’s price? If the price increases do I need to burn more sUSD than I minted to get the same SNX back?

3. The documentation says: “The oracle is responsible for collecting and updating all token prices known to the Synthetix system. Although it is not a contract, it controls a known Ethereum address from which price updates are sent to the ExchangeRates contract.” Who is the oracle? Who controlls the address? Isn’t there a single point of failure if the address is compromised? Why do we trust this address?"

It can be simple though, specially if you ""just"" hold the token! I have been growing my interest on synthetics due to infinitude of possibilities that it allows, and how important its flexibility can be in order to solve specific problems.

Here's my main holdings:

[**Synthetix**](https://synthetix.io/) **- $SNX -** by far may largest bag from the list, and the market leader in synthetics.

Synthetix is building a decentralized liquidity provisioning protocol that any protocol can tap into for various purposes. Its deep liquidity and low fees serve as a backend for many exciting protocols on both Optimism and Ethereum. Many user-facing protocols in the Synthetix ecosystem, such as Kwenta (Spot and Futures), Lyra (Options), Polynomial (Automated Options), and 1inch & Curve (Atomic Swaps), tap into Synthetix liquidity to power their protocols. Synthetix is built on Optimism and Ethereum mainnet. 

[**Uma**](https://uma.xyz/) **- $UMA**

UMA is an optimistic oracle and dispute arbitration system that securely allows for arbitrary types of data to be brought on-chain. UMA’s oracle system provides data for projects including a cross-chain bridge, insurance protocols, custom derivatives and prediction markets.  UMA's oracle is used to create many other types of products and protocols. 

[**Dafi Protocol**](https://www.dafi.io/) **- $DAFI**

 DAFI is building an entirely new incentive model for every protocol & application. Today, everything decentralized relies on inflation, an example is miners earning Bitcoin in return for maintaining the Blockchain.  DAFI creates limitless applications with reduced inflation, by replacing simple token rewards with dTokens. As a network grows in demand, dTokens distributed to users can increase in quantity. Essentially, DAFI converts demand volatility into user rewards. There's also a hybrid exchange  on beta testing stages.

[**Horizon Protocol**](https://horizonprotocol.com/) **- $HZN**

Horizon Protocol is a DeFi platform that facilitates the on-chain trading of synthetic assets that represent the real economy. Horizon Protocol seeks to provide exposure to real-world assets risk/return profiles via smart contracts on the blockchain. Forked from Synthetix, Horizon Protocol will leverage the time-tested derivative liquidity protocol and bring interoperability, scalability and a whole new array of tradable, real-world derivative products to the DeFi ecosystem. Horizon Protocol’s commitment to the Binance ecosystem and native implementation on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) offers users the speed and dependability that is currently lacking on the Ethereum blockchain. 

&#x200B;

I am currently holding all those tokens, but I am actively looking for more exposure to synthetics. Wondering if anyone has anything worth looking into/buying?"

Chainlink is the middleman who doesn’t skim off the top. It securely connects off-chain data to on-chain smart contracts. This one's being snapped up like free beer at a frat party by big names like Google and Oracle. Missing out on LINK? Good luck explaining that one!

4. Polkadot (DOT)

Polkadot is the United Nations of blockchain, letting different networks communicate. It’s groundbreaking functionality in the scalability department has made it a hot property. An investment here could dot your wallet with some impressive figures!

9. Synthetix (SNX)

Ever wished you could jump on the commodities market with your crypto? Synthetix lets you mint, trade and gain on 'synthetic' assets bound to real-world commodities. It’s like playing Monopoly with real money. Go, SNX!

10. Algorand (ALGO)

Doing a darn good job of being the backbone for DeFi, Algorand promises security, scalability, and decentralization. It's more than just a token; it's potential leverage for consumer-based applications.

RSI Indicator Suggests ETH Pump isn't Over Yet; Analyst Warned Not to Short the Current Pump Cycle,ethtrader,18c8hgs,2023-12-06 12:00:59,2,0.55,27,https://i.redd.it/bzec7lw4hp4c1.jpg,pythonskynet,Sentiment,"The Ethereum price has increased considerably since October. Despite the upward movement, the rate of increase lagged behind that of Bitcoin and numerous other altcoins.

Nevertheless, the ETH price finally broke out from the $2,000 resistance area last month, validating it as support. The ongoing increase suggests that the breakout is not a deviation like that in April (red circle). The weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) gives an interesting reading.

If the RSI reading is above 50 and the trend is upward, bulls still have an advantage, but if the reading is below 50, the opposite is true. The RSI is increasing and is above 50.

The closest resistance is currently at $3,000, 40% above the current price. If the current cycle is similar to the last one, the ETH price will reach it this month.

[This ETH technical analysis posted on [beincrypto website first](https://beincrypto.com/december-crypto-predictions/), which also had TA on BTC and SNX (Synthetix).

Another prominent cryptocurrency analyst has issued a stark warning to investors: avoid shorting Bitcoin and altcoins during their current rally.

>People keep trying to time the top with shorts and/or profit taking because they believe this rally is ""overheated"". 

>Guys, look at the data. There is literally nothing ""overheated"" about this rally. 

>We simply keep sending it till every last bear is dead.

**Projected Synthetix** **📷**[**SNX**](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-SNX/) **Perp V3 upgrade**

The Synthetix bulls are on a rampage today after the protocol unveiled plans for a new upgrade dubbed Perp V3. As highlighted in its announcement, Perp V3 will build on the success of V2, and the plan is to launch the new trading engine on the Base Layer-2 network. 

The protocol recanted the success it recorded with V2, noting that it achieved a $30 billion milestone riding on the back of advanced innovations like on-chain perps, a focus on risk management, and the debut of ""now-standard features like dynamic funding rates and price impact.""

With Synthetix now coasting on to V3, the protocol said users can expect to enjoy the collateral of multiple assets, including sUSD, sETH and sBTC, among others, for use as margin. While liquidity upgrades will also be at the forefront of the Perp V3 innovation, Synthetix highlighted how it will introduce cross margins and integrate account-based access. 

Notably, the V3 hype has been around for some time, yet the launch date was not revealed. The excitement surrounding the upgrade has, however, forced Synthetix traders to drive the price of SNX higher.

**Potential price trend to watch**

Synthetix **📷**[**SNX**](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-SNX/) is known for occasional bullish price action that typically takes a detour from the general market. This ongoing rally is proof that the token remains a highly regarded asset among altcoin traders.

Should the current momentum continue, we May see the price of SNX soar as high as $4 in the short term as an attempt to retest its all-time high (ATH) of $28.77 remains the ultimate long-term goal."

Highest return Grayscale product 2025 Bull Run (for IRA): DEFG defi trust? HZEN Horizen trust?,CryptoCurrency,17twqmu,2023-11-12 18:17:05,12,0.77,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/17twqmu/highest_return_grayscale_product_2025_bull_run/,TheRealTheory001,DISCUSSION,"For IRA consideration, which Grayscale products would you buy today for  the highest return in 2025 bull run?   Obviously custodial crytpo carries risks vs self custody, but for funds stuck in an IRA, there is nothing else that offers the return.   We're talking about a tiny IRA, like 5%  investment.  So the goal is highest risk/reward. Hats off to people who bought the BTC bottom at 50%  discount, or SOL. That would be the play.  But starting from today:

BTC & ETH premiums are about zero'd out and would probably offer a 3x to 7x.

Most of the alts trusts are trading at multiples of their value.  I'll wait for a cool off either way.  Solana is at 10x premium.   I may still go 20% into SOL if there is a pullback but does anyone see paying $600 for $60 SOL as a good move?  Usually by bull peak, the premium diminishes fwir.

I'm looking at DEFG defi trust which is trading close to zero premium. Composition:  UNI Uniswap 40%/ LDO Lido DAO 20%/  AAVE Aave 15%/ MKR Maker dao13%/ SNX Synthetix 7%/ CRV Curve 5%.     UNI is going KYC in January 2024, so if it loses market share it could hurt it's price significantly.  But I think this one may be the best return? UNI is still 87% down from ATH. LDO 68%,  AAVE 85%.

The other options are

Horizen ZEN (93% down, 35% premium).

ZCash (90% down, 10% discount)

Livepeer (83% down, 45% premium/overcharge)

ETC/Eth Classic (87% down, 40% discount).  This is interesting (mining/not security), other than the fact that ETC moons for 1 day every cycle and if you miss it it's back down 80% the next day.

LTC Litecoin - (80% down/7% premium) didn't make new ATH 2021, not much market interest or hype.

The other alts are all trading at multiples of valuation.

I'm considering 10% BTC / 10% ETH / 40% to 50% Defi trust  and splitting the rest among the alts above maybe.   What would you go with for a 80% certainty of max gains?  I hold out that BTC could do an 8x from 30k if there were a pullback.  I don't know if all the ETF's will take off that fast though, it could take another cycle for institutions to get comfortable."

I need a quick reminder however.""** Sure thing John : 

Decentralized derivatives are advanced financial tools built for digital assets. Traditionally, these are widely used on centralized platforms like Binance Futures.

However, the rise of decentralized derivatives platforms now allows traders to engage in trustless trading of crypto derivatives. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""What was the meaning of decentralized perpetuals?""** Here is a friendlt reminder : 

Decentralized perpetuals are a widely used type of cryptocurrency derivative. They allow users to take leveraged positions on a futures contract that doesn't have an expiry date. In the past, you could only do this on centralized exchanges, but now, decentralized platforms like Perpetual Protocol and dYdX have made it possible for the broader DeFi (Decentralized Finance) community to access leveraged trading while maintaining control of their funds. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Ok, what is up with Perpetual Protocol?""** Here is your answer John : 

Perpetual Protocol is like a platform for trading special types of cryptocurrency contracts that never expire. These contracts allow users to bet on the price of cryptocurrencies going up or down, with the option to use leverage (borrowed money) to amplify their bets.

Here's how it works: Instead of storing the actual cryptocurrencies, Perpetual Protocol uses a virtual system called vAMM, which is similar to other systems like Uniswap. This vAMM doesn't hold any real assets. It uses USDC (a stable cryptocurrency) as collateral to let users take leveraged positions. The total amount of money in this collateral vault determines how much traders can profit.

To make trading faster and reduce transaction costs, Perpetual Protocol uses the xDai chain. This ensures high liquidity (lots of available assets) and low price slippage (the difference between the expected and actual price).

But there are risks involved, like funding rates and liquidation ratios. Funding rates are like fees that traders pay or receive hourly, and liquidation ratios are a safety measure. If a trader's position falls below this safety level, it can be taken over by keeper bots, which earn a fee for doing so.

Perpetual Protocol has its own cryptocurrency called PERP. It's mainly used for voting on platform changes, and holders can also stake it for more PERP and a share of transaction fees in USDC. However, stakers need to commit to a fixed period called an epoch, which lasts seven days. They can't withdraw their funds until the end of the epoch, but they can claim transaction fees right away. PERP rewards, though, are locked for up to 6 months. Stakers don't have to worry about something called impermanent loss, but the PERP token's price can still be volatile.

As of April 2021, you can use Perpetual Protocol for trading on the Ethereum and xDai mainnets.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

""And the other one called dYdX?"" Here is an explanation : 

dYdX is like a decentralized exchange that offers various crypto services like lending, borrowing, regular trading, and more. It's different from traditional exchanges because it operates on the blockchain.

You can do things like lend your crypto to others and earn interest or use your crypto as collateral to borrow more. But what sets dYdX apart is that you can also trade with borrowed money, which is called margin trading. For example, you can use 5 times the amount of your own crypto to make a trade. They support Ethereum (ETH), USD Coin (USDC), and DAI for regular trading.

They also have something called perpetual swaps, which are like contracts where you bet on the future price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Aave, and LINK. You can use up to 10 times the amount of your crypto to make these bets.

When you lend your crypto on dYdX, you start earning interest immediately, and the interest keeps adding up with every transaction. The interest rates can change based on how much people are using the platform. If more people are borrowing, the rates go up.

For borrowers, you need to put up at least 125% of the value of what you're borrowing as collateral, and you have to keep it above 115% to avoid getting liquidated (basically losing your collateral).

dYdX also offers different types of trading orders like market, limit, and stop orders, similar to regular exchanges. Trading fees are charged when you take certain actions, and they can be either 0.3% or variable gas costs, whichever is higher.

They have this thing called perpetual markets, where all the contracts use USDC as collateral. But each contract has its own rules and requirements.

In early 2021, dYdX teamed up with Starkware to make transactions faster and cheaper using a Layer-2 technology called StarkEx. It uses something called zero-knowledge rollups and settles transactions on the Ethereum network. This makes it more efficient.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Some other platforms that you might want to consider?""** Sure, here are some notable mentions :

* **Futureswap**: It's like a decentralized exchange where you can bet on the future prices of cryptocurrencies. You can use up to 10 times your own crypto to make these bets.
* **MCDEX**: This is a decentralized exchange too, but it uses something called automated market makers for perpetual swaps. Anyone can create a market here as long as there's a price feed for the cryptocurrency you're trading and some ERC-20 tokens to use as collateral.
* **Injective Protocol**: This one operates on a special network called Injective Chain. It supports a fully decentralized order book, which is like a list of all the trades happening, and it can connect to Ethereum using a special token bridge. As of April 2021, it's still in test mode, not fully launched yet.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Decentralized options?""** Yes, here is what they are :

Decentralized options are a bit like a bet you make in the crypto world. You can use them to protect your investments from losing value or to try and make even more money without risking too much. Traditional finance has used options for a long time, and now, in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), we have protocols that let you do the same thing.

Before, people traded options on centralized exchanges like Deribit. But now, there's a growing interest in having decentralized options protocols. In this section, we'll explore two of the top ones: Hegic and Opyn.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Now I remember that we talked about Ophyn. What's up with Hegic though?""** Glad that you are curious John :

Hegic is like a digital platform where you can buy and sell options for cryptocurrencies like ETH and WBTC. Options are like contracts that let you bet on whether the price of a cryptocurrency will go up (call option) or down (put option) by a certain date. You can even customize these options by choosing things like the price at which you'll buy or sell and when the contract expires.

When you use Hegic, it calculates the prices for these options, and there's a small fee when you buy them. These options can't be traded like regular cryptocurrencies, but you can use them whenever you want because there's always enough money in the contract.

Hegic works by having people put their cryptocurrency into a pool, and this pool is used as collateral for all the options. There are separate pools for ETH and WBTC. If you put your cryptocurrency into the pool, you get tokens called Write tokens, which represent your share of the premiums paid by users to buy options. These Write tokens can be staked to earn rewards, and there's even a way to earn more valuable tokens called rHEGIC.

If you have a lot of HEGIC tokens, you can become a Hegic Staking Lot owner and get a share of the fees collected by the platform. If you don't have that many tokens, you can still delegate some of your tokens to earn rewards.

Hegic is a popular platform with lots of cryptocurrency locked in it, and it handles a significant amount of trading every day. So, it's one of the top places for decentralized options trading.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""I would like to receive a reminder for Ophyn.""** Anytime friend : 

Opyn is like a digital platform where you can create and trade options for cryptocurrencies. These options are like contracts that give you the right to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at a specific price and time. What's unique about Opyn is that it makes sure there's always enough cryptocurrency to back up these options, so they can always be used.

The first version of Opyn, called Opyn V1, allows you to create these special option tokens called oTokens. You do this by putting 100% of the cryptocurrency you want to use as collateral. These options can be made for cryptocurrencies like ETH, WBTC, UNI, and SNX, but they have fixed terms like a set expiration date and a specific buying or selling price. You can use oTokens to buy or sell the cryptocurrency they're linked to, or you can trade them on Uniswap. Opyn V1 doesn't charge extra fees for transactions or settlements.

Opyn V2, the newer version, has more features like auto-exercise, which means options can be automatically used if they make sense to do so. It also has something called flash minting, which is a bit like flash loans on Aave. The latest version, Opyn V3, offers options in a way similar to traditional options markets like Deribit, but for Wrapped Ether (WETH) with specific prices and timeframes.

So, Opyn is a platform where you can trade options for cryptocurrencies, and it has evolved to offer more features and flexibility over time.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""What are the differences between them?""** Here is your answer :

Hegic and Opyn, two options platforms, have some similarities but also important differences.

Both platforms require the people creating options (called options writers) to have enough cryptocurrency to cover the options they create. This ensures that if someone wants to use one of these options, there's enough cryptocurrency backing it.

However, they have different ways of handling the money put up by options writers and support different cryptocurrencies. Hegic pools together the funds from options writers for each cryptocurrency separately. In contrast, Opyn locks up 100% of the cryptocurrency for each option created.

Both Hegic and Opyn like American-style options because they are more flexible for the fast-paced DeFi world. These options allow you to use them at any time before they expire. On the other hand, centralized exchanges like Deribit prefer European-style options, which can only be used at their expiration date. In Opyn V2, there are fewer options with shorter timeframes, which suggests that there isn't as much demand for options with strict time limits in the cryptocurrency market, where prices change rapidly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""I quess you have another list of notable mentions for this category.""** You are right : 

* **FinNexus**: FinNexus allows users to create options for almost any asset, as long as there's a reliable source of price information. They use a system called Multi-Asset Single Pool (MASP) that lets you have positions in different assets while using a single type of asset as collateral.
* **Auctus**: Auctus is a DeFi platform that lets you do ""flash exercises"" where you don't need to actually own the tokens used in the options to exercise them. They also offer principal-protected yield farming through Auctus Vaults and have a section for OTC (over-the-counter) options trading.
* **Premia**: Premia is like a marketplace where you can buy and sell options. They make it more efficient by letting you mint, transfer, and exercise multiple types of options with fewer transactions, saving you time and gas fees.
* **Antimatter**: Antimatter wants to be like the Uniswap of options by providing an exchange for perpetual options. You can get exposure to either long or short positions by buying these Polarized option tokens, and you don't have to worry about options expiring.
* **Siren Protocol**: With Siren Protocol, you can choose to be an options writer or buyer by purchasing either bTokens or wTokens from the SirenSwap Automated Market Maker. bTokens let you exercise options, while wTokens represent the writer's side and can be used to withdraw collateral or receive payment when options are exercised.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Now we are heading for Synthetic Assets. Interesting. I still have some memories for when we scrathed the surface on this topic.""** It means a lot that you can remember those details John :

Synthetic assets are essentially like stand-ins for real assets. They mimic the value or behavior of something else. Instead of owning the actual asset, you can have synthetic assets that follow the same value changes.

For example, you can have synthetic assets that represent real-world stocks, Ethereum gas prices, or data from websites like CoinGecko. When you trade these synthetic assets, it's like trading the real things, but you don't need to own the real assets.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Synthetix? I remember this name!""** Very good John. Let's recap : 

Synthetix is like a special platform where you can make and trade something called ""Synths."" These Synths act like copies of real assets, but you don't need to actually own those assets.

There are two types of Synths: Regular Synths (like sDEFi) and Inverse Synths (like iDEFI), although not all Synths have an inverse version. These Synths can represent different things like cryptocurrencies, regular money, goods, stock market indexes, and company stocks. Synthetix uses a tool called Chainlink to keep track of the prices of these assets.

To make Synths, people need to put some of their own cryptocurrency, called Synthetix Network Token (SNX), as collateral. Since the value of SNX can go up or down a lot, you have to put in a lot more SNX than the value of the Synths you're making to be safe.

If your collateral gets too low, you might have to add more or get rid of some Synths to keep it safe. Right now, you can only make one type of Synth, called sUSD.

You can trade these Synths on the Synthetix Exchange. It's not like other regular exchanges with buyers and sellers. Instead, you trade with a smart computer program that always has enough of these Synths to trade. This makes it good for big trades without messing up the prices too much.

If you use Synthetix, you might get some rewards, like fees from trading, and extra SNX if you keep your collateral safe. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""UMA? The name gives me Adidas vibes, not gonna lie.""** That is pretty strange comparison, but ok :

UMA, short for Universal Market Access, is a special system on the Ethereum network that lets people create and enforce artificial assets. These artificial assets don't need to rely on real-world prices like some other systems. Instead, they depend on having enough collateral, which is like a security deposit, to back them up.

UMA has something called the Data Verification Mechanism (DVM), which helps make sure everything is fair. This DVM helps settle disputes about liquidation and contract settlements by getting input from UMA token holders. These token holders vote on what they think is the right value for an asset at a specific time.

Now, let's talk about the important players in the UMA system:

1. **Token Sponsors:** These are people who put up collateral to create artificial tokens. They need to make sure they have enough collateral to avoid losing it.
2. **Liquidators:** They watch over things and make sure positions have the right collateral. If something seems wrong, they can dispute it, but there's a delay to check before it's final.
3. **Disputers:** These folks also keep an eye on things and can dispute if they think there's a problem. If they're right, they get rewards.
4. **DVM:** The DVM helps settle disputes by proposing a fair value for an asset based on votes from token holders.
5. **Token Holders:** UMA token holders vote on asset values to help the DVM figure things out. They use information from outside the blockchain to make their decisions.

If everyone does their job right, things work smoothly. But if someone messes up or tries to cheat, the system has ways to punish them and make sure it's fair. People have used UMA to create different products, like tokens that become worth a certain amount over time and tokens to bet on Ethereum gas prices. They've even made options for popular DeFi tokens like Sushi and Balancer.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""And what separates those 2 platforms?""** Here is the answer : 

Both Synthetix and UMA offer synthetic assets that require users to provide collateral to create them. However, they have some differences:

**Synthetix** relies on an on-chain price feed to determine the value of its synthetic assets and collateralization ratio. It's more focused on options and supports a wide variety of synthetic assets, with over 50 available.

**UMA** takes a different approach by incentivizing participants to act fairly in the system. It has a more flexible collateralization requirement based on a global ratio, making it potentially more capital-efficient. However, it doesn't support as many different synthetic assets.

Synthetix has also built a strong ecosystem around its synthetic assets, with platforms like dHEDGE and Curve Finance using them for various purposes. dHEDGE allows users to invest in portfolios that include synthetic assets, while Curve Finance uses Synthetix as a bridge for asset swaps.

In terms of liquidity and trading volume, Synthetix currently has an advantage, with more trading activity and established platforms for synthetic asset trading. UMA's trading volumes are lower, but the future adoption of synthetic assets by retail and institutional users is still uncertain and could change the landscape.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Stop teasing me and tell me the other options.""** Alrighty Johny : 

**Mirror Protocol**: This protocol operates on both Ethereum and Terra blockchains and creates synthetic assets called mAssets. These mAssets imitate the prices of real-world assets like stocks and indices. For example, you can find assets like mAMZN (mirroring Amazon's stock) and mQQQ (mirroring the Nasdaq 100 index).

**DEUS Finance**: DEUS Finance is a DeFi protocol that allows users to access data from oracles and turn them into tradeable assets known as dAssets. These dAssets are designed to have a 1:1 peg with their real-life counterparts, and this peg is maintained using data from price oracles. Essentially, you can trade assets in the crypto world that represent real-world assets.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""And what the risks that I am exposing myself to if I choose to operate on the platforms that we have discussed?""** I am glad that you are being cautious John : 

When you're involved with decentralized derivatives platforms, it's crucial to understand that trading with leverage and using derivatives can be very risky. To stay safe in this part of decentralized finance (DeFi), you should maintain a good collateral ratio and always be aware of the liquidation price for your positions.

Synthetic assets, which are central to these platforms, rely heavily on oracles for price information. If these oracles provide incorrect data, it can lead to undesirable outcomes. Also, since synthetic assets are primarily created by putting up collateral, there might not always be enough liquidity for these assets, causing their prices to differ significantly from real-world assets.

For options trading, make sure you can exercise your profitable positions promptly, as some platforms don't offer automatic exercise features. As more and more people participate, keep an eye on significant option expiration periods, as they can bring increased volatility to the market.

&#x200B;

Helping the average John guy understand the Defi space : Decentralized fund management and TokenSets,CryptoCurrency,16o8a8f,2023-09-21 02:17:50,2,0.55,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/16o8a8f/helping_the_average_john_guy_understand_the_defi/,Natural_NoChemical,DISCUSSION,"**John is now curious how he should take care of the money that he got from being such a successful crypto investor. I got you John. I present to you the DECENTRALIZED FUND MANAGEMENT :** This is like taking care of your money, but without a traditional manager. Instead, smart computer programs handle your investments. These programs follow specific rules you set, so you can pick the strategy that fits your goals and saves on fees. Token Sets are an example of how this works in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""And what are those tokens? Token sets?""** It's Token sets John. Here is your answer : 

TokenSets is a platform where you can get Strategy Enabled Tokens (SET). These special tokens come with built-in plans for managing your crypto investments. They do the work for you, so you don't have to constantly watch the crypto market or make emotional decisions. Each SET is like a basket of different cryptocurrencies that automatically adjusts based on your chosen strategy. It's like having a token that follows a specific crypto trading plan. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""What kind of Sets are there?""** Only 2 main types John :

In the past, there used to be Social and Robo Sets, but they were phased out in early 2021. Now, there are two main types of Sets: Index Sets and Yield Farming Sets. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Could you describe in simple terms both of those?""** Sure thing. Here is an explanation :

Index Sets are like bundles of assets that allow users to easily own a variety of cryptocurrencies with just one token, saving on transaction fees. One popular Index Set is the DeFiPulse Index (DPI), which tracks the performance of various DeFi tokens based on their market value.

As of April 2021, DPI includes 14 DeFi assets:

1. Uniswap (UNI)
2. Aave (AAVE)
3. Synthetix Network Token (SNX)
4. Sushiswap (SUSHI)
5. Maker (MKR)
6. Compound (COMP)
7. Yearn.Finance (YFI)
8. REN (REN)
9. Loopring (LRC)
10. Balancer (BAL)
11. Kyber Network (KNC)
12. Harvest Finance (FARM)
13. Cream Finance (CREAM)
14. Meta (MTA)

By owning DPI, you essentially have a piece of all these different cryptocurrencies in one convenient token.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""And what about Yield farming sets?""** You haven't let me finish John. I was gonna describe those next:

Yield Farming Sets make it easier to earn rewards in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) without the hassle of many small transactions. These Sets use smart strategies to automatically claim rewards, convert them into preferred assets, and reinvest them. It's like DeFi's way of compounding interest, saving you time and gas fees. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Ok man,but how do Sets exactly help me?""** They do help you John, trust me bro : 

Sets are like digital tokens that represent different trading strategies. If you want to try out specific strategies, like buying a mix of different assets, Sets make it simple. However, remember that past success doesn't guarantee future gains in the volatile crypto market. Do your research and choose a strategy that makes sense for you.

One popular type of Set is the DeFi Pulse Index Set, which follows a strategy based on the market value of its assets. It has shown significant growth since its creation. While it might not beat individual assets, it often outperforms most of them. If you don't have a unique strategy, using Index Sets for diversified exposure can be a smart choice.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Maybe I will get into this in the future. Got any directions?""** Yep. Here is my personal step-by-step guide : 

**Step 1 :**

* Go to [**https://www.tokensets.com/**](https://www.tokensets.com/)
* Click ""Sign In"" in the top right corner.
* Choose to sign in with your Metamask wallet or any other wallet you prefer.

**Step 2 :**

* You'll be taken to a new page.
* A pop-up may ask for your email address, but it's optional, so you can skip it if you want.

**Step 3 :**

* Eventually, you'll reach the Explore page.
* Here, you'll find a list of Sets available.
* Index Sets usually have ""Index"" in their names, and Farm Index Sets have ""Farm"" in their names.
* For instance, you might see ""DeFi Pulse Index"" or ""ETH-USD Yield Farm.""

**Step 4 :**

* Let's see how to buy one of these Sets. We'll use ""DeFi Pulse Index"" as an example.
* Click on ""DeFi Pulse"" from the Explore page.
* Then, click ""Buy.""
* A pop-up window will appear.
* You can choose to buy it using one of the four supported currencies.
* Let's say you want to buy $80 worth of ""DeFi Pulse Index"" (DPI).
* Click ""Submit.""

**Step 5 :**

* You'll need to approve TokenSets to spend your USDC (a stablecoin).
* Click ""Confirm"" in your Metamask wallet.

**Step 6 :**

* Once your approval is confirmed, you can submit your purchase.
* Another transaction approval is needed.
* Click ""Confirm"" in your Metamask wallet.
* That's it! You're done Johny. See, it wasn't that hard!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***TL;DR :***

* **Decentralized Fund Management:** It's like automated crypto investing without a traditional manager. TokenSets is an example.
* **Types of Sets:** Two main types - Index Sets bundle crypto assets, and Yield Farming Sets help you earn rewards in DeFi.
* **How Sets Help:** They simplify trading strategies. Do your research, choose one, and invest.
* **Getting Started:** Visit tokensets.com, choose a Set, specify your investment, and confirm it. Ez!

"Helping the average John guy understand the Defi space : Decentralized Derivatives, Synthetix and Opyn",CryptoCurrency,16nn22i,2023-09-20 10:43:02,10,0.78,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/16nn22i/helping_the_average_john_guy_understand_the_defi/,Natural_NoChemical,DISCUSSION,"**After John got the balls to use a DEX, now he is adventuring on a very complicated path:** ***Decentralized Derivatives.*** **We must help John understand what are those and how do you use them. Please John, it might be(and it is) complicated, but I and others will try my best to make a summary using the simplest terms ever. As an explanation of what they are:**

John, imagine a contract that gets its value from something else, like stocks, gold, or even interest rates. These contracts are called derivatives. People use them for different reasons: to protect themselves from price changes, to bet on where prices will go, or to increase their investments. But they're risky and need a ***good understanding***.

In the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), there are derivative apps worth about $5.82 billion, which is 8.2% of the DeFi world. However, they face challenges because of high fees on Ethereum, so they're not as big as lending apps, which are worth $10.68 billion. **(data from 2021)**

Two of the major DeFi derivative apps are **Synthetix** and **Opyn**.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Ok,so those two are the major ones. I would like to know more about Synthetix.""** Sure thing John, we will go slowand steady so at the end of this chat, you will be an expert on this topic. Here is the answer that I have for you:

Synthetix is like a system on Ethereum that creates fake assets called Synths. These Synths can be traded on a platform called Synthetix.Exchange. It's all about making and trading these fake assets. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""And what are those \*fake assets\* ?""** The answer might surprise you because only the name makes them to seem complicated : 

Synthetic assets, or Synths, are like special tokens that follow the value of real assets without you needing to own the actual assets. There are two types: Normal Synths, which go up when the real assets go up, and Inverse Synths, which go up when the real assets go down.

For example, Synthetic Gold (sXAU) tracks the price of gold, and Inverse Bitcoin (iBTC) goes up when Bitcoin goes down and vice versa. Inverse Synths have limits, so they can only go up or down by a certain amount. When they reach these limits, their prices are locked, and you can exchange them at those fixed values on Synthetix.Exchange. Then they start over with new limits. It's like a way to bet on the price of assets without owning them directly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Why Synthetic Assets?""** Why are you not paying attention John : 

Synthetic assets, or Synths, are handy because they let traders benefit from an asset's price movements without owning it. For example, Synthetic Gold (sXAU) lets you profit from gold's price changes without dealing with traditional gold brokers, paperwork, or middlemen.

Synths also have a cool feature: you can easily trade one Synth for another. So, if you have Synthetic Gold, you can quickly exchange it for Synthetic Japanese Yen, Synthetic Silver, or even Synthetic Bitcoin on Synthetix.Exchange. It's like having access to all kinds of real-world assets using your Ethereum wallet.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""And how are those created exactly?""** Here is your answer John : 

Creating Synths is kind of like making DAI on Maker ([https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/16lyksk/helping\_the\_average\_john\_guy\_understand\_the\_defi/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/16lyksk/helping_the_average_john_guy_understand_the_defi/) here is the link if you don't remember), but with a twist. To start, you need to lock up Synthetix Network Tokens (SNX) as collateral. SNX is a bit less stable than Ethereum (ETH), so you need a bunch of it to back your Synths. We're talking at least 500% of the Synths' value as collateral, which is a lot more than the 150% needed on Maker.

For example, if you want to make $100 worth of Synthetic USD (sUSD), you'll need at least $500 worth of SNX as backup.

Making Synths can get tricky because it involves taking on some debt. The debt levels change depending on how much Synths are floating around in the system. If, for example, everyone's using synthetic Ethereum (sETH), and the price of real Ethereum doubles, the debt (including yours) doubles too.

Once you've made your Synths, you can trade them on Synthetix.Exchange or other decentralized exchanges like Uniswap. If you're not into making Synths and don't want to deal with debt, you can simply buy them from a decentralized exchange.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Are there many assets that are supported?""** Yes, quite a lot actually John : 

1. **Cryptocurrencies:** These are like digital currencies, and Synths support a bunch of them, like Ethereum, Bitcoin, Cardano, and many more.
2. **Commodities:** Synths also track real-world stuff like Gold, Silver, and Oil. So, you can trade Synths representing these commodities without owning the actual items.
3. **Fiat Currencies:** Synths mimic traditional money, such as USD (US Dollars), AUD (Australian Dollars), CHF (Swiss Francs), JPY (Japanese Yen), EUR (Euros), and GBP (British Pounds).
4. **Indexes:** You can also find Synths that follow indexes, which are like collections of stocks or assets. There's one for Centralized Exchanges, another for the FTSE 100 Index, one for the Nikkei 225 Index, and even one for the DeFi Index.
5. **Stocks:** Synths don't stop there; they also mirror individual stocks like Tesla (TSLA). So, you can trade a Synth that's linked to Tesla's stock price.

These Synths give you a way to invest in or trade these different assets without having to own them physically. It's like having a piece of various financial pies, all in one place.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Just saw this name :  Index Synths. What does it mean?""** Don't get scared John : 

Index Synths on Synthetix are like baskets of different tokens bundled together to represent a specific group of assets. As of April 2021, there are four main Index Synths: sCEX, sDEFI, sFTSE, and sNIKKEI.

**sCEX:** This Index Synth is like a mix of tokens from various centralized exchanges (CEXs). It tries to match the total value of tokens on these exchanges. It includes tokens like Binance Coin, Crypto.com, and others. There's also an ""inverse"" version called iCEX.

**sDEFI:** As the name suggests, this Index Synth gives you exposure to a bunch of tokens from the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) world. It includes tokens like Aave ([https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/16mvlcv/helping\_the\_average\_john\_guy\_understand\_the\_defi/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/16mvlcv/helping_the_average_john_guy_understand_the_defi/) Aave guide if needed) , Uniswap ([https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/16ncsjj/helping\_the\_average\_john\_guy\_understand\_the\_defi/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/16ncsjj/helping_the_average_john_guy_understand_the_defi/) Uniswap guide if needed) , Maker, and several others. Just like sCEX, it has an ""inverse"" counterpart called iDEFI.

**sFTSE and sNIKKEI:** These Index Synths follow the performance of specific stock market indexes. sFTSE tracks the FTSE 100 Index, which represents the top 100 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. sNIKKEI follows the Nikkei 225 Index, which includes major companies from the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

By trading these Index Synths, you can get exposure to a whole group of assets without having to buy each one separately. It's like getting a piece of the action in different parts of the financial world with a single Synth.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""And this Exchange, it's the same as the others?""** No, listen carefully : 

Synthetix Exchange is a special kind of exchange where you can trade SNX and Synths. Unlike regular exchanges, it doesn't have order books or pools of money like Uniswap. Instead, it uses a smart contract to make sure there's always enough money for trading, which helps prevent problems like price changes when you make big trades.

Here's what's cool about it: When you trade on Synthetix Exchange, you're not actually buying the real assets; you're getting a contract that follows the value of those assets. This means you can make really big trades without causing the contract's price to change a lot. In a normal exchange, a huge trade could mess up the prices, but not here.

So, it's a different way to trade, and it's designed to be efficient and prevent problems like price changes or not having enough money to trade.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""If I want to start using it one day, can you give mesome instructions?""** Sure thing John. Just follow those steps:

**Step 1:** First, you need SNX tokens as collateral. If you don't have them, you can get them on exchanges. In this example, I will swap ETH for SNX on Uniswap.

1. Go to Uniswap ([**https://uniswap.exchange/swap**](https://uniswap.exchange/swap)).
2. Connect your wallet.
3. Enter the amount of ETH you want to swap for SNX.

**Step 2:** Now, you're ready to mint your Synth. Go to [**https://staking.synthetix.io/**](https://staking.synthetix.io/).

1. Connect your wallet.
2. Click ""MINT sUSD.""

**Step 3:** Choose ""MINT MAX"" or ""MINT CUSTOM."" For this example, I will choose ""MINT MAX.""

**Step 4:** The amount you can mint depends on the collateral ratio of SNX to the Synth. In April 2021, the ratio is 500%. So, if you have $275.55 worth of SNX, you can mint about 55.06 sUSD.

**Step 5:** A Metamask pop-up will appear. Click 'Confirm.' The website will show that the minting is in progress while you wait for the transaction to complete.

**Step 6:** After confirmation, you'll see sUSD in your wallet balance. That's it John.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Ok, that's enough Defi for today friend. I wi-""** STOP RIGHT THERE. I have not finished yet. Please take a seat John. We haven't discussed about Opyn.

**""Chill, ok. Tell me about it.""** That's the spirit Johny : 

Opyn is like a financial safety net for your assets and smart contracts. It offers protection against price swings for assets like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and others. It also acts as insurance for smart contracts, safeguarding you from various risks.

Opyn uses financial tools called options to provide this protection. It's not just about smart contract failures; Opyn covers other dangers too, like financial and admin risks. Essentially, it helps you keep your assets safe and secure in the unpredictable world of cryptocurrency.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""What are those options?""** Glad that you asked John : 

Options are like special agreements in the world of finance. There are two main types: Call and Put options.

* A **Call option** gives you the right, but not the obligation, to buy something (like a cryptocurrency) at a set price within a specific time frame.
* A **Put option** gives you the right, but not the obligation, to sell something (like a cryptocurrency) at a set price within a specific time frame.

For every person who wants to use these options, there has to be someone willing to make the deal. The person who wants the option pays a fee to the person who's willing to provide it.

Think of Call options like deciding when to eat your Halloween candy. You can either eat it right away (like an American option) or only on Halloween night (like a European option). The choice depends on the type of option.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""How does Opyn work?""** Here is your answer man : 

Opyn works like insurance for cryptocurrency traders. It helps protect against the risk of prices suddenly dropping, security issues with smart contracts, governance problems, or unexpected market events.

For example, imagine you're holding Ethereum (ETH), and you're worried its price might crash. With Opyn, you can buy something called ""oTokens."" These oTokens act like a safety net. If Ethereum's price drops below a certain level (the ""strike price""), you can use your oTokens to get back some of your money in a stable cryptocurrency like USDC.

Let's say you bought an oToken when Ethereum was worth $2,400. If Ethereum's price later falls to $2,000, you can use your oToken to get $400 back. This helps protect you from losing too much money if the price goes down a lot.

Yes, there's a fee to buy these oTokens, but they can save you a lot of money in tough situations. And the best part is, you don't need a central authority to make this work – it's all done in a decentralized way.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Ok, you got my attention. Are those option free?""** Glad to hear that John and no, they are not free :

The cost of options and insurance on Opyn can vary. It depends on different factors like which cryptocurrency you're getting insurance for, how long you want the insurance to last, and how much coverage you want.

In Opyn version 1, you can trade these insurance tokens (called ""oTokens"") on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap. But in version 2, it's more like a marketplace where people set their prices when buying and selling these options.

The price you see for these options typically reflects the actual value of the protection they offer. For example, if you're buying an option to protect against a cryptocurrency dropping from $2,000 to $1,000, you'd expect the option to be worth at least $1,000 because that's the potential loss it's covering. However, there are other factors like how much time is left before the option expires and any significant changes in the cryptocurrency's value that can affect the price.

One interesting thing is that the price of these oTokens can change based on what people think. If a lot of people believe the insurance is a good deal and start buying these oTokens, the price can go up. It's like a signal that tells you if people think the insurance is worth it or not. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Why would anyone sell protection on Opyn?""** Great question. Here is the answer : 

People might choose to sell insurance or protection on Opyn because it allows them to earn money on their cryptocurrencies like ETH, YFI, UNI, WBTC, or DPI.

Here's how it works:

1. **Provide Collateral:** To become an insurance provider on Opyn, you start by putting up some of your cryptocurrencies as collateral in Opyn's smart contract. Depending on the type of insurance you're offering, there are different requirements for how much collateral you need. For example, if you're providing insurance for Compound ([https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/16ml6mz/helping\_the\_average\_john\_guy\_understand\_the\_defi/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/16ml6mz/helping_the_average_john_guy_understand_the_defi/) Compound guide if needed) deposits, you need to have collateral equal to 140% of the value you're insuring. For other types of options, 100% collateral is needed.
2. **Mint oTokens:** Once you've provided collateral, you can create what are called ""oTokens."" These are like the insurance contracts you're offering to others.
3. **Earn Premiums:** There are two main ways you can make money as an insurance provider:  
a. **Liquidity Provider on Uniswap:** If you decide to be a Liquidity Provider on Uniswap, you can earn transaction fees from people who are buying and selling insurance on the Opyn platform through Uniswap. Being a Liquidity Provider can offer you a chance to earn a variable but potentially significant return. You can also remove your funds from Uniswap at any time.  
b. **Selling oTokens on Uniswap:** You can also sell the oTokens you've created on Uniswap. To figure out how much you can earn, you can check Opyn's 'sell protection' section. The returns you get depend on the type of insurance you're providing. For example, if you're selling insurance on Compound deposits, your returns are based on the difference between the yield with insurance and the yield without insurance. The returns for other assets can be found in Opyn's 'Earn Premiums' and 'Earn (Annualized ROI)' columns.

While the premiums you can earn as an insurance provider are attractive, there are risks involved. When you sell insurance, you're taking on the risk that certain adverse events won't happen, like hacks or financial issues with the assets you're insuring. You also need to maintain the required collateral levels to avoid liquidation. So, it can be profitable, but it's not without its challenges and potential downsides.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Is it safe to use?""** Yes Johny. In my opinion, it should be and here is why : 

Opyn is designed with safety measures:

1. **Publicly Verifiable:** Opyn's smart contract is open for anyone to inspect and verify. This means you can check the code to ensure it operates as intended.
2. **Audited by Experts:** The smart contract used by Opyn has undergone a thorough audit by OpenZeppelin, a respected firm that specializes in auditing smart contracts.
3. **Non-Custodial and Trustless:** Opyn is built to be non-custodial, meaning it doesn't hold or control your assets. It's also trustless, which means you don't need to rely on any central authority. Instead, the system operates based on predefined rules and incentives.

These features are designed to enhance the safety and transparency of the Opyn platform. However, it's important to note that like any financial system, there are inherent risks associated with using Opyn John.

**""Can you tell me more about Opyn Version 2?""** Sure thing bud : 

Opyn Version 2, also known as the Gamma Protocol, was launched on December 30, 2020, as an upgrade from Version 1 (Convexity Protocol). Here are the key changes and new features in Version 2:

1. **European Cash-Settled Options:** In Version 2, Opyn introduced European options that are settled in cash, unlike the physically-settled American options in Version 1. European options can only be exercised on their expiration date.
2. **Margin Improvements:** Version 2 allows users to create Put Credit Spreads and Put Debit Spreads, which makes better use of their capital. Additionally, in-the-money options are automatically exercised when they expire, simplifying the process.
3. **Option Creation:** In Version 2, anyone can create new options if the underlying asset is whitelisted, providing more flexibility for users.
4. **Collateral Variety:** Users can now use yield-bearing assets like cTokens, aTokens, and yTokens as collateral for their options.
5. **Trading on 0x Exchange:** Options created in Version 2 are traded on the 0x Exchange. It's important to note that Version 1 is still operational alongside Version 2.

As of April 2021, Version 2 supports options on Wrapped Ether (WETH) only. These updates enhance the functionality and accessibility of the Opyn platform, making it more versatile for traders and investors.

**""I would like however both guides for both versions. Can you help me with that?""** I always help a fellow crypto brother John :

**Opyn Version 1:** 

**Step 1:** Go to https://v1.opyn.co/#/  , and click 'Buy Protection.' I will be insuring some Wrapped Ether (WETH).

**Step 2:** On the 'Buy Protection' page, find the list of assets Opyn offers options for. Scroll to the ETH Put Options and click 'Buy' on a Put option of your choice.

**Step 3:** Clicking 'Buy' provides more details. If the 'Continue Purchase' button is grayed out, you might need to wrap your ETH using a decentralized exchange (DEX). Once ready, click 'Continue Purchase.'

**Step 4:** A dialog box appears. Set the amount of WETH you want to cover and choose the currency for the charge. Double-check the details and click 'Confirm' to approve the transaction.

**Step 5:** After processing, Opyn will display the transaction, and you're now insured against an ETH price drop!

**Opyn Version 2:**

 **Step 1:** Visit https://opyn.co/#/  and click 'START TRADING.' I will insure some WETH.

**Step 2:** Choose the expiry date (e.g., 30-Apr-2021) and the strike price (e.g., $1,280). Click on the price.

**Step 3:** A new window with more details appears. Enter the amount of oTokens you'd like to purchase. Click the button to approve spending your USDC and pay the transaction fee.

**Step 4:** Click 'Buy oToken.' Now, you're insured against an ETH price drop! If the price of ETH falls below $1,280 on 30th April 2021, you can choose to exercise your oTokens.

These steps should help you navigate Opyn Version 1 and Version 2 to protect yourself against price drops in the cryptocurrency market.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***TL;DR :***

* Synthetix creates synthetic assets (Synths) that mimic real assets.
* You can profit from real asset price changes without owning them.
* To create Synths, you lock up SNX tokens.
* You can trade Synths covering various assets.
* Opyn offers crypto asset and smart contract insurance.
* It uses options for protection.
* You buy oTokens to safeguard against price drops.
* Safety measures are in place, and it's audited.
* For Opyn Version 1, select an asset, buy protection, and confirm.
* For Opyn Version 2, choose options, buy oTokens, and confirm.

DEFI: An Aussie's Definitive Ranking of the Top DeFi in 2023,CryptoCurrency,15xu9go,2023-08-22 00:03:02,8,0.78,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/15xu9go/defi_an_aussies_definitive_ranking_of_the_top/,teeceaustralia,DISCUSSION,"It's a crabbing bear market right, stacking and having patience is key right? Earning a little sum sum on the side helps too right?

Let's talk DeFi.

Below is some top DeFi cryptocurrencies in 2023, considering factors like adoption, technology, usability, and community support. Let me what you think and if you have some other options to add.

Yearn.finance is synonymous with yield optimization. Its automated strategies move funds between different DeFi protocols to maximize yield, making it a popular choice for users seeking passive income opportunities.

**8. SushiSwap (SUSHI)**

SushiSwap, a Uniswap fork, has grown into a multi-chain DEX ecosystem with features like yield farming, staking, and community governance. Its vibrant community and innovative initiatives continue to drive its adoption.

**9. Compound Chain (CCHAIN)**

Compound Chain has taken the Compound protocol to a multi-chain level, enabling cross-chain lending and borrowing. Its interoperability and expansion potential contribute to its position in this ranking.

**10. Bancor (BNT)**

Bancor's automated market maker protocol focuses on providing liquidity to a wide range of tokens. Its self-balancing pools and emphasis on single-token exposure make it a unique option for DeFi users.

**11. Balancer (BAL)**

Balancer's automated portfolio management platform enables users to create liquidity pools with multiple tokens and varying weights. Its flexible design appeals to traders seeking customized exposure.

**12. REN (REN)**

Ren's interoperability protocol allows users to bring assets from one blockchain to another, expanding DeFi's potential across different networks. Its innovative approach to cross-chain liquidity adds value to the ecosystem.

**13. Kyber Network (KNC)**

**16. PancakeSwap (CAKE)**

PancakeSwap, a prominent DeFi project on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), offers users a decentralized exchange (DEX) platform similar to Uniswap but with lower fees due to BSC's network characteristics. Its ability to provide liquidity, yield farming, and other DeFi services has made it a popular choice within the BSC ecosystem.

Remember, the DeFi space is a tad bit chaotic at times and certainly very dynamic, new projects are emerging regularly. This ranking is based on the information available to my stupid Australian brain up to this point in 2023 and will most likely change. DYOR and use this maybe as a guide, or not."
Der Synthetix Network Token (SNX): Revolutionäre Entwicklungen im Bereich der Kryptowährungen,u_LWCapM,15tje89,2023-08-17 06:22:59,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_LWCapM/comments/15tje89/der_synthetix_network_token_snx_revolutionäre/,LWCapM,,"Die Welt der Kryptowährungen ist ständig in Bewegung, und immer wieder tauchen neue Projekte auf, die das Potenzial haben, die Art und Weise, wie wir Finanzen betrachten, zu verändern. Eines dieser vielversprechenden Projekte ist der Synthetix Network Token (SNX). In diesem Artikel werden wir uns eingehend mit dem SNX-Token befassen, seine Funktionsweise verstehen und untersuchen, welchen Einfluss er auf die Kryptowelt haben könnte.

**Was ist der Synthetix Network Token (SNX)?**

Der Synthetix Network Token (SNX) ist das Herzstück des Synthetix-Ökosystems, einer Plattform, die es Benutzern ermöglicht, synthetische Assets, auch als ""Synths"" bezeichnet, zu erstellen, zu handeln und darauf zu wetten. Synths sind tokenisierte Versionen von realen Vermögenswerten wie Fiat-Währungen, Aktien, Rohstoffen und Kryptowährungen. Sie erlauben es den Nutzern, die Wertentwicklung dieser Vermögenswerte zu verfolgen, ohne sie tatsächlich besitzen zu müssen.

**Wie funktioniert der SNX-Token?**

Der SNX-Token ist das Rückgrat des Synthetix-Netzwerks, da er als Sicherheit für die Erstellung von Synths dient. Um Synths zu erzeugen, müssen Benutzer eine bestimmte Menge an SNX-Token als Sicherheit hinterlegen. Diese Sicherheit wird verwendet, um das Netzwerk vor potenziellen Verlusten abzusichern, die entstehen könnten, wenn der Wert eines synthetischen Assets stark schwankt. Als Belohnung für das Hinterlegen von SNX-Token und die Unterstützung des Netzwerks erhalten die Benutzer sogenannte ""Synthetix Rewards"".

**Die Vorteile des SNX-Tokens:**

1. **Diversifikation:** Mit Synths können Benutzer eine breite Palette von Vermögenswerten in ihrer Kryptowährungs-Portfolio aufnehmen, ohne sie tatsächlich besitzen zu müssen. Das ermöglicht eine höhere Diversifikation und verringert das Risiko von Verlusten in einem bestimmten Markt.
2. **Finanzielle Inklusion:** Der Zugang zu traditionellen Finanzmärkten ist oft eingeschränkt. Synthetix ermöglicht es Menschen aus aller Welt, auf verschiedene Vermögenswerte zuzugreifen, die normalerweise für sie nicht verfügbar wären.
3. **Dezentralisierung:** Synthetix basiert auf der Ethereum-Blockchain und trägt somit zur Dezentralisierung des Finanzsystems bei. Transaktionen werden in einem transparenten und unveränderlichen Ledger erfasst.
4. **Passive Einkommensquelle:** Durch das Hinterlegen von SNX-Token und die Beteiligung am Netzwerk können Benutzer passives Einkommen in Form von Synthetix Rewards generieren.

📷  


**Zukunftsaussichten für SNX:**

Der Synthetix Network Token hat das Potenzial, die Finanzlandschaft nachhaltig zu verändern. Mit der steigenden Nachfrage nach DeFi (dezentralisierte Finanzen) und synthetischen Vermögenswerten könnte SNX zu einem zentralen Akteur in diesem Bereich werden. Die kontinuierliche Entwicklung des Protokolls, die Integration neuer Synths und die Optimierung der Dezentralisierung könnten das Netzwerk noch attraktiver machen.

**Fazit:**

Der Synthetix Network Token (SNX) ist zweifellos ein bemerkenswertes Projekt in der Welt der Kryptowährungen. Seine Fähigkeit, synthetische Assets zu schaffen und zu handeln, bietet Nutzern eine Vielzahl von Möglichkeiten zur Diversifikation und Partizipation am Finanzmarkt. Während die Kryptowelt weiterhin wächst und sich entwickelt, bleibt abzuwarten, wie sich der SNX-Token und das Synthetix-Ökosystem in dieser sich verändernden Landschaft positionieren werden."
