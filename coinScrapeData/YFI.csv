These shifts were driven by evolving market narratives, trends, and hype cycles. Here’s an analysis of when each genre gained major inflows of capital:

>**1. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) - Initial Surge: Mid-2020**

* The DeFi boom began in summer 2020, often referred to as ""DeFi Summer.""
* Key drivers included platforms like Uniswap (UNI), Compound (COMP), and [Yearn.Finance](http://Yearn.Finance) (YFI), which introduced yield farming and liquidity mining.
* DeFi tokens dominated attention from mid-2020 to early 2021 as users chased high returns and DeFi total value locked (TVL) surged.

>

>**2. Gaming and Metaverse Coins - nitial Surge: Mid-2021**

* Gaming and metaverse tokens like Axie Infinity (AXS), The Sandbox (SAND), and Decentraland (MANA) gained traction during Q2–Q3 2021.
* Axie Infinity drove the narrative with its play-to-earn (P2E) model, which saw rapid adoption in emerging markets.
* The metaverse hype reached its peak in late 2021, fueled by Facebook’s rebranding to Meta in October 2021.

>

>**3. Meme Coin** \-  Initial Surge: Early 2021

* Meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) surged in popularity during Q1–Q2 2021.
* Elon Musk’s tweets and the broader retail investor craze (e.g., Reddit-driven pumps) contributed to the explosive growth of DOGE, which peaked in May 2021.
* SHIB followed in Q2–Q3 2021, fueled by its community-driven growth and listing on major exchanges.

>

>**4. Layer-1 Protocols**

* Initial Surge: Late 2020 to Early 2021
* Layer-1 tokens like Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and Binance Coin (BNB) saw significant inflows as Ethereum faced scalability issues.
* From late 2020 through Q3 2021, investors sought alternatives to Ethereum, driving the growth of competing blockchains.

>

>**5. NFT -  Initial Surge: Q1–Q2 2021**

* Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) exploded in early 2021, driven by projects like CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), and major auctions like Beeple’s $69M NFT sale in March 2021.
* The NFT craze aligned closely with the gaming/metaverse hype in Q3–Q4 2021, expanding into broader cultural and entertainment sectors.

>

* **6. Privacy Coins -  Initial Surge: Early to Mid-2021**
* Coins like Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) saw renewed interest in Q1 2021, as concerns about regulatory scrutiny and privacy grew during the bull run.
* This genre's surge was smaller compared to others but aligned with broader crypto adoption.

* **Genre                        Initial Major Inflows    Peak Interest Period**
* DeFi                          Mid-2020                     Late 2020 – Early 2021
* Gaming/Metaverse   Q2 2021                       Q3 – Q4 2021
* Meme Coins             Early 2021                    Q2 – Q3 2021
* Layer-1s                    Late 2020                    Q2 – Q4 2021
* NFTs                          Q1 2021                       Q2 – Q4 2021
* Privacy Coins            Early 2021                    Mid-2021

>Observations and Takeaways:

>Rotational Capital:

1.  Money rotated through genres as the market narratives shifted.
2.   Early adopters of each genre benefited the most as capital inflows surged.
3.   Gaming as a Late-Stage Winner: Gaming and metaverse coins often peaked later in the cycle, especially during the altcoin season after Bitcoin and Ethereum had their major runs
4.    Meme Coins Thrive on Hype: Meme coins tend to surge during periods of retail euphoria, often spurred by social media campaigns.
5.    DeFi Pioneered the Bull Run: DeFi projects laid the groundwork for mainstream crypto adoption in mid-2020, establishing foundational protocols.

Looking Forward to the Next Bull Run - If historical patterns repeat, gaming/metaverse tokens like Karrat could see their major inflows in the latter stages of the next bull run, likely around Q3–Q4 2025. Meme coins and NFTs might see earlier retail-driven pumps, while DeFi and Layer-1s could kickstart the cycle.

Riding the DeFi Waves: An Analysis of Trend Following Strategies in [yearn.finance](http://yearn.finance) (YFI)  
  
Abstract  
  
In the cosmos of decentralized finance (DeFi), yearn.finance's YFI token emerges as both a beacon of yield optimization and a volatile subject of speculative fervor. This abstract encapsulates an analytical voyage through the trends of YFI, employing a blend of technical analysis, sentiment dissection from the digital agoras of X posts, and an examination of macroeconomic indicators influencing DeFi markets. Herein, we explore how trend following strategies could be applied or have failed spectacularly in the DeFi odyssey of YFI. By charting the volatile price movements against the backdrop of real-time social sentiment and traditional financial indicators, this study aims to illuminate the efficacy of trend-based investment tactics within the new frontier of finance. Our methodology marries the old school chartist's toolkit with the new-age digital pulse, offering insights into whether one can truly surf the financial waves of YFI with traditional trend-following lifebuoys or if this new sea requires entirely novel navigational aids.

7. **Store Your YFI Safely**: After purchasing YFI, consider transferring it to a secure cryptocurrency wallet for long-term storage. Hardware wallets or reputable software wallets provide enhanced security compared to keeping your tokens on an exchange.

Additional Features: Apart from simplifying transactions, addrs allows for crypto receiving via Visa/MasterCard/Bank, depositing directly into your wallet without the need for a custodial account.

Easy Integration on Your Site: Embedding addrs on your site is a breeze. Just use our [embed.addrs.to](https://embed.addrs.to) embeds, and you're set. Here's a sample for quick integration:

`<iframe src=""https://embed.addrs.to/pr0/eth""/>`

Beyond Payments: Don't miss out on our latest feature - Payment Requests! Now, even without an addrs account, you can generate a payment request. Just pick a token, set the amount, and share the secure link that opens the payer's wallet pre-filled with all the details. It's the simplicity of Web2 for the Web3 world.

For Developers: addrs isn't just user-friendly; it's a developer's ally too. Integrate our simple payment request links into your websites or apps, offering your users a seamless crypto payment experience.

To give you a concrete example, imagine you're a graphic designer who wants to accept ETH for your work. With addrs, you simply create a payment profile and share your unique link with your client. They click, confirm the amount, and boom - ETH arrives in your wallet. No more dictating addresses over the phone or triple-checking for typos!

# QA

So is your tech layer dependent? Do you operate on layer 1, or is this a layer 2 service? Can the payments be between different layers or chains? u/coinsRus-2021  
We are not. Both.

Good concept, and informative post. Any relation with (or inspiration from) ENS?Am one of the first ENS users, own pay.eth/hey.eth/devs.eth. The problems that ENS still req u to put in the ENS, which becomes a prob as adoption inc. This:

* removes any address/ENS, just tap a link, wallet opens with address ready.
* its free, no fees
* network agnostic - not just ETH focused

u/Hsiang7  
How does the sending of such crypto work then for any wallet that isn't an web wallet integrted into your browser since you need authorization from your personal wallet to send funds, or is a web wallet such as Metamask needed to use the service?  
Is addrs compatible with all wallets?  
addrs is compatible with any BTC/ETH wallet that follows BIP20 for Bitcoin or EIP 67/681 for Ethereum, as well as most protocols, making it widely compatible with different wallets. If they use uri, its supported

u/ApprehensiveHumor237  
How does addrs gain revenue? Do you collect a fee for each processed transaction? If yes, how much?  
Its free I have other projects to gen way more than this could. [https://keychain.me/](https://keychain.me/)  
Theres a fee for the onramp sometimes, but its only for fiat payments.  
  
[Kindly-Wolf6919](https://www.reddit.com/user/Kindly-Wolf6919/)

Firstly, I think you're onto something great here. Secondly, will this project continue to be expanded? I'm not sure if I missed it but there doesn't seem to be a feature to send payments? Say, for example, if I wanted to send some cash to another addrs account it'd be nice if I was able to have something like an address book where I can save names and their respective addrs accounts for easy use. Also, does your platform offer additional layers of security such as 2FA etc?  
Its not a wallet, most wallets already have this, we also dont track payments so this would not be possible. Not atm."

Crypto Millionaires invest in these 10 cryptos right now,DailyLedger,1awae69,2024-02-21 07:02:06,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DailyLedger/comments/1awae69/crypto_millionaires_invest_in_these_10_cryptos/,Rebellion_Protocol,Investment,"1. Polkadot (DOT)
Let's kick off with Polkadot, the versatile multi-chain platform, and it's DOT token. With scalability being the buzzword in the DeFi world, Polkadot’s interoperability could be the lifesaver that many projects need. With parachains and cross-chain transfers, it has proven to be the Swiss army knife of blockchain technology. Plus, with its governance features, DOT is a token with both utility and prospects for growth.

2. Chainlink (LINK)
What’s behind Door Number 2? Oh, it’s Chainlink - the 'oracle' of the DeFi world. Well, maybe not an oracle, but the LINK network is piping off-chain data onto the blockchain and providing reliable information to smart contracts. It’s like a DeFi data waterboy. No bull run can ever take off without this speedster hitching the ride.

3. Cardano (ADA)
How could we leave out DeFi’s very own tortoise, Cardano? With its slow and steady academic approach, it has won many hearts in the cryptoverse. ADA, Cardano's native token, has proven to be one of the most sustainable cryptos in the market. It’s like the calm sea before the killer wave, and it might just be the right time to dive in.

4. Uniswap (UNI)
Imagine a crypto Starbucks; a platform where you can exchange any ERC20 token for another. That’s Uniswap for you. With its permissionless interface and decentralization, UNI is making strides in the DeFi world. As long as there are new ICOs on ETH network, Uniswap's gonna be serving cups of joe to the early birds.

5. Synthetix (SNX)
This one’s for those who love to invest in assets, real or synthetic. Synthetix is a DeFi protocol that allows users to mint and trade synthetic assets representing real-world commodities. The SNX token, therefore, is a gateway to the world of virtual commodities. Riding this wave could be more adventurous than you think.

6. Aave (AAVE)
You thought money markets were only for the traditional financiers, didn't you? Think again. As the backbone of DeFi loans, AAVE is your ticket into the fast-paced world of lending and borrowing without those annoying bank suits. You can stake, lend, and earn, all on AAVE.

7. Compound (COMP)
Looking for more action in the lending battlefield? Check out Compound. Just like AAVE, COMP is a DeFi lending protocol, but here's the twist - borrowers can also earn COMP, just like lenders! That's got ""investment opportunity"" written all over it!

8. Maker (MKR)
Debts can be lifelines, and nobody knows this better than MakerDAO. With its unique concept of collateral debts, MKR token, and stablecoin DAI, Maker is reinventing financial debts. Plus, its community-based approach keeps the power in the hands of the people. Saddle up for an interesting ride!

9. Yearn.finance (YFI)
Don't let the nerdy name fool you. It's a DeFi protocol that will automate your investment stints with yield farming. Imagine a smart broker with a smarter algorithm, on the hunt for the best yields. That's YFI for you. Load up the spaceship with the rocket fuel!

10. Rebellion Protocol (REBL)
Last but definitely not the least, Rebellion Protocol or REBL. This beauty is a crypto-focused venture capital (VC) fund run by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). It's one of the first Investment DAOs, and let me tell you; Investment DAOs are expected to go parabolic this year. With experienced people at the helm, this investment fund promises to be more lucrative and more fun than any ordinary VC firm. Its motto “You don’t need a suit to run Wall Street” rings loud and clear. Check out Rebellion Protocol’s homepage for more.

Conclusion
The cryptocurrency world is chockfull of gems waiting to be unearthed. These are just ten of the countless promising altcoins out there. Just remember, these aren't fortune cookies, and I am not a fortune teller. Do your due diligence before you dive into any investment opportunity.

While crypto investments can be the rocket boosters to your portfolio, they can also be the black holes. Don't just follow the herd! Crypto markets are volatile, and prices can dip faster than you can say ""Bitcoin"". Hence, it is crucial to do your own research before going all-in. Your investment choice should be based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and the time you are willing to commit.

If you enjoyed this crypto-soaked rollercoaster, show some love by giving it a dozen Upvotes! Happy investing, folks!"

[Source: cryptopolitan](https://preview.redd.it/rii897zbcp1c1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=d96ea5e22c043e703d72acffe11cf99ea11c9117)

In recent years, a remarkable transformation has been taking place in the world of [finance](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/yearn-finance-yfi-plummeting-so-much-today/) and technology. Governments, regulatory bodies, and financial institutions are increasingly recognizing the potential of [blockchain](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/news/blockchain/) technology and its application in the form of asset tokenization.

As we approach the year 2024, this paradigm shift is gaining momentum, with real-world assets poised to be a key driver of digital asset adoption. In this article, we delve into the evolving landscape of asset tokenization, its benefits, and how governments worldwide are adapting to this transformative technology.

During the crypto winter of 2018–19, skepticism and regulatory uncertainties deterred financial institutions from direct engagement with cryptocurrencies. The volatile nature of tokens raised concerns, leading to an atmosphere of caution. However, the tides have shifted, and [tokenization ](https://web-assets.bcg.com/1e/a2/5b5f2b7e42dfad2cb3113a291222/on-chain-asset-tokenization.pdf)is now being viewed as an attractive option by both governments and regulatory bodies.

Blockchain technology offers several advantages, including enhanced liquidity, fractional ownership, and global accessibility, without exposing assets to the volatility of cryptocurrencies. This shift in perception has prompted governments worldwide to reevaluate their regulations to harness the potential benefits of blockchain technology.

# A multi-trillion dollar market by 2030

Real-world assets are emerging as a driving force behind digital asset adoption. Financial powerhouses have embraced the concept of tokenizing tangible assets such as precious metals, art, and real estate, placing ownership securely on the blockchain. According to a report by the Boston Consulting Group, the tokenization of assets is projected to become a multi-trillion dollar market by 2030.

In an era marked by market volatility, tokenized real-world assets have emerged as a sought-after hedge, providing stability and resilience during turbulent times. Financial institutions are increasingly exploring the use of tokenized financial instruments within decentralized finance frameworks. Notably, many of these institutions are opting for public blockchains, signaling growing confidence in the security and potential of decentralized networks.

# Government and regulatory support

Government involvement in asset tokenization is a significant development. Governments worldwide are realizing the necessity of regulatory changes to benefit from blockchain technology and support the tokenization of real-world assets.

A research report by Bank of America highlighted that tokenization is a “key driver of digital asset adoption” and has the potential to reshape value transfer, settlement, and storage across various industries. Established investment management firms like Hamilton Lane have also entered the fray, partnering with digital-assets securities companies to tokenize their funds.

While full-scale digital asset acceptance remains a work in progress, governments and regulators are reevaluating their stance on real-world assets. Historically, real-world assets were confined by existing regulations. However, recent months have seen a shift as jurisdictions worldwide consider regulatory changes to leverage real-world assets for their needs.

# Government pioneers in Asia

Asia is leading the charge when it comes to supporting asset tokenization. Governments in Hong Kong and Thailand are not merely acknowledging its potential but actively shaping its use for the greater public good.

[Hong Kong](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bc-techno-group-90m-bgx-hong-kong-crypto-osl/), for instance, aims to broaden participation in land sales in the northern territories by partnering with global entities, not limited to local developers. Asset tokenization offers a way to achieve this goal by allowing fractional ownership, expanding the investor pool, and lowering entry barriers.

Thailand, on the other hand, has been eager to distribute tokens to its citizens. While regulatory hurdles are not the primary concern, the technical aspects of token distribution present challenges. The Thai government is collaborating with blockchain platforms to address these technicalities and explore pilot projects.

We are witnessing a global trend where governments are earnestly seeking blockchain integration to unlock new revenue streams and reduce costs. The focus is primarily on the utility and applications of the technology itself.

Real-world assets such as real estate, fine art, and commodities represent prime use cases for tokenization. Whether this transformation takes place in the next year, five years, or a decade, recognizing and harnessing this immense opportunity is pivotal for the future of finance. The integration of blockchain technology into our daily lives is inevitable, and it holds the potential to reshape industries, enhance transparency, and unlock new possibilities for investors and stakeholders alike.

Helping the average John guy understand the Defi space : Decentralized fund management and TokenSets,CryptoCurrency,16o8a8f,2023-09-21 02:17:50,3,0.56,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/16o8a8f/helping_the_average_john_guy_understand_the_defi/,Natural_NoChemical,DISCUSSION,"**John is now curious how he should take care of the money that he got from being such a successful crypto investor. I got you John. I present to you the DECENTRALIZED FUND MANAGEMENT :** This is like taking care of your money, but without a traditional manager. Instead, smart computer programs handle your investments. These programs follow specific rules you set, so you can pick the strategy that fits your goals and saves on fees. Token Sets are an example of how this works in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""And what are those tokens? Token sets?""** It's Token sets John. Here is your answer : 

TokenSets is a platform where you can get Strategy Enabled Tokens (SET). These special tokens come with built-in plans for managing your crypto investments. They do the work for you, so you don't have to constantly watch the crypto market or make emotional decisions. Each SET is like a basket of different cryptocurrencies that automatically adjusts based on your chosen strategy. It's like having a token that follows a specific crypto trading plan. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""What kind of Sets are there?""** Only 2 main types John :

In the past, there used to be Social and Robo Sets, but they were phased out in early 2021. Now, there are two main types of Sets: Index Sets and Yield Farming Sets. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Could you describe in simple terms both of those?""** Sure thing. Here is an explanation :

Index Sets are like bundles of assets that allow users to easily own a variety of cryptocurrencies with just one token, saving on transaction fees. One popular Index Set is the DeFiPulse Index (DPI), which tracks the performance of various DeFi tokens based on their market value.

As of April 2021, DPI includes 14 DeFi assets:

1. Uniswap (UNI)
2. Aave (AAVE)
3. Synthetix Network Token (SNX)
4. Sushiswap (SUSHI)
5. Maker (MKR)
6. Compound (COMP)
7. Yearn.Finance (YFI)
8. REN (REN)
9. Loopring (LRC)
10. Balancer (BAL)
11. Kyber Network (KNC)
12. Harvest Finance (FARM)
13. Cream Finance (CREAM)
14. Meta (MTA)

By owning DPI, you essentially have a piece of all these different cryptocurrencies in one convenient token.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""And what about Yield farming sets?""** You haven't let me finish John. I was gonna describe those next:

Yield Farming Sets make it easier to earn rewards in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) without the hassle of many small transactions. These Sets use smart strategies to automatically claim rewards, convert them into preferred assets, and reinvest them. It's like DeFi's way of compounding interest, saving you time and gas fees. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Ok man,but how do Sets exactly help me?""** They do help you John, trust me bro : 

Sets are like digital tokens that represent different trading strategies. If you want to try out specific strategies, like buying a mix of different assets, Sets make it simple. However, remember that past success doesn't guarantee future gains in the volatile crypto market. Do your research and choose a strategy that makes sense for you.

One popular type of Set is the DeFi Pulse Index Set, which follows a strategy based on the market value of its assets. It has shown significant growth since its creation. While it might not beat individual assets, it often outperforms most of them. If you don't have a unique strategy, using Index Sets for diversified exposure can be a smart choice.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**""Maybe I will get into this in the future. Got any directions?""** Yep. Here is my personal step-by-step guide : 

**Step 1 :**

* Go to [**https://www.tokensets.com/**](https://www.tokensets.com/)
* Click ""Sign In"" in the top right corner.
* Choose to sign in with your Metamask wallet or any other wallet you prefer.

**Step 2 :**

* You'll be taken to a new page.
* A pop-up may ask for your email address, but it's optional, so you can skip it if you want.

**Step 3 :**

* Eventually, you'll reach the Explore page.
* Here, you'll find a list of Sets available.
* Index Sets usually have ""Index"" in their names, and Farm Index Sets have ""Farm"" in their names.
* For instance, you might see ""DeFi Pulse Index"" or ""ETH-USD Yield Farm.""

**Step 4 :**

* Let's see how to buy one of these Sets. We'll use ""DeFi Pulse Index"" as an example.
* Click on ""DeFi Pulse"" from the Explore page.
* Then, click ""Buy.""
* A pop-up window will appear.
* You can choose to buy it using one of the four supported currencies.
* Let's say you want to buy $80 worth of ""DeFi Pulse Index"" (DPI).
* Click ""Submit.""

**Step 5 :**

* You'll need to approve TokenSets to spend your USDC (a stablecoin).
* Click ""Confirm"" in your Metamask wallet.

**Step 6 :**

* Once your approval is confirmed, you can submit your purchase.
* Another transaction approval is needed.
* Click ""Confirm"" in your Metamask wallet.
* That's it! You're done Johny. See, it wasn't that hard!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***TL;DR :***

* **Decentralized Fund Management:** It's like automated crypto investing without a traditional manager. TokenSets is an example.
* **Types of Sets:** Two main types - Index Sets bundle crypto assets, and Yield Farming Sets help you earn rewards in DeFi.
* **How Sets Help:** They simplify trading strategies. Do your research, choose one, and invest.
* **Getting Started:** Visit tokensets.com, choose a Set, specify your investment, and confirm it. Ez!

Blockfi just filed a new motion asking the court to allow ""trade-only"" wallet assets to be sold off, in exchange for stablecoins that wallet users could then withdraw. They're saying these make up less than 0.5% of US wallet funds (they don't state intl %), and that BitGo doesn't have the ability to perform customer withdrawals for these assets with the current Blockfi integration. So effectively telling the court that it'd cost too much time/money to build individual withdrawal mechanisms for them, and asking if they can just sell it all into stablecoins and allow wallet users to withdraw the proceeds they are owed from the sale instead. UCC supports the motion.

Filing states trade-only assets they hold are:

* US Wallets: Algorand (ALGO), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Dogecoin (DOGE)
* International Wallets: Cardano (ADA), Cosmos (ATOM), Avalanche (AVAX), Polkadot (DOT), Filecoin  (FIL), Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), Binance Coin (BNB), Serum (SRM),  Near (NEAR), Fantom (FTM), Sandbox (SAND), Decentraland (MANA), Tron  (TRX), Gala (GALA), Aave (AAVE), Axie Infinity Shards (AXS), EOS (EOS),  FTX Token (FTT), Loopring token (LRC), Omg Network (OMG), Hedera (HBAR),  Texos (XTZ), Maker (MKR), Curve DAO Token (CRV), Compound (COMP),  SushiSwap (SUSHI), The Graph (GRT), yearn.finance (YFI), Chiliz (CHZ),  1inch (1INCH), Enjin Coin (ENJ)

Still sitting on some FTT.. sigh. Hopefully wallet holders that are locked out from withdrawals on account of trade-only assets will get to withdraw ASAP."
DEFI: An Aussie's Definitive Ranking of the Top DeFi in 2023,CryptoCurrency,15xu9go,2023-08-22 00:03:02,8,0.78,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/15xu9go/defi_an_aussies_definitive_ranking_of_the_top/,teeceaustralia,DISCUSSION,"It's a crabbing bear market right, stacking and having patience is key right? Earning a little sum sum on the side helps too right?

Let's talk DeFi.

Below is some top DeFi cryptocurrencies in 2023, considering factors like adoption, technology, usability, and community support. Let me what you think and if you have some other options to add.

**1. Aave (AAVE)**

Aave retains its top position as a pioneer in the DeFi lending space. With an extensive range of assets available for borrowing and lending, Aave's safety mechanisms and flash loan capabilities make it an essential DeFi platform.

**2. Uniswap (UNI)**

Uniswap's decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol remains a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem. Its simple yet robust AMM design enables seamless trading and liquidity provision, earning it a well-deserved spot on this list.

**3. MakerDAO (MKR)**

As the creator of the first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, MakerDAO maintains its significance in DeFi. Its ability to maintain price stability and collateralization through its decentralized governance model sets it apart.

**4. Compound (COMP)**

Compound's lending and borrowing platform continues to attract users seeking efficient ways to earn interest and borrow against their crypto holdings. Its user-friendly interface and variety of supported assets contribute to its popularity.

**5. Synthetix (SNX)**

Synthetix has carved a niche in the DeFi market with its synthetic asset platform. Users can create, trade, and hold synthetic assets that track real-world assets' value, offering exposure to a diverse range of financial instruments.

**6. Curve Finance (CRV)**

Curve Finance specializes in stablecoin swapping with minimal slippage, making it a go-to option for traders looking to exchange stablecoins efficiently. Its focus on low fees and optimal liquidity makes it a valuable tool in the DeFi toolkit.

**7. Yearn.finance (YFI)**

Yearn.finance is synonymous with yield optimization. Its automated strategies move funds between different DeFi protocols to maximize yield, making it a popular choice for users seeking passive income opportunities.

**8. SushiSwap (SUSHI)**

SushiSwap, a Uniswap fork, has grown into a multi-chain DEX ecosystem with features like yield farming, staking, and community governance. Its vibrant community and innovative initiatives continue to drive its adoption.

**9. Compound Chain (CCHAIN)**

Compound Chain has taken the Compound protocol to a multi-chain level, enabling cross-chain lending and borrowing. Its interoperability and expansion potential contribute to its position in this ranking.

**10. Bancor (BNT)**

Bancor's automated market maker protocol focuses on providing liquidity to a wide range of tokens. Its self-balancing pools and emphasis on single-token exposure make it a unique option for DeFi users.

**11. Balancer (BAL)**

Balancer's automated portfolio management platform enables users to create liquidity pools with multiple tokens and varying weights. Its flexible design appeals to traders seeking customized exposure.

**12. REN (REN)**

Ren's interoperability protocol allows users to bring assets from one blockchain to another, expanding DeFi's potential across different networks. Its innovative approach to cross-chain liquidity adds value to the ecosystem.

**13. Kyber Network (KNC)**

Kyber Network facilitates instant and secure token swaps, catering to both traders and dApps requiring seamless token conversion. Its focus on decentralized liquidity provision makes it an essential player in DeFi.

**14. dYdX (DYDX)**

dYdX's trading platform offers decentralized margin trading and perpetual swaps. Its non-custodial design empowers users to trade with leverage while maintaining control over their funds.

**15. Osmosis (OSMO)**

Osmosis Zone, built on the Cosmos ecosystem, offers a unique take on automated market making and decentralized exchange. With its focus on liquidity pools and yield farming, Osmosis has gained attention for its potential to empower users to create and manage their own tokenized assets.

**16. PancakeSwap (CAKE)**

PancakeSwap, a prominent DeFi project on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), offers users a decentralized exchange (DEX) platform similar to Uniswap but with lower fees due to BSC's network characteristics. Its ability to provide liquidity, yield farming, and other DeFi services has made it a popular choice within the BSC ecosystem.

Remember, the DeFi space is a tad bit chaotic at times and certainly very dynamic, new projects are emerging regularly. This ranking is based on the information available to my stupid Australian brain up to this point in 2023 and will most likely change. DYOR and use this maybe as a guide, or not."

Aave temporarily freezes lending markets to fend off further attacks,expay24,z70tnw,2022-11-28 11:24:41,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/expay24/comments/z70tnw/aave_temporarily_freezes_lending_markets_to_fend/,Expay-24,,"Decentralized liquidity protocol Aave has temporarily suspended lending markets for 17 tokens to fend off volatility risks that could lead to further attempts at market manipulation.

Lending markets were frozen right after its governance members [passed](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=121) a vote that aims to temporarily freeze assets considered to be volatile and have low liquidity. The assets included in the list are Yearn.finance ([YFI](https://cointelegraph.com/yearn-finance-price-index)), Curve Finance (CRV), 0x (ZRX), Decentraland ([MANA](https://cointelegraph.com/decentraland-mana-price-index)), 1inch (1INCH), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Enjin (ENJ), Ampleforth (AMPL), DeFi Pulse Index (DPI), RENFIL, Maker ([MKR](https://cointelegraph.com/maker-price-index)) and xSUSHI.

Apart from these, the protocol also suspended the following stablecoins: sUSD, Pax Dollar (USDP), Liquidity USD (LUSD), Gemini Dollar (GUSD) and RAI. With the assets frozen, users cannot take loans on the assets or deposit their assets to the protocol.

According to the proposal, the aim of the move is to reduce the risk for Aave v2 and promote the eventual migration to v3. The proposal also pointed out the lower risk tolerance of community members at the moment. However, the authors of the proposal also highlighted that the next course of action, which may be to either delist or relist the markets, would depend on liquidity and usage levels.

**_Related:_**[**_Mango Markets hacker allegedly feigns Curve short attack to exploit Aave_**](https://cointelegraph.com/news/mango-markets-hacker-allegedly-feigns-curve-short-attack-to-exploit-aave)

The governance proposal follows a [failed $60-million attack](https://cointelegraph.com/news/aave-proposes-governance-changes-after-failed-60m-short-attack) on CRV using USD Coin ([USDC](https://cointelegraph.com/usdc-price-index)) as collateral. The attack was unable to go through because of a wrong calculation of the decentralized protocol’s liquidity levels. Nevertheless, contributors within the project worked on the proposal to prevent further exploitation attempts on the protocol.

Despite the turbulence in the broader crypto market, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol was able to raise $10 million in investments from various investors, such as Bitfinex and Ava Labs. Last week, Cosmos-based ecosystem Onomy [secured funds to develop its new protocol](https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-protocol-raises-10m-from-bitfinex-ava-labs-despite-turbulent-market) that combines DeFi and foreign exchange.

MakerDAO Risk Core Unit makes urgent parameter change request in light of recent market events,expay24,yt0u64,2022-11-12 03:24:12,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/expay24/comments/yt0u64/makerdao_risk_core_unit_makes_urgent_parameter/,Expay-24,,"The MakerDAO Risk Core Unit, a key group within the MakerDAO governance system, [submitted](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/urgent-signal-request-urgent-recommended-collateral-parameter-changes/18764) an urgent request on Nov. 11 to change collateral parameters for the decentralized autonomous organization’s stablecoin, Dai ([DAI](https://cointelegraph.com/dai-price-index)).

Primoz, a member of the Risk Core Unit team, posted the request to the MakerDAO forum.

“In light of recent events in the crypto ecosystem and surrounding uncertainty regarding financial stability and asset liquidity of various entities and their possible relations with token governed protocols, we are proposing following temporary emergency measures.”

The message proposed that the debt ceiling for MATIC ([MATIC](https://cointelegraph.com/polygon-price-index)), LINK ([LINK](https://cointelegraph.com/chainlink-price-index)), YFI ([YFI](https://cointelegraph.com/yearn-finance-price-index)) and renBTC vaults should be reduced by the following amounts:

  - MATIC: from 20 million to 10 million (50%)
  - LINK: from 25 million to 5 million (80%)
  - YFI: from 10 million to 3 million (70%)
  - renBTC: from 10 million to zero (100%)

A separate, earlier proposal also [suggested](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mana-a-intermediate-parameter-change-proposal/18727) that the debt ceiling for MANA ([MANA](https://cointelegraph.com/decentraland-mana-price-index)) be lowered from 10 million to 3 million.

If the proposal passes, it will reduce the number of tokens that can be used as collateral to mint new Dai.

Some of the tokens on this list are so close to the new debt ceiling that they will immediately hit it or be close to hitting it should the proposal pass. For example, there is currently $14.2 million worth of MATIC backing Dai, but the proposal would lower the debt ceiling for MATIC to $10 million. This would mean that users would no longer be able to mint new Dai by depositing MATIC.

In the proposal, Primoz sought to calm users and express that the changes may only be temporary:

“When the situation becomes clearer and the environment less risky, we (@Risk-Core-Unit) or either MOMC will propose further parameter changes to adjust parameters based on the future state. While we do not necessarily want current positions to unwind, we want to limit further possible exposure.”

Over the past few days, the crypto community has been rocked by the news that FTX, the world’s third-largest crypto exchange by volume, [did not have enough liquidity](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-and-binance-s-ongoing-saga-everything-that-s-happened-until-now) to handle all customer withdrawals. This event started a contagion that has spread through the crypto market, leading many coins to have huge losses.

MakerDAO has turned out to be the latest victim of this contagion. As the value of the collateral backing Dai has fallen, debt levels have risen too high for the comfort of the Risk Core Unit team. This may lead to lower debt ceilings and increasing frustration for borrowers who wish to mint new Dai.

Don't have time for active crypto trading? You still have an option to benefit from crypto investments. Check this list of passive income strategies. 💵,Alfacash,ykdd6i,2022-11-02 14:46:20,9,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alfacash/comments/ykdd6i/dont_have_time_for_active_crypto_trading_you/,AlfacashStore,,"1️⃣ HODL. Perhaps this is the most popular strategy among crypto enthusiasts who sincerely believe in the great future of cryptocurrencies. ""HODL"" originated as a misspelling of ""HOLD"" in an online post by an early Bitcoin investor. It means a long-term strategy when investors do not sell crypto waiting for a future growth. 📈

2️⃣ Staking. This is a way to get passive income from cryptocurrencies that work on the Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm. Unlike mining, users do not need to buy hardware. They are rewarded just for storing coins in their wallets for a certain period of time. ⏳ There are a dozen of coins suitable for staking - ETH, DOT, XTZ, MATIC, ALGO, CAKE, etc. 

3️⃣ Yield Farming. This is a way to earn passive income by lending your funds to others through decentralized financial protocols. Yield farming is typically done using ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum. The leading protocols include Aave (AAVE), Compound (COMP), Yearn Finance (YFI). It's a rather risky and complicated strategy that needs time to dig inside the ocean of DeFi projects. 🌊"

## 基本介绍

## 简介

Yearn Finance 是去中心化金融 (DeFi) 中的一个收益聚合器，可在以太坊区块链上提供贷款聚合、收益生成和保险。该协议由各种独立开发人员维护，并由 YFI 持有者管理。Yearn Finance 是一项资产管理协议，试图为依赖自动化投资的未来构建基础设施，专注于通过在不同借贷协议之间自动切换来最大化 DeFi 功能。 该协议抓住了yield farming 炒作的机会，以构建具有即时产品市场契合度的功能。Yield farming 是一种新趋势，交易者向 DeFi 协议提供流动性（存款代币）以赚取他们的原生代币。高回报吸引了大量交易者，他们已转变为全职 yield farmer。yEarn Finance有多种产品，但其主要产品是“yVaults”，它利用了 Yield farming 趋势。这些 yVaults 是自动化的投资策略，可为投资者带来收益。投资者所要做的就是将资金存入 yEarn 保险库，剩下的由协议来处理。值得注意的是，所有这些都是自动且无需信任地完成的。

### 团队

2020 年初，Yearn 协议的作者 – Andre Cronje 开始研究自动化他的策略，为他的稳定币选择最高报酬的借贷协议。在这协议开发之前，Andre 必须每天醒来并手动检查当天哪个协议支付的 APY 最高，并考虑将他的资金转移到该协议上。一次总是有几个选项可用，例如 Compound、Aave、Fulcrum 或 dYdX。这项手动工作很快变得重复和乏味，因此Andre开始编写第一个版本的 Yearn 协议，以自动化为他的稳定币选择最佳策略的整个过程。Andre Cronje 是一名开发人员和技术专家，拥有二十年的经验。他曾与传统技术行业和加密货币领域的多家公司合作。 Cronje 是加密领域最受尊敬的开发人员之一，也是 Crypto Briefing 的前 CTO。 Cronje 是一名顶级 DeFi 开发人员，并由一群聪明能干的人提供支持，他们负责监督协议升级、新产品和业务执行。

### 代币供应

YFI发行总量仅为3万枚。YFI 没有 ICO，被认为拥有自比特币以来最公平的代币分配。这是因为 100% 的代币都分发给了协议参与者，而 Cronje 没有为自己保留任何代币。由于 YFI 的分配从一开始就是通过挖矿产生的。从 YFI 首次 3 万个代币分配完毕开始，YFI 将其所有治理完全交由社群来进行。

## 市场机会

DeFi 每天都在创造新的收益机会。有些策略比其他风险更大，但很少有人能长期维持下去。 流动性挖矿在最近一年发展迅速，DeFi的总锁仓量也上升了很多。yEarn 能够在更可持续的战略中获取收益。作为收益聚合器，yEarn 有可能成为渴望收益的加密货币投资者的一站式商店。而不是去个别的协议和衡量那里投资的收益，人们可以简单地去 yEarn 并选择相当可持续的产量农业策略。目前，yEarn 仅限于几种策略。但是任何人都可以制定新的策略并将其提交给社区。一些最聪明的加密算法交易员正在努力建立 yEarn 金库。为了进一步激励交易者将他们的最佳策略部署到 yEarn，有一项治理提案将每个策略赚取的部分费用奖励给策略的部署者。人们可以将 yEarn 视为一种为缺乏动力的人提供的投资工具。您无需手动进行收益最大化，只需将您的代币委托给 yEarn ，并允许无需许可的协议为您完成。但是，yEarn 并没有缩小范围并专注于单个垂直行业，而是在每个 DeFi 垂直行业中分得一杯羹。该协议的产品可满足资产管理、保险、代币交易、借贷和稳定币的需求。
