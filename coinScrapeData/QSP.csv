Gdzie najlepiej kupić Quantstamp (QSP)?,kryptomaniak,1bzmjn3,2024-04-09 03:52:23,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/kryptomaniak/comments/1bzmjn3/gdzie_najlepiej_kupić_quantstamp_qsp/,Ujowo,,"Gdy zastanawiasz się, gdzie najlepiej kupić Quantstamp (QSP), istnieje kilka istotnych czynników, które warto wziąć pod uwagę. Quantstamp to projekt, który zapewnia narzędzia do bezpiecznego wdrażania smart kontraktów na blockchainie Ethereum. Ponieważ kryptowaluty są coraz bardziej popularne, znalezienie odpowiedniej giełdy, na której można kupić QSP, jest kluczowym krokiem dla każdego inwestora.

Jednym z najpopularniejszych sposobów na zakup Quantstamp jest korzystanie z renomowanych giełd kryptowalutowych. Platformy takie jak Binance, Coinbase Pro czy Kraken często oferują możliwość handlu QSP. Warto wybrać giełdy, które cieszą się dobrą reputacją, zapewniają bezpieczeństwo środków oraz mają odpowiedni wolumen transakcyjny.

Kolejnym istotnym czynnikiem do rozważenia jest kwestia opłat transakcyjnych. Różne giełdy mogą pobierać różne opłaty za transakcje, w tym opłaty za handel oraz wypłaty. Przed dokonaniem zakupu Quantstamp warto zorientować się w polityce opłat poszczególnych platform, aby uniknąć niepotrzebnych kosztów.

Ważne jest również, aby upewnić się, że wybrana giełda obsługuje odpowiednie pary handlowe z Quantstamp. Sprawdź, czy istnieje możliwość bezpośredniego zakupu QSP za pomocą Twojej preferowanej waluty, czy też konieczne będzie najpierw zakupienie innej kryptowaluty, aby następnie wymienić ją na Quantstamp.

Poza tradycyjnymi giełdami, istnieją również alternatywne sposoby zakupu Quantstamp, takie jak giełdy zdecentralizowane (DEX) lub platformy do zakupu tokenów bezpośrednio od projektu. Zawsze jednak upewnij się, że korzystasz z zaufanych i sprawdzonych źródeł, aby uniknąć ryzyka oszustwa.

Podsumowując, najlepiej kupować Quantstamp na renomowanych giełdach kryptowalutowych, biorąc pod uwagę czynniki takie jak bezpieczeństwo, opłaty transakcyjne oraz dostępność odpowiednich par handlowych. Pamiętaj również o dokładnym zbadaniu wybranej platformy przed dokonaniem transakcji, aby mieć pewność, że Twoje środki są bezpieczne.

"Nomad hack: smart contract auditors outlined the possibility of the exploit. The team rejected the audit findings as ""impossible"". Ended up getting hacked for $200m. Unreal incompetence",Buttcoin,we8514,2022-08-02 06:28:30,851,0.98,148,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/we8514/nomad_hack_smart_contract_auditors_outlined_the/,Dirt-Purple,,"Defi is incredibly dumb and risky, but smart contract audits can atleast suggest to the developers how to fix their own mistakes. 

Thats what the smart contract audit for Nomad (the bridge that got hacked today) did.. 

This is the audit report: https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/nomad

See the section: QSP-19 Proving With An Empty Leaf

> Recommendation: Validate that the input of the function is not empty


> The Nomad team responded that ""We consider it to be effectively impossible to find the preimage of the empty leaf"". 

> We believe the Nomad team has misunderstood the issue. It is not related to finding the pre-image of the empty bytes. Instead, it is about being able to prove that empty bytes are included in the tree (empty bytes are the default nodes of a sparse Merkle tree). Therefore, anyone can call the function with an empty leaf and update the status to be proven.

Its important to note even the auditors think the Nomad team has ""misunderstood the issue"" i.e incompetent. 

The status of this audit finding is still "" Acknowledged"" i.e it was never fixed. Somehow the Nomad bridge launched even without fixing the issues identified in its audit. 

And of course, it got hacked with the exact same way outlined above. 


Someone passed an empty strong 0x000000 as proof of the transaction and were able to withdraw money from the vault without any authorisation. This is like punching in a code into an ATM without entering your card, and being able to clean out all the funds in the ATM. 

https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1554259057585729536

Crypto bros are dumb but crypto devs are even dumber and utterly clueless about security and the technology they are building. Most of them dont seem to have a functional understanding of software development lifecycle. Let alone an understanding of finance, banking, and forget the advanced computer/cryptography skills needed to manage such complex programs. 


If you are managing $200m of people's funds, your team better have the best in the industry.. but no, crypto devs are all either fresh grads or devs who have worked exlcusively on other crypto ponzis.  If they had worked at a competent company, they would know to not rush into launching something when there are unresolved issues. 

As long as crypto devs play with other's internet monies and not their own, they will continue to make expensive mistakes, because all of it is just a big experiment for them. $200m hacked? No biggie, good learning, A16Z will fund their next project for sure..

How people can justify putting even a dollar into a market as risky as crypto defi, which has zero checks and balances is baffling."

Quantstamp price today is $0.084958470119 with a 24-hour trading volume of $57,838,447. QSP price is up 4.3% in the last 24 hours. It has a circulating supply of 710 Million QSP coins and a total supply of 976 Million. If you are looking to buy or sell Quantstamp, Coinbase Exchange is currently the most active exchange. Quantstamp is a security-auditing protocol for smart contracts. As a apps platform, Ethereum has proven its security time and again. However, apps and smart contracts on top of Ethereum may still have bugs in which malicious players can cause havoc on the network. The two most notable examples of these being the $55 million DAO hack and the $30 million Parity wallet bug. These issues not only affect the people who’ve had their funds stolen, but they also diminish the credibility of the entire ecosystem. Quantstamp is making smart contracts more secure through automated software testing and a system of bug bounties. Although starting with Ethereum, the team is building the protocol to be available on any DApp platform in the long run.In an industry where security is a primary concern and bugs have caused the theft of millions of dollars, Quantstamp should help to legitimize blockchain projects and ensure that large-scale smart contract hacks are a thing of the past. Quantstamp held a successful ICO in November 2017 in which the team raised a little over $30 million dollars. They distributed 650 million (65%) QSP out of the 1 billion total supply to ICO participants at a price of $0.072 per token. After the usual post-ICO volatility, the QSP price stabilized at around $0.10 (\~0.000005 BTC) through the end of November. The price followed the trend of the altcoin market and rose rapidly to an all-time high of $0.82 (\~0.000051 BTC) before slowly falling to its current price of \~$0.286. The QSP price weathered the beginning of the year market downfall better than most other altcoins.

"Reminder: EVERYTHING is a shitcoin in a bear market. [A lookback at some ""great"" projects from 2018]",CryptoCurrency,njc1pl,2021-05-23 13:06:59,1550,0.93,653,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/njc1pl/reminder_everything_is_a_shitcoin_in_a_bear/,Flower838,TRADING,"***tl;dr: Dont get in love with, or marry you baggs.***

The intention is to not spread more FUD (like we need it right?), but please be aware. 

This recent crash (no, its not a dip; lets call it what it is at this point) has many investors and traders scared to put money into the market. We have seen some of the altcoins get rekt pretty hard.  40-70% loss on the weekly is not uncommon for even top 50 and those are surely supposed to be ""good & solid"" projects right? Well...think again. 

With the potential upcomming bear market I would like to remind everyone that most alts that are now top 100 might not make it. This time the hype is around staking rewards, DeFi APY pools, NTF's and meme coins. The main focus of 2018 were ICO's. It changes drastically each cycle. As someone who witnessed my portfolio outperform BTC in 2017, only to lose both sats and fiat value by 90% in the early 2018, I would like to inform the new people how things work with altcoins. BTC's dominance is rising again - hinting at the end of altseason.

Consider the following to be true:

1.) It does not matter if the team is good.  
2.) It does not matter if the idea is revolutionary.  
3.) It does not matter that there is a real life usecase for the coin/token.

I see some newcommers on this sub already coming to terms with the fact that it might be over and sayin ""ill just hold my alt picks for the longterm, I believe in the project"".... Now, yes, some will be good in the longterm... **But most will not.** Even if we go sideways for a few months and then have another leg up in the summer due to good news, institutions buying more, and major platforms(mainly big three ETH, ADA, DOT) with big updates, A LOT of coins will not be there.

I suspect many will never reach their ATH's again. Remember, most of the coins I will mention below were in the top 100 at some point during the 2017-2018 bullrun, perhaps briefly, perhaps for months.

So....

A lookback at some of the coins that were shilled and hyped heavily on the way down from the 2018 peak and never got back to ATH's:

[Iota](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/iota/)

*Price facts:*

It peaked at $5 in december 2017, and bottomed at \~$1 just a few months later in april 2018. Thats an 80% loss. Then it went on to reach a low of as much as $0.1 in the following years. **A loss of 98% from ATH.**

I was buying this at 2.3 and 4.2 all the way up back in 2017, waiting for my guaranteed 10x. Finally got rid of it at 1.7 this year.It never got back to its ATH - peaking just slightly above 2.53 this run.

*The hype surrounding it:*

Reading about it, you could hear stuff like ""Blockchain 3.0"", and ""the bigger the userbase the faster and more secure the network"", and ""the currency of the future"", ""it will connect all machines on the internet, making them exchange good in IoTa currency"", ""the team is smart and hard-working"" ""a very well designed projects"" ""will revolutionalize the way smart cars, refrigiratos and phones communicate with each other"".

[Request (REQ)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/request/) (frequently hyped and shilled on this sub like VET and LTO today)

*Price facts:*

Had a massive run in extremely short time. This one hit like few others. Was just under 10 cents in december 2017, then it just 10x-ed in a month or so to just uner a dollar, peaking in January. It was free money. Until it one day just wasnt. By april it was trading at 14 cents again. **Now its dead.**  Gone from top 100 for probably forever, forgotten by most. Went under a cent in 2019 (-99.4% from ATH) and came back this year to around 15 cents again. Still like 83% away from ATH.

*The hype surrounding it:*

Didnt really read into it much back then. It was the one that got away and I never got into it. Something something about revolutionazing the paymant industry, putting it on the blockchain. Having an universal storage of transactions. I am talking credit cards, cashback, decentralised and publically viewed on the blockchain and becoming transparent. HUGE. It was all the rage and the cryptospace, especially YTB was losing its mind over it, this sub not beeing immune. I am talking  VET and LTO level shilling.

&#x200B;

[Substratum (SUB)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/substratum/)

*Price facts:*

Picture this: Its 30th of December 2017 and you are preparing for new years eve party. You finally dump 2.5k into Substratum after researching it for a week or so, already feeling massive FOMO for missing the price surge from 40 cents to $1. You get 2,517 of them. In 9 days I was sitting on 7.5k, about 5k in pure profits feeling on top of the world. It 3x-ed in 10 days. Why sell? Shit is going to $10 for sure.

....

This one, I still to this day hold. BAGGGS of it. It was delisted on Binance, where my worthless bag resides. I cant do shit with it. It is now trading at 0.004 on an exchange no1 knows about and has no volume. That is a 99.8% price drop from ATH.

*The hype surrounding it:*

My friend pitched it to me saying it will make internet use fair. It was supposed to make search engines fair and it was supposed to do that by decentralising them. HUGE project, solid team. Shilled heavily on YouTube mostly. Exit scam.

&#x200B;

[QuantStamp (QSP)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/quantstamp/)

*Price facts:*

After 7x-ing its value(from 9 cents to 73 cents) in 2 weeks or less, it went all the way back down to 20 cents before dead-cat-bouncing slightly above 35 again. Then died quite quickly (to like 0.006) with 99.1% loss in the upcomming bear. Got a bump to 10 cents this bullrun.

*The hype surrounding it:*

The first mover advantage into Smart Contact Security. Top notch tech for securing the ETH blockchain, even getting mentions from Vitalik. Huge partnerships, hard working team, and a product we surely need, right? RIGHT??

&#x200B;

[Lisk (LSK)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/lisk/) This one was really dear to my heart. I even got my dad into it.

*Price facts:*

It initially lost 76% during the great crash of 2018, and the went on to rebounce somewhat, finally bottomed around %0.7 (a 97% crash) in 2020. This run it never got past $10, I got out at around $8.3 after holding for years.

*The hype surrounding it:*

It was massive. It was aiming to be the biggest blockchain ecosystem around in the years to come, with a pro team and a long roadmap, and you were really early if you buying at $17( I was). 

There was a rumour going around that ALL apps, on ALL playstores, be it android or iPhone would be written on and connected throught Lisk. It was like the main blockchain for mobile app industry. They had events, AMA's, hard working team, a product that the world surely will need. They will be the first in the space. 

The blockchain has also been around since before the bullrun, and that was somehow supposed to prove these guys are legit.  It was stable it was secure it was the future. 

&#x200B;

[Icon(ICX)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/icon/)

*Price facts:*

Crashed from $12 to $3 when everything else was crashing. I bought this one on the way down actually. I let it go at $2.3 this year(almost perfect peak, yay me) after holding all throughout the bear. Bottomed at -95%+ at some point.  

*The hype surrounding it:*

Throwing around big words that noone really understood or took the time to explain such as ""aggregator"", ""interoperability"", ""layering"" and the bunch. It was supposed to connect the one bussines group with another though its network in an effective and decentralised way. Had actually shools and governments as partners. Also Samsung got involved later I think.

&#x200B;

[Power Ledger (POWR)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/power-ledger/) 

*Price facts:*

It was worth like $1.6 at some point, I remember getting into it at 70 cents. Held it all the way through initial crash of like 80+% to 2021, when I let it go for like $38. Peaked at $0.64 this run.

*The hype surrounding it:*

This project was supposed to revolutionalize the energy and electric distribution globally, making it trackable on blockchain, and sending it where there is shortage. Sustainable energy for all. Connected globally. No1 of us though why we need a crypto token to implement this change and why would any big energy firm need a token to implement this change though. It just sounded sooooo coool. 

&#x200B;

[PIVX](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pivx/)

*Price facts:*

Crashed from like $13 to $2 (around 80%) in a month or less. Bottomed at sub 25 cents (a 98% loss from ATH ) in 2020. Never came back, but had a bump back to $2 this run. 

*The hype surrounding it:*

Simply put, it was ""the Monero killer"". Almost no fees, even more secure, more anonymous, cutting edge tech, privacy for days. The future of privacy coins. Masternodes. Proof of stake. Top tech. Buy buy buy. 

&#x200B;

[NEO (or ""Antshares"" back then).](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/neo/)

*Price facts:*

This beast literally 200x-ed. If you got into it before rebranding, when it was still Antshares you were lucky. It almost reached $200 from sub $1. Crashed hard after China FUD was released(yes China FUD was a thing back then also). From January 15 to April 4th, a loss of 74%. ALMOST came back to ATH this bullrun. It never broke into top 25 I dont think, even though it was firmly in the top 10 for quite some time in 2017. I hodled like 42 of them all these yeas, finally letting it go at $50 this year. I lost like half my money on it.

*The hype surrounding it:*

It was advertised as the Chinese Ethereum killer. Better tech.Better implementations of smart contracts. Harder working team. The fact that is was (somewhat) centralized didnt bother much people. Earning GAS for just holding it was a big deal back then (staking rewards were not really a thing, you see). It was one of the only projects giving passive income. Also a lot of projects were starting on it. 

&#x200B;

[DeepBrainChain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/deepbrain-chain/)

*Price facts:*

Would you like to 6x your money in 10 days?? All you had to do was buy this shitcoin at new year 2018 and sell it at the peak on 9th January 2018. Now trading at around one cent, down 98% from ATH.

*The hype surrounding it:*

An integration of AI and blockchain technology. A revolution in the AI industry. Not anonymous team. Good partnerships, huge offices, dedication, integrity, vision, exelent crowdfunding. The future is ours. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Honorable mentions that were also shilled on Youtube and some from 2018 might remember, but I dont have the time to go into detail and will only mention:**

Aion: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aion/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aion/) Was really big back then, but I cant quite remember what  for. Some on my friends held loads of it. Today is sub 300 on cmc.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**THERE's A LOT MORE.** These are the ones I and my friends remember.

 Hold on to your sats guys.

&#x200B;

**Which projects/coins/tokens do I think will not make it??**

1.) ***The majority of the food shitcoins on Binance Smart Chain*** ...

will just die. I mean, can you imagine buying CAKE, BAKE or BURGER  after what happened last week?? Of course the dog coins and scams on BSC will die also. If/when ETH fixes fee's, Cardano does smart contracts and Polkadot kicks off parachains, there will be less and less need for BNB in the space, and even though the token might(probably will) stay a top 10 for years to come, the BSC ecosystem will surely lose its significance in the crypto space.

2.) ***Memes.***

Everyone loves hype, TikTok, YouTube and Twitter shilling, and dumb money flows into this. But with the recent crash, dumb money is now scared shitless. Yes DOGE might come around again in the next run as the king of memes, but I dont see that hapenning to coins with ""safe"", ""dog"" ""mars"" ""elon"" ""moon"" ""cum"" ""pussy"" in their name. Its just not happening.

3.) ***Smart contract platforms and Ethereum competitors.***

Dont get me wrong I do believe in multichain world. I think some can coexist. SOME. Not all. I believe Ethereum, Cardano and Polkadot are here to stay. They have solid tech, they have hardworking teams and have been around for years now. I also think Cosmos(ATOM) is undervalued and is all tech no hype this run, and thus, didnt get to shine in the spotlight, but can potentially play a big role in the years to come. I am not so sure about Solana, Avalanche, Tezos, Tron, Eos, Icon, Neo, Algorand, Elrond, Nem, Hedera HashGraph, ... etc

I know many of you like these projects. I, too, like some of them. Ask yourself, is there really a space for them in crypto in 3 -10 years??

***4.) Coins that are trying to be ""the next"" \_\_\_\_\_\_ (fill in the blank) and forks that are trying to improve on an existing coin.***

There are countless(actually I think 105) forks of BTC that are now mostly ghost chains. Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond, BitcoinX, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision; even Bitcoin Cash Satoshi Vision and ... Bitcoin this and Bitcoin that.  Do you have any idea how fast EthereumClassic(ETC) will die?? Probably even BCH (bcash) and LTC(litecoin) will not make it. For sure others didnt.

Yes Litecoin is objectively better tech(and dear to my heart) than Bitcoin. It does not matter though.

&#x200B;

***tl;dr: Dont get in love with, or marry you baggs.***

&#x200B;

Not financial advice. But you already know that. Good luck in the weeks to come,"

QSP - Quantstamp,SatoshiStreetBets,ldhk1g,2021-02-05 16:18:22,2,0.75,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/ldhk1g/qsp_quantstamp/,Which-Studio1010,Discussion,What do people think? It's been on a relatively upward trend lately. Good opportunity or about to crash?
Quantstamp $QSP and it's moon capability,CryptoMoonShots,layzkd,2021-02-02 11:01:25,8,0.83,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/layzkd/quantstamp_qsp_and_its_moon_capability/,HuskerNatChamps2020,Discussion,"So I was browsing older posts from 2017-2018 bullrush and found QSP being talked about a lot, and I think it is due here soon for another moonshot back to previous ATH. QSP was the talk of the town and I remember hearing tons about it, but since the crash it seems that this coin got lost in the noise WHICH MAKES NO SENSE. This coin simply is the body guard/Cyber security for Ethereum. 

Quantstamp is a security-auditing protocol for smart contracts. As a apps platform, Ethereum has proven its security time and again. However, apps and smart contracts on top of Ethereum may still have bugs in which malicious players can cause havoc on the network. The two most notable examples of these being the $55 million DAO hack and the $30 million Parity wallet bug. These issues not only affect the people who’ve had their funds stolen, but they also diminish the credibility of the entire ecosystem. Quantstamp is making smart contracts more secure through automated software testing and a system of bug bounties. Although starting with Ethereum, the team is building the protocol to be available on any DApp platform in the long run.In an industry where security is a primary concern and bugs have caused the theft of millions of dollars, Quantstamp should help to legitimize blockchain projects and ensure that large-scale smart contract hacks are a thing of the past.

OK SO HERE'S WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR

\-this coin has been $0.80 before and is currently nowhere near it at $0.03

\-25 million dollar market cap means that it is not being watched at all even though it's tech is extremely important

\-It is a well established coin with a team that is working constantly

\-security protocol protects coins from attacks using smart contracts

\-even if it doesn't hit $0.80 it can easily 2x or 3x

Thanks for coming to my TED Talk"
Binance to Binance US,binance,kkqq8l,2020-12-26 16:51:26,3,0.72,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/kkqq8l/binance_to_binance_us/,FantasticPhilosophy0,Binance.US,"Received a message today saying I had 14 or 15 days to move my tokens from Binance.  As a US citizen, who pays a small amount of attention to crypto I had an idea this might be happening at some point...or something close.

&#x200B;

Anyway my question is this....moving some of the crypto has been easy like BTC and 0x.  I slid my BNB over to my binance US account.  Easy enough...altho wasn't happy about paying ""fees"" to move it from one binance site to another...oh well, no biggie.

&#x200B;

Ok the question - what about these coins??  I don't see them on Binance US or coinbase....any recommendations what to do with them?  Quantstamp (QSP), Tron (TRX), or well those are my only 2 left on binance.  Anything I can do with them....I have like 3500 of each....."
The Secret PhutureDAO Master Plan (just between you and me),PhutureDAO,ivpqxe,2020-09-19 05:55:48,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhutureDAO/comments/ivpqxe/the_secret_phuturedao_master_plan_just_between/,PhutureDAO,,"⁃ Inspired by Elon Musk.

*Background: This piece is written by the PhutureDAO creators, who are merely catalysts in the conception and construction of PhutureDAO. The community will run and govern the eco-system. Listed here is our vision for the ‘phuture’ of the PhutureDAO eco-system. Ultimately, the community can take it in whichever direction they decide, but we thought it would be cool to share our thoughts.*

As you already know, PhutureDAO is creating a range of benchmark decentralised programable indexes. Most people are familiar with PhutureDAO and our initial index that is due to be launched, ‘The Defi Index’, tracking the top Defi projects by market cap with one token. This is auto-rebalancing and will add in and out tokens weekly. Naturally, investors in the index will own the underlying asset and not a synthetic version. However, most aren’t aware of the use cases and incentivisation (we will speak more about this in a later post) PhutureDAO can provide.

PhutureDAO is designed from the ground up, to last the test of time, using its own liquidity pools which are key — and something we will talk about later. First of all, we see a future that has a range of different indexes. From Defi to, Dex’s (decentralised exchanges), to DAO’s (decentralised autonomous organisations), and even individual communities.

The notion of a non-crypto native, buying their first ETH from an exchange like Coinbase, who wants to have exposure to specific areas of crypto, having to go in and individually buy the top tokens at that time is not something we see taking place. We at PhutureDAO believe crypto and non-crypto natives want exposure to specific sectors within crypto, and that it should be as easy as purchasing the DEX index token, which would give exposure to the top 10 or top 100 projects. Depending on the investor’s interest.

PhutureDAO is structured in a way that empowers its users as they can create their own index. An index that we believe would gain traction in the current market conditions would be a ‘Fair Launch Index’. As a user, you could create this index, and the more AUI (assets under index) you receive, the more of a kickback you receive, therefore incentivising creators of the index.

A community within the crypto sphere is key. It wouldn’t take a lot of imagination to think that an audit provider, like QuantStamp (QSP), could launch the QuantStamp index. This index would be made up of all the different projects they have audited. Giving the community an easy option to buy into their work.

Indexing community efforts is an interesting theme that we believe will provide a lot of growth for the PhutureDAO eco-system. Another interesting example would be the DAO provider Aragon (ANT). If a user believes in the Aragon eco-system and DAO’s, they could purchase one token that owns a % of all the Aragon projects. Taking a wider view than making a few small investments and hoping they work out.

Users could also create an index that owns the Andreessen Horowitz crypto portfolio and could invest in the same investments. This goes for any crypto VC fund that has token exposure. It benefits the individual project and VC’s, as more liquidity is channelling into those projects and their portfolio. It benefits the index investor because without investing in the Andreessen Horowitz Venture fund, they can own the same assets at a level of risk that suits them, in a tokenised fashion.

Things happen quickly in Crypto. Owning individual tokens, unless you are actively managing them, is not the right option for most investors. Owning an index that changes with the times, we believe is the ‘phuture’. Buy the haystack not the needle.

So far, we have spoken about retail investors looking to participate. We can also take a different view and look at institutional investors that want exposure to the crypto economy. Let’s say, for example, they want exposure to DEX’s and gaming NFTs, do you think they will buy one or two tokens within those sectors? We at PhutureDAO think they would prefer a highly liquid index, that auto-rebalances and changes with the times. Providing exposure to those specific areas and best of class projects, weighted by the institution’s selected metrics, could be by market cap, underlying users, earnings etc…

Exchanges want to provide their users with as many projects and tokens as possible but are limited by the onboarding processes. Imagine a world where an exchange can list ‘The DAO Index’ or ‘The DEX Index’ which automatically provides exposure from 5–100 different projects. We think that this world sounds like a good place to be.

We at PhutureDAO believe this would be an area of huge growth for the individual index tokens.

The PhutureDAO eco-system has the ability to do all of the above.

This is part 1 of the Master Plan, we hope you learned more about our vision and PhutureDAO’s role in the indexing of the crypto economy.

Part 2 coming soon.

Discussion of the Day: Quantstamp (QSP),CryptoCurrency,h9rijf,2020-06-15 19:28:41,5,0.67,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/h9rijf/discussion_of_the_day_quantstamp_qsp/,joenorwood77,TRADING,"-Today's Crypto of the Day is Quantstamp (QSP), and it's current price is $0.0225.


DUE TO SOME PERSONAL ISSUES, I AM TEMPORARILY BEHIND ON FOLLOW UP POSTS. I WILL EVENTUALLY CATCH UP AND POST MY OPINIONS ON ALL OF THEM. I AM NOT TRYING TO MAKE LOW EFFORT POSTS AND WILL DO MY BEST TO POST A NEW DISCUSSION DAILY FOR A WHILE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING. 


-Since 2/18/20, I have posted a crypto/asset of the day for discussion.  I typically begin by posting the current price, as well as the brief CoinMarketCap summary. If there is a video featuring it on Coin Bureau, I also post that. After a week or so, I usually post replies to some of the posts, and I also add an overall summary of my thoughts, if I plan to hold any, and is so how much. 

-I strongly encourage everyone to follow up on past discussions and you can still make comments on them. There is a lot of valuable information on many of these posts, so please check them out as you have time. You may learn a lot regarding some of these projects. I know I certainly did!
https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/search?q=author%3Ajoenorwood77&restrict_sr=on

-My first month or so I featured projects listed on some of the main exchanges. Now I plan to focus on the top 100 on CoinMarketCap. After that I expect to broaden to the top 200, and then some random moonshots. I will eventually create a post looking for any projects I should feature before I eventually close this project.

-Just because I feature a project does not mean I like it. I feel discussion on bad projects are just as important as the good ones. It is useful to hear pros and cons about every project, even if you are simply playing devils advocate.

-I would say a perfect reply would include at least one pro and at least one con for the project. However, I still feel it is acceptable if you post only pros or cons. If your post does not have any substance to it, ""this coin is a scam"", ""avoid this shitcoin"", ""this coin will moon to $1000 by the end of 2020"", then I will just assume you are posting for personal gain rather than helping the community.  If you simply downvote the post without any comments, the only thing you accomplish is having less people view the post. I do not care about Reddit Karma, but if a post drops to zero early on, it can be extremely difficult for people to even find these discussions (which I assume is your intention). 

-These posts are not meant to be financial advice, but instead to be an educational discussion. Everyone is responsible for doing their own research. For each project, I am interested in learning if you have any investment in it, and if so, about what percentage of your portfolio does it carry. Most importantly, what should we all know; good, bad, and indifferent, about this project? "

QSP Updates,Quantstamp,cvf0te,2019-08-25 18:08:40,10,0.82,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Quantstamp/comments/cvf0te/qsp_updates/,boomerangcapitalInc,,"Binance, the leading crypto exchange in terms of volume, has tapped Quantstamp to audit its new GBP-backed stablecoin, Binance GBP (BGBP).

This type of collaboration shows Quantstamp is held in very high esteem within the crypto community. And Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said the “Quantstamp team is thorough and efficient when it comes to ensuring the security of ERC-20 tokens.”

Quantstamp also audited smart contracts from Klaytn, a blockchain platform created by Kakao. Kakao is the creator of South Korea’s dominant messaging platform, KakaoTalk.

So Quantstamp continues to be seen as the go-to service for large crypto projects. This exposure will lead to increased use of the Quantstamp platform, which will reward QSP holders over time."

Nobody is trading my pair,UniSwap,c2uvz3,2019-06-20 07:31:18,7,1.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniSwap/comments/c2uvz3/nobody_is_trading_my_pair/,mruniswap,,"About 2 weeks ago I was the first to provide liquidity for Quantstamp (QSP - 0x99ea4db9ee77acd40b119bd1dc4e33e1c070b80d) but nobody has traded it since. As it's the #247 token by market cap, I wasn't expecting it to be shown in the default list, but I did expect at least someone with a bot to try and arbitrage it. There has been plenty of volatility, and right now 1 ETH - 9400 QSP on UniSwap, but is 10100 on Binance.  


Is there something I've done wrong, or does it just take time for trading to start?"
