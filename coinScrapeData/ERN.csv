Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis: A New Approach,scoliosis,1i945yd,2025-01-24 14:47:15,0,0.2,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/scoliosis/comments/1i945yd/adolescent_idiopathic_scoliosis_a_new_approach/,Such_Thing7698,Discussion,"This is my PERSONAL collection of information (my specific PERSONAL story) and the stories of many others.

Specifically, here I present my story.
My father has scoliosis, and so do I. If you ask my father, he will insist that I had a wonderful childhood (my sister seems to have not had one, or it was very mild).At my last X-ray (June 2023), I had a 47-degree scoliosis and a lot of pain.

In my opinion, the genetic component of idiopathic scoliosis is sensitivity—some people are more sensitive. Now, moving forward—see, the greatest injury that a parent doesn’t heal is passed down to the child. (In my case, repressed anger.) It can also come from grandparents. If our ancestors did not heal the injury, it is passed on to the next generations. These are all manifestations of untreated trauma from previous generations. A major event that happened in the past but was not recognized. Therefore, the next generations carry it. This way, they can recognize it.
I suffered from pain for a long time, but now I have no pain. It was unresolved trauma in my body.
The idea that scoliosis arises from asymmetric muscle tension was first suggested by Nicholas Andry in the 18th century, who coined the term ""Orthopaedics"" from the words ""straight"" (orthos) and ""child"" (pais) (LeVay, 1990). Andry promoted the theory of ""spasmodic muscle contraction"" as the cause of spinal deformity.
The Origin of Muscle Tension What Andry did not explain, however, was the cause of asymmetric muscle tension and how it deformed the spine. There are many potential causes of asymmetric muscle tension, including injury, sports, overuse of one side of the body, neurological disorders, congenital defects, issues with a particular organ, emotional stress, and so on. This is why scoliosis is still considered idiopathic. There are simply too many potential causes to establish reproducible statistical data. Moreover, almost every case of scoliosis is unique, and the curve never looks exactly the same because each individual has their own circumstances that manifest the imbalance.
Fascia is not an inert structural component of the body, but forms a network throughout the body that plays a role in proprioception, pain perception, and mechanically connecting muscles and transmitting forces (Wilke et al., 2018). Fascia is well innervated with mechanoreceptors and free nerve endings (Yahia et al., 1992) and is rich in contractile cells, so muscles and fascia can be considered a myofascial unit (Stecco et al., 2009). The muscles of the body are connected through fascia, forming so-called myofascial chains that extend the length and width of the body and can transmit mechanical forces of stress and tension (Wilke et al., 2016).

It is these myofascial chains that stabilize the lumbar vertebrae on the sacral base, without which the lumbar spine would be unable to bear the normal loads it is meant to carry (Willard et al., 2012). It is assumed that these chains may provide new methods for understanding the mentioned pain and justify the development of more comprehensive treatment (Langevin, 2006).
The majority of people today maintain chronic muscle tension in various parts of their bodies.
In fact, the presence of imbalanced stress, as such, is characteristic of almost everyone. Statistically, about 70% of people have some form of spinal deformity (Schwab et al., 2005). However, why do some people develop significant spinal deformity, while others do not?
What is the reasoning behind the idea that certain ""tension configurations"" cause scoliosis, while others do not?
You can think of the body as a map of contractions. If these contractions are more or less random, they will help cancel each other out, and the fascia will know how to adjust all the tensions to work in harmony. However, if some tensions are too strong or persist for a long time in a specific pattern of aligned vectors, without treatment, the result could be spinal deformation.
The fascial system has a threshold of compensatory intensity, beyond which it can function in a self-regulating manner. However, when the intensity exceeds this threshold, the fascial tissues must ""ask for help"" from both the muscular and skeletal systems.
The body perceives emotions as contractions in the fascial tissue. Different emotions are recognized by different contraction configurations.
Repressed emotions manifest as excessively tense fascia, and over time, they create chronic contraction in the affected area, corresponding to the repressed specific emotions.
As a child grows, their emotional processing is not yet fully developed. Any unresolved emotions from the child's experiences are stored in the body. When a person says they have no memories from childhood, it's not because they are stored in the mind, but because they are stored in the body, which is why there are no words for those experiences. These memories are stored without words. The extreme example of this mechanism can be seen in videos of soldiers returning from World War I, who were shell-shocked.

These memories are stored without words. The extreme example of this mechanism can be seen in videos of shell-shocked soldiers returning from World War I.
The body holds memories in fascicular tissue, in different locations depending on the type of emotion. These fascicular contractions can lead to reduced function of certain organs, eventually resulting in disease or structural tension, which can lead to scoliosis deformities.
Children who do not like themselves hold tension around their hearts. A sense of not belonging manifests as contraction in the legs. Children who feel pressure to express their emotions will develop tension in the throat, while the lack of safety at home will manifest as digestive issues. Sexual trauma and thigh contractions can also occur.
These contractions hold the memory of experiences as energy of fear, shame, anger, and more, and restrict blood flow in the organs affected by the contraction.
In young children, these contractions manifest as painful emotions and frustration, while in older age, they manifest as diseases in those organs or related structures. For example, repressed emotions related to grief contribute to the formation of a kyphotic curve. Suppressed anger leads to fascial contractions in the liver and contributes to the curvature of the thoracic spine. Repressed fears cause fascial contractions in the kidneys and contribute to the lateral tilting of the lumbar spine.
Children who grow up in high emotional stress environments and are not supported in expressing and processing those emotions will hold these feelings as fascial hypertonia related to specific emotions.

The myofibroblasts present in the fascial tissue are capable of long-term tissue contractions, which can lead to tissue remodeling (Hintz, 2013). Their growing cellular contractions are strong enough to cause about 1 cm of tissue contracture per month (Follonier Castella et al., 2010; Schleip et al., 2019). Fascial contractility can be strong and stable enough to continuously affect the spine over extended periods, ranging from several days to months (Schleip and Klinger, 2019).
The connection between emotions and physiological responses is well-documented (Damasio and Carvalho, 2013; Russell, 2003). The brain can generate sensory-motor activation patterns that can alter an individual’s state (Toivonen et al., 2012). Repressed emotions, stored as embodied memories, can manifest as excessively tense fascia and over time lead to chronic contraction associated with repressed specific emotions (Nummenmaa, 2018; Iani, 2019).


Unresolved emotions during childhood can be internalized and stored as trauma in the body (Ruchkin & Schwab-Stone, 2014). Somatization of trauma in children and adolescents is complex and can be seen in children who are generally more sensitive and suffer from emotional distress (Kealy et al., 2018; Luoni et al., 2018; Finn et al., 2018), and who are especially survivors of cancer (Erickson & Steiner, 1999). Children growing up in high emotional stress environments, who are not supported in expressing and resolving these emotions, will store them as hypertonia within the fascia. The body holds these memories as myofascial trigger points within fascicular tissue, in various locations depending on the type of emotion. These fascicular contractions can affect the normal or pathological function of tissues and organs (Langevin, 2006) or manifest as structural tension that may lead to scoliosis deformities. Anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders in childhood and adolescence, affecting nearly one-third of the adolescent population in the U.S. (Merikangas et al., 2010). Low back pain is associated with psychosocial stress (Erne & Elfering, 2011) and unexplained chest pain is linked to depression and emotional and social functioning disturbances (Eliacik et al., 2019). Anxiety and depression affect kyphosis (Moslehi et al., 2011), and psychological distress in AIS patients has been shown to play an important role in the onset of back pain (Makino et al., 2019). Statistically, girls tend to be more emotionally sensitive than boys, and therefore the greater the sensitivity and amount of stress the body must deal with (Chen et al., 2018). The concept that scoliosis arises from asymmetrical muscle tension was first suggested by Nicolas Andry in the 18th century, who coined the term “Orthopaedics” from the words “straight” (orthos) and “child” (pais) (LeVay, 1990). Andry promoted the theory of “spasmodic muscle contraction” as the cause of spinal deformity. He said, “It should be noted that the curvature of the spine does not always arise from a disorder of the spine itself but is sometimes caused by the excessive shortening of the muscles of the body’s first part, causing the spine to become curved, just as a bow becomes more curved by tightening the string.” Andry used rest, traction, postural approaches, and padded corsets in the treatment of scoliosis. The origin of muscle tension! However, what Andry did not explain was the cause of asymmetrical muscle tension and how it deformed the spine. There are many potential causes of asymmetrical muscle tension, including injury, sports, overuse of one side of the body, neurological disorders, congenital defects, issues with specific organs, emotional stress, and more. This is why scoliosis is still considered idiopathic. There are simply too many potential causes to establish reproducible patterns for statistical data. Moreover, nearly every case of scoliosis is unique, and the curve never looks exactly the same, as each individual has their own circumstances that express the imbalance. In the last two to three decades, an interesting development has been the resurgence of interest in the importance of the connective tissue network, known as fascia, in muscular-skeletal development (Stecco & Schleip, 2016; Adstrum et al., 2017; Stecco et al., 2018), and its role in chronic stress (Schmitter et al., 2010). Fascia is not an inert structural component of the body, but rather forms a network throughout the body, playing a role in proprioception, pain perception, and mechanically connecting muscles and transmitting forces (Wilke et al., 2018). Fascia is well innervated by mechanoreceptors and free nerve endings (Yahia et al., 1992) and is rich in contractile cells so that muscles and fascia can be considered as a myofascial unit (Stecco et al., 2009). The muscles of the body are connected via fascia, forming so-called myofascial chains that extend the body’s length and width and can transmit mechanical forces of stress and tension (Wilke et al., 2016). These myofascial chains stabilize the lumbar vertebrae on the sacral base, without which the lumbar spine would not be able to carry the normal loads it should bear (Willard et al., 2012). It is believed that these chains can provide new methods for understanding the aforementioned pain and justify the development of more comprehensive treatments (Langevin, 2006). Most people nowadays retain chronic muscle tension in parts of their bodies. For example, it is estimated that 16% of the European population suffers from migraines (Olesen et al., 2009). It has been proposed that migraine attacks originate in myofascial trigger points, which are hyperirritable areas that develop in the skeletal muscles (Do et al., 2018). In fact, the presence of imbalanced stress, as such, is characteristic of almost everyone. Statistically, about 70% of people have some form of spinal deformity (Schwab et al., 2005). However, why do some people develop significant spinal deformity while others do not? The myofibroblasts present in the fascial tissue are capable of long-term tissue contractions that can cause tissue remodeling (Hintz, 2013). Their increasing cellular contractions are strong enough to induce approximately 1 cm of tissue contracture per month (Follonier Castella et al., 2010; Schleip et al., 2019). Fascial contractility can be strong and sustained enough to continuously affect the spine over long periods, from several days to months (Schleip & Klinger, 2019). The connection between emotions and physiological responses is well-documented (Damasio & Carvalho, 2013; Russell, 2003). The brain can generate sensory-motor activation patterns that can alter an individual’s state (Toivonen et al., 2012). Suppressed emotions, stored as embodied memories, may manifest as excessively tense fascia and over time cause chronic contractions related to specific suppressed emotions (Nummenmaa, 2018; Iani, 2019). It is suggested that these activation patterns, which work through the fascia, generate long-term muscle tension. When they spread into a specific configuration and intensity, the spine may alter its orientation, and scoliosis develops. This is especially important during emotional stress and growth periods, such as adolescence. (Iani, 2019). The proposed activation patterns that work through the fascia lead to prolonged muscle tension. When they spread into a particular configuration and intensity, the spine can change its alignment, and scoliosis develops. This is particularly significant during emotional stress and periods of rapid growth, as happens in adolescence. Random configuration of fascial tension, which does not lead to scoliosis (A) versus a contraction configuration that leads to scoliosis (B)
Fascia irritation can lead to a variety of local and global responses, such as connective tissue remodeling, inflammation, nervous system sensitization, which eventually follows with the organism’s adaptive response (Langevin & Sherman, 2007). Under certain dysfunctional conditions, the neuro-fascial interaction may be responsible for the “memory” of local tissue or peripheral sensitization, which follows with appropriate structural change (Tozzi, 2014).
Unresolved emotions in childhood can be internalized and stored as trauma in the body (Ruchkin & Schwab-Stone, 2014). Somatization of trauma in children and adolescents is complex and can be seen in children who generally suffer from emotional turmoil (Kealy et al., 2018; Luoni et al., 2018; Finn et al., 2018), and who are survivors of cancer (Erickson & Steiner, 1999). Children growing up in environments with high emotional stress and who are not supported in expressing and resolving those emotions will store these emotions as hypertonia within the fascia. The body holds these memories as myofascial trigger points within fascicular tissue, in different places depending on the type of emotion. These fascicular contractions can affect the normal or pathological function of tissues and organs (Langevin, 2006) or manifest as structural tension that may lead to scoliosis deformities (Whyte Ferguson, 2014). Anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders in childhood and adolescence. They affect nearly one-third of the adolescent population in the United States (Merikangas et al., 2010). Low back pain is associated with psychosocial stress (Erne & Elfering, 2011) and unexplained chest pain with depression and emotional and social dysfunction (Eliacik et al., 2019). Anxiety and depression affect kyphosis (Moslehi et al., 2011), and psychological distress in AIS patients has been shown to play an important role in the onset of back pain (Makino et al., 2019). Girls are statistically more emotionally sensitive than boys, and therefore the greater the sensitivity and the amount of stress the body has to deal with (Chen et al., 2018). The primary age of scoliosis onset is between 10-15 years, which occurs equally in both sexes. However, females are eight times more likely to progress to a curve size that requires treatment (Raggio, 2006; National Scoliosis Foundation, 2020). The explanation for this is that the female spine grows more than the male spine between the ages of 9-13 years (Taylor & Twomey, 1984). During the growing period before maturity, the transverse diameter of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae grows more in males than in females, and this horizontal growth is accompanied by an increase in muscle mass and strength that occurs during male sexual maturation (Feik & Story, 1983; Twomey et al., 1983). Therefore, the female spine tends to be longer and thinner, especially in the early stages. Hence, it is more likely to deform as AIS is characterized by a smaller vertebral cross-section and higher intervertebral disc height in females (Schultz & Cisewski, 1978; Ponrartana et al., 2016). The explanation for the prevalence of severe scoliosis in girls is that they enter the adolescent growth spurt with inadequate postural mechanisms.

In the next section of the article, I will discuss how to treat adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The theory proposed here is based on the idea that scoliosis is misunderstood and misclassified in Western medicine. The critical impact of fascia on spinal support and shape, as well as the influence of emotions and physical exercise on muscles (Pleuss et al., 2009) and fascia (Bordoni and Marelli, 2017), suggest that AIS is not an orthopedic issue per but rather has psychological and environmental origins. Therefore, it is important to understand that the development of AIS takes time, and correcting it will require time and effort. The earlier it is detected, the greater the chances of reversing it.

(These are the shadows of the penners's own tormented thoughts, his private scrawls, and nothing beyond. Therefore, if the reader should find these passages to be disjointed, let him not despair. All in this world lacks any true coherence…
In the end, even if you perceive yourself as possessed of perfect lucidity, it does not diminish the likelihood that, at any moment, without the slightest warning, you shall be stripped of reason, and not even recognize the fact…
We are all touched by madness, and no soul exists in perfect health. Sanity is but a phantom of the human mind.)

Having awoken one day from a sleep that was most unwholesome, feeling only a surge of relentless, cruel chill, and with a profound aversion to all action—still caught betwixt slumber and wakefulness—I did cast my gaze through the window, to observe the environs of this day's Wallsport, a place which possessed naught of distinction, save its close proximity to some village. And that day was not, it seemed, a herald of events of striking brilliance, nor of joyous celebration; for there was only a fetid and overcast sky. And all about were structures veiled in a fog of such density that nothing could be disc erned from the earth below, and I myself am situated on that uppermost level—or, rather, within that chamber, the fourth of its kind—if my memory does not betray me. Gray and nigh-black clouds did weave about, drawing a pattern as of some braid, in which was caught the gray tresses of a relentlessly hideous and abhorrent monstrosity—a semblance of humanity only partly perceived by my senses. As if some ghastly phantom, it did stir within my mind, denying even slumber, which now more closely resembles a plunge into the very abyss of forgetfulness. And that sensation itself, was most distressing; I dreaded to close my eyes, and shuddered at the slightest resistance from my orbs, as if some unseen hand did, involuntarily, touch my thin, bony shoulder, bringing forth a wave of sickness that did long endure. And even now, it seems so near. And I am tormented by thoughts… I feel as if I am bound by another's will, and now, I desire—I desire with a terrible longing, to journey to the station, for a moment haunts my soul in which I cast myself toward the rails, and feel myself crushed between the platform and the train—should such a fate befall me. I perceive already, the agony of shattered bone, of crushed entrails, of torn sinews… worse than any viscera dangling from a carcass… and I am seized by a terrible urge to grasp my brushes and my paints, for I am unwilling to sacrifice this precious life. For it is not fitting to barter such worth for so trivial an end; unless to render it within the bounds of a painting. The torment within my head, does fill even me, its possessor, with a most dreadful amazement… and terror…
These phantasmal thoughts do, at times, surge into my mind from some unseen origin, disrupting my accustomed affairs—be they of domestic duty, labor, or study. They have ever been my unwelcome companions, and I understand fully that the very content of my contemplations is not of the norm; yet, my reason appears as my foe, ever seeking to wage war upon my cold nature, and craving that surge—that surge of dangerous impetuosity—that threatens to imprison my soul within the fetid confines of some asylum for the deranged, which I now fear as I fear the very fires of the inferno. How am I to avoid plummeting into that lowest abyss…?
Nonetheless, even within those surges of madness that were wrought by my thoughts, I could, with great effort, maintain a semblance of composure; and such was the case upon this day. Having turned, involuntarily, from the window, still observing as the clouds did smother all before me, I could not find any peace within my thoughts; but with a dismissive gesture, I did then venture into the kitchen. My repast differed naught from the commonplace; a simple omelet with a cup of coffee, and no more; and my appetite did not penetrate that door, which was secured against my very will. Therefore, I did not consume it with the ravenous hunger that would have possessed a man who had languished for days during the Great Depression (1929-1939), one who had recently lost his employment, and squandered all of his accumulated income, upon the provision of his own children. Thoughts whirled within my skull, like an unending vortex, and my reason became unmoored; my hands trembled in the attempt to focus upon a single point—yet, all endeavors were to no avail. Consumed by a most extraordinary disquiet, I did abandon my repast halfway through, leaving what remained upon the plate, not placing the dishes in the sink; and I did not again return to that place. My senses were now overwhelmed; my vision did grow dim, as I removed my chemise, and donned a brown checkered suit, of somewhat more presentable form, and did observe myself in the glass. To where was I bound, in such attire?... an expedition, of most particular importance, did await, together with my companions, and to arrive late would be most inexcusable; thus, I had risen early to prepare. Yet there was naught of reaction to my form upon my countenance; before me appeared but a face, that was pale as death itself, emaciated almost to the very bone, riddled with veins (most especially upon my temples). My form resembled a living skeleton—though why this be, I know not. The bags beneath my eyes were turning to that blackest of shades, which had once inspired terror, but now, I held them in a profound indifference, for I had often seen the faces of others, amazed by my appearance, and uttering words that spoke of my likeness to a corpse. And in some manner, I am inclined to agree with them.
The thing I felt... a wild stench from the smoke from the enterprises, from which I felt like a passive smoker, standing next to heavy smokers, and inhaling this smoke, which disappeared with each of my breaths. My lungs seemed to refuse to fill with such air, and with such an aroma, which is why I had to cough several times in moments.
“Oh, God of mercy…,"" did a discordant bell peal within the confines of my skull, as I was brought to a standstill by such unexpectedness—""...what if…? What if we are destined for utter failure…? Yes… the semblance of this environment, is a mere deception… they harbor another design, most assuredly. Perhaps… they are all in league with one another… a conspiracy in which I am but an unwitting pawn, knowing naught of its true purpose. Can it be… that they converse in some language utterly alien…? No…that is not possible. Ha-ha…it may be that I do not comprehend, but…they shall conceal nothing from my sight. M-hm… they will conceal nothing…”.
As that last word was framed in my mind, I was at the very threshold, when the following thought did flood back, and it was not a thought that I did welcome:
“Oh… could it be that I have forgotten something…? Nay… I could have forgotten nothing, for my gaze was watchful. Ah, yes… the keys! Surely, I could not have left them within that lock…! What if, even now, some intruder has penetrated my abode…? Oh heavens…! Oh, heavens, that must not come to pass by any means…!”.
In the throes of an incomprehensible fit, did I lose all comprehension of the present moment; but that was but a fleeting shadow, for as my body did stir beneath the force of a howling wind—which did seem to take on the very nature of a tempest—I awoke, yet, only opened my eyes, and could not feel, nor perceive, the presence of my own form. That invisible force did drag me back into the hall, no matter how I struggled with all that remained of my reason, and I felt as if I were imprisoned. But then, did I release myself, and regaining control of my flesh, found myself at the door of my chamber. There was no key within that lock; therefore, did I begin to rifle through my bag—which I had seized before my departure—and threw it over my shoulder, casting furtive glances at the yellowish, festering walls, adorned with dark colors that did resemble stains and blots that were dissolving everywhere—a sight that I did find most abhorrent. Then did I glance at the floor, which was covered by dark brown canvas, and I felt the cold touch of what I knew was metal, and I was quick to extract it; and it was—the key. Oh…the relief was so immense that my deep sigh did seem as a great river, and it was as loud as the death rattle of a dying man. And it was then that I did fall silent and begin to gaze all around me. Not a soul…none had noticed…none were casting those suspicious glances. None would perceive the shadows of my thoughts. A reprieve, for a second.
Nevertheless, returning to a semblance of myself, I made for the stairs, old, and yet, not bereft of their former appearance, if one did not perceive the peeling paint. With every single step I took, it did seem as though my heart was about to burst from my very breast, and my breath was seized—I was forced to stop, and pause, repeatedly. The ascent was not so great in length; but it appeared to me to be endless, and it did twist like a spiral before my very eyes. And after I had gathered myself, I once more stood before that door to the entrance, and, as I glanced, observing the hue (which now approached that of burgundy, but it was, in truth, brown, for the paint was peeling and falling upon the stone below), did I rush away, whilst glancing back—fearful that I should forget the path. A coincidence it was, and unexpected, that we were, with our group, bound for the station, and naught else, save to meet with them first; and a tremor did seize me, and my hands shook. And while I could proclaim that I was given to fits of unexpected agitation, to me, such things were mundane e, as was all else. I did never desire to take anything sinister to heart, for I had come to believe, that the shadows were not eternal. Then I traversed the crowds. The streets were possessed of both noise and a great inflexibility in their sound; merchants cried out, from some unknown source; the stalls did tremble in the gusts of the wind; and from some distance, I could discern: “Buy my bread! I have baked it myself!”. There was even one who did hawk tobacco. But one sensation, I could not deny—the wild stench from the smoke of the manufactories, and I felt like a passive smoker—standing next to one who did partake in such practice with great zeal, inhaling that smoke, which did depart with my each breath. My lungs did refuse to fill with such air, and with such a scent, which forced me to cough, repeatedly, in a short period of time. 
And there was one square, which remained the sole exception in Wallsport, bereft of name, its marker but a crude circle, and naught beyond, that was distinguished by its arcane embellishment. Stones of varied hues and shapes, arranged with meticulous precision into an ancient mosaic—encircled by a ring of gray bricks—did glimmer as if possessed by some inner fire. And, it would seem, they composed a scene of a subject so shrouded in mystery that no mortal mind could unravel it: a man struck through the heart by a spear, wielded by a shadow, wrought of ebony stones, while at that very point of violent entry—and from which the weapon did emerge—a grim monument rose, crafted of bronze, depicting some monstrous entity with clocks, hung upon chain s, in its left hand—which far exceeded in size the breadth of its palm—nay, perhaps, even its entire limb. Encompassing this mosaic and the looming monument was naught but a barren expanse; no dwellings, no taverns, no inns, and no trifling adornments did appear—only this desolate space, that did disrupt the perimeter with three diverging paths. Rarely did any carriage traverse this square; to behold one seemed a feat most improbable, and when they did present themselves to the eye, they appeared but abominable visions, vanishing as swiftly as they came, when some unfortunate soul, broken by a torrent of rising dread, did turn abruptly. And that feeling was most vile, as it surged through me, accompanied by a frosty draft—or so it seemed—that left me shivering from head to heel. From such turnings, I was oft seized by a burning sensation—most peculiar—yet, with a quality that was painful, yet, not agonizing.
Still, I did cast my gaze upon it for a while— and, it would seem, admired those empty surroundings—embracing that long awaited silence, and then did turn towards the right, directly to that path which presented itself first to mine eyes. Thereupon, a few paces hence, the aspect of the streets changed, and the discordant clamor did re-establish itself, for the station was but a few miles distant, and as for the ticket—no worry was there to be had, for all was arranged, since, at the behest of my superiors, my colleagues and I were upon this “journey of affairs,” to employ the local vernacular. I then recalled, that until now, I had never traversed such quarters… had never been… or, perchance, had been. Nay…I had been! A treachery of my own memory! And then did I emit what seemed a most profound sigh, and I once more perceived that river—a winding stream that flowed, not in a long thread, but in a spiraling descent. My steps did echo in my ears, amidst this din, and were, it did seem, far more resounding than the din itself; yet, well it was, that they did not deafen me—a blessing that I would not lose my hearing. And I did notice none, but went upon my path, which seemed at times, but a narrow tunnel; and naught else did I see beyond that, for all around me did blur, as if it were the vision of one who was sightless, who beheld a world that was far apart from this. Alas, I have not the slightest knowledge of how long I went, when I did finally arrive at the station, and survey all thereat. 
Through the putrid walls of that station, water did seem to seep, drop by agonizing drop, moistening the cement that did bind together a myriad of dark, earthy bricks—which appeared to be, at any moment, upon the precipice of collapse, ready to fall upon me. Such was my perception. The gates were so frail, that their very fastenings did struggle to maintain their hold; the sable paint—alas—did not appear truly black, but rather did blend to the hue of tarnished copper, though…the color did change from time to time. To the right of the gate, upon a massive hook, hung an enormous bell, already about to shatter the failing metal beneath its mass, and when a guard did approach (though, he remained invisible), a chilling sound did erupt, and that nearly deafened me. It was unlike the sound of my footsteps.
Soon, with a creak that was like a needle in my ear, did the gates open, and I did proceed with a slow pace to the square. After presenting my tickets and the papers, I would have rushed directly to the platform, but my intentions were stayed by a hand that did abruptly seize my shoulder.
“Intentionally…,” I did declare, “did you touch me…?”
“Why, brother,” there followed a voice, that was most familiar, “you did not seem thus yesterday. Do you not recognize me?”
Those words were sufficient to make me turn to their speaker, and how great was my astonishment to perceive, before me, my four colleagues—I had thought they would not arrive at the same t ime. It was strange that I had entertained the thought, that something might not proceed as was intended, or that I did not perceive—had not perceived—that such a thing might occur.
“Neil…,” I did murmur in shame, lowering my head, “you, my companions, must forgive my folly…”
“What devil makes you seek forgiveness?!” Greg, who stood beside Neil, did exclaim, as he adjusted his flaxen rags, “You are likely weary from yesterday; thus, you do grow foolish in your delirium!”
“What am I raving of…?”
“Well…” Neil did interject, “trouble not yourself. He does exaggerate. Let us proceed…”
My gaze did become rigid (according to the feelings that did possess me), as Neil did pat me twice upon my shoulder, and then did we march towards the platform; and once we had left the door behind, there were visible only two deep pits at the perimeter. How should I tread, so as not to fall into them; and I desired—I desired to see that image that was present to my sight as I awoke in the morning. I desired to… no—that is not to be. In no way, should such a thing come to pass. Oh, heavens… what is this… Is it truly I… ? No…
One fleeting instant, and I was everywhere, and nowhere. Everywhere, yet, nowhere. In a chasm such as no mortal had ever witnessed, nor ever endured. All did dissolve before me, and gradually, a darkness did take hold before my gaze, and so did blacken my vision. My body no longer obeyed my will, and, it did seem that I was in some state that lay beyond understanding. That force did drag me again into some place—but this time, it was into the void. From afar, or, perchance, close by, I could hear only the frenzied cries of those who passed, while some did beg for help in an attempt to escape that unknown place; yet, I was devoid of any perception of their plight. Neil and Greg—their cries did reach my ears, but I did not comprehend, for the sounds were as blurred as an echo, and I could perceive only the beating of my own heart, and the sound of convulsive inhalations. Naught could I hear beyond those sounds, and those very sounds did deafen all else. Then, suddenly… silence—a deathly silence. A void of sound, and nothing more. Darkness, …and nothing more.
And, in the passing of some moments, it did become clear that it would not retreat…never. Despair was born within my very chest. It was as if all of my plans were being destroyed in this chasm. And an even greater despair did seize me, as I reopened my eyes. There was naught around me, except soft walls, stitched in a large pattern of squares; and hearing did return, though I could not understand what had befallen me.
“Hold…on…,” a low, lisping voice did suddenly echo from some distance, “what, precisely, is the matter?”
“Likely, he did push a man,” another responded, “...and the man was crushed betwixt that platform and the onrushing train…”
“So…how?! How did he have the will to commit such an act?!”
“Let us delve into his very skull and learn…”

(P.s. This is purely the work of my own fantasy, so everything I had penned here is not real. Though I may be a beginner in writing and telling stories I do still practice and improve my skills) "
"Frustrated because my crochet always ends up way bigger than the pattern reads, even though I feel like I’m using OK tension.",CrochetHelp,1huq07c,2025-01-05 22:46:48,90,0.99,42,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1huq07c,mmmzane,Wearable help,"I’m definitely a beginner (started a few months ago) and crocheted a blanket for Christmas using hdc. The width of the blanket ended up being wider than I intended, but I wasn’t using the exact yarn of the pattern, and I was probably crocheting a bit loose.

I’m now making a vest with granny stitch (first time on this stitch) and I feel like I’m crocheting OK. The pattern came with this yarn & hook size, and I thought I was ok when I did a tension swatch.

I’m a smaller person, so I intended on making the smallest size, but now that I’m a few rows in I just realized I’m making almost the largest size :(

I used the correct number of stitches (I think) and I’m crocheting as uniformly/tightly as I can without it being messy. 

Does this look super loose to you? Any advice? 

The sizing wasn’t a big deal with a blanket but with a piece of clothing I’m disappointed :( I don’t really want to frog but I’m frustrated. I also don’t know if I can really make it that much tighter with my skills right now. Anyone been here?"

Ern's Blog: [https://earlyretirementnow.com/options/](https://earlyretirementnow.com/options/)

First of all, I know my spreadsheet is ugly, but its the best I have. All data was retrieved from CBOE, and YF. I do understand BSM model, though I was too lazy to make the formulas, so if they are wrong blame Chat GPT. Pls make a copy if you want to change stuff. If you share your updated spreadsheet in the comments, I am open to changing the main one, to include other data.

Okay. Now - what is the strategy being backtested? This is from ERN (who was a great blog on his strategy that is pretty simple) who details consistently selling 1DTE <5 delta puts on SPX for income (on top of his underlying growth portfolio). As a note, he has switched to a more conservative approach and looks at VIX when choosing strike, but I am too lazy. Feel free to make one and share it.

Full disclaimer here - the actual options data is calculated based on BSM model. The strikes might not have really existed and the premiums might have differed. 1DTE options did not exist in 1990, so that would be unfeasible. Dates are missing, but you can fill them in if you like - (top is Nov 11, and the further down, the older). On that note, lets dive in to the spreadsheet and see what it tells us.

Go to Sheet 1, and you see a bunch of numbers. Most of it is self-explanatory. Strike is calculated (by ChatGPT) formulas at 5 delta, and put premium as well with VIX as IV. The long decimals on the right are a running total of returns starting al the way from 1990. As we can see, had we been running this strategy, we actually would have lost about half of our initial capital. Why is this - I thought theta is edge? (First of all - theta is not an edge, your edge selling options is IV > RV mitigating gamma's effect versus theta. Also, this strategy is not completely theta driven, and had this been done with calls, results would have likely been significantly worse due to betting against the market w/ - delta exposure). If you look on CBOE options chain - you will see that implied volatility is not consistent through strikes - extremes almost always have greater IV (in equities). If you are wondering why - BSM assumes perfectly standard distribution, but tail risk is exaggerated for many reasons.

So clearly we can't take IV to be just VIX, but what can we do? Looking at some of the past couple of days (make sure to check during trading hours, bid is very low ), we can see that the IV is anywhere from 10-30% higher than VIX at the 5 delta level. What I next implemented was the same thing where black-scholes is calculated, but introducing skew to the IV, marking it up by 5-10% respectively (this is conservative IMO, and you can edit it and share your results). W/ just a 5% increase (not additive, but multiplicative eg. 14% --> 14.7%) in volatility our -50% returns jump up to -20%. Still losing, but definetely better. Here is where the true gold in this strategy lies - with 10% skew. Still not very significant - about 2 points on the vix. We go from -50% to +50% in a 30 year time frame - 1.3% CAGR. Now to some of you, this return is very unattractive, but I want you to keep two things in mind. First of all, implementing this does not actually require the use of any money, rather BP reserved by your broker (you kind of need PM for this strategy) meaning alpha on your investments, as well as an additional way to gain delta exposure.

But for those still not appeased with this strategy, do not worry. We have a trick up our sleeves to boost returns AND dampen volatility. When we look at where our losses and gains usually come from in terms of VIX levels, generally lower VIX leads to higher EV, especially VIX < 25 with anywhere from 1.5 - 2x the average EV of all VIX levels. At first, some of you thetagangers might be surprised by this finding, with the common practice of selling options on tickers with on ridiculously high IV (MSTR, TSLA). However though, this makes sense for two reasons. First of all, when VIX is high, it generally indicates a bearish or somewhat bearish sentiment of the market, meaning our puts positive delta exposure is working against us. Additionally, according to a study done by [](https://www.reddit.com/user/AlphaGiveth/), higher IVR percentile usually means that IV does not exceed RV by as much. Personally, I do not understand this finding, and it might not persist in the future, but I think it has something to do with the fact that there is less demand with high VIX, because on the surface - options seem more expensive.

Anyways - back to the way to boost our returns. From our findings, it seems that perhaps selling exclusively in low(er) VIX environments could be more profitable. Move to the leverage sheet, and I have implemented a running total for VIX < 30, and 25. Despite taking fewer total trades (I don't know the exact number - feel free to tell me) In both cases, we ended w/ greater end amounts - 116% or 103% returns. Despite the lower CAGR, tbh, I prefer the 103% return because it presents less volatility.

Now, everybody's favorite - Leverage. I'm not going to go much into detail here, because the results heavily depend on your assumptions. W/ PM, your broker should offer you anywhere from 5-11x leverage. I do not reccomend going all in to this strategy, and I encourage adding some uncorrelated/negatively correlated assets as insurance in sudden dips. However, w/ 4x leverage trading only when VIX < 25, we would have 16x our money, matching SPX's return over the time period while less volatility, and \~1.6x less max draw down. (Not entirely sure how to calculate Sharpe or Sortino off of this data, please let me know how to do this and annualize it). However, this strategy is actually incredibly ""safe"" - leverage wise. We can ""safely"" (take this with a grain of salt, but I consider safe in this definition to mean maintaining optimal returns) lever this up to 30x, to over 500,000x our money. Of course your broker will not allow it, and the past is by no means a guarantee of the future, but the chance of this strategy going to 0 is small assuming proper risk management. Even just blindly selling, we can ""safely"" lever up to 7 times, though at that point you're just underperforming for added risk.

Closing Note:  
Some of the information I learned through this project was quite surprising, and I honestly did not expect such great performance with only 10% skew.  
I do want to acknowledge that I could have done a lot more with proccessing and creating information, but my knowledge of spreadsheets, and some of these concepts is limited. Please feel free to make edits and add points that you think are helpful (different delta, DTE, sharpe, sortino, margin calls, skew%, etc.)

TLDR; selling high IVR does not equal profit. Volatility Skew carries in extreme delta environments. Braindead selling < Informed selling

Anyways - back to the way to boost our returns. From our findings, it seems that perhaps selling exclusively in low(er) VIX environments could be more profitable. Move to the leverage sheet, and I have implemented a running total for VIX < 30, and 25. Despite taking fewer total trades (I don't know the exact number - feel free to tell me) In both cases, we ended w/ greater end amounts - 116% or 103% returns. Despite the lower CAGR, tbh, I prefer the 103% return because it presents less volatility.

Now, everybody's favorite - Leverage. I'm not going to go much into detail here, because the results heavily depend on your assumptions. W/ PM, your broker should offer you anywhere from 5-11x leverage. I do not reccomend going all in to this strategy, and I encourage adding some uncorrelated/negatively correlated assets as insurance in sudden dips. However, w/ 4x leverage trading only when VIX < 25, we would have 16x our money, matching SPX's return over the time period while less volatility, and \~1.6x less max draw down. (Not entirely sure how to calculate Sharpe or Sortino off of this data, please let me know how to do this and annualize it). However, this strategy is actually incredibly ""safe"" - leverage wise. We can  ""safely"" (take this with a grain of salt, but I consider safe in this definition to mean maintaining optimal returns) lever this up to 30x, to over 500,000x our money. Of course your broker will not allow it, and the past is by no means a guarantee of the future, but the chance of this strategy going to 0 is small assuming proper risk management. Even just blindly selling, we can ""safely"" lever up to 7 times, though at that point you're just underperforming for added risk.

Closing Note:  
Some of the information I learned through this project was quite surprising, and I honestly did not expect such great performance with only 10% skew.  
I do want to acknowledge that I could have done a lot more with proccessing and creating information, but my knowledge of spreadsheets, and some of these concepts is limited. Please feel free to make edits and add points that you think are helpful (different delta, DTE, sharpe, sortino, margin calls, skew%, etc.)

TLDR; selling high IVR does not equal profit. Volatility Skew carries in extreme delta environments. Braindead selling < Informed selling"

Unmasking MrBeast’s Crypto Web: Insider Trading and Token Manipulation,DuaCrypto,1gfyys9,2024-10-30 18:17:49,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DuaCrypto/comments/1gfyys9/unmasking_mrbeasts_crypto_web_insider_trading_and/,duacrypto,"Trust, but verify","# 

https://preview.redd.it/o5i6ztlixyxd1.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee0bc477ad3e6f32cd938db060c507da78c0b042

MrBeast, one of YouTube’s biggest sensations, has built a digital empire with over 320 million subscribers across his channels. Known for his elaborate challenges, philanthropic stunts, and viral content, he has garnered immense fame. However, recent allegations have cast a shadow over his seemingly pristine reputation, with concerns about cryptocurrency manipulation, questionable lotteries, and misleading video content coming to light.



A deeper investigation has now emerged, spearheaded by a team of researchers, revealing a complex web of cryptocurrency wallets tied to MrBeast. The findings expose a long-standing history of insider trading, influencing token prices, and using his massive online platform to push tokens — only to later offload them on unsuspecting investors.

# The Secret Wallets of MrBeast

Through meticulous on-chain analysis, researchers have identified over 50 cryptocurrency wallets associated with MrBeast. The most prominent wallet, identified as 0x9e67D018488aD636B538e4158E9e7577F2ECac12, is his primary wallet, from which many secondary wallets branch off. In fact, on several occasions, MrBeast himself has disclosed his involvement in NFTs, such as CryptoPunks, aligning with purchases observed on-chain.

One notable wallet, **0x3640f50C46632E03F2677f85Ec0372a8Dd70b8f4**, holds significant interactions with other wallets, including funding from the Binance exchange, where MrBeast has conducted transfers totaling more than $13 million. The evidence shows a clear pattern of inflows and outflows between these wallets, often using shared deposit addresses on exchanges like Gemini.

# The Gemini Connection

A key aspect linking these wallets to MrBeast is the shared **Gemini deposit address 0xD62**, which appears across multiple wallets. Many of the wallets connected to this deposit address show heavy inflows and outflows to MrBeast’s known wallets. This activity strongly suggests coordinated efforts to move large sums of cryptocurrency across different platforms, further indicating that these wallets are under his control.

# Case Study: SuperVerse

One of the most significant projects associated with MrBeast is **SuperVerse** (formerly **SuperFarm**). Promoted heavily by influencers like KSI, LazarBeam, and MrBeast himself, SuperVerse was marketed as a revolutionary NFT marketplace. However, the reality painted by on-chain data tells a different story.

Early investors were drawn to the SuperVerse token ($SUPER), which saw a meteoric rise from $0.02 to $1 per token, promising massive gains. However, legal loopholes allowed early public investors to be refunded, while insiders, including MrBeast, walked away with substantial profits. MrBeast’s primary wallet received an initial allocation of 1 million $SUPER tokens, later distributing and farming these tokens through secondary wallets like **0x4f7B657a** and **0x2c071Af9**, netting a profit of over **$7.5 million**.

# More Token Manipulation

This pattern isn’t limited to SuperVerse. Other projects that MrBeast has backed — such as **Ethernity Chain (ERN)**, **AIOZ**, and **Refinable (FINE)** — show similar insider activity.

In the case of **Ethernity Chain**, MrBeast was allocated a large number of pre-sale tokens, which he quickly offloaded for a combined profit of **$4.6 million**. Similarly, his involvement with **AIOZ**, a token marketing itself as a solution for Web3 AI and streaming, saw MrBeast extract over **$1 million** in profits by selling his token allocations in a series of 225 transactions.

In another instance, MrBeast received significant token allocations from **Refinable**, a project aiming to create a leading NFT marketplace. Despite publicly backing the project, on-chain data reveals that he dumped his tokens shortly after launch, profiting **$193,926** in the process.

# The Bigger Picture: Using Fame for Profit

The research into MrBeast’s crypto dealings paints a troubling picture. It appears that MrBeast, leveraging his immense online presence and influence, has been able to participate in crypto projects early, push them to his audience, and then quietly sell off his positions, leaving regular investors to face the fallout. His involvement in these projects often goes beyond casual endorsement, suggesting a deeper level of strategic financial gain.

# Conclusion

As MrBeast continues to rise in fame and influence, the revelations of his cryptocurrency dealings expose the darker side of influencer-backed investments. While MrBeast may be beloved by his fans for his charitable contributions and entertaining content, these findings raise significant questions about the ethics of using one’s platform to promote and profit from volatile, unregulated financial assets.

The cryptocurrency world is fraught with risks, and MrBeast’s actions are a stark reminder that even the most trusted figures in entertainment can be involved in questionable financial practices.

**Disclaimer**: This investigation was conducted based on available on-chain data and public records. Further developments and responses from MrBeast or his team may clarify or refute some of these findings. As always, due diligence is advised when investing in cryptocurrency projects.

On the shape of Arda,lotr,1gbczwr,2024-10-24 16:48:37,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/1gbczwr/on_the_shape_of_arda/,Awesome_Lard,Lore,"In [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/1gax2m5/is_that_really_globe_of_world_with_middleearth/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) from u/[Far\_Marionberry\_9478](https://www.reddit.com/user/Far_Marionberry_9478/) there seemed to have been some confusion about where that map came from and if it was canon. So to clarify, there are two maps of first age Arda from The Shaping of Middle Earth (that Christopher lables ""Map IV"" and ""Map V"") and a description from Tolkien on how the world changed from one to the other. Both of these maps depict a flat world.

The following comes from The Shaping of Middle Earth, Section V, The Ambarkanta:

""Then the Valar removed into the West and forsook the island; and upon the highland at the western side of the West Sea they piled great mountains, and behind them made the land of Valinor. But the mountains of Valinor curve backward, and Valinor is broadest in the middle of Earth, where the mountains march beside the sea; and at the north and south the mountains come even to the chasm. There are those two regions of the Western Land which are not of Middle-earth and are yet outside the mountains: they are dark and empty. That to the North is Eruman, and that to the South is Arvalin; and there is only a narrow strait between them and the corners of the Middle-earth, but these straits are filled with ice. For their further protection the Valar thrust away Middle-earth at the centre and crowded it eastward, so that it was bended, and the great sea of the West is very wide in the middle, the widest of all waters of the Earth. The shape of the Earth in the East was much like that in the West, save for the narrowing of the Eastern Sea, and the thrusting of the land thither. And beyond the Eastern Sea lies the East- ern Land, of which we know little, and call it the Land of the Sun; and it has mountains, less great than those of Valinor, yet very great, which are the Walls of the Sun. By reason of the falling of the land these mountains cannot be descried, save by highflying birds, across the seas which di- vide them from the shores of Middle-earth. And the thrusting aside of the land caused also mountains to appear in four ranges, two in the Northland, and two in the Southland; and those in the North were the Blue Mountains in the West side, and the Red Mountains in the East side; and in the South were the Grey Mountains and the Yellow. But Melko fortified the North and built there the Northern Towers, which are also called the Iron Moun- tains, and they look southward. And in the middle land there were the Mountains of the Wind, for a wind blew strongly there coming from the East before the Sun; and Hildorien the land where Men first awoke lay between these mountains and the Eastern Sea. But Kuivienen where Orome found the Elves is to the North beside the waters of Helkar. But the symmetry of the ancient Earth was changed and broken in the first Battle of the Gods, when Valinor went out against Utumno, which was Melko's stronghold, and Melko was chained. Then the sea of Helkar (which was the northern lamp) became an inland sea or great lake, but the sea of Ringil (which was the southern lamp) became a great sea flowing north-eastward and joining by straits both the Western and Eastern Seas. And the Earth was again broken in the second battle, when Melko was again overthrown, and it has changed ever in the wearing and passing of many ages."""
