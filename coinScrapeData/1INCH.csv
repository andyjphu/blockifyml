my break up story time ‚òïÔ∏è,BreakUp,1i98vvy,2025-01-24 18:12:14,6,0.87,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUp/comments/1i98vvy/my_break_up_story_time/,PresentationShot1884,,"hi guys, this is my first reddit post because i can‚Äôt sleep so i just wanna spill some tea! pls let me know your thoughts, i think we could have a fun discussion here. (please be respectful and open minded tho!)

i met this dude back in 2020, we began dating in 2021, and then broke up in mid 2023. we broke up amicably and agreed to stay friends. we loved each other but had our differences, he struggled with being intimate and we never once had sex. he was anxious on how to approach sex after his diagnosis, but i‚Äôve done my research and have had many ideas on how to approach sex/intimacy in many different ways beyond intercourse, but we still couldn‚Äôt overcome that. i‚Äôve expressed that sex & intimacy is important for me to feel connected to my romantic partner (i am kinda demi-romantic; its hard for me to experience romantic feelings for someone but when i do, i require intimacy bc that differentiates my romantic relationships vs my platonic relationships; he began to feel like just a friend that i mislabeled as a lover) i was committed to the relationship that i even considered the possibility of me having a strictly sexual partner to fulfill my needs. we agreed to try, but when i got on the apps i realized i wouldn‚Äôt even let anyone touch me unless i had a close connection to them. when we got to that realization that there wasn‚Äôt much solutions to attempt and no compromises we could make, we both decided to end things before it got messy, we didnt want our love for each other to become resentment. we planned our last date and did our favorite things, had one last sleepover, and said our goodbyes. he said he wanted to keep in touch, so we would text and send a check in memo weekly for the first few initial months, but i started feeling hurt when things grew inconsistent, i told him we dont need to check in as often, so it became a monthly thing. by 2024, i told myself i wasn‚Äôt going to reach out, maybe on his birthday. i hoped that things would die down from here, but he would continue sending memos monthly, sometimes i would respond, sometimes i wouldnt. and his voice memos would consist of minor updates on his life like his gym progress, his work/career, his family & relatives i‚Äôve met, and sometimes some pop culture and similar interests we shared. i found it endearing and sweet, yet difficult and conflicting, because i am a lover girl and its hard for me to let go. and i was trying to figure out how to transform this love into a friendship, bc i still wanted to support him even if we weren‚Äôt together. 

for extra context: this was my first healthy relationship and for him, i was his first ever long term romantic relationship. we started as friends than became lovers. and even at the time of our break up, we still were very much were in love and had love for each. so as you could imagine, it‚Äôs a difficult thing to let go and overcome for anyone.

so time flies and its the summertime, which marks 1 year since the break up and im still trying to process it. but we are still doing our monthly check ins, and i even begin to send the first memos and initiate the conversations, going back on my 2024 resolution on ‚Äònot‚Äô reaching out. (i know what your thinking, girl ur not getting over him bc yall keep talking‚Ä¶.shhhhh i am very self aware, but i was just ms. delulu at the time. my hopeless romantic ass thought he was gonna come back into my life and finally f*ck me‚Ä¶but only one can dream </3)(but chill, lemme cook things will start getting juicy) 
we send our silly little goofy memos, and afterwards i get an inclination to stalk his profile. my body told me something is afoot, and my mind was like ‚Äúhe is talking to someone.‚Äù so i do my due diligence, and i stalk his ig profile. (after we broke up, i decided to unfollow each other on social media) a necessary thorough check had to be done bc i am not new to this i am true to this‚Ä¶ and lo and behold, i see in his tagged photos a picture of this girl, taking a pic with a mirror, and his @ tag is specifically placed on her ass. and im like AND A OOP! that pic was in a collection of a casual photo dump but it wreaked of a soft launch‚Ä¶ so naturally i stalk her profile, and i dont see much interaction besides him liking that ‚Äòone‚Äô post and none of the newer pics. but whats ODD, is he didnt even leave a comment on the ass pic. (bc if i was her man‚Ä¶id be BARKING but i guess thats neither here or there) but because he hasn‚Äôt really interacted much on her profile, i just assumed it was accidental or nothing deep. there wasn‚Äôt much information to make of this anyways, so i just keep it pushing.

Now its fall time and he sends me his usual memo update on the gym, work, family, and pop culture, short and brief. but interestingly enough, the last few memos from the previous months, he has mentioned certain things like ‚Äúthis made me think of you,‚Äù or ‚Äúi did this thing, and it was very ‚Äúyou‚Äù coded.‚Äù and i didnt think too deeply about that, bc i believe that can happen and exist when your friends, but its a hard line to tread when that is your ex. but i gave him the benefit of the doubt and tried my best not to internalize it, but it did make me feel warm inside. but this recent memo, he mentioned my upcoming birthday and gave me a really heartfelt birthday wish. i thought it was so sweet that i ended up on his ig profile again. i went straight to his tagged photos and clicked the pic with the girl, this time there were new photos on her page. and the most recent one happened to be a photoshoot/hard launch of them on together, but mind you‚Ä¶.he didnt comment on the post, he wasn‚Äôt tagged on either, and he didnt even LIKE it?!?! then i looked at her other pics and he is missing in the likes too‚Ä¶ mind you i know he has been online bc he post a new story weekly. (how do i know this, i used the watch ig story anonymous websites) and just the icing on the cake, he hasnt even made a post on his profile of them. so as you can imagine the confusion!! with all this new information, a new found motivation was instilled in me that night. i was hysterical and manic past midnight, stalking all of her profiles. by sunrise, i‚Äôve seen all i‚Äôve needed to know. i found out they started talking or atleast going out on dates during feb/march, then officially bf/gf by june/july and been together ever since. so by my deductions, they would‚Äôve been together from atleast 6-10 months at this point. BUT THE BIGGEST GAG IS, WE ARE VERY SIMILAR. she is creative, she likes to sing, she constantly changes her hair, she likes the same anime, she collects cute things, she‚Äôs LITERALLY 1inch shorter than me, AND SHE LOOKS LIKE ME. another crazy thing that i discovered through her twitter, she drew him a picture of them together for his birthday gift..2 years ago, i did the same thing but put him into his favorite anime as his own character‚Ä¶i know his ass couldn‚Äôt help but recall my gift and draw parallels how similar it all is. 

but when i tell you i was SPIRALING, you better NAURTO BELIEVE IT! so many things were running through my head, like how come you never told me? how come you get to be happy? how come im still stuck on you? how come you get to find love? is she better than me? is she what you wanted but i could never be? how could you get over me so quickly? how come its her and not me? why do i even care? why do you even talk to me? why do you even text me? what do you even want from me? like can you imagine being in a whole relationship, dating a new girl, whilst still being friends with your ex and talking on a monthly basis but not sharing that information‚Ä¶im sorry is your new gf not worth mentioning?? or giving an update on?? i dont need to know all the details, but DUDE PUT SOME RESPECT ON YOUR GIRL‚Ä¶even if it upsets me, that isn‚Äôt your problem. if we are FRIENDS like you desire us to be, TREAT ME LIKE ONE. i was initially very EMBARRASSED AND SAD, but then i grew so angry, frustrated and disgusted. there was sooooo many feelings flowing through me all at once. i didnt know how to make sense of it, but all i knew is i didnt like it. i didnt like that he didnt tell me, i didnt like that he is playing the field between me and her, and i didnt like how he was ‚Äòtreating‚Äô her. so i simply just blocked him because this was never going to end. and here i was again, making decisions and creating solutions for that man even after our break up. as im writing this its been over 2 months now, and i dont plan on unblocking. 
BUT FUNNY ENOUGH, i started using this dating app and why a few weeks later, i get a LIKE from MY EX‚ÄôS BEST FRIEND. i thought long and hard about what i wanted to do, if this was a trick, if it was sus, or if men are even dumber than we ever imagined? a part of me wanted to ‚Äòlike‚Äô his best friend back but not text him, or text him and expose that i know who he is (we never met in person), or even play dumb too and start a casual conversation. but unfortunately as the noble steed, i took the high ground and declined. but it really made me think tho‚Ä¶were these two in kahoots, was the best friend on a solo mission to catch me slipping, or was it men just being men and swiping on everybody and anybody? 

but ANYWHOS, this concludes my lil story time. if you made it this far, i greatly appreciate you! <3 this was very therapeutic and fun to write. also, please comment something, i wanna get the reddit experience or whatever‚Ä¶ ty xoxox

The gynaecologist then did a doppler ultrasound and said that, judging at the blood flow around/of the mass, it doesn‚Äôt look like cancer/it‚Äôs probably not cancer, but also doesn‚Äôt look like a cyst. The weird thing is that she had an appointment just about a year ago and everything was fine - so this thing, whatever it is, grew from 0 to 2,5cm in just a year. The gynaecologist scheduled a check-up in 3 months time, but isn‚Äôt that a bit long considering the rate of growth of this thing?

And what else could this thing possibly be ?(considering that benign tumours don‚Äôt generally grow this fast) 

Apologies if my post is a bit of a mess, I‚Äôm just really worried for my gf and would like to do everything I can to help her. Thank you in advance for you feedback. "

I have been dealing with awful uti like symptoms for 3 months that has turned my world upside down. Started with treating Ureaplasma Parvum, then I was fine and moved on with my life. A month later symptoms of vaginal burning came back. Doctor said it was yeast but burning persisted after treatment. Within 2 weeks the burning moved to my bladder. Since then I feel burning pain when urine hits my bladder. I can‚Äôt hold more than 5oz of urine at a time (and that‚Äôs holding it). I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep as I pee every 30 mins. Nothing helps the pain. I haven‚Äôt been able to work. I have taken 7 rounds of various antibiotics and done all the tests. Cystoscopy shows inflammation in the bladder neck, and ct showed a 6.5mm phlebolith right by my bladder neck area. 

My urologist is stumped. He‚Äôs reaching out to colleagues to get ideas because he agrees that it doesn‚Äôt make sense that one day I‚Äôm completely normal and then the next I‚Äôm like this. I‚Äôm set to have a biopsy done next week and he‚Äôs also looking to see if the lab will investigate a tissue sample for infection that may be missed. 

Could a phlebolith near the bladder neck cause all this?"

Mainstream Men's Hairstyles of 21st Century So Far...,decadeology,1i7mvww,2025-01-22 16:44:23,12,0.81,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/decadeology/comments/1i7mvww/mainstream_mens_hairstyles_of_21st_century_so_far/,avalonMMXXII,Fashion üëïüëö,"**Sloppy Spiked Hair**

2000-2012 = sloppy spiked hair with lots of gel, mouse, or pomade (this was basically the staple of every guy and still widely worn for guys over age 45) it was spiked, scissors cut on sides and back usually, although some guys had electric razor cuts on the sides and back. The theme of this look was to appear ""messy, like bed head"". Some guys with dark hair dyed the tips of the spikes blonde.

**The Helmet Head**

2002-2010 = This was usually worn on teen boys or those in their early 20s, it was also popular on the West coast, such as California. Basically this was a 70's Helmet Haircut (think of Scott Baio in 1980/1981 as a reference if needed)...some people called this the ""shag"" as well, this was big in the Emo community. So younger people today do not realize it was a recycled 70s hairstyle and instead think of Just Beiber instead. This hairstyle also carried a bit into the first two years of the 2010s before just becoming rare.  It was usually parted on the side or ""middle-side"" and was layered to lool like bangs in the front but cover the ears like ear muffs, and cut about in the back but with about a half inch to an inch covering the back of the neck to balance it out a but and not make a persons neck look too long.

**The Fauxhawk Hairstyle**

This was simply a combination of the sloppy spiked hairstyle and a mowhawk. It worked well with guys with receding hairlines as well. It was cut closer with electric razors on the sides, and scissor clipped on the rest of the hair. Some guys shaved the back of the head as well, others grew the back of the head to match the length of the scissor cut top of the head. The spikes were not very high. Hair gel was usually the product worn to achieve this look. It was also around the Jersey Shore Era, with Ed Hardy t-shirts and MMA fighting was popular, and this hairstyle is often associated with that now.

**The Hitler Haircut**

2010-2021 = This is a hairstyle that started showing up in small groups in late 2008/early 2009 but it was not popularized until 2010 when PSY wore it. Basically this was a recycled hairstyle from the 1930s and 1940s...sadly the most notable person that has ever worn this hairstyle in history was Hitler. How this hairstyle was worn...it was parted on the side, and the sides and back of the head were cut with an electric razor very close to the scalp, then the parted hair on top would slightly cover the other side of the scalp that was not as exposed.  As the decade progressed other started wearing it, but by the late 2010s it was more popular in the LGBT community. The best way to describe the ""Hitler Haircut"" or ""Undercut/Gentleman's Cut"" as it was sometimes referred to was that it look like a lopsided wig that was slipping off the side of a persons head.

**The ""Smith Brothers"" Cough Drops Cut**

2010-2022 = This was a classic old school 19th century barber shop haircut, it was closely shaved on the sides and back but faded up a bit on the upper sides and back of head being longer on the top and then parted on the side.  This was not a new hairstyle by any means, but instead a very common hairstyle you saw in 19th century photos and early silent film era movies. Many men that had this hairstyle often wore in with very long Smith Bothers Cough Drop beards...the same with the haircut, which gave it the nickname ""The Smith Bros. Cough Drop Hairstyle"", others simply called it the Hipster look as lumber jack clothing would be worn with it.

**The Edgar Haircut**

2017-2022 = A mix between the Caeser haircut and a bowl cut. The Edgar haircut has indigenous roots, and some say it resembles the hairstyles of the Jumano tribe.¬† It was worn brushed down with small bangs that were cut higher to the hairline (think of Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber) but the sides were cut or shaved to the scalp very close, the back was was tapered in.

**The Broccoli Haircut**

2018-Present = The is a hairstyle that resembles those of the New Romantic/New Wave period in the UK. It is permed (or naturally curled) on the top, with curled bangs on the forehead, it is often shaved close on the lower sides and back.  Some guys shave the lower sides and back to the scalp, others scissor cut it close to the scalp. It is a very ""Top-Heavy"" hairstyle.

**The Wolfcut/Mullet**

**2022- Present** = This hairstyle is the most modern of the list so far, This is currently a very popular '20s hairstyle as well. It is very versatile and can be worn with any hair type. It is often layered from front to back. Some guys wear it parted in the middle, parted on the side, slicked back, or in curls. It is often cut shorter on top and longer in the back. The sides are cut in a way to balance the top and back out a bit if properly done by a hairstylist. This hairstyle works with many facial types and neck lengths as as well, often balancing out a persons face, nose and neck more. It is usually scissor cut and the ear is either completely exposed, or half exposed, or slightly exposed, the back is often 1inch or longer. It also makes a persons hair look like it it thicker and fuller."

And then the lower part houses an 18650 battery, a soundboard and a speaker. 

25.4mm\*\~15cm seems to be smallest chassi I can find to 3d print, does that sound about right? By default the parts I am using to build the saber are 25mm diameter on the inside so if I could avoid having to make that wider that would safe me a bunch of work."

What is slippage in crypto?,cryptoQandA,1i78n1t,2025-01-22 06:01:46,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoQandA/comments/1i78n1t/what_is_slippage_in_crypto/,Ujowo,,"## Understanding Slippage in Cryptocurrency Trading

Slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is actually executed. It is a common phenomenon in financial markets, including cryptocurrency trading, and occurs due to rapid price fluctuations, low liquidity, or delays in order execution. In decentralized finance (DeFi) and centralized exchanges, slippage can significantly impact trading outcomes, especially for large orders or assets with volatile prices.

### How Slippage Occurs

1. **Market Volatility**  
   Cryptocurrencies are known for their price volatility. When an order is placed, the price of an asset might change before the transaction is finalized. For example, if you attempt to buy Bitcoin at \$30,000, but the price surges to \$30,500 by the time your order is processed, the executed price will reflect the new market rate, resulting in **positive slippage** (if the price moves in your favor) or **negative slippage** (if it moves against you).

2. **Liquidity Constraints**  
   Liquidity refers to how easily an asset can be bought or sold without affecting its price. In markets with low liquidity‚Äîsuch as smaller altcoins or newer tokens‚Äîlarge orders may exhaust available buy/sell orders in the order book. This forces the trade to execute against less favorable prices deeper in the order book, amplifying slippage.

3. **Order Size and Execution Speed**  
   Slippage is more pronounced for large orders. A substantial buy/sell order may require matching with multiple counterparties at progressively worse prices. On decentralized exchanges (DEXs) using automated market makers (AMMs), slippage is mathematically tied to the size of the trade relative to the liquidity pool. For instance, swapping \$10,000 worth of ETH in a pool with \$100,000 liquidity will cause a larger price impact than swapping \$100.

---

### Slippage in Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)

Decentralized exchanges like Uniswap or PancakeSwap rely on liquidity pools rather than order books. Traders interact directly with these pools, and slippage is determined by the **constant product formula** (e.g., \( x \times y = k \)), which adjusts asset prices based on the ratio of tokens in the pool. Key factors include:

- **Price Impact**: The percentage change in an asset's price caused by a trade. Larger trades relative to the pool size result in higher price impact and slippage.
- **Slippage Tolerance**: A setting in DEX interfaces that allows users to define the maximum acceptable slippage (e.g., 1%). If the actual slippage exceeds this threshold, the transaction fails.

---

### Mitigating Slippage

1. **Limit Orders**  
   On centralized exchanges, traders can use limit orders to specify the exact price at which they want to buy/sell. However, this requires sufficient liquidity at the desired price level.

2. **Splitting Large Orders**  
   Breaking a large trade into smaller chunks reduces price impact. Algorithms like TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) automate this process over a set period.

3. **Choosing High-Liquidity Pools**  
   Opting for assets with deep liquidity (e.g., ETH/USDC pools) minimizes slippage. Centralized exchanges often have better liquidity for major pairs compared to DEXs.

4. **Adjusting Slippage Tolerance**  
   On DEXs, increasing slippage tolerance (e.g., from 0.5% to 3%) raises the likelihood of transaction success during volatile periods. However, this exposes traders to worse execution prices.

5. **Layer-2 Solutions and DEX Aggregators**  
   Platforms like 1inch or Matcha aggregate liquidity across multiple DEXs and leverage Layer-2 networks (e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism) to reduce gas fees and slippage.

---

### Real-World Examples of Slippage

- **Meme Coin Volatility**: A trader buying a newly launched meme coin with low liquidity might face 20%+ slippage due to a shallow order book.
- **Flash Crashes**: Sudden market crashes or pumps (e.g., due to news events) can trigger cascading liquidations, exacerbating slippage for market orders.
- **Front-Running**: In Ethereum-based DEXs, bots may exploit pending transactions by adjusting gas fees to execute their trades first, worsening slippage for ordinary users.

---

### The Role of Slippage in Trading Strategies

- **Arbitrage**: Slippage can erode profits for arbitrageurs exploiting price differences between exchanges.
- **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)**: Firms use advanced infrastructure to minimize slippage by executing orders in milliseconds.
- **Yield Farming**: In DeFi, slippage affects the ROI of providing liquidity, as large swaps in pools alter token ratios and impermanent loss."
How to avoid snipers in crypto?,cryptoQandA,1i78fmx,2025-01-22 05:47:30,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoQandA/comments/1i78fmx/how_to_avoid_snipers_in_crypto/,Ujowo,,"## Understanding and Mitigating Crypto Sniper Risks

Crypto ""snipers"" refer to individuals or bots that exploit vulnerabilities in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or newly launched tokens to front-run transactions, manipulate prices, or drain liquidity. These actors often target low-liquidity pools, memecoins, or newly listed projects. Below are detailed strategies to minimize exposure to sniper activity.

---

### 1. **Avoid Publicly Announced Launch Times**
   - Snipers monitor social media channels (Telegram, Twitter) for exact launch times of tokens. By publicly announcing a launch window, you create a predictable target.
   - **Alternative**: Use a **stealth launch** by deploying the token contract without prior announcement. This reduces the time window for snipers to prepare bots.
   - For projects, consider a **fair launch** mechanism where tokens are distributed evenly over time (e.g., via bonding curves or gradual liquidity unlocks).

---

### 2. **Liquidity Pool (LP) Strategies**
   - Snipers often target tokens with low initial liquidity. To mitigate this:
     - **Lock Liquidity**: Use a trusted third-party service (e.g., UniCrypt, Team Finance) to lock LP tokens for a predefined period. This prevents sudden liquidity removal.
     - **Increase Initial Liquidity**: Start with a higher liquidity pool (e.g., 10+ ETH) to make price manipulation more expensive for snipers.
     - **Avoid ""Meme"" Tax Structures**: High buy/sell taxes (e.g., 20%) attract snipers who exploit tax arbitrage. Use moderate fees (5‚Äì10%) or dynamic fees that adjust based on trade volume.

---

### 3. **Transaction Tactics for Traders**
   - **Use Slippage Tolerance**: Set slippage to 5‚Äì15% on DEXs to reduce the risk of front-running. Avoid using ""max slippage"" (e.g., 49%), which is a common target for snipers.
   - **Limit Orders**: Use decentralized limit-order platforms (e.g., UniswapX, 1inch) instead of market orders to specify exact entry/exit prices.
   - **Avoid ""Copy Trading""**: Snipers track wallets of large investors. Manually execute trades rather than following publicized whale activity.

---

### 4. **Contract-Level Safeguards**
   - For developers, implement code-level protections:
     - **Anti-Bot Measures**: Add modifiers to the token contract to block known sniper bot addresses (e.g., blacklisting contracts with `isContract` checks).
     - **Transaction Cooldowns**: Enforce a cooldown period (e.g., 30 seconds) between buys/sells for the same wallet.
     - **Max Transaction Limits**: Cap the percentage of the supply that can be traded in a single transaction (e.g., 1‚Äì2% of total supply).

---

### 5. **Monitor and Analyze On-Chain Activity**
   - Use blockchain explorers (Etherscan, BscScan) to track:
     - **Large Wallet Accumulations**: Sudden spikes in holdings by a single address may indicate sniper activity.
     - **Liquidity Changes**: Watch for abrupt additions/removals of liquidity in pools.
   - Tools like **DeFiLlama**, **DexTools**, or **Token Sniffer** can identify suspicious contracts or liquidity patterns.

---

### 6. **Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Selection**
   - Avoid DEXs with poor resistance to Miner Extractable Value (MEV) or front-running. 
   - Prioritize platforms with:
     - **MEV Protection**: DEXs like CowSwap or aggregators (Matcha) use batch auctions to minimize front-running.
     - **Private Transactions**: Services like Flashbots RPC (Ethereum) allow submitting transactions directly to miners, bypassing public mempools.

---

### 7. **Community Vigilance**
   - **Verify Contract Authenticity**: Ensure the token contract is renounced (ownership transferred to a dead address) and audited.
   - **Watch for Honeypots**: Use tools like Honeypot.is to detect contracts that prevent selling‚Äîa common sniper trap.
   - **Report Suspicious Activity**: Flag sniper bots or rug pulls to communities and moderators on platforms like RugDoc or Crypto Twitter.

---

### 8. **Time-Zone and Volume Arbitrage**
   - Snipers often operate during low-activity hours (e.g., late-night U.S. time). Schedule trades or launches during high-volume periods (European or U.S. mornings) when general market activity can dilute sniper impact.

---

### 9. **Legal and Regulatory Awareness**
   - While crypto is decentralized, some jurisdictions penalize market manipulation. Report fraudulent projects to regulatory bodies (e.g., SEC, FCA) if they exhibit clear sniper collusion or fraud."

I‚Äôm trying to figure out the cheapest, fastest, and easiest way to do this.

1. Should I bridge my ETH to a different network with cheaper fees before swapping? If yes, which network would be the most cost-effective? Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, etc.? Or is it better to skip bridging and just swap directly on mainnet if it‚Äôs cheap enough given the right dapp in part 2. If I need to bridge, which dapp is cheapest and trustworthy? Hop Exchange?
2. Which dapp should I use for swapping? Squid, Uniswap, 1inch,  DefiLlama

Which one offers the best combination of low fees, good liquidity, low slippage, and reliability? Does the choice depend on the network I‚Äôm on? For example, some dapps might work better on certain chains.

3. For people who‚Äôve swapped ETH for USDC before, what‚Äôs the general workflow or best practice? Which network and dapp combo is considered the go-to for low fees and ease of use?

I looked into 1inch and uniswap and they say fees are essentially zero due to some like of magic routing or something, but is it really? Also their eth price is below that of the price listed on binance. Why is this spread so significant? What am I missing here?

Cex is not an option here

Thanks for the help!

ROTATION #2 DAK is live,coffeerotation,1i70ulv,2025-01-21 21:45:44,18,0.85,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeerotation/comments/1i70ulv/rotation_2_dak_is_live/,dirtydials,,"Hello all,

I'm trying this again after the first run yesterday. Here's the update for [ROTATION #2 DAK LIVE:](https://coffeerotation.com/products/rotation-2)

v2 Update:

Bean Dosing:

* Workflow speed has improved, reducing from 20 minutes to 14 minutes for dosing and bagging approximately 250 grams of beans.
* Emphasis on cleanliness with a clean workspace and wearing gloves to avoid cross-contamination of flavors.
* Using a K-ultra grinder rubber air blower to clean the Orion nano doser, especially since Dak beans produce a lot of skin particles, which can take 2 minutes to clean.
* The Orion nano doser is accurate to within 0.2 - 0.1 grams; I manually adjust by adding one bean to get closer to 15 grams, allowing for three additional servings per box.

Packaging:

* Miscalculated bean quantities initially, which complicated order fulfillment by necessitating alternative beans for 2-3 orders.
* Adopting a ""random"" approach where the specific bean isn't listed online but is detailed on the bag.
* Label system streamlined via Google Sheets for auto-filling information, though current labels (2.25 x 1.25 inches) are too small for clear reading. Larger 3x2 inch labels are on order.
* QR code functionality changed; now directs to the main website due to configuration issues.
* Custom boxes were a mistake; arriving in two weeks, but currently using black mailers. The boxes are smaller than ideal (7x6x1 inch), should've been taller. maybe 3 inches not 1inch.

https://reddit.com/link/1i70ulv/video/gn6h120zkgee1/player

Current Problems:

* The backend of the store is undergoing rapid changes. Transitioning to a headless setup for more flexibility, but currently, it's just a basic site.
* Shipping Label Issue: Shopify integration for labels isn't working; had to use Pirate Ship for syncing orders and label creation. Encountered issues this morning, but managed to ship orders with a workaround.
* Store Compliance: My store was flagged for potential fraud, requiring additional paperwork, setting a pricing structure, and prohibiting $0 sales, which seems odd.

Cost:

Investing in a doser ($900) and label machine ($150) was costly. Manual labor would be cheaper but too time consuming. I can only dedicate 30 minutes to an hour of my brain to this.

Handwriting labels would be inefficient as this is 100+ at a time./label maker/printer was a must.

Bean Pricing:

* Beans cost roughly $3 per 20 grams (e.g., DAK at $31/200 grams or 13 servings or 64$/pound), making each baggie sold at a $9 ""loss.""
* Seeking sustainable solutions, I've contacted multiple places for wholesale pricing but received little response.

Reflections:

This project is fun but might not be sustainable long-term. If it stops being enjoyable, I'll reconsider continuing.

My idea is slowly growing into something bigger, its nice, but its also not fun. Ordering coffee is the easy part, bagging, packing, getting charged 3% on shopify, paying for shipping, spending money on redoing labels, its all how a person dies from 1000 papercuts. It's just funny how I'm getting dms about shipping cost when I'm doing all of this work and they want shit for free. They want FREE coffee, FREEE shipping, FREE everything. Definitely not sustainable, but I would like a way to make this a self sustaining thing so that people can enjoy and try coffee without the risk of spending on a full bag. There's something here, but just need to work through it so that the solution presents itself. I'm not sure what I got myself into...

I'm not a big fan of those subscription wholesalers, but that might be a way to facilitate that through this so that its self sustained. If you like XYZ sample, you place order, and rotation gets some type of affiliate sale. There are a lot of ideas floating around, but we'll  just have to wait and see how it all ends."

Should I make a straight duct a inch long and go straight to the rear panel or maybe it grabs some motherboard heat on the way out ? Like to hear everyone's thoughts. "

Question for those with experience as teen or mom of teen,Periods,1i6rcqi,2025-01-21 14:46:03,2,1.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Periods/comments/1i6rcqi/question_for_those_with_experience_as_teen_or_mom/,Mobile-Sky1,Period Question,"I know a 16 yr old teen who has never had regular periods - closest was bi-monthly, but now has dropped to nothing. She‚Äôs not sexually active at all. Her last two periods had to be ‚Äúinduced‚Äù by her gyno due to it being 3- 4 months with nothing and she was told they don‚Äôt want her lining to get too thick. Her periods previously were very heavy and painful, and as mentioned - bi-monthly at best. 

Dr tested her hormones. All came back fine. Now they want to put her on birth control which she really doesn‚Äôt want to take any meds. She is only 5ft 1inches tall and 98 lbs. the gyno told her she needs to gain weight, but she‚Äôs always been very small and can‚Äôt seem to gain even when trying boost or similar things to bump her calories. 

Any experiences on things that might help her overall or what could be going on for her?  She has an upcoming appt and the gyno will probably push for birth control again. Thanks. "

Wedding dress - bust taken in vs waist loosening,wedding,1i6hr3m,2025-01-21 07:44:08,2,0.67,31,https://i.redd.it/6subkn8vecee1.jpeg,Hungry4Lychee,,"I have been told my the bridal shop that I am a size 4 as my waist is 25in (size 2 is 24in). However, my bust is closer to a 0 and so the bust will need to be taken in 3in.

I initially agreed to a size 4 however the cost of alterations for taking in 3in is worrying me as it‚Äôs not an insignificant amount.

I haven‚Äôt tried the actual size of the dress as they have larger sizes in store, then order your size in so it is difficult for me to know how tight the size 2 will be.

Does anyone have recommendations or advice? Is it easier to make the waist a little bigger if needed (1inch)?

For context, the dress is a simple satin fabric dress. I am after a very tight bodice (and a-line skirt).

The Kriss is a good platform even with stock barrel. The 10 shot grouping is less than 1inch at 50 meters with Norma TAC22 ammo. 

I replaced the stock firing pin with Magload UK Kriss firing pin to use drop in triggertech diamond trigger. 

The Magpul UBR stock requires some 3d printed spacer otherwise the buffer tube doesn‚Äôt fit. 

The barrel is slightly shorter than the hand guard so I designed and printed a suppressor for the functional and the look. Glad it‚Äôs legal to make suppressor for my own use here. 

For the scope I‚Äôm using the DNT 7-35 with an additional holosun 403r.

A Historic Turning Point for Crypto Innovation and Investment,zec,1i4zsv9,2025-01-19 09:37:02,5,0.78,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i4zsv9,ahmede2020,news,"We are at a critical turning point in the adoption of blockchain technology. With the war on crypto in the United States nearing its end, we are just one day away from a radical policy shift. 

For the first time, clear regulatory frameworks in the U.S. and globally will allow real crypto innovation to flourish, giving developers the freedom to accelerate their work on new and exciting projects. But for this technology to truly thrive, it must be built on open, permissionless networks.

For the past six years, the #1 reason investors avoided this space was ""regulatory concerns."" Now, with ETFs gaining approval and a new administration showing constructive support for crypto, the door has finally opened.

Verst√§ndnisfrage zu Meme-Coins,wallstreetbetsGER,1i4we4t,2025-01-19 06:22:18,0,0.5,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsGER/comments/1i4we4t/verst√§ndnisfrage_zu_memecoins/,No-Artichoke-5338,,"Hallo Leute,

ich bin noch relativ neu im Handel mit Krypto und bin aktuell insgesamt mit ca. 2000‚Ç¨ in XRP, SOL, Polkadot ,NEAR und Algorand investiert.

Gestern war ich im √ºberlegen f√ºr 12$ den Trump Memecoin zu kaufen. Jedoch haben Leute hier auf Reddit davor gewarnt, dass der Kurs auch schnell wieder fallen k√∂nnte und es war mir in dem Moment zu aufwendig ein Wallet zu erstellen, den SWAP √ºber 1inch durchzuf√ºhren und die Coins zu kaufen, da ich noch keine Ahnung von Wallets habe und bisher nur √ºber Trade Republic handele.

  
Jetzt bereue ich das ein wenig, da ich gerne mal 500 oder 1000‚Ç¨ investiert und zum jetztigen Stand verf√ºnffacht h√§tte und jetzt verkauft h√§tte.

  
Meine Frage: Ist es bei Meme-Coins √∂fters so, dass sie in den ersten 1-2 Tagen um 500% steigen und man dann einfach rausgehen kann mit fettem Gewinn?

  
Nehmt es mir nicht √ºbel, dass ich als Anf√§nger einfach mal ganz unwissend diese Frage stelle.

Ich arbeite halt hauptberuflich hart f√ºr mein Geld und die Verlockung ist sehr gro√ü in kurzer Zeit z.B. aus 5000‚Ç¨ mal 10000‚Ç¨ zu machen. Ist das √ºberhaupt realistisch oder kann man da auch Pech haben?

  
Ist es besser Krypto √ºber ein Wallet zu kaufen? Die Schritte scheinen f√ºr einen Anf√§nger jedoch sehr kompliziert zu sein, da man ein Wallet er√∂ffnen muss und dann Swappen muss etc.

Kann ich mit einem Wallet auch einfach zu jederzeit wieder verkaufen?

W√§re euch sehr dankbar um Antworten und ob es Sinn machen w√ºrde sich mit der Materie tiefgehend zu befassen, um ""leichtes Geld"" in kurzer Zeit zu verdienen."

DIY temporary insulation?,Renovations,1i4nvpv,2025-01-18 21:22:21,12,0.93,14,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i4nvpv,AnotherJayson,HELP,"Hey all,

We did doing major remodeling on an old house but won't be finishing the basement for a year or two.

I was wondering if there's a way to DIY a temporary insulation in the meantime. Something like rolling some R12 pink fiberglass insulation on the walls.

Do I need to do some framing (current wood frame over the foundation is only 1inch) ? Put a vapor barrier on them?

Or is it simpler to cut styrofoam rectangles like on one of the walls?

Thanks!

New homeowner and new to this but very eager to learn.

Cheers"
Touchscreen seems unresponsive at the edges ,ATOTO,1i4ixph,2025-01-18 17:16:16,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ATOTO/comments/1i4ixph/touchscreen_seems_unresponsive_at_the_edges/,aaaddd000,,"I have an S8 Ultra Plus. The headunit overall feels very snappy and responsive.
One issue I have is that there seems to be an area about a 3cm wide (~1inch) around the touchscreen that seems to be pretty much unresponsive. No matter how many times I try it doesn register the touches. This is most noticeable at the bottom part of the touchscreen where sometimes buttons / menus of apps apear. I have to consciously tap a bit higher than the center of said app buttons for it to register the input. It feels almost like some kind of edge detection thing on phones or touchpads where it tries to ignore ""accidental"" touches if that makes sense.
Does anyone know a fix for this? Or maybe some setting to turn it off if it's indeed a ""feature""?
Thanks."

"Clutch Spacer For 1"" (25.4mm) Engine Shaft",diynz,1i3wih6,2025-01-17 20:36:04,1,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/diynz/comments/1i3wih6/clutch_spacer_for_1_254mm_engine_shaft/,TechE2020,,"I am retrofitting a clutch onto a wood chipper with a 1"" (25.4mm) shaft.  I need a 25.4mm ID x 14.5mm L spacer since the clutch is shorter than the originally drive pulley.  The spacer goes between the retaining bolt on the end of the shaft and the bearing race of the clutch.  Spacer should be steel to avoid deforming once the retaining bolt is tightened.  Maximum diameter is around 32mm to avoid hitting the clutch bearing retaining c-clip.

This is the exact part that I need, but they don't ship to NZ:  [https://cutpriceracing.com.au/store/1inch-Crankshaft-Clutch-Spacer-suit-GX390/](https://cutpriceracing.com.au/store/1inch-Crankshaft-Clutch-Spacer-suit-GX390/)

Total length needs to be approximately 14mm to 14.8 (5/16"") and can be multiple pieces stacked up.

Motorcycles uses 1"" axle spacers, but they are typically aluminium.  Spindle moulder spacers might be an option, but I haven't found the right parts.  Wurth has 25.4mm circular saw spacers, but eight of those at $49+GST each is half the price of a chipper - worse case I guess I could get a 10-pack off of Aliexpress, but would prefer NZ based if possible.

Any other ideas on where to find some shims / spacers / bushings or what I should be searching for or companies to check?  I have checked Blackwoods, Blacks Fasteners, etc,  But I haven't found the magic keywords.

"Advice on how much air space is needed for single filter CR Box. Looking to build one built into a bookshelf, powered by pc fans.",crboxes,1i2yyiw,2025-01-16 15:48:45,9,0.92,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/crboxes/comments/1i2yyiw/advice_on_how_much_air_space_is_needed_for_single/,RestInThee,,"I am looking to build a CR box that is discrete and safe from curious child hands. I have decided to build one into the back of a bookshelf. I am planning on using a single 20x30x2 merv13 filter, which will have the same air draw as two 1-inch filters. (I also plan to use a 1inch merv8 filter outside of it to extend the lifespan of the merv13 filter without decreasing air draw very much).

My question is, how much air space should I allot for in the air chamber between the filter and the fans? 

I plan on doing a vertical arrangement like the typical pc fan design, with all the fans on the top. So if you picture [this design](https://www.cleanairkits.com/products/luggables) with one filter replaced with a solid wall, and all fans on top, that is essentially what it would be. So how much space would be necessary between the 2-inch filter and the wall? Is 1 inch too little?


On a separate note, my plan is to then redirect the fan blowing either out the open back using an angled piece of wood, or make the fan blow out the front by funneling the air."
