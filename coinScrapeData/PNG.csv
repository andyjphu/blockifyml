5 coins I would recommend buying right now (with explanations),WallStreetBetsCrypto,1i54bub,2025-01-19 12:52:45,30,0.8,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBetsCrypto/comments/1i54bub/5_coins_i_would_recommend_buying_right_now_with/,InnerAbrocoma9880,DD,"I'm a day trader with a \~$300K portfolio and here's what I bought yesterday in preparation for the next (hopefully) bull run:

* **Sperax ($SPA)**: massively undervalued since its last pump where it was sitting comfortably at the $0.02 range. It's currently just at $0.014 which I'm confident is the bottom. The ATH of this coin was $0.24, so big potential.
* **Tezos ($XTZ)**: has likely hit the bottom at around $1.30. This coin has reached $10 on previous bull runs. Also on Coinbase, there is up to 7% staking with only a 2-day unstaking time, which is actually really good.
* **Ribbon Finance ($RBN)**: also undervalued. Currently at $0.34, but primed to lock back into the $0.40 - 0.50 range. In the 2024 bull run, it reached $1.80.
* **Pangolin ($PNG)**: undervalued at $0.29. This coin can pump to the $0.70 - 0.80 range on bull runs.
* **Kyber Network ($KNC)**: I've been tracking this coin for years. It tends to dart between the $0.50 and $1 range quite often, so is perfect for trading. But it also reached an instance ATH of $6 a few years ago.

Obviously I'm not a financial adviser, but hopefully these tips are at least useful food for thought. Good luck!"

Can't help but notice how PNG keeps making posts regarding ""answering all the questions about token supply"", despite not a single person asking about token supply anymore. It has become apparent to me and others that all they are doing is making attempts to try to divert the flood of real questions coming in about V3 that they clearly refuse to answer.

But if it's token supply they want to discuss, then token supply is what I'll talk about here.

What really happened was PNG rugged all their investors and dumped all their coins on the market. Once it hit rock bottom, they ""got a new team"" (lol), burned what was left that they could no longer profit from, and then spin it as ""no more inflation!"" just to get you to buy more useless tokens to pump what bags they still have. Seriously, anyone that has been following can't help but notice how much they have been promoting ""No more inflation!"", as all the tokens are now in supply. Pretty sad to reflect back and realize that this was hands down their biggest ""achievement"" of 2024."

You might have seen our post on r/selfhosted but we wanted to post here as well about how we are using WireGuard: [Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hujxxo/pangolin_beta_your_own_tunneled_reverse_proxy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Pangolin is a self-hosted tunneled reverse proxy management server with identity and access management, designed to securely expose private resources through encrypted WireGuard tunnels running in user space. With Pangolin, you retain full control over your infrastructure while providing a user-friendly and feature-rich solution for managing proxies, authentication, and access, and simplifying complex network setups, all with a clean and simple dashboard web UI.

The whole system is made up of a couple of services. Gerbil provides a WireGuard management server that Pangolin can use to create peers for connectivity. It can be used on its own with JSON config files to manage a WireGuard server. There is also Newt, a CLI tool and Docker container that connects back to Gerbil with WireGuard. The interesting part is it is fully in user space using the ‚Äúnetstack‚Äù WireGuard example so you do not need to run a privileged process or container in order to connect!

I see some people just complain with no reason recently. Lets make this clear..,PangolinExchange,1h3dtof,2024-11-30 09:35:21,19,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PangolinExchange/comments/1h3dtof/i_see_some_people_just_complain_with_no_reason/,CelliosIV,,"One of the complaints I‚Äôve seen is the claim that crypto projects have no value. Yes, there are many projects with no value, but decentralized exchanges are not one of them.

Decentralized exchanges generate more revenue than 90% of the projects in the industry. For example, Uniswap earns significantly more profit than most Layer 1 projects‚Äîpossibly even as much as a major project like Solana. I haven‚Äôt checked the latest figures, so I‚Äôd need to verify that.

Are you saying that in a world where people still buy and sell Pok√©mon cards and sports trading cards, a profitable exchange has no value?

Another complaint is that PNG is considered a worthless project.

This project was abandoned until recently. A new team was assigned, and a roadmap was established, which they are now following. Yes, some promises were not fulfilled in the past.

But as you can imagine, taking over an incomplete project and reviving it is not an easy task.

Now, let‚Äôs move on to a few frequently asked questions, where I‚Äôll share my own answers and thoughts. And why do I believe in the project and invest in it?

This is Adam's post on twitter - Lead Contributor

""Let‚Äôs break it down with some simple math: 

PNG has a maximum supply of 230m, all of which is already in circulation. Will any new PNG enter circulation? No. 

Every swap transaction on Pangolin V2 generates fees that are automatically used for PNG buybacks. These purchased PNG tokens are then distributed as rewards in the PNG staking pool. This means that PNG is continuously being bought off the market.  

Currently, the trading volume on Pangolin V2 is low, which is understandable. The absence of farm rewards has reduced TVL, naturally leading to lower volume. 

However, this is about to change with Pangolin V3. The innovative dynamic fee mechanism combined with concentrated liquidity infrastructure will drive significantly higher trading volumes even without farm rewards. (That said, some pools will also feature AVAX rewards.)  

Significantly higher trading volume means substantially much more PNG buybacks from the market. While I can‚Äôt comment on PNG‚Äôs price, the math and mechanics here speak for themselves.""

I think the tokenomics are great.

Will it reach $10? That depends partly on AVAX's performance. It‚Äôs all about how big the rally will be.

Let‚Äôs discuss the other questions in the comments. At the end of the day, we‚Äôre all just a handful of people trying to make money. The most sensible approach is to create an exit plan and stick to it.

# [Stock futures slide to kick off September trading: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/02/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)
*****
> U.S. stock futures declined Tuesday as traders braced for a potentially tough month ahead after a strong but volatile August.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 197 points, or 0.5%. S&P 500 futures lost 0.5%, and Nasdaq-100 futures fell 0.6%.
*****
> U.S. markets were closed Monday due to the Labor Day holiday.
*****
> The major averages are coming off a winning session, securing a gain for major averages in the month. Notably, the S&P 500 clinched its fourth straight winning month.
*****
> Those moves came after a steep sell-off to begin the month. Concern over the U.S. economy falling into a recession, along with the unwinding of a popular hedge fund trade involving the Japanese yen, sent stocks tumbling in early August. At one point, the S&P 500 was down more than 7% for the month before recovering.
*****
> ‚ÄúAugust got off to an incredibly rough start,‚Äù wrote Deutsche Bank macro strategist Henry Allen. ‚ÄúBut after August 5, calm began to return to markets. In part, that was helped by more positive data on the US economy, which helped to ease fears about an imminent recession.‚Äù
*****
> Investors will get their first major economic report of the month on Friday, when the U.S. government releases the August jobs report. Wall Street will also have to contend with seasonal headwinds, as September has been the worst month on average for the S&P 500 over the last 10 years.

*****
> U.S. stock futures declined Tuesday as traders braced for a potentially tough month ahead after a strong but volatile August.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 197 points, or 0.5%. S&P 500 futures lost 0.5%, and Nasdaq-100 futures fell 0.6%.
*****
> U.S. markets were closed Monday due to the Labor Day holiday.
*****
> The major averages are coming off a winning session, securing a gain for major averages in the month. Notably, the S&P 500 clinched its fourth straight winning month.
*****
> Those moves came after a steep sell-off to begin the month. Concern over the U.S. economy falling into a recession, along with the unwinding of a popular hedge fund trade involving the Japanese yen, sent stocks tumbling in early August. At one point, the S&P 500 was down more than 7% for the month before recovering.
*****
> ‚ÄúAugust got off to an incredibly rough start,‚Äù wrote Deutsche Bank macro strategist Henry Allen. ‚ÄúBut after August 5, calm began to return to markets. In part, that was helped by more positive data on the US economy, which helped to ease fears about an imminent recession.‚Äù
*****
> Investors will get their first major economic report of the month on Friday, when the U.S. government releases the August jobs report. Wall Street will also have to contend with seasonal headwinds, as September has been the worst month on average for the S&P 500 over the last 10 years.

Trend Following Dynamics in Cryptocurrency Markets: A Case Study on Pangolin (PNG)  
  
Abstract  
  
This paper explores the application of trend following strategies within the volatile and rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market, focusing specifically on Pangolin (PNG), a decentralized trading platform on the Avalanche network. The analysis delves into how PNG's trading activities and token performance align with trend following methodologies, examining historical data to identify patterns and trends. We assess the effectiveness of trend following in navigating the high volatility and liquidity changes characteristic of cryptocurrency markets, particularly through case studies that highlight periods of significant market movements. The study also investigates user behavior, trading patterns, and the broader ecosystem interactions that influence PNG's market dynamics. By integrating quantitative analysis with market microstructure insights, this research aims to provide a nuanced understanding of how trend following can be strategically applied in decentralized finance (DeFi) environments like Pangolin, offering implications for both algorithmic trading strategies and risk management in the crypto space.

When I try to create a wallet for PNG via the Tangem app, it shows that the only network available is its native network, Avalanche:

So attempting to send to my Tangem wallet won't go through, right? (Edit: or more likely, will send my PNG to crypto purgatory.) Does ERC20 support need to be added for PNG on Tangem before we can offramp from Coinbase?"

then here it is on the 4h Time frame. I also spotted a bearish divergence I think on the RSI. so that tells me it could play out as a rising wedge?

Hello there. For those who know me and those who don't, I'm Kaiser Isaiah. DBM's main representative of Animal Kaiser, probably the first guy to really do 3D stuff on the subreddit, the guy who put the whole subreddit against Capybaras in Drip Jackets, local brain-dead moron but in the end, just your local DBM NPC with some fun side quests.


Now I haven't really been interacting with DBM as often as I used to, especially since after gaining brainrot from a brand new Genshin Impact ship (Aether X Furina) which might arguably overtake Bennett X Fischl for me. But today's a little bit of a special day since well, it's the 22nd of January. My Reddit Cake Day. 


Unfortunately though unlike last year, I did not have the motivation to draw something for the friends I've made along the way, so instead you only get half of the puzzle that I left last time, which is a long ass essay type-a shit about DBM. I have a feeling most of you guys (The 40+ of you who upvoted last year's Cake Day post lmao) missed that out anyway.


So well, here I am, there's a decent chunk of things to say really. 2023 has arguably been the best year of my life to say the least. From being able to help out the place I love the most in my country, gaining a newfound appreciation for Pangolins, having new friends on 2 Genshin subreddits, my audience on Twitter blowing a decent chunk which helps promote my work, with so much more positives before ending it all with Animal Kaiser announcing its return and a successful emulation as 2023 was coming to its finale. Overall, it's been one hell of a wild ride.


And of course, DBM too hasn't changed too much, playing as a part of my life still. Unfortunately, there were still many issues that I had to go through this year, albeit they were as pathetic as myself. Still, I'm somehow still alive by this point so maybe I shouldn't question life as much as I do. But as usual, there somehow always are positives.


From reuniting with friends that I haven't seen in a long time like LordCrate once again, to my moment of insanity that was International Friendship Day, successfully pulling off SFM VS Animations and managing to create some of my best (and hopefully will be last) matchups starring my favourite franchise. Oh and Pink Sheep VS Team Sky Leader Mikey is there too, should give them more love. 


Even DBM has been doing quite well recently...Okay while writing this I just remembered the Springtrap stuff so maybe not that much but still, our usual brain-dead activity doesn't seem to be as bad as it once was just last 2 years ago. After the whole Scarlet King Superman and Springtrap hax thing, as of right now DBM just seems to be doing pretty dang alright.


But with all this, I still thank all of you folks here who have or have not interacted with me here in DBM. Each one of y'all have played a part in my life one way or another. Many good, bad, goofy ass memories all come from this place with all of you in this subreddit. Those who post matchups featuring my favourite franchises, those who gave positive compliments for everything I've made from matchups to art and of course, those who I call my friends. All of y'all are constant bringers of joy to my life.


And this is more of a Discord thing, but I am unfortunately aware that I am not the same person I was during since 2022, somehow I had a significant enough personality change so I'm not as good of a friend, let alone person as I used to be. I've definitely still had pretty unfortunate thoughts regarding my friend group as a whole here in DBM, but still I am surprised that so many of y'all still stuck around me. I'm grateful to be part of DBM, with all of you around as my companions.


2024 is the weird year already, but starting off with a brand new top post for Superman VS Scarlet King to literally kick off my first DBM post for the year was genuinely surprisingly. Plus my posters FINALLY settling Kyle VS Simon and my remastered favourite series matchups also did pretty well so thank you for that. I've got a few things to look forward to this year, so I hope another wonderful year with all of you will be on that list.


Once again, thank you r/DeathBattleMatchups for everything. Here's to another wonderful year with all of you! And stay tuned for the Animal Kaiser Emulator, because when it's out I look forward to sharing it with all of you.




Yours sincerely and all things Pangolins,
Kaiser Isaiah, DBM's Animal Kaiser guy"

I was wondering if I am the only one finding a large monster, or at least a different monster in the trailer.  
Let me explain :  
* The beasts at the beginning behind us have a [long tail](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/429315088462249985/1182666119526490153/image.png?ex=658586a7&is=657311a7&hm=a066f15eadd014083633edf25f93821397b86f0ef6f43caa224dbd2e00e264ff&)  
* We can see one attack during the sandstorm around the charged pangolin, standing his ground like any other Beast model (arzuros, goss harag those kind of monsters) [BUT there is one around his size but not standing up](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/429315088462249985/1182665783759880295/image.png?ex=65858657&is=65731157&hm=6175bacc8daa6de8cc2956fc4fd57d5fa7f208cd23c70fc9ddc6bc60f722618e&)  
* And that same buffed monster, also [has a tail that is way shorter](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/429315088462249985/1182665975607349369/image.png?ex=65858685&is=65731185&hm=5364ff8e88dc1012d4306f59ac113e0c5c60e8ab6b49d87f377c8d074e81eda4&)

Simple Historical Armor for PF2,Pathfinder_RPG,16keoq7,2023-09-16 14:39:13,8,0.69,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/16keoq7/simple_historical_armor_for_pf2/,Iestwyn,2E Resources,"This is inspired by a recent article on [armor inaccuracies in Baldur's Gate 3](https://acoup.blog/2023/09/15/collections-the-gap-in-the-armor-of-baldurs-gate-and-5e/) by military historian Bret Devereaux.

It's no secret that RPG armor is only loosely based on actual historical armor. Honestly, that's fine; these games take place in Golarion or Faerun or whatever, not early modern Europe. Things are bound to be different. Also, there's magic, which changes things up significantly.

Where it does make a difference (in my opinion) is when these differences make the armor impractical or - at worst - nonfunctional. We want our worlds to feel relatively grounded, like we can make decisions that have reasonable results. That means that unless there's a specific reason for it, like magic, then things like the rules of physics should probably line up with real life. That extends to things like armor design.

*Note: That's only my design philosophy. If you or your players don't think like this, feel free to ignore this. Of course, this could still be useful if you're just looking for something new for your games.*

&#x200B;

So this post will offer some slight changes to armor in PF2. I'm going to be keeping the adjustments as minimal as possible - just reskins of existing armors. We'll stick to just the armor in the Core Rulebook to keep things simple, and ignore anything enhanced by magic (since that could logically differ from real-world armor). Some armor types will be dropped, since they don't have any real-world counterparts.

I'll include armor names, stats, and a reference image, along with a short description. Some armors will be left as-is, but I'll still list the stats here. For a more detailed exploration, feel free to check out the article linked at the start of the post.

&#x200B;

Let's get started!

* **Light Armor**
   * *Padded* \- [Regular padded armor](https://2e.aonprd.com/Armor.aspx?ID=3), [Image](https://steel-mastery.com/image/cache/cache/663001-664000/663082/additional/f35b-DSC00932-0-1-0-1-1-490x648.jpg) \- Basically wearing a quilt; also called a ""gambeson"" or ""arming jacket"" (though the latter usually referred to a padded shirt worn under other armor
   * *Buff Leather* \- [Reskinned leather armor](https://2e.aonprd.com/Armor.aspx?ID=4), [Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Kyller_-_Livrustkammaren_-_30083.tif/lossy-page1-800px-Kyller_-_Livrustkammaren_-_30083.tif.jpg) \- Historically made from buffalo, but could be made from fantasy creatures
   * *Mail Shirt* \- [Regular chain shirt](https://2e.aonprd.com/Armor.aspx?ID=6), [Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Kusari_katabira_11.JPG/1280px-Kusari_katabira_11.JPG) \- Could probably lose the Noisy trait if we're being really accurate, since it was usually worn with cloth under or over
* **Medium Armor**
   * *Mail Hauberk* \- [Reskinned chain mail](https://2e.aonprd.com/Armor.aspx?ID=9), [Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Italian_-_Mail_-_Walters_51575.jpg) \- Essentially a longer version of the mail shirt
   * *Scale Armor* \- [Regular scale armor](https://2e.aonprd.com/Armor.aspx?ID=8), [Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Coat_of_Pangolin_scales.JPG/330px-Coat_of_Pangolin_scales.JPG) \- Vulnerable if attacked from beneath, which would get under the scales
   * *Leather Lamellar* \- [Reskinned hide armor](https://2e.aonprd.com/Armor.aspx?ID=7), [Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Karuta_tatami_dou_3.JPG/800px-Karuta_tatami_dou_3.JPG) \- Made from ""cuir bouilli"" or ""boiled leather"" (we're not sure if it was really boiled historically), this leather is very tough and hard, and decently heavy; note that ""lamellar armor"" is made of lots of overlapping plates
   * *Metal Lamellar (Brigandine)* \- [Reskinned breastplate](https://2e.aonprd.com/Armor.aspx?ID=10), [Image of outside](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Jack_of_plate%2C_English_or_Scottish%2C_c1590%2C_Royal_Armoury%2C_Leeds.JPG/800px-Jack_of_plate%2C_English_or_Scottish%2C_c1590%2C_Royal_Armoury%2C_Leeds.JPG), [Image of inside](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Brigandine%2C_Italian%2C_c1470%2C_Royal_Armoury%2C_Leeds_%28internal_view%29.JPG/1280px-Brigandine%2C_Italian%2C_c1470%2C_Royal_Armoury%2C_Leeds_%28internal_view%29.JPG) \- More lamellar armor, but the lamellae are on the inside of a padded cloth cover
* **Heavy Armor**
   * *Breastplate over Mail* \- [Reskinned splint mail](https://2e.aonprd.com/Armor.aspx?ID=11), [Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Chain_mail_with_breastplate_%2829123781315%29.jpg/600px-Chain_mail_with_breastplate_%2829123781315%29.jpg?20160928200646) \- Breastplates were relatively heavy (still not as heavy as we tend to imagine), so adding just one to a hauberk is fair
   * *Half Plate* \- [Regular half plate](https://2e.aonprd.com/Armor.aspx?ID=12), [Image](https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/attachments/1578938392900-png.515902/) \- Adding some more plates to the hauberk helped, but was, again, heavier
   * *Full Plate* \- [Regular full plate](https://2e.aonprd.com/Armor.aspx?ID=13), [Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Rustning%2C_Gustav_Vasa_-_Livrustkammaren_-_32921.tif/lossy-page1-800px-Rustning%2C_Gustav_Vasa_-_Livrustkammaren_-_32921.tif.jpg) \- Again, usually worn over layers of padded and mail, though still not as heavy as we usually think
* **Removed Ideas**
   * *Studded Leather* \- Adding little rivets to cuir bouilli (or worse, regular leather) does nothing. This was probably just people misinterpreting [historical paintings of brigandine](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1c/c5/23/1cc523648ce701a61ca0893048257e8e.jpg) (discussed above).
   * *Hide Armor* \- Regular leather, like the leather we wear together or usually imagine on fantasy heroes, is pointless. Untreated leather, like what ""savage"" characters wear (oof), is even worse.
   * *Split Armor* \- This might be a misinterpreted imagination of lamellar armor, but the lamellae need to overlap, not just hang close to each other.

&#x200B;

Some additional thoughts that don't affect gameplay, but can allow for more realism:

* *Helmets* \- For the love of everything good in this world, give your characters helmets, preferably with face coverings. The head was the first thing armored IRL; even if you couldn't afford a gambeson, you could try to find a [metal bowl](https://media.britishmuseum.org/media/Repository/Documents/2014_9/30_15/b05cb826_164a_4aa1_8382_a3b601035e3b/mid_00019889_001.jpg) to wear. I know we really want to leave faces uncovered so we can see our characters' faces, but try to at least give a little covering like a [Norse nasal helm](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/KHM_Wien_A_41_-_Moravian_nasal_helmet%2C_11th_century_transparent.png/603px-KHM_Wien_A_41_-_Moravian_nasal_helmet%2C_11th_century_transparent.png).
* *""Chain mail""* \- Small quibble, but ""chain mail"" isn't a thing. Just call it ""mail.""
* *Decoration* \- You could argue that historical armor doesn't look very interesting. That's fine - historical people tended to think that it looked kinda dull, too. That's why they wore fancy things over the armor, like [tabards](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Pursuivant_tabard.jpg). Feel free to pretty up your characters, too.
* *Boob armor* \- Not to beat a dead horse, but breasts-plate wasn't a thing. When women did wear armor (and it did happen sometimes), they wore a regular breastplate, maybe sized a bit bigger if the lady was particularly large. Having [defined boobs](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9e499bb2c90d16693eeed035fdb03515-pjlq) would deflect any attacks towards the center of the chest instead of off to the side. You could argue that your world has makes impractical fashion choices in the name of showing off the sexiness of the person inside, but if you want to go that way, then go ahead and include [decorative codpieces](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9b31219a2a73f9d6b684de49bdf79c83.webp) for the guys, which were a real thing (if uncommon outside of ceremonial armor because, again, it was impractical).

&#x200B;

Need help getting higher quality images of the follower forms!,CultOfTheLamb,16jqszm,2023-09-15 18:23:26,2,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CultOfTheLamb/comments/16jqszm/need_help_getting_higher_quality_images_of_the/,CloverUTY,Image,"&#x200B;

[5 days ago, I had posted a tierlist on this sub for the follower forms. However, the tierlist was incomplete, and I wanted to try to make my own that included all the follower forms in the game. I had used the COTL wiki to get the images, but I noticed that all of the images didn't have a standardized size or format, resulting them looking weird in Tiermaker. I've been trying to make all of them standardized, but as you can see, the ones marked in red have weird backgrounds and red borders around them all. The bishop's images are worse too \(I tried fixing Heket, but it looks kinda bad tbh\). Does anyone know where I can get the sprites of ALL follower forms in the same style as the ones in the green box?](https://preview.redd.it/fo6926zzuhob1.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=876abd6917a548253d686d0018f48967f9631cfe)"

**2ND BASE SET**

[This would be the medium armour set](https://preview.redd.it/xh6djoers9hb1.png?width=355&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd61916ddc259dd8d79abc9880f3289165c44953)

Now the inspiration for this would mostly be tribal with exception for the chestplate(?) So let us go into it briefly.

&#x200B;

* **Headwear**

Now this will come in specific with the ***Igorot Oklop*** wood bowl helm. Now I hear you saying, didnt I not say we were not going specific? Yeah but the problem is helmets for a normal gear is pretty hard to find here ngl that predates Islam and other foreign forces.

So instead I took inspiration in organic material helmets. But this is the big issue, I'm torn between making a full wooden helm or woven materials instead since the latter is more common.

Another example can be like the **Dayak** ***Ketapu/Katapu***

Sometimes you can find it purely carved from a block of wood but most of the times it is woven. So maybe we will just go with woven materials tbh. Higher tier variants could maybe include something similar like the **Nias,** ***Takula Tofao***\*.\*

&#x200B;

* **Torso**

Here is where other things may be mended together. This was inspired by the idea of the ***Siping-siping*** scale armour

[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/239\_Krishnayana\_Reliefs\_%2825560173967%29.jpg/1024px-239\_Krishnayana\_Reliefs\_%2825560173967%29.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/239_Krishnayana_Reliefs_%2825560173967%29.jpg/1024px-239_Krishnayana_Reliefs_%2825560173967%29.jpg)

And another would be the ***Torajan War Vest***

***Dayak War Vest***

And the ***Dayak Baju Empurau***

Details regarding tribal armour is difficult as it is made with organic materials that can rot more easily than metal artefacts. It can be maintained only if the generations worth of people even care about it as well, then the matter of humidity, war times, pass overs and etc. tends to leave this subject in the bad side of things.

But from what we know, these woven armour were not only woven with such materials like rattan or whatsoever but laced with plates of *horn*, *bone* and even *scales* from either tough ***fish*** or ***pangolins*** (*tenggiling*). Further more it sometimes were ***reinforced with hide*** as well, results may differ.

Accessories over it would primarily be based of *head hunting* groups so typical things like fangs would be worn like the **Dayaks**

[https://reqnews-storage-pro.s3.ap-southeast-3.amazonaws.com/2022/08/Panglima\_Jilah.png](https://reqnews-storage-pro.s3.ap-southeast-3.amazonaws.com/2022/08/Panglima_Jilah.png)

And **Igorot** tribes

[https://i.pinimg.com/564x/52/98/11/5298111e6399d221aefec7a5dcdc6f35.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/52/98/11/5298111e6399d221aefec7a5dcdc6f35.jpg)

The loincloth is used instead and was explained earlier.

&#x200B;

* **Arms**

The arm ring stays similar but the arm guards are changed into bangles like the metal ***Tumpa*** instead

[https://sevenpie.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/gawai-header.jpg](https://sevenpie.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/gawai-header.jpg)

Or either just stack up enough fangs to make a gauntlet and I had seen some people done it before in a festival few years back. (*lmao*)

I'm not so serious about this part as even I don't really know any other way to implement said gauntlets so it is up to you all, this is just references.

**ALTERNATE MED ARMOUR SET**

[Style A](https://preview.redd.it/w8is10knv9hb1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=5389e200a5e98806e826d5a9fc82e9fe79238b35)

[Style B](https://preview.redd.it/aymd2crpv9hb1.png?width=298&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f1396676a55520e68f065fdff934d81f74a7dce)

Now is for the *alternate*, from what I noticed in FH, the alternates tend to be *more personalised* or was it the other way around(?) like how *Warmonger*'*s alternate is without the cape but the normal one is with the cape and etc*. So instead, I opted for something to cover a bit of the chest for more room for the paint pattern option. But as usual, I'm torn between the 2.

As for the head, as long as it has feathers or horns, I'm a-okay with it because its cool.

Example like the *Takula Tufao* earlier, this would be the base

[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ee/10/15/ee1015c13d73a20d215f071c4f1728c8.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ee/10/15/ee1015c13d73a20d215f071c4f1728c8.jpg)

And this the ***alternate***

Or the **Dayak** variant with its feathers:

[https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9AUOVwpIh98/VRQqwzoOvlI/AAAAAAAAARY/kUVNPt4HFhI/s1600/1044215\_248858135238859\_1819575074\_n.jpg](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9AUOVwpIh98/VRQqwzoOvlI/AAAAAAAAARY/kUVNPt4HFhI/s1600/1044215_248858135238859_1819575074_n.jpg)

Or even the **Igorot** style:

[https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HyjHjLoofTw/Vd61cGJM4BI/AAAAAAAACnU/orxNciT6JoE/s1600/native-costume-badjao-charles-romano-wandag-FB.jpg](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HyjHjLoofTw/Vd61cGJM4BI/AAAAAAAACnU/orxNciT6JoE/s1600/native-costume-badjao-charles-romano-wandag-FB.jpg)

It doesn't matter as long as those adornments be uptight there lmaoo. Because it'll look cool, I mean look at *Ocelotl*.

* **Torso**

For the Torso, I initially planned from the ***Gagong*** (*Dayak Chief War Vest*) which becomes **style A**

[https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c6/d9/1f/c6d91f342e76bfa864935b02d84de5f8.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c6/d9/1f/c6d91f342e76bfa864935b02d84de5f8.jpg)

The material can be made differently but the base would always be woven, the top could either be of ***bark, pelt*** and at times ***feathers*** too which makes it cool. Something a bit like Warmonger Sabaktes(?) set.

But this started to have problems as so far as I know they are the only ones who does this so the only other option is **Style B** which just have a ***wraparound cloth***. Most commonly seen with the **Igorots**; *Gaddang*, but other cultures does the same too just nowadays we rarely seen it since its *not officially* part of the regalia.

[https://i.pinimg.com/564x/fc/0f/32/fc0f324c68a6a1b7b0782d22fa8968b5.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/fc/0f/32/fc0f324c68a6a1b7b0782d22fa8968b5.jpg)

Not only the tribes but anyone who wears it casually; not formally. Like these Kelantanese Malays here. Most times people are kinda lazy to wear it so they just put it around or if its too cold and other variety of reasons so it is a normal thing to see and for people to do too like the *Highlanders*.

Now some may ask why implement the *obscure siping-siping* armour and not like the ***Baru Oroba***.

To that I say that its a bit to *similar to the light set* if I'm being honest since it is also a vest. This armour seen the world too in a way even in Peninsular Malaya did we even managed to dig up its armour.

*During the late 19th century, there was a civil war in Selangor and the other side had a lot of Mercenaries from Sumatra but the thing is most of them were sub-ethnic groups of the* ***Minang*** *people yet this armour which is evidently of* ***Nias*** *origin could be found which is funny. Somebody just decided to wear what he had or probably the guy was mixed, who knows.*

**HEAVY ARMOUR SET**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/8qxf8s7iw9hb1.png?width=337&format=png&auto=webp&s=f830c3d4666b9cb66f729403195f4851a10105b5)

Now this one is the most simple one to explain. To most people this may be based of the ***Moro*** set which isn't wrong.

[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1c/c5/bb/1cc5bb315728ec9a375492b57e525a0e.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1c/c5/bb/1cc5bb315728ec9a375492b57e525a0e.jpg)

But ever since the Islamic influence and colonial era of the time, most MSEA just use their technology. Its hard to explain but we adapted and just decided its better.

Even in Indonesia, styled helmets like the ***Paseki*** exists.

[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/COLLECTIE\_TROPENMUSEUM\_Man\_van\_Zuid-Celebes\_in\_krijgskostuum\_TMnr\_10002058.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/COLLECTIE_TROPENMUSEUM_Man_van_Zuid-Celebes_in_krijgskostuum_TMnr_10002058.jpg)

The ***plate and chain*** style of amour was taken from either the *Arabs, Persian or the Mughals*. Heck, probably all at once.

[https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bAJ-TIK4QyU/UGkVr3lWnqI/AAAAAAAAADw/7zTNj4dzK\_w/s1600/Pameran+Perisai+01.jpg](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bAJ-TIK4QyU/UGkVr3lWnqI/AAAAAAAAADw/7zTNj4dzK_w/s1600/Pameran+Perisai+01.jpg)

Its littered all over MSEA by this point. Even in terms of weaponry which we will go through later. There's nothing really much to say.

I could however suggest an alternate.

https://preview.redd.it/qgzkl8vkw9hb1.png?width=303&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ed75f5b92da61ec2fabcfac54f5617fb55f0bf2

This version includes a shirt under the armour and a *kain*.

This version will **manipulate** the colour selection even more since there is a shirt underneath or a tunic along with *feathers* of course. I was particularly inspired by the individual on the right and no one else really. (lmao)

The Resurrection Chamber for the beginning practitioner: a guide to using necromancy to revive the dead in Dwarf Fortress.,dwarffortress,10d9jvh,2023-01-16 03:45:10,112,0.99,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/10d9jvh/the_resurrection_chamber_for_the_beginning/,Kilmire,,"#The Build in Detail

First off, this is an example of the final design https://i.imgur.com/NFucJod.png it's not a very precise matter, so feel free to decorate or change things up. Note this is much easier with a citizen necromancer, and this guide refers to reviving citizens, but you can alter the design to make it safe for anything. (With another side tunnel locked via bridge you could revive a dead web making forgotten beast and lead it to a room for silk production.)

The red X is the body storage room. It's set up so that your necromancer, stationed in the blue X room, can see the body via fortification to revive without it being able to reach them. (In the case you revive it as a violent corpse instead of intelligent undead.) 

Then after the undead is raised, there's a required side door to the side so they can leave or get rescued. Edit: Add a cage trap in here if you'd like to save any hostile zombies you revive. You can also add a pedestal to transport the dead easier. 

The green X room is the waiting room. After the ritual, your necromancer may panic; you don't want them running around accidently raising more corpses because of that so I lock them in there for a moment to make sure they are calm before they leave.

The goblin is the necromancer bait, able to be seen via fortification. It can be any creature you can target to attack with a squad, or anything inherently hostile without ranged attacks; especially if you're trying to use a neutral prisoner necromancer, since they can't be commanded.

You set it up by capturing something in a cage, building said cage in the room, and then linking it with and releasing it via lever. It's very important to have at least one empty space in your cage room otherwise a mechanism will open the door when you open the cage letting your creature out.

Lastly, you cannot revive skeletons or mangled bodies, at least not as intelligent undead.

#The Revival Ritual

The ritual goes like this: if using a pedestal, go to the corpse section and assign the body; making sure it doesn't actually get displayed (lock body and unset it from the display when it enters the room) 

Alternative method for bulk revival or large corpse list using dump zones:  >!Make a dump zone in the red X body room, pause all other dump zones and lock all other corpses and body parts in the stocks menu, unforbid and mark the body(s) you wish to revive to be trashed, and watch the corpses to make sure they haul them over to the dump. They may cancel it a few times, you just have to keep marking them and waiting. They may also have put other trash in there, don't worry as long as it's nothing revivable. Pedestal is more coinvent for solo revival for these reasons!<

Once it's in it's chamber, forbid it, and lock the doors into it's room. 

Now station your necromancer in the Blue X room by putting them in a squad (noble necromancers can be added to squads, just not as leaders, be careful to individually command them if you use them) lock the door to the green X room and, going slow here, order them to kill the goblin.

Extra info about necromancer transport: >!there's several methods you can use to get them in the chamber, but any non-squad method will not work with neutral bait, as you will need to initiate combat to start revival. If it doesn't want to kill you and you're using a citizen necromancer, you need to use them in a squad with a kill command to do that!<

This will revive the corpse into something. Cancel the order to kill. If it's hostile, lock your necromancer in the green X waiting room and let it get caged or just kill it. (Letting your necromancer scream in horror about the undead by waiting in the *blue* X room is really bad for their mood.) 

If it's intelligent undead, congratulations! Depending on their condition, they will either walk out and go to work or the hospital, or lay there helplessly in indescribable pain that they no longer care about waiting to be rescued.

That's why you need the bridge, close it if dwarves get scared and can't rescue them. With that side door entrance into the red X room and proper locking however, they should be fine. Just leave the creature in there for next time, it's reusable.

More on revival: >!As mentioned earlier, you can revive a lot more than just intelligent undead candidates, most unmangle bodies can be revived, skeletons sometimes, but I've haven't managed it with dwarf skeletons. [Pangolin Skeletons](https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/zs97d6/the_indestructible_pangolin_skeleton/) are a famous example. I can't find info on the success rate for intelligent undead or what it's based on, anything known would be appreciated. Anything with a ranged attack will attack your dwarves through fortifications so beware. Revival *can* imbrue magic powers to the undead, some of which are ranged, but in practice I've never had, say, a civilian dwarf corpse revived into a violent icicle shooting undead. Let me know if that happens to you! Adding on to this complexity, apparently different forms of the secrets of life and death can give necromancers more powers? Might be a good, or at least !FUN! idea to try and let your necromancer read every life or death book you can find, though I haven't tried that yet.!<

#About Intelligent undead

Once healed/rescued/free to terrorize the world of the living, they will go back to work like they used to and petition for citizenship at some point, and you'll need to accept that to put them in the army. intelligent undead are super neat and good warriors, so it's worth reading their wiki page.

In general, they are far less fragile then their living counter parts. They are also sometimes buggy, you can get infinitely bleeding int dead for your doctor to train on (rare) and if they die and are revived again they may end up mindless and unable to do anything even as int dead. Apparently sending them on raids can sometimes make them come back as ghost too, but it's even more weird then that, read the wiki page on them if you're curious.

>!Contained within this line are the secrets of life and death. *You have become a necromancer*!<"

Update 1.11 and Twlight Pack Out Now!,PlanetZoo,y739pp,2022-10-18 06:29:38,82,1.0,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlanetZoo/comments/y739pp/update_111_and_twlight_pack_out_now/,Hotlikerobot09,Frontier Official," Hayo Zookeepers!

It's time to discover what happens when the sun sets, with the Planet Zoo: Twilight Pack and free Update 1.11, both out now! You can grab the pack on¬†[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2150050/Planet_Zoo_Twilight_Pack/?snr=), and update your game to be able to enjoy the free content!¬†

 [**https://youtu.be/13OCTIfyqD8**](https://youtu.be/13OCTIfyqD8) 

Meet your curious new residents: five cunning animals including the Raccoon, Common Wombat, Red Fox, Striped Skunk, and you'll also see the Egyptian Fruit Bat soar!

The brand new Planet Zoo: Twilight Pack will also allow you to create a truly thrilling zoo with more than 200 scenery pieces inspired by gothic architecture and spooky celebrations. Enjoy haunted d√©cor and creepy elements like¬†spider web benches, carved pump jack-o'-lanterns, and even a spooky cauldron to help make your zoo as atmospheric as possible. Of course, we haven't forgotten some fall flora, so you'll also be able to incorporate Ivy, Foxgloves, and even piles of scattered leaves to add to the ambiance.¬†

Finally, the Twilight Pack will also bring you a brand new Campaign Scenario, the first one since the Arctic Pack!¬†Dominic Myers has abandoned a Transylvanian zoo in a state of complete disrepair, and Nancy is going to need your help to fix it up. You'll also have to contend with the needs of an in-world-famous Himalayan Bear, which guests are flocking to in droves - with the spotlight on you, you will need to make sure the Bear is getting everything they need. We're sure you're up to the task!

[The Planet Zoo: Twilight Pack is available now on Steam for ¬£7.99 ($9.99, 9.99‚Ç¨)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2150050/Planet_Zoo_Twilight_Pack/?snr=)

You must have the base Planet Zoo game to be able to play this content. Update 1.11 is out now to install and is free for all players.

Update 1.11 is free and available to all players who own the base Planet Zoo game! Simply update your game now to play.

This free Update has some exciting new features, including Educator Exhibit Demonstrations, Customisable Exhibit Backdrops, New Biome Skirts, a New Animal Behaviour allowing large escaped animals to attack bins and rummage for food, and the addition of Sounds of Summer to your in-game Speakers. You can read more about the free update in the¬†[announcement post](https://steamcommunity.com/games/703080/announcements/detail/3292718815231691548?snr=), but we'll share a selection of highlights for you here, too.¬†

Your guests will be able to get closer to exhibit animals than ever before with new Educator Exhibit Demonstrations, where your Educators can take out exhibit animals and hold them during Educator Talks to give your guests demonstrations.¬†This will be available for a wide range of species¬†and there are different ways your Educators may hold them, so we hope you enjoy seeing how your favourites are included in Talks. Not all species are included as some are either too large or unsafe to handle (so animals such as the Common Death Adder or Golden Poison Frog will have to stay in their exhibit at a safe distance!).

Customisable Exhibit Backdrops are also now available for your Zoo, so that you can use any image you'd like as a 2D backdrop for exhibits. This means you can incorporate theming and customise exhibits like never before - we can't wait to see what you do with this new feature.¬†

Speaking of customisation...Update 1.11 also brings with it 12 New Biome Skirts and 1 Reskin Design, which will provide more variation to your zoo maps, and allow for more diverse landscapes for your zoos.¬†

Some of your animals will also exhibit a new behaviour upon escaping their habitats - attacking bins! If a large enough animal escapes their habitat, they'll knock over bins around your zoo and begin eating the contents...yuck! Luckily, as the contents of your bin will be leftover food from your guests, your animals won't get sick from this new behaviour. This¬†

*will*

¬†impact the quality of their last meal, though, so they might be a little unhappy until they're returned to their habitat and given access to fresh food more in keeping with their needs.¬†

If you joined us for the Sounds of Summer launch stream, or have managed to enjoy the¬†album on YouTube¬†since, we've got a treat for you! You'll now be able to use these tracks on your in-game speakers, bringing the chilled lo-fi vibes to your zoo and giving your guests (and you!) the perfect soundtrack to say goodbye to summer with.¬†

There are lots more features included in Update 1.11, including new Piebald variants of some species, exhibit camera improvements, a ramp terrain stamp, and more! For more information, read the¬†[Update 1.11 announcement post](https://steamcommunity.com/games/703080/announcements/detail/3292718815231691548?snr=), or check out the full Update Notes, below!¬†

We can't wait to see what you create with the Planet Zoo: Twilight Pack and the new features in Update 1.11! Don't forget to join us for a launch livestream later today, on¬†Twitch¬†or¬†YouTube.

**New Content - Free Update 1.11.0**  


* **NEW - Automated Exhibit Population Management**
   * We have added a new mechanism by which you can delegate repeat population management in exhibits.
   * Animal populations in exhibits can now be managed automatically in accordance to user-defined rule sets. For both male and female animals in the exhibit, set the following rules:
      * Max. number of animals
      * Processing options:
      * Removal Priority:
      * Exemptions:
* **NEW - Piebald Colourmorph Gene**
   * Piebaldism describes patterns of unpigmentes areas across an animal's skin or coat, resulting in really unique-looking patterns. This rare genetic expression is now available to the following species in Planet Zoo:
      * Nyala
      * Pronghorn Antelope
      * Springbok
      * Red Fox
   * Like other morphs, piebaldism is inherited recessively.
   * On animals that can exhibit morphs other than leucism/albinism, piebaldism may be expressed additively - so keep an eye out for colourful combinations!
* **NEW - Educator Exhibit Demonstrations**
   * Educators are now able to hold and showcase exhibit animals to guests during an animal talk about an exhibit species
   * These animations are available to all species that aren't too large or unsafe to handle (so animals such as the Common Death Adder or Golden Poison Frog will have to stay in their exhibit at a safe distance!). Animals that can be held are:
      * Giant Burrowing Cockroach
      * Titan Beetle
      * Goliath Beetle
      * Giant Forest Scorpion
      * Giant Tiger Land Snail

# What is Psyber-X

**Psyber-X** is a play to earn first person shooter NFT blockchain game.

**Phase 1**
Royal Reptile Studios is building Psyber-X to launch initially as a 10 versus 10 brawler where players will battle it out for Level (LVL) token and bragging rights. It is a switchable first and third person shooter game built on Unreal Engine 5.

**Phase 2**
Once the game is launched into closed beta, the next phase of development begins, the land 'between' the brawls - the PsyberVerse.  With a myriad of mini-games and activities planned to give all of PsyberX NFTs, and those of our partners, deep utility within an expanding ecosystem and player driven economy, while continuing to develop the different FPS game environments available across the map

**Future Phases and Updates**
We will integrate lands and partnership advertising through them, this includes the possibility to 'broadcast into' the live PvP matches.

# Psyber-Decks

Who knew that a few NFTs could cause people to get up to no good? Grab your commons and uncommons, boys...the Rares and Legendaries are about to get overwhelmed in this battle scene of NFT vs NFT. Each NFT within the Psyber-X line up has been assigned stats with varying strengths, defenses, speed, etc. There are some NFTs in Psyber-X that have been given special powers over others and of course counters have been built in to smack the powerful ones back and keep them in line. There is balance, but it will only take playing to find out where the ""easter eggs"" are and what strategies work best. 

If you're not familiar with ""Easter Eggs"" in terms of movies and games, it means there are hidden gems throughout the game. In this case, some cards that you'd expect to be weak turn out to be strong. While the rarities have been set by our crews here at Psyber-X, Psyber-Decks has added some spice by flipping the rules. They're programming it, so it's their rules and their stats. Wanna find an ""Easter Egg"" NFT amongst the commons or uncommons? Guess you'll have to grab a crate or two.

![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/psyberx/23wzxhoKpMiEv2U2aUFb2tQBRTXN63aM2ZbXf7jiWumj86AQw4bxhjj1bXSmYqLEhK5f8.png)

## Psybercrates

Each Psybercrate holds 5 NFTs. You can buy them at http://www.psyberxmarket.com where you can connect your Hive wallet and pick up the latest and greatest NFTs. Psybercrates are currently purchasable with Hive or HBD for a limited time. In the coming months, we intend to allow purchasing of crates with LVL only. 

# <center>*** Exclusive Special ***</center>

![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/psyberx/23wM2aBesoiyyjXBwKjk5xRHrxa6exAPvKNXJNywUNiJzewuTTQR9rbRPXapgssvZb7oo.png)

If you buy 2 crates in the market, you'll qualify to test Psyber-Decks in its ***Alpha*** testing phase. That means once it's ready for players to test it, you'll be able to jump in. That gives you 10 NFTs to play. When the full version comes out, you'll need at least 5 NFTs.

# Psybercrate Accessibility

The current Psybercrates have a limit. There are only 100K crates. That may sound like a lot; however, nearly 10,000 crates have already been distributed/purchased. That leaves approx. 90,000 crates to go. This is the first wave of NFTs developed by **Psyber-X**. Just like games similar to Magic the Gathering(c), Psyber-Decks will allow variety for your NFT holdings. When MTG first came out, the first cards (called Alphas) became very valuable later on. Who knows if the same will happen with Psyber-X NFTs? We don't...but you may be in for a treat when you can use your NFTs in multiple ways...

# Psyber-X NFT uses

Psyber-Decks is going to be the first mini-game provided by these side developers (*Psyber-Decks is not developed by the Psyber-X crew, but we're providing the information they need to be able to incorporate our NFTs*). They've already let us know that there are several other games they're building at the same time based on gaming formats we all love, like tower defense, top-down shooters, and of course Psyber-Decks which is a turn-based strategy game. Therefore...if you own NFTs from Psyber-X, you'll be able to play Psyber-X related games. With that also comes the ability to rent your NFTs to others who will play.

# Renting NFTs/""Scholarships""

Similar to other games on the Hive blockchain, once Psyber-Decks is up and running, you will be able to rent out the NFTs you own to others. I also know several people who have told me they're buying crates to partner with others who will play on their behalf. If you're not familiar with this, the way it works is one person owns a set of NFTs. We'll pretend it's 25. They find someone who is really good at strategy games. The two join into a partnership where one plays using the other's NFTs and they split the reward based on a percentage they both agree upon. This way, someone who does not have the funds to buy an NFT can connect with someone who does and ***voila!*** a partnership is made and both are satisfied. Did someone mention risk?

# Risk Based Games

First, let's discuss risk...In risk-based games, you ante up something with the chance of earning something in return based on your skills or based on chance. Psyber-Decks is a game based on how strong your NFTs are vs your opponent's and how skillful you are at challenging their attacks and defenses. Will bots be able to play? Yes they will. But just like anything, they'll have to be programmed first, and if you have better NFTs than the bots, then the bots lose and you take the winner's plunder. So your ability to win is not set in stone just because a bot is playing. You still have to use a strategy to beat your opponent.

<center>https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/900944174902304770/958064108236845086/lvl1.gif</center>

# Cost

Every mini-game, like Psyber-Decks, will have an ante to play; however, they will each also have a **Practice** mode where you can play just ""for funsies."" At first the game may set differing ante amounts or they may allow players to set the terms, but this is still being developed. There will be a take by the developers for providing the game and it will range between 1-5%. This information will be provided at a later date. The hope is that sponsored games will also be provided so that those who own NFTs but don't have LVL can join a sponsored game to earn some LVL, then reuse that LVL in the anted games. A minimum of NFTs are needed to play; therefore, Psyber-Decks will not be a free play-to-earn game, but entry into the game will be as low as buying 1 crate of 5 NFTs. If you have questions or concerns, feel free to ask the team.

### Recap:

**Psyber-Decks** is a turn-based strategy mini-game being developed to use **Psyber-X** NFTs. If you'd like to be able to play the game before anyone else, you simply need to buy 2 Psybercrates at http://www.Psyberxmarket.com for the Alpha testing access.

Ability: The Pangolins body is covered in sharp scales that are as hard as steel that provide it with protection not only that but the user can also curl themselves into a ball thus providing them a powerful attack and defense. this also allows the user enhanced defense when they enter combat making them a walking tank not to mention the tail has very sharp armored scales being able to be used as a piercing or blunt weapon

[boulder defense mode](https://somoskudasai.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/BitesA-1024x578.jpg): the user curls into a ball and stays still protecting them from attacks

[Boulder crash](https://makeagif.com/i/fG4bGo): the user curls into a ball as strong as steel dashing forward crashing into enemies and running them over

[Defense counter](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DYhE3sRWAAAMF52?format=jpg&name=large): the user loosens their defense a bit tricking enemies into striking the area until in which the user clamps down onto the enemies limb trapping them then rolls around as the enemy will be thrashed around the area or the user can spin in place as the sharp scales would cut into the enemies limb as if it was a saw until the limb comes off

**GARUDA PRIME ACCESS**

Awash in crimson and shimmering gold, Garuda Prime has emerged! Add Garuda Prime, exclusive Prime Accessories, Weapons, Boosters and more with Prime Access, or earn Relics in-game to craft Garuda Prime, Nagantaka Prime and Corvas Prime in your Foundry. 

Garuda Prime and her signature Prime gear tear through the battlefield with razor-sharp talons and sanguine bloodletting. Experience Garuda‚Äôs reworked abilities and witness the queen of gore get deadlier the more blood is spilled.  


[8bcc25efbc6e867bc2735b63a28ae237.jpg](https://n9e5v4d8.ssl.hwcdn.net/uploads/8bcc25efbc6e867bc2735b63a28ae237.jpg)

**Garuda Prime**  
White, gold and deepest scarlet, the queen of gore in full regalia. She also has increased Energy and Armor stats, along with an additional Madurai slot. 

Her Talons also have increased base damage and Critical Chance stats. 

**Nagantaka Prime**  
A golden version of Garuda‚Äôs versatile crossbow, as fashioned by the Orokin‚Äôs finest weaponsmiths. Alt-fire to let loose a barrage of bolts. All bolts have a chance to cause Bleeding, and Headshots have a chance to increase Reload Speed. When wielded by Garuda the Nagantaka gains a slight Punch Through effect. 

**Corvas Prime**  
Flaunting ceremonial beauty, this arch-gun flak-cannon is even more devastating than its standard issue counterpart. 

**Exclusive Garuda Prime Glyphs**

**Garuda Prime Accessories includes:**

  * Kukri Prime Armor 
  * Sanguinax Prime Ephemera 
  * 90-Day Affinity Booster 
  * 90-Day Resource Booster 



When Garuda Prime enters Prime Access, the following items will be added to the Prime Vault. If you have Relics that contain these items they will remain in your Inventory. 

  * Titania Prime 
  * Corinth Prime 
  * Pangolin Prime 



With this Vaulting comes the shift of the following Syndicate Sacrifices: 

  * Replaced Arbiters of Hexis Sacrifice of Corinth Prime Barrel to Astilla Prime Barrel 
  * Replaced Arbiters of Hexis Sacrifice of Titania Prime Neuroptics to Gara Prime Chassis 
  * Replaced New Loka Sacrifice of Titania Prime Systems to Nezha Prime Chassis 
  * Replaced Steel Meridian Sacrifice of Pangolin Prime Handle to Zakti Prime Receiver 



_Note on Garuda Prime Relics: We have skipped Neo N19 in Relic naming convention and went straight to Neo N20 due to chat linking issues we encountered in testing._

If you already wield the power of these Primes or have their Relics in your Inventory, they will remain after the Vaulting. 

Garuda Prime Access begins March 28 on all platforms. Don‚Äôt miss out on adding the queen of gore‚Äôs full regalia to your Arsenal! Find the Prime Access packs here:<https://www.warframe.com/prime-access>

HELP! - Moving LUNA from Avalanche C-Chain to the Ethereum Network,u_sunlyleon,to9ymq,2022-03-25 20:52:51,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_sunlyleon/comments/to9ymq/help_moving_luna_from_avalanche_cchain_to_the/,sunlyleon,,"  

I got into this ""Pangolin Triple Rewards Super Farm"" https://app.pangolin.exchange/#/png/2 since more than 6-7 weeks ago, and now that I have harvested the triple rewards of some PNG, WAVAX and LUNA which by its default the farm had placed these rewards into my Avalanche wallet in C-Chain. I could also be able to see these tokens in my ""LEDGER Controlled"" Metamask wallet which were both being set up with Avalanche Network as well as the Ethereum Mainnet.

However, in the last few days I have spent many hours struggling to move my earned LUNA reward from the Avalanche wallet to the Ethereum blockchain where I may then possibly bridge the token to Terra Station and eventually to the Osmosis Zone. Tried as I might, the LUNA remained un-budge inside of my Avalanche C-Chain although I had been charged twice on gas fee of the two (prompted successful) attempts to send this token over to the Ethereum Network. Since my wallets are connected to LEDGER, and I noticed that both the Avalanche Network and Ethereum Mainnet on my Metamask wallet are having the same identical wallet receiving address. I wonder if this might be the problem. Any advice from anyone would be greatly appreciated. To the extent, I am close to giving up trying. Thank you."

This has been one of the most informative and friendly crypto subreddits I've seen. I run a crypto research company's website and write for their YT channel and it was when I was assigned a script about LUNA that I discovered this sub. It's great.

Anyway, while researching another topic I found that Pangolin (a native AVAX DEX) has a 'Super Farm' with boosted return of 18% on its UST-USDC pool. And it pays that 18% in one of 3 ways including LUNA. Enjoy.

They say that 'it takes one to know one', and therefore, as a Count, and non-WEF vampyre, it may turn out badly to stir up global fear of my kind amongst the general populace in order to 'fight the pandemic' (itself a vampyre's metaphor), but that is a risk One must take.

The 'virus' and it's 'variants', I say to you, are allegories of the enemies of the 'NWO'.

Doing a little more research, I [read](https://vireviews.com/pangolin-dex-introduces-the-super-farm-program-offering-up-to-10-token-rewards-on-a-single-farm/) that they are going to launch ‚Äúsuper farms‚Äù, which is what they call a new version of yield farming that lets you earn multiple tokens for liquidity provision. Nothing new right?

Except they will allow you to earn up to TEN TOKENS simultaneously. I haven't‚Äô seen any other platform offer this, but I could be wrong there. The basic reward is the $PNG token + the other token, but the pangolin team says that developers can add multiple tokens on top of that. A few of these super farms have already launched.

Pangolin is trying to get some partnerships in place for its super farm program and I‚Äôll be damned if this doesn‚Äôt sound too good to be true. But that‚Äôs the thing, have I just discovered a real life pipe dream or what?"

# Problem: Loud fans, no Coreboot, custom firmware on AMD

Pangolin (pang11) is **infamous** for not having CoreBoot and running proprietary firmware. There is no opitons in the BIOS to modify fan-curves, and there are no s76 software available to modify them either.

I got a pang11 via work, not having read the reviews and what was driving my especially crazy was that the fans were \*always\* running, as it turned out later at a minimum of 30%, even if the CPU temp was at lowly 30C.

# Solution: EmbeddedController SystemD service

The pang11 is based on Clevo, and finally after much searching I forked ([https://github.com/mmt050/clevo-fancontrol/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/mmt050/clevo-fancontrol/blob/master/README.md) a repo I found ([https://github.com/SkyLandTW/clevo-indicator/](https://github.com/SkyLandTW/clevo-indicator/)) which provided manual fan-control via EmbeddedController instructions , but was also bound to gtk to provide an indicator. I run KDE and ideally I would like to have a systemd service with automatic pre-defined fan curve, which was completely silent <50C.

So I forked, took out all GUI references from the source (effectively turned it into a CLI tool), amended the built-in curve to suit me, and modified the default query-output to be be JSON, so it can be re-used by other programs more easily.

&#x200B;

# Energy Budget manipulation with RyzenAdj

Then it became apparent that if I keep the Ryzen 5700U at default TDP and wattage (30W on AC power), I would be still be spinning the fans often (especially during Teams meetings, duh!) . So I found [https://github.com/FlyGoat/RyzenAdj/wiki/Renoir-Tuning-Guide](https://github.com/FlyGoat/RyzenAdj/wiki/Renoir-Tuning-Guide) which is a tool that allows to configure sustained & burst max-power, as well as max temperature for Renoir and others.

I was willing to sacrifice some sustained multi-core performance to achieve mostly silent operation with minimum fan during long teams meetings. Baseline Geekbench scores for the machine were (1259/7833), and after tinkering with Ryzenadj I arrived at the following settings:

    /usr/bin/ryzenadj ¬†--slow-limit=9000 --fast-limit=13000 --tctl-temp 80

Which allowed me to get to stable & silent 1238/6054, which are respectively 98%  and\~77% of the original power budget.  The settings above effectively mean ""Use 9w sustained, and burst to max 13w"" It's impressive but not unexpected that the CPU could still perform so well withing that budget.

# Notes:

* A systemd service is needed to maintain the ryzenadj settings on wakeup from sleep, and startup.
* Two UDEV rules are needed to maintain ryzenadj on plugging in/out (AC<->battery transitions),
* Another systemd service is needed to keep the clevo-fancontrol  running.
* Examples of all of these are in the repo.
* My energy curve for temp X (note I have a tctl-temp 80C, which means I throttle at 80C):
   * X <50C -> 0%
   * 50C < X < 60C -> 16% (\~1100rpm)
   * 60C < X < 70C -> 30% (\~3100 rpm)
   * 70C < X < 80C -> 40%
   * 80C < X < 85C -> 65%
   * 85C < X < 87.5 -> 90%
   * 90C < X            -> 100%

&#x200B;

# Disclaimers:

* I am not a C system coder, my code is probably shitty.
* This is not the \*best\* way to achieve this. That would be coreboot open-source firmware.
* My built-in fan curve wont be perfect for anyone but myself.

TL;DR - if you're bothered by constantly running fans, on pang11, you'll read the whole thing
