Investment Thesis: Occidental Petroleum (OXY) [2025],u_YetAnotherSpeculator,1i9v4yx,2025-01-25 14:41:38,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_YetAnotherSpeculator/comments/1i9v4yx/investment_thesis_occidental_petroleum_oxy_2025/,YetAnotherSpeculator,,"Dear Redditors,

In this letter, I will explain why Warren Buffett invested in Occidental Petroleum and why I am too.

Let me start with how Warren Buffett has basically bought himself a risk-free bond yielding 10% with future growth potential that have very very long runways. And yes, oil prices matter... sort of…

**What happens when oil prices are high?**

Well, back in Q1 2023, OXY redeemed 6.47% of Berkshire Hathaway’s preferred shares after a record 2022 where worldwide oil prices averaged at $91.91 in Q1, $100.10 in Q2, $98.30 in Q3, and $94.36 in Q4 of 2022 (based on OXY's Q1 2023 10-Q).

The redemption was mandatory, due to a provision in the preferred stock where if (in the trailing 12 months) OXY spends more than $4.00 per share in either:(i) dividends paid to common shareholders and (ii) repurchases of the common stock, then the amount above $4.00 per share must be redeemed at a 10% premium.

At the time, the long-term federal funds rate (FFR) was reaching 5%. Given OXY’s credit ratings Baa3 by Moody’s and BB+ by S&P and Fitch, the interest on OXY’s debt would’ve been \~6% to 7%. Interest payments have tax benefits. Preferred shares do not. This is why Warren Buffett said ""this makes sense"" during his annual shareholder meeting.

So in the high oil prices scenario, depending on the FFR rate, preferred decreases, debt decreases, buybacks increase, earnings increase, and the stock price increases (perhaps some multiple expansion too, depending on how Mr. Market feels).

**What happens when oil prices are low?**

This is where things get interesting as Warren Buffett has found downside protection.

(1) OXY is one of the most efficient oil producers claiming production costs that break even at $40 worldwide oil price which puts a nice margin of safety on earnings. 

(2) The preferred shares are immortal. With lower capital amounts returned to shareholders, preferreds are unlikely to get redeemed. Even if we get Paul Volckered at some point, the tax benefit strategy redeeming preferreds over debt no longer works. 

(3) Low oil prices bring down the oil production of the United States and OXY contributes to about \~1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd). The US is in a very strong position to affect oil prices and I highly doubt they US wants to cede energy price control back to OPEC. Moreover, the United State's lead in oil production is mutually beneficial as OPEC countries seek to diversify from oil driven economies.

(4) US oil majors (perhaps all oil majors) are no longer interested in the boom and bust cycle that wreaks havoc on supply chains and drives inflation. Price stability is in the world’s best interest. Crashing oil prices, I would say, is unlikely -- despite Donald Trump's economic illiteracy.

(5) Not to offend some Warren Buffet cultists, but it appears he is also decreasing the float of the company to add some stock price stability which could indirectly protect credit ratings from volatile price action and bipolar bull/bear sentiment on oil. Remember, he described OXY’s volume as a gambling parlor and being able to buy his entire stake in 2 weeks. Warren Buffett also owns some warrants too, so it’s a win-win for both.

**What does that leave for the rest of us?**

Assuming oil prices stay in the current $70 to $90 range, OXY’s earnings are relatively predictable.

Now, excuse me for using EPS. I know it's a sin, but for simplicity, just listen to me.

Some quarters will come in low range (maybe $0.50) while other quarters come in the high range ($1.50). Depending how Mr. Market feels about oil (bullish or bearish due to geopolitics, renewables, etc), OXY’s price may swing +/- 30%. But in the long-term, the earnings will average out, debt will decrease, preferred shares will  be redeemed, dividends increased, buybacks increased, and OXY will be an opportunistic consolidator (this is where Warren Buffett’s trust in Vicki’s capital allocation is crucial).

So it's clear Warren Buffet is making out like a bandit, so why are other super investors such as Li Lu buying a stake in the company?

Believe it or not, I believe these super investors are ***speculating*** on OXY’s competitive advantage in carbon management, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech -- after all “safe investments make for safe speculation.”

Crazy, I know, but before you stop reading, hear me out.

OXY is basically a high yielding bond with two growth driver’s that have very *very* long runways: 

1. Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE)
2. Carbon Management via Direct Air Capture (DAC) and Carbon Sequestration

I’ll start with the less controversial one…

**TerraLithium: Direct Lithium Extraction**

If you didn’t know TerraLithium is a 50-50 joint venture between a start-up, All American Lithium, and a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum. All American Lithium was the latest iteration of a company that originally formed to [acquire the assets](https://www.desertsun.com/story/tech/science/energy/2017/02/10/salton-sea-geothermal-plant-would-use-lithium-tech-caught-teslas-eye/97743092/) of Simbol Materials, which developed a much-hyped and highly secretive lithium extraction process. Simbol Materials’ technology impressed \*\*Elon Musk\*\* (yes, you read that correctly) so much that Tesla offered to buy the start-up for $325 million. But the deal fell apart, and a few months later Simbol Materials went bust.

Fast forward to today:

https://preview.redd.it/svafhv50b7fe1.png?width=1913&format=png&auto=webp&s=f03f01e606af2526a2bcd1c0ffad551218bc55f7

**Berkshire Hathaway Energy owns 10 out of the 11 geothermal power plants in the Salton Sea and TerraLithium has over 40 patents relating to direct lithium extraction from geothermal brine. Together, they are working to tap the estimated 18 million metric tons of lithium suspended in geothermal brine. That's the equivalent to half of the current global production of lithium. It's enough to make over 375 million electric vehicle batteries. The depth of the Salton Sea's reserves dwarf other potential reserves such as the  Smackover Formation or hectorite clay, recovered oil field brines, recycled electronics, etc.**

https://preview.redd.it/xqkq8gd9a7fe1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4e09c4b2cb943454ef30eebcb7bb0debd13f483

The 11th geothermal power plant is owned by a competitor EnergySource Minerals who is also trying to extract lithium from geothermal brine. Despite being closer to a commercially viable solution, EnergySource Minerals attempted to challenge TerraLithium's patent for being ""too general"" which may suggest that TerraLithium's patent claims are competitively advantaged (on top of the scale advantage provided by Berkshire Hathaway Energy). The other competitor called Controlled Thermal Resources must start from scratch (the project being dubbed  “Hell’s Kitchen”). That is, build a geothermal power plant and then add the direct lithium extraction tech which, compared to Berkshire Hathaway Energy and TerraLithium, has high execution risk. Moreover, Berkshire Hathaway Energy has been running their geothermal plants for decades and TerraLithium has decades of experience with carbon, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech.

Any regulatory hurdles will be minimal: (1) At the national level, there's a strong bipartisan push for lithium independence. (2) At the state level, the government plans on taxing all extracted lithium. (3) At the local community level, there's a powerful incentive to revitalize communities that were destroyed by the drying of the Salton Sea which exposed toxic lakebed dust containing pesticides and heavy metals. New direct lithium extraction facilities offer a chance for regional revival creating an estimated 80,000 new jobs. (4) Direct lithium extraction from geothermal brine is significantly greener than hard rock mining and solar evaporation of brine.

**If you ever wondered why Warren Buffet chose his successor to be Greg Abel (*****the current CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy*****) this is probably a major contributing factor.**

I have no idea what TerraLithium will be worth, but in Q2 2024 Occidental Petroleum did a “small” fair value adjustment of $27 million and they plan on licensing the technology in future (a fixed cost shielded from the cyclicality of lithium prices).

Now, onto the more controversial one…

**1PointFive: Carbon Management**

Anti-oil company climate activists can stop reading now.

On May 18^(th), 2024, at CERAWeek by S&P Global -- an annual global energy conference focusing on the industry’s biggest goals and challenges -- Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman interviewed CEO Vicki Hollub to discuss Occidental Petroleum’s CrownRock Acquisition in December 2023. 

In the latter half of the interview, Vicki Hollub details a clear path for how Occidental Petroleum will transition to a Carbon Management Company, via their subsidiary 1PointFive:

>“We've been using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery for over 50 years. It's a core competence of ours; we understand how CO2 works, how to manage it, and how to handle it effectively. We have the necessary infrastructure in the Permian Basin for this.

>For a long time, we attempted to capture anthropogenic CO2 from industrial sources. This proved to be challenging because negotiating with industrial sites to retrofit equipment for carbon capture was difficult. We started this effort back in 2008 but were unsuccessful in making it happen with any partners.”

Vicki is talking about Occidental Petroleum’s previously failed Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) venture called Century. Built in 2010, Century was intended to be the largest carbon capture facility in the world, aiming to handle over 20% of global CCS capacity. Integrated into a natural gas processing plant, Century was designed to capture carbon dioxide before it could be released into the atmosphere by using two engines: one capable of capturing 5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and the other able to capture more than 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.

However, a **Bloomberg Green** investigation found satellite data showing that cooling towers on one of the engines didn’t function, suggesting that Century never operated at more than a third of its capacity in the 13 years it’s been running. The technology worked but the economics didn’t hold up because of limited gas supplied from a nearby field, leading to disuse and eventual divestment by Occidental Petroleum who sold off the project in 2022 for $200 million to Mitchell Group - significantly less than the original $1.1 Billion invested into Century.

The painful lesson: while CCS technology worked, the economics are heavily tied to the carbon dioxide emission source. Mainly, the profitability relied on how much carbon dioxide was emitted and negotiating/working with the owners of the emission source. 

Luckily, a new carbon capture technology emerged, direct air capture (DAC), that proved much more economically viable:

>“Then we discovered a carbon capture technology designed to extract CO2 directly from the atmosphere. This was a game-changer for us, akin to finding the holy grail. With this technology, we no longer needed to negotiate with emitters; instead, we could control our own development pace and schedule. This direct air capture approach allows us to operate when and where it makes the most sense.”

Learning from the failed venture of Century, Vicki believes that DAC is more economically viable because the source of carbon dioxide is pulled out of the atmosphere (not carbon dioxide emission sources) which shifts the bottleneck to cost reduction of DAC technology. Freed from the complication of carbon dioxide emitters, Occidental Petroleum engineers can focus on building the most cost efficient DAC facility without rushing or technical limitations from carbon dioxide emitters that could result in suboptimal decisions.

>“An added advantage is that the technology uses potassium hydroxide to capture CO2 from the air. We are the largest marketer of potassium hydroxide in the U.S. and the second largest globally. Additionally, for efficient mixing in the contact tower—necessary for optimal CO2 extraction—PVC diffusers are used. We also manufacture PVC, creating synergies with our existing oil and gas and chemical businesses.

>These synergies were fortuitous, and it felt like it was meant for us. However, the economic viability of direct air capture depends on various factors, including the performance of rivals and market conditions.”

>Along with Occident Petroleum’s infrastructure to use captured carbon for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery in the Permian Basin, when it comes to developing DAC, Occidental Petroleum already has part of the supply chain for DAC vertically integrated.

The main challenge that remains is the fact that DAC is a rather expensive process. According to a news post by Julie Chao from Berkeley Labs on April 20^(th), 2022, DAC costs about $600 per metric ton of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) with the following 2 factors driving up the cost: (1) Separating the carbon dioxide from the reactive absorbent -- usually potassium hydroxide -- requires a costly heating process. (2) Carbon dioxide’s poor solubility in water requires a costly pressurizing process to sequester the carbon dioxide in a saline reservoir to use later for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery.

Despite the US tax credit of $180 per metric ton of carbon dioxide removal that is directly captured from the atmosphere, the overall economics make DAC a money losing venture with a theoretical net loss of $420 per metric ton of DAC CDR.

However, Vicki talks about a developing carbon credit market, where DAC CDR credits can be sold for a premium with increasing demand:

>“We plan to launch the first phase of Stratos, our direct air capture facility in the Permian Basin, by mid-next year. We have already sold about 70% of the carbon reduction credits for the facility, which will ultimately handle 500,000 tons of CO2 per year. The demand is strong, coming from airlines, tech companies, consulting firms, and others interested in reducing their carbon footprint.

>These buyers are part of the voluntary compliance market, focusing on offsetting their carbon emissions. This should provide us with a steady cash flow from the facility.

>As for when the facility will break even and become profitable, it depends on the value of credits beyond those we’ve already sold. While credit prices are currently rising due to limited availability, I hope to have a clearer picture in two years. We’ll check back with you as things continue to evolve.”

At full capacity, Stratos will collect 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year costing at least $300 million in annual operational expenses. In combination with the $180 DAC CDR credits, Stratos is projected to lose $420 per metric ton of CDR which is an annualized loss of $210 million. 

However, as Vicki points out, companies are willing to pay a premium for DAC CDR credits, which may help subsidize and offset the loss. Here’s a list deals that were already made:

Climate activists' be damned, but carbon must be removed from the air in order to revert climate change.

*That is a fact.*

All startups so far have produce subscale solutions that are not economically viable to reach the scale to offset carbon emissions, let alone reverse it.

*OXY has a scalable solution via their subsidiary 1PointFive.*

In order to effectively decarbonize the atmosphere, **thousands** (think a few thousand at minimum) of these DAC plants will need to be built, and OXY is vertically integrated to do so.

**History doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes.**

Crazy or not, I believe buying OXY now is like buying Nvidia.

Nvidia’s GPUs have proven various use cases from gaming, crypto, to AI.

Similarly, OXY’s expertise in carbon, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech has proven various use cases from carbon based enhanced oil recovery, lithium extraction, carbon sequestration, and other decarbonization efforts.

The difference: 

Nvidia’s growth is fueled by **speculative demand** for crypto and artificial intelligence. The world has yet to see returns, but plans on spending $1 trillion over the next few years on AI hoping the economics will work out.

*If that isn’t speculation, I don’t know what is.*

And believe me, I understand this tech more than you ever would think. A colleague of mine who has a PhD in CS told me exactly the many use cases of GPUs, but I didn't buy it because: (1) I viewed AI as speculative. (2) Because of reason 1, I expected companies to invest slowly and cautiously. I mean, just look at how the market reacted to Mark Zuckerberg's push into the Metaverse. (3) Because of reason 1 and 2, I expected a slow growth rate where Nvidia's moat would erode in a 3 to 5 year time frame to competitors (something that is happening as we speak -- i.e. CUDA on AMD) before Nvidia could make a killing.

In fact, my stance on tech in general can be summarized as so:

>The reality of tech companies is that they age rapidly — like dog years squared. Moats flash in and out of existence within 2 to 3 years time (along with their valuations). The odds of finding the next Oracle are slim to none, because it's almost certain that the world will never rely on a single relational database architecture again. The main worries in tech are competition, growth, value-cre-ation, and value-ation. When competition enters the space, investors should pack their bags since the rapid democratization of information allows competition to grow at lightning speeds. The forever holdings are businesses that are entrenched usually for non-technological reasons (i.e Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon, Spotify, Palantir). And lack of technical and algorithmic literacy, makes the chances of accurately determining an enduring business next to none.

With the release of ChatGPT, you can imagine where I went wrong... At that point, I should've just bough the damn company since the growth was obviously higher than I anticipated completely invalidating my original thoughts. But I digress, the focus of this letter isn't about me confessing my sins for missing out on Nvidia...

Speculation aside, Occidental Petroleum’s growth is fueled by **non-speculative demand**: (1) There is real long term demand for lithium making TerraLithium's tech as relevant as ever. (2) Climate change keeps getting worse, the atmosphere will need to be decarbonized, and there's a growing carbon credit market perfect for 1PointFive to dominate. (3) The world still needs oil for the foreseeable future, so I can sleep every night knowing Occidental Petroleum's core business will still be here when I wake up.

Overall, I buy whenever OXY nears single digit earnings multiples or reaches an acceptable free cash flow yield (adjusted for things I deem reasonable like Warren's preferred shares).

For me OXY is a safe vehicle to park my money while I wait for other opportunities. And until then, I will just be clipping coupons.

So yeah, oil prices matter... sort of... but, Occidental Petroleum has some other things too...

ODSP overpayment,legaladvicecanada,1i9ss0u,2025-01-25 12:59:57,1,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/1i9ss0u/odsp_overpayment/,SpecificAd1181,:24px-Flag_of_Ontario:Ontario,"Hi, I have a family member who was receiving money through ODSP and another government program for about five years. He is elderly and has very little understanding of his obligations, and as a result, he did not report the income he was receiving from the other program to ODSP. Now, five years later, ODSP has ordered him to repay the overpayment, which amounts to around $50,000—a significant amount for him.

A few days ago, I went to a legal aid office with him to seek advice on how to handle this situation. They provided us with a few options. The first option was to essentially do nothing and allow the debt to transfer to the CRA. The second option was to negotiate a payment plan, and the third option was to appeal the decision with the tribunal.

However, I found the first option a bit confusing, as the way it was explained to us seemed too good to be true. They told us that all we needed to do was let the debt transfer to the CRA and that the only impact on him would be losing tax credits, such as the GST/HST credit, carbon tax rebate, Ontario Trillium benefits, and similar payments.

My questions for those who may have faced a similar situation or have knowledge about this are:

1. How accurate is the information we received from the legal aid office?
2. Are there other ways the CRA might attempt to recover the debt?
3. Will he still be able to apply for and receive Old Age Security (OAS) while having a debt with the CRA?

I look forward to your comments and suggestions, and let me know if you need any more details.

I moved out of Canada to work abroad in  Feb 2023, and in Nov 2024, I hired an accountant to do my non-resident taxes. I now owe an amount to the CRA for benefits and credits. The amounts are as follows:

* GST/HST credit: 441.75
* Ontario energy and property tax credit & Northern Ontario energy credit: 584.60
* Ontario sales tax credit: 453.00
* Canada Carbon Rebate: 488.00

I called the CRA, and the representative told me that there is no interest or due date for benefits and credits. Can someone confirm if this is true? It’s a bit hard to believe that there is no due date. I’m not in the best financial situation and would ideally like to pay it back in multiple installments."

A novice fragrance collector's review:,fragrance,1i9ru23,2025-01-25 12:18:44,10,0.92,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1i9ru23/a_novice_fragrance_collectors_review/,Spiritual_Sir_9079,REVIEW,"Hi everyone! I hope your day is going well. 

I started my collection a couple months ago, I hope to keep it growing! I am particularly infatuated with vintages. 

Not all of these are full bottles, that would be nuts (and expensive). Most of the reviews are from samplers or decants I am testing to then see if they're full bottle worthy. 

I would love to hear your thoughts if you have tested any of these as well! Enjoy reading!

*Tobacco Oud:* The opening is very boozy, then: woody, tobacco-y, and spicy. It is a tad smokey, as well. I really enjoy the smooth sweetness from the tobacco. I want to emphasize that smooth quality, I think that is what made this fragrance a stand-out. Now, bear with me through the following words: I like the *concept* of liquor in fragrances. If “cognac,” or “scotch” is mentioned as being in a fragrance, my ears perk up. The problem is, typically when the note of a certain drink is used, it’s found in the opening of a fragrance (the top), so your shot with an immediate blast of alcohol when you first spray it. This has been an area of dislike for me, because most fragrances are alcohol based, leading my brain to believe that I am being with a poorly crafted perfume, when in reality, it’s to opposite. I guess what I am trying to say, in short, is that I don’t care for boozy notes in fragrances as much as I care for the idea of them. All that aside, I am in love with what this fragrance becomes. Smooth (there’s that word again), sensual, tobacco-filled, slightly oriental, and masculine. Longevity is great and, surprisingly the projection was to my standards, not being to beastly. **(8/10)**

**CoSTUME NATIONAL**

*Scent Intense:* A bright, fresh, sweet, and green opening. It had a very clean quality to it, I really enjoyed it. The florals make their way in quickly, deepening the scent, which may also be credited to the cinnamon. The longevity is around 6 hours, and the projection is not beastly. The dry down is very amber-y. It was sensual and pleasing, though, for me, uninteresting. I enjoyed the opening better. **(4/10)**

**FRAGRANCE OF IRELAND**

*Patrick:* A stunning green fougere, I’m in awe of this fragrance at first spray. The green notes on top are completely timeless and crisp. After a moment, there is a deeper green scent that comes through. It may be the fern or oak moss, which is later trailed by a hint of carnation. The florals add their powdery, classic touch after a couple minutes, emphasizing the timelessness of this fragrance. Once that fades, it settles into that nice, dark green, slightly bitter aroma. It doesn’t last forever, but listen- The PRICE on this fragrance makes any complaint non-existent. It is wonderfully *classic.* **(9/10)**

**GIORGIO BEVERLY HILLS**

*Extraordinary (original formula):* This deep golden juice is BEAUTIFUL. I also have the current formula (from 2021), and the difference between their colors is night and day. The opening is a blast of aldehydes, florals, something musty (in the most pleasant way), spices, and slightly orange-like. It’s a true chypre, reminiscent of a bygone era. Once settled, the honey comes out, and though I usually loathe honey in fragrance, it works nicely here. Though, of course, isn’t suitable for all occasions, I enjoy it. It follows the same lines as the original Givency *Gentleman*, or Hugo Boss *No.1*, both fragrances I adore. The deeper the dry down, the better this fragrance becomes. The base is smoothed out to perfection and blended like no other. Longevity is great. **(9/10)** 

**DEMETER**

*Pipe Tobacco Cologne:* An extremely linear fragrance. You are met with a dry, sweet tobacco note that remains throughout the entirety of this fragrance, however there is also a slight spice-filled quality to the fragrance, one that I did not enjoy. Luckily, the strength of the initial blast fades rather quickly, leaving that faint funkiness to be a thing of moments ago. Overall, this is a realistic pipe tobacco fragrance. That’s it. It doesn’t have wonderful performance, but for the price, who can complain? The value for these bottles is kind on the wallet. **(2/10)**

**CALVIN KLEIN**

*Obsession for Men (original formula):* THE GIRL OF MY DREAMS GAVE ME A COMPLIMENT WHILE WEARING THIS, IMMEDIATE TEN OUT OF TEN!!! As head over heels I was (am), here is a more tasteful review: The initial blast is bright and citrus-filled, but soon after you get a smooth sweetness. That lavender is *delicious*. As the spices surround it, you get a smooth, clean, and seductive fragrance. It has a classic feel to it, but not so much so that it minimizes its sensuality. The base notes are hard to identify individually, but that speaks volume about the quality of blend. The dry down was wonderful. The longevity is incredible and the projection was good enough for her to smell, so it’s good enough for me. **(10/10)**

*Eternity for Men (original formula):* The opening is masculine, fresh, citrus filled, but also green and aromatic. The green notes are particularly favorable. Hints of sweetness work their way in, most likely due to the florals, though the fragrance remains aromatic and slightly herbaceous. The dry down is, like *Obsession*, extremely well blended. I was smelling myself for hours. The longevity is 8+ hours, though I cannot speak for the current formula, and the projection was good! **(8/10)**

**MIHAN AROMATICS**

*Sienna Brume:* The first blast contains juniper berry, coconut, and cucumber; very light, breezy, and fresh. Soon after, some spiciness comes through. I definitely get a slight sun screen adjacent smell, most likely due to the coconut, but it isn’t overbearing. This fragrance is definitely reminiscent of somewhere tropical and near the ocean. It has a sea breeze likeness to it.   The dry down was not too far off from the opening, just more faint and possibly more woody. The longevity was around six hours long and the projection is pretty good for the first three hours. Though I wouldn’t often reach for it, its uniqueness is intriguing. **(4/10)**

**ESTEÈ LAUDER** 

*Cinnabar (vintage formula):* That is some STRONG juice. The opening is full of aldehydes, citrus, spices, and light florals. The cloves and spices are strong, though what else could be so fitting for a fragrance, given its namesake. The oriental notes come through, slowly, adding some nice nuance to the fragrance. Again, this is some powerful stuff. I cannot speak to the current formula, but if you get your hands on the vintage- be prepared. I’m not huge on labeling fragrances, but I can confidently say that it leans pretty feminine. Longevity: pretty much eternal. Projection: powerful. I cannot see myself reaching for this often but it’s a special fragrance, that’s for sure. **(6/10)**

**TED LAPIDUS** 

*Lapidus Pour Homme:* I am going to be honest, pin-pointing the individual notes in this fragrance is no easy task. I will start with what I know: this fragrance is a powerhouse! It is reminiscent of the classic, masculine fragrances we know and love (at least I do). I was able to smell honey, which works well with the other notes. I really enjoy the aromatic notes in this fragrance. It is so many things: sweet, musky, masculine, warm, cool, citrusy, aromatic, a bit herbaceous, slightly floral, woody, and smooth. Overall, I love it. That dry down… WHEW! Fantastic. I wish I could give a more descriptive rundown of this fragrance, for that I apologize. The longevity is eternal and the projection was heavy for my liking. **(9/10)**

  
**LOUIS VUITTON:**

*Cactus Garden:* I GOT MY HANDS ON IT! A bright, vivacious opening! Almost immediately, it gets a hint of sweet freshness, reminding one of green gardens, just lightly dewed. The lemon grass makes its way in, adding some bitter citrus to the already fresh scent. The mate deepens the scent, giving it a darker, slightly funkier dry down. It almost becomes a bit sour? I enjoy the first two phases of this fragrance more than the dry down, I would have hoped it stayed more aromatic, slightly sweet, and fresh. The projection is intimate and the longevity is mediocre. Shamefully, I’m more excited to now own this fragrance than I am to actually wear it. **(7/10)**

  
**PENHALIGONS:**

*The Tragedy of Lord George:* A perfect gentleman’s fragrance; very posh, timeless, and reminds me of a gentleman’s lounge, though I’ve never been inside one. You know, the ones in a high society British Gentleman’s Club? The movies I’ve seen them in seem to fit the bill pretty well. There is a soapy, boozy, amber quality throughout this fragrance. Though tobacco isn’t part of this composition, the combination of notes creates a pipe/cigar-like feel. In the 1998 Parent Trap, the Grandfather is described smelling like, “peppermint and pipe tobacco.” Again neither notes are present, but the composition creates the image of a man such as him. The performance is good! **(8/10)**  

  
*Halfeti Leather:* I liked the strength of the opening, which, after a minute, settles into a much quieter fragrance (or I went nose blind). The opening had some lovely notes, there was definitely this overarching aroma of leather, but the lighter notes, such as: bergamot, fruits, and maybe lavender, all dissipated quickly. The scent soon becomes smooth and woody, with the support of spice. I was able to pick up on some florals, which added nuance to the fragrance. They weren’t prevalent, but a very nice addition to the blend. Later, on the dry down it smelled very similarly to Dolce & Gabbana’s *Pour Homme Intenso,* a fragrance I wasn’t crazy about. Longevity was a bit longer than *Halfeti*, at around 6-7 hours. **(5/10)**

  
**LE LABO:**

*Baie 19:* When I first sprayed this, it smelled like all the other Le Labo fragrances, containing a very heavy “pencil shaving” note, which I do not dislike, though I wish was not the case for a variety of fragrances. I really nave no other way to explain what their commonalities smell like, so that’ll have to do. Luckily, I wore this a second time, understanding it more. Having had the pleasure of smelling dried, pure juniper berries, *Baie 19* does capture that essence well. There is something almost aquatic or costal rocky cliff-like about it, as well. The patchouli is evident after the initial spray as well. The longevity is good, and the projection isn’t too beastly. It is very linear, not so complex as other fragrances. It was good, though nothing special. **(4/10)**

  
**BOIS 1920**

*Vetiver Ambrato:* I often find citruses to be dominant on the tops of fragrances. I think *Vetiver Ambrato* did a wonderful job at allowing the aromatic, herbaceous, fougere-adjacent notes of galbanum and artemisia to shine. The bergamot and lemon still make an appearance, though not too garishly. Later, the warmth of florals and spices make for a classic gentleman’s styled fragrance. I enjoyed the dry down, it was warm but not suffocating. The combination of vetiver, mixed with ambers, finished with a touch of vanilla was simply intoxicating. It almost had a tobacco-like aroma, a note I am fond of. The projection was sufficient and the longevity was great. **(8/10)**

  
**EIGHT & BOB**

*Memories de Mustique:* A bright, bergamot, citrus-filled, orange blossom opening. The white florals in here are light and breezy, the way I like them. There is something ever so slightly animalic that creeps its way in, adding a bit of depth and roughness to the smell. I think it may be from the sambac jasmine? It has feminine qualities, but I love it, I think it is one of Eight & Bob’s best fragrances I’ve smelled so far. If you enjoy white florals with the slight tang of orange, this is incredible. It lasted 8 hours on me and the projection was favorable. I could 100% see myself wearing this in the summer, especially on a warm vacation. **(7/10)**

*The Original:* Pepper, lemon, and woods make themselves known in the opening. It has a very fresh, spicy, even *cooling*, quality to it. This fragrance feels classic and gentleman-like, but is still wearable today. It isn’t a fougere, but it has the same feel to it. The ambergris note, though not natural, gives the slight undertone of an aquatic theme. The woods are nice, deepening the scent. It isn’t ground-breaking or new, but it is solid. The projection was good and so was the longevity. I can see myself wearing this in the future. **(7/10)**

*Champs de Provence:* Smooth, juicy pear and citrus head this fragrance, creating a fresh, bright, clean, and refreshing aroma. Florals begin to arrive after a minute, twisting the fragrance into something a bit deeper. The florals stay pretty light, not leaning into the heavy potential of rose, rather leaning in favor of the white florals. The next change in the fragrance was unfavorable to my nose. The base notes listed include: ambroxan, musk, and mate. I’m not sure which of those is was, but mixed with the sweetness of the florals, it created a slight stinginess, that reminiscent of body odor. Though it subsides, the transition was disagreeable. When the fragrance reaches its dry down, the smell reminded me of what it tastes like to eat a raspberry flavored Pez, with an added chemically cleaning spray. I realize that is strangely specific, but thats what I got.

  
**MEO FUSCIUNI**

*Odor 93:* Wow, that opening was something else. I was pleasantly surprised, which is one of my favorite things to be when spraying a fragrance for the first time. *Odor 93* is a fantastic example of how to use florals without leaning too powdery. The use of white florals (tuberose & narcissus) is truly intoxicating and alluring. They have an innocence to them, but it leaves you wanting more. I almost caught a slight minty/medicinal note on the opening, which was strange, but interesting, and not unwelcome. The juxtaposition of the freshly sweet florals against the woody undertones, which become more prevalent on the dry down, makes for a beautiful dance of aroma. There are hints of spices that linger in the air, though not heavy, but essential to the effect of this: *odor*… see what I did there. There is also a slight smokiness. Truthfully, this fragrance isn’t one that seems right for me. I immensely enjoyed it, but not to wear personally. The projection is great and the longevity is the same. **(7/10)** 

*Little Song:* The coffee is definitely noticeable, but the spicy, fresh notes on top are a nice burst of energy before getting into the smoother notes. I *think*, key word “think,” that the pink pepper is what I am mainly smelling on the top. After about five minutes, the coffee makes its way in. Mixed with florals, it makes for a pleasant smell. The rose is also present. I put it on right before going to work, went to my night shift, and after getting home (6 hours later) I could not smell it. It was fine while it lasted, not my favorite in the world. **(3/10)**

**MAISON CRIVELLI**

*Papyrus Moléculaire:* The opening was fresh. Then, it reminded me of something… I couldn’t put my finger on it- Oh, wait. I remember: *Santal 33.* Truthfully, that realization worried me. Here is my take on their similarities; The *concept* of *Santal 33* was more appealing than its execution, in my opinion, not to mention, everyone and their mom was wearing it at its peak. Because *Papyrus Moleculaire* isn’t *trying* to be anything, other than what it is at face value, it’s easier to accept. I also enjoyed the smell a bit better, there was a slight aquatic quality that I thought blend nicely. I cannot speak to what pure sandalwood smells like, but if it’s the note that I found similar in both fragrances, its not my favorite, it smells synthetic/processed; like pencil shavings (I am hoping that it’s a synthetic version of sandalwood because I really want to like the authentic stuff). There is a creaminess to *Papyrus Moleculaire* that was pleasant. I think the overall smell does a really great job at portraying the idea of actual papyrus. The dry down was smooth, slightly sweeter. It was pleasant. Performance was good, incredible longevity and acceptable projection. **(7/10)**

**J.F. SCHWARZLOSE BERLIN**

*Leder 6:* There is a hint of sweet freshness on the opening, though that fades rather quickly. The saffron is faint, and the leather is there. The milky vanilla reveals itself hastily, giving you a smooth, gourmand aroma. I am glad the leather and saffron ease us into the sweetness. There is something, the closer you smell to the skin, that I do not care for. I can’t figure out what it is, but the further my face was to my wrist, the better. It may have actually been the potent vanilla I was smelling up close. Maybe the styrax? Though, I don’t know what styrax smells like. The jury is still out on that one. Anyways, the dry down after 6+ hours is very beautiful and intimate, sweet and smooth. I liked it, though only later on; not enough, however, to purchase a full bottle. Projection is minute and the longevity is great. **(3/10)**"
The Very Last: Occidental Petroleum Investment Thesis,ValueInvesting,1i9nm6c,2025-01-25 09:05:15,88,0.98,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1i9nm6c/the_very_last_occidental_petroleum_investment/,YetAnotherSpeculator,Stock Analysis,"Dear Redditors,

In this letter, I will explain why Warren Buffett invested in Occidental Petroleum and why I am too.

Let me start with how Warren Buffett has basically bought himself a risk-free bond yielding 10% with future growth potential that have very very long runways. And yes, oil prices matter... sort of…

**What happens when oil prices are high?**

Well, back in Q1 2023, OXY redeemed 6.47% of Berkshire Hathaway’s preferred shares after a record 2022 where worldwide oil prices averaged at $91.91 in Q1, $100.10 in Q2, $98.30 in Q3, and $94.36 in Q4 of 2022 (based on OXY's Q1 2023 10-Q).

The redemption was mandatory, due to a provision in the preferred stock where if (in the trailing 12 months) OXY spends more than $4.00 per share in either:(i) dividends paid to common shareholders and (ii) repurchases of the common stock, then the amount above $4.00 per share must be redeemed at a 10% premium.

At the time, the long-term federal funds rate (FFR) was reaching 5%. Given OXY’s credit ratings Baa3 by Moody’s and BB+ by S&P and Fitch, the interest on OXY’s debt would’ve been \~6% to 7%. Interest payments have tax benefits. Preferred shares do not. This is why Warren Buffett said ""this makes sense"" during his annual shareholder meeting.

So in the high oil prices scenario, depending on the FFR rate, preferred decreases, debt decreases, buybacks increase, earnings increase, and the stock price increases (perhaps some multiple expansion too, depending on how Mr. Market feels).

**What happens when oil prices are low?**

This is where things get interesting as Warren Buffett has found downside protection.

(1) OXY is one of the most efficient oil producers claiming production costs that break even at $40 worldwide oil price which puts a nice margin of safety on earnings. 

(2) The preferred shares are immortal. With lower capital amounts returned to shareholders, preferreds are unlikely to get redeemed. Even if we get Paul Volckered at some point, the tax benefit strategy redeeming preferreds over debt no longer works. 

(3) Low oil prices bring down the oil production of the United States and OXY contributes to about \~1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd). The US is in a very strong position to affect oil prices and I highly doubt they US wants to cede energy price control back to OPEC. Moreover, the United State's lead in oil production is mutually beneficial as OPEC countries seek to diversify from oil driven economies.

(4) US oil majors (perhaps all oil majors) are no longer interested in the boom and bust cycle that wreaks havoc on supply chains and drives inflation. Price stability is in the world’s best interest. Crashing oil prices, I would say, is unlikely -- despite Donald Trump's economic illiteracy.

(5) Not to offend some Warren Buffet cultists, but it appears he is also decreasing the float of the company to add some stock price stability which could indirectly protect credit ratings from volatile price action and bipolar bull/bear sentiment on oil. Remember, he described OXY’s volume as a gambling parlor and being able to buy his entire stake in 2 weeks. Warren Buffett also owns some warrants too, so it’s a win-win for both.

**What does that leave for the rest of us?**

Assuming oil prices stay in the current $70 to $90 range, OXY’s earnings are relatively predictable.

Now, excuse me for using EPS. I know it's a sin, but for simplicity, just listen to me.

Some quarters will come in low range (maybe $0.50) while other quarters come in the high range ($1.50). Depending how Mr. Market feels about oil (bullish or bearish due to geopolitics, renewables, etc), OXY’s price may swing +/- 30%. But in the long-term, the earnings will average out, debt will decrease, preferred shares will  be redeemed, dividends increased, buybacks increased, and OXY will be an opportunistic consolidator (this is where Warren Buffett’s trust in Vicki’s capital allocation is crucial).

So it's clear Warren Buffet is making out like a bandit, so why are other super investors such as Li Lu buying a stake in the company?

Believe it or not, I believe these super investors are ***speculating*** on OXY’s competitive advantage in carbon management, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech -- after all “safe investments make for safe speculation.”

Crazy, I know, but before you stop reading, hear me out.

OXY is basically a high yielding bond with two growth driver’s that have very *very* long runways: 

1. Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE)
2. Carbon Management via Direct Air Capture (DAC) and Carbon Sequestration

I’ll start with the less controversial one…

**TerraLithium: Direct Lithium Extraction**

If you didn’t know TerraLithium is a 50-50 joint venture between a start-up, All American Lithium, and a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum. All American Lithium was the latest iteration of a company that originally formed to [acquire the assets](https://www.desertsun.com/story/tech/science/energy/2017/02/10/salton-sea-geothermal-plant-would-use-lithium-tech-caught-teslas-eye/97743092/) of Simbol Materials, which developed a much-hyped and highly secretive lithium extraction process. Simbol Materials’ technology impressed **ELON MUSK** (yes, you read that correctly) so much that Tesla offered to buy the start-up for $325 million. But the deal fell apart as Simbol Materials’ commanded a billion dollar valuation. Tesla investors familiar with the matter, know that they did not have a billion dollars to throw around at the time. And months later Simbol Materials went bust.

Fast forward to today:

**Berkshire Hathaway Energy owns 10 out of the 11 geothermal power plants in the Salton Sea and TerraLithium has over 40 patents relating to direct lithium extraction from geothermal brine. Together, they are working to tap the estimated 18 million metric tons of lithium suspended in geothermal brine. That's the equivalent to half of the current global production of lithium. It's enough to make over 375 million electric vehicle batteries. The depth of the Salton Sea's reserves dwarf other potential reserves such as the  Smackover Formation or hectorite clay, recovered oil field brines, recycled electronics, etc.**

The 11th geothermal power plant is owned by a competitor EnergySource Minerals who is also trying to extract lithium from geothermal brine. Despite being closer to a commercially viable solution, EnergySource Minerals attempted to challenge TerraLithium's patent for being ""too general"" which may suggest that TerraLithium's patent claims are competitively advantaged (on top of the scale advantage provided by Berkshire Hathaway Energy). The other competitor called Controlled Thermal Resources must start from scratch (the project being dubbed  “Hell’s Kitchen”). That is, build a geothermal power plant and then add the direct lithium extraction tech which, compared to Berkshire Hathaway Energy and TerraLithium, has high execution risk. Moreover, Berkshire Hathaway Energy has been running their geothermal plants for decades and TerraLithium has decades of experience with carbon, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech.

Any regulatory hurdles will be minimal: (1) At the national level, there's a strong bipartisan push for lithium independence. (2) At the state level, the government plans on taxing all extracted lithium. (3) At the local community level, there's a powerful incentive to revitalize communities that were destroyed by the drying of the Salton Sea which exposed toxic lakebed dust containing pesticides and heavy metals. New direct lithium extraction facilities offer a chance for regional revival creating an estimated 80,000 new jobs. (4) Direct lithium extraction from geothermal brine is significantly greener than hard rock mining and solar evaporation of brine.

**If you ever wondered why Warren Buffet chose his successor to be Greg Abel (*****the current CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy*****) this is probably a major contributing factor.**

I have no idea what TerraLithium will be worth, but in Q2 2024 Occidental Petroleum did a “small” fair value adjustment of $27 million and they plan on licensing the technology in future (a fixed cost shielded from the cyclicality of lithium prices).

Now, onto the more controversial one…

**1PointFive: Carbon Management**

Anti-oil company climate activists can stop reading now.

On May 18^(th), 2024, at CERAWeek by S&P Global -- an annual global energy conference focusing on the industry’s biggest goals and challenges -- Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman interviewed CEO Vicki Hollub to discuss Occidental Petroleum’s CrownRock Acquisition in December 2023. 

In the latter half of the interview, Vicki Hollub details a clear path for how Occidental Petroleum will transition to a Carbon Management Company, via their subsidiary 1PointFive:

>“We've been using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery for over 50 years. It's a core competence of ours; we understand how CO2 works, how to manage it, and how to handle it effectively. We have the necessary infrastructure in the Permian Basin for this.
> \
>For a long time, we attempted to capture anthropogenic CO2 from industrial sources. This proved to be challenging because negotiating with industrial sites to retrofit equipment for carbon capture was difficult. We started this effort back in 2008 but were unsuccessful in making it happen with any partners.”

Vicki is talking about Occidental Petroleum’s previously failed Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) venture called Century. Built in 2010, Century was intended to be the largest carbon capture facility in the world, aiming to handle over 20% of global CCS capacity. Integrated into a natural gas processing plant, Century was designed to capture carbon dioxide before it could be released into the atmosphere by using two engines: one capable of capturing 5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and the other able to capture more than 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.

However, a **Bloomberg Green** investigation found satellite data showing that cooling towers on one of the engines didn’t function, suggesting that Century never operated at more than a third of its capacity in the 13 years it’s been running. The technology worked but the economics didn’t hold up because of limited gas supplied from a nearby field, leading to disuse and eventual divestment by Occidental Petroleum who sold off the project in 2022 for $200 million to Mitchell Group - significantly less than the original $1.1 Billion invested into Century.

The painful lesson: while CCS technology worked, the economics are heavily tied to the carbon dioxide emission source. Mainly, the profitability relied on how much carbon dioxide was emitted and negotiating/working with the owners of the emission source. 

Luckily, a new carbon capture technology emerged, direct air capture (DAC), that proved much more economically viable:

>“Then we discovered a carbon capture technology designed to extract CO2 directly from the atmosphere. This was a game-changer for us, akin to finding the holy grail. With this technology, we no longer needed to negotiate with emitters; instead, we could control our own development pace and schedule. This direct air capture approach allows us to operate when and where it makes the most sense.”

Learning from the failed venture of Century, Vicki believes that DAC is more economically viable because the source of carbon dioxide is pulled out of the atmosphere (not carbon dioxide emission sources) which shifts the bottleneck to cost reduction of DAC technology. Freed from the complication of carbon dioxide emitters, Occidental Petroleum engineers can focus on building the most cost efficient DAC facility without rushing or technical limitations from carbon dioxide emitters that could result in suboptimal decisions.

>“An added advantage is that the technology uses potassium hydroxide to capture CO2 from the air. We are the largest marketer of potassium hydroxide in the U.S. and the second largest globally. Additionally, for efficient mixing in the contact tower—necessary for optimal CO2 extraction—PVC diffusers are used. We also manufacture PVC, creating synergies with our existing oil and gas and chemical businesses.
> \
>These synergies were fortuitous, and it felt like it was meant for us. However, the economic viability of direct air capture depends on various factors, including the performance of rivals and market conditions.”

Along with Occident Petroleum’s infrastructure to use captured carbon for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery in the Permian Basin, when it comes to developing DAC, Occidental Petroleum already has part of the supply chain for DAC vertically integrated.

The main challenge that remains is the fact that DAC is a rather expensive process. According to a news post by Julie Chao from Berkeley Labs on April 20^(th), 2022, DAC costs about $600 per metric ton of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) with the following 2 factors driving up the cost: (1) Separating the carbon dioxide from the reactive absorbent -- usually potassium hydroxide -- requires a costly heating process. (2) Carbon dioxide’s poor solubility in water requires a costly pressurizing process to sequester the carbon dioxide in a saline reservoir to use later for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery.

Despite the US tax credit of $180 per metric ton of carbon dioxide removal that is directly captured from the atmosphere, the overall economics make DAC a money losing venture with a theoretical net loss of $420 per metric ton of DAC CDR.

However, Vicki talks about a developing carbon credit market, where DAC CDR credits can be sold for a premium with increasing demand:

>“We plan to launch the first phase of Stratos, our direct air capture facility in the Permian Basin, by mid-next year. We have already sold about 70% of the carbon reduction credits for the facility, which will ultimately handle 500,000 tons of CO2 per year. The demand is strong, coming from airlines, tech companies, consulting firms, and others interested in reducing their carbon footprint.
> \
>These buyers are part of the voluntary compliance market, focusing on offsetting their carbon emissions. This should provide us with a steady cash flow from the facility.
> \
>As for when the facility will break even and become profitable, it depends on the value of credits beyond those we’ve already sold. While credit prices are currently rising due to limited availability, I hope to have a clearer picture in two years. We’ll check back with you as things continue to evolve.”

At full capacity, Stratos will collect 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year costing at least $300 million in annual operational expenses. In combination with the $180 DAC CDR credits, Stratos is projected to lose $420 per metric ton of CDR which is an annualized loss of $210 million. 

However, as Vicki points out, companies are willing to pay a premium for DAC CDR credits, which may help subsidize and offset the loss. Here’s a list deals that were already made:

Climate activists' be damned, but carbon must be removed from the air in order to revert climate change.

*That is a fact.*

All startups so far have produce subscale solutions that are not economically viable to reach the scale to offset carbon emissions, let alone reverse it.

*OXY has a scalable solution via their subsidiary 1PointFive.*

In order to effectively decarbonize the atmosphere, **thousands** (think a few thousand at minimum) of these DAC plants will need to be built, and OXY is vertically integrated to do so.

**History doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes.**

Crazy or not, I believe buying OXY now is like buying Nvidia.

Nvidia’s GPUs have proven various use cases from gaming, crypto, to AI.

Similarly, OXY’s expertise in carbon, chemical substrates, and subsurface tech has proven various use cases from carbon based enhanced oil recovery, lithium extraction, carbon sequestration, and other decarbonization efforts.

The difference: 

Nvidia’s growth is fueled by **speculative demand** for crypto and artificial intelligence. The world has yet to see returns, but plans on spending $1 trillion over the next few years on AI hoping the economics will work out.

*If that isn’t speculation, I don’t know what is.*

And believe me, I understand this tech more than you ever would think. A colleague of mine who has a PhD in CS told me exactly the many use cases of GPUs, but I didn't buy it because: (1) I viewed AI as speculative. (2) Because of reason 1, I expected companies to invest slowly and cautiously. I mean, just look at how the market reacted to Mark Zuckerberg's push into the Metaverse. (3) Because of reason 1 and 2, I expected a slow growth rate where Nvidia's moat would erode in a 3 to 5 year time frame to competitors (something that is happening as we speak -- i.e. CUDA on AMD) before Nvidia could make a killing.

In fact, my stance on tech in general can be summarized as so:

>The reality of tech companies is that they age rapidly — like dog years squared. Moats flash in and out of existence within 2 to 3 years time (along with their valuations). The odds of finding the next Oracle are slim to none, because it's almost certain that the world will never rely on a single relational database architecture again. The main worries in tech are competition, growth, value-cre-ation, and value-ation. When competition enters the space, investors should pack their bags since the rapid democratization of information allows competition to grow at lightning speeds. The forever holdings are businesses that are entrenched usually for non-technological reasons (i.e Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon, Spotify, Palantir). And lack of technical and algorithmic literacy, makes the chances of accurately determining an enduring business next to none.

With the release of ChatGPT, you can imagine where I went wrong... At that point, I should've just bough the damn company since the growth was obviously higher than I anticipated completely invalidating my original thoughts. But I digress, the focus of this letter isn't about me confessing my sins for missing out on Nvidia...

Speculation aside, Occidental Petroleum’s growth is fueled by **non-speculative demand**: (1) There is real long term demand for lithium making TerraLithium's tech as relevant as ever. (2) Climate change keeps getting worse, the atmosphere will need to be decarbonized, and there's a growing carbon credit market perfect for 1PointFive to dominate. (3) The world still needs oil for the foreseeable future, so I can sleep every night knowing Occidental Petroleum's core business will still be here when I wake up.

Overall, I buy whenever OXY nears single digit earnings multiples or reaches an acceptable free cash flow yield (adjusted for things I deem reasonable like Warren's preferred shares, because there’s free cash flow and then there’s free cash flow I get).

For me OXY is a safe vehicle to park my money while I wait for other opportunities. And until then, I will just be clipping coupons.

So yeah, oil prices matter... sort of... but, Occidental Petroleum has some other things too...

From,

YetAnotherSpeculator

I came across something interesting and PURPLE..,AmmonHillman,1i9jpvu,2025-01-25 04:53:19,11,1.0,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmmonHillman/comments/1i9jpvu/i_came_across_something_interesting_and_purple/,TattooKatt,,"Has anyone ever heard of Chromobacterium violaceum? The chemical compound is C₂₀H₁₃N₃O₃ .. I am no chemist whatsoever, although I would like to at least learn more basics. I got led to this in my research in the craziest ways that I have to just laugh at this point🤣 anyway, I am seriously wondering if this has anything to do with the purple used back then? We know our ancestors were much smarter than we give them credit for..And I also get a feeling it may be being utilized today in other ways that we are not yet aware of, or rather, a few may know in the higher echelons of the pharma world because it has use in biotechnology.. But I could be wrong.. here it is...


Chromobacterium violaceum is particularly renowned for its production of violacein, a distinctive purple pigment..

The Color: 
Violacein Chemical Structure: Violacein is a bisindole pigment, meaning it contains two indole units connected by a carbon bridge. Its chemical formula is C₂₀H₁₃N₃O₃, and it has a molecular weight of 343.33 g/mol.

Color Properties: Violacein gives C. violaceum colonies a deep purple to violet color, which can appear almost black in concentrated forms. This color is stable under various conditions, including light, pH changes, and temperature fluctuations, which makes it visually striking and scientifically interesting.

UV Protection: One of the speculated biological roles of violacein is to act as a UV protectant, shielding the bacteria from harmful solar radiation when living in water or soil environments exposed to sunlight.
Antimicrobial Properties: Violacein has been shown to have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities, including antibacterial, antifungal, and antitumor effects. This could serve as a defense mechanism against competing microorganisms in its natural habitat.

Uniqueness of C. violaceum:
Rarity Among Bacteria: While many bacteria produce pigments (like carotenoids for orange/red or pyocyanin for blue in Pseudomonas aeruginosa), the production of a stable, deep purple pigment like violacein is somewhat unique among bacteria. This makes C. violaceum visually distinct and of particular interest in microbiology.

Genetic Basis: The biosynthesis of violacein involves a complex pathway with several genes (vioA to vioE) encoding enzymes that sequentially modify two tryptophan molecules into violacein. This pathway is not commonly found in other bacteria, making C. violaceum a subject for genetic and synthetic biology research.

Ecological Role: The pigment might play roles in the bacterium's survival by deterring predation or competing with other microbes for space and nutrients. It could also have roles in biofilm formation or as an antioxidant.
Medical and Biotechnological Interest:
Antibiotic Research: Given its antimicrobial properties, there's interest in using violacein or derivatives in new drug development.
Quorum Sensing Studies: The regulation of violacein production is linked to quorum sensing, providing a model for studying bacterial communication and potential new ways to control bacterial infections.

Research Tool: The pigment's visibility makes C. violaceum an excellent organism for educational purposes in microbiology, allowing easy observation of bacterial growth, colony morphology, and genetic manipulation effects.
Environmental Applications: Due to its UV-protective properties, there's interest in using violacein or genetically modified organisms in bioremediation processes or as natural sunscreens in products.

Why Only C. violaceum?
While C. violaceum is not the only bacterium capable of producing violacein, it is the most well-known and studied due to its high violacein yield and the medical implications of its infections. Other bacteria within the genus Chromobacterium might produce violacein, but C. violaceum is highlighted because:

Prevalence in Nature: It's more widely distributed and frequently encountered in tropical environments.
Human Pathogenicity: Its association with human disease gives it a special status in medical microbiology.
Research History: The long history of study on this bacterium due to its pigment and pathogenicity.

In summary, the unique color of Chromobacterium violaceum is not just an aesthetic feature but a window into its biology, offering insights into bacterial pigmentation, environmental adaptation, and potential applications in medicine and biotechnology..

"I don’t know what I’m doing wrong, or if I’m even doing anything wrong.",studytips,1i97cmo,2025-01-24 17:04:26,2,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/studytips/comments/1i97cmo/i_dont_know_what_im_doing_wrong_or_if_im_even/,TimBje,,"I don’t know what I’m doing wrong, or if I’m even doing anything wrong.

I study a lot. A *lot*. Six days a week (because you need at least one break day to avoid burnout). My schedule looks like this:

2.5 hours of studying for school.

15 minutes of Polish.

45 minutes of advanced math (I’m doing this for extra points, even though I don’t have to, but I like it)

40 minutes split into two parts for preparing for *Högskoleprovet* (a Swedish test that can help you enter university if your grades aren’t good enough).

I enjoy studying, but it feels like I still don’t get the results I expect—especially compared to my old school and other students now.

# Biology Tests

For example, I studied for a biology test a whole month in advance. I knew *everything*. I tested myself with my dad and got every question right. I was so sure it would be an easy A, just like it used to be at my old school. But the test was all multiple-choice questions, and I struggled a lot. (It’s hard to explain, but the questions are written to make it tricky—they mix the correct answer with something that’s almost right, so it’s more about test-taking skills than knowledge.)

I ended up getting a C.

The next biology test was on the same subject, but it only had two questions. The first one I answered correctly. The second was about what happens to a rat’s body after it dies, focusing on material cycles. I named five cycles, but I forgot water. To get full points, you had to mention the carbon, nitrogen, *and* water cycles. Since I forgot water, I only got a B.

# English Presentation

I prepared for an English presentation and knew it like the back of my hand. I barely even needed my notes and still nailed it, though I spoke a bit fast. I got a B, which I was fine with—until I saw that others got A's. Some of them forgot parts of their presentation or said “uhh” multiple times. How is that fair?

# Social Studies Test

Then came a social studies test on government systems. It was another multiple-choice test, and I got a C like most others. I was okay with that since it was between two biology tests, and I knew my focus wasn’t at 100%.

# Recent Tests

After that, I had more tests:

Another biology test: The first part was multiple-choice, and I was ready for those tricks this time—I got an A (38/40, highest in the class). The second part had an unclear question that the teacher refused to explain. I did my best but knew it was probably wrong.

Environment class test: Got an A.

Swedish test: Another multiple-choice test, and I got a B, but I was happy with that.

Then, today, I had a presentation and discussion about environmental markings. I did my presentation almost entirely without notes and was the best in my group. But the discussion was chaotic—there were 10 people, and everyone kept repeating the same points to make sure they got credit.

Afterward, I asked the teacher how this could be graded individually when it’s just a race to speak first. She told me my presentation was good but that the discussion was more important. She said she noticed I tried to contribute but couldn’t get in because of the chaos. She told me not to be upset if I got a C. I tried to stay polite, but I was *so* frustrated.

# What Am I Doing Wrong?

When I compare this to my old school, where tests weren’t structured like this, I used to get consistent A's and B's with less studying. Now, despite studying more effectively—getting into flow states, taking breaks, and using proven methods—it feels like I’m not getting the results I deserve.

My dad says I’ll win in the end, that my hard work will pay off more than the students who only study a week before the test. But right now, I don’t know if I’m the problem or if it’s something else."
Why Are We Ignoring 273 Million MWh of Clean Energy Every Year?,EdmaNetwork,1i95tvk,2025-01-24 15:58:41,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdmaNetwork/comments/1i95tvk/why_are_we_ignoring_273_million_mwh_of_clean/,Edmanetwork,,"Every year, 25 million households with solar panels generate over 273 million MWh of clean energy. By 2030, this number will grow to 100 million households—a massive opportunity to reshape the renewable energy and compliance markets.

But here’s the issue: these households are being completely ignored by the compliance and voluntary markets for carbon credits, renewable energy certificates (RECs), and certificates of origin.

What’s going wrong?
1. Lack of Accessibility: Smaller producers like households don’t have the resources or systems to participate in the compliance market.

2. Complex Bureaucracy: The process of converting clean energy into tradeable certificates is tedious, expensive, and tailored for large corporations.

3. Market Opacity: The carbon credit and REC markets are plagued by a lack of transparency, making it difficult for new contributors to participate.

4. Missed Potential: The renewable energy sector struggles to meet demand for carbon credits and certificates, while millions of small energy producers are left out of the equation.

Why does this matter?

- If these households could tokenize their energy production and generate certificates of origin or carbon credits, they could play a critical role in meeting global ESG goals.

- Both compliance and voluntary markets could benefit from a decentralized, transparent supply of credits and certificates, addressing the growing demand for sustainability.

- Smaller contributors like households could finally participate in the market without being excluded by high costs or complicated processes.

What’s the solution?

We need a system that simplifies compliance for everyone, from small households to large-scale producers. A transparent platform that converts clean energy into certificates and enables trading on a global scale could unlock the full potential of millions of producers.

It feels like the current system is failing both producers and the compliance market. What do you think? Are we doing enough to include small-scale contributors in the renewable energy economy? Let’s discuss! 🌱"

CRA and Retroactive Payments?,PersonalFinanceCanada,1i8r8s7,2025-01-24 03:56:57,0,0.5,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/1i8r8s7/cra_and_retroactive_payments/,Stitch626-04,Taxes,"Hi folks,

I was hoping someone could answer a confusion for me.

I recently caught up on filing my taxes (I was behind a few years), and now in my payments information upcoming for GST/HST, Trillium Benefit, and Carbon Rebate Benefit, they each show an amount total that I'll be receiving as a payment come a date in February. However, when I click on said payment for more detail, it also shows a value underneath listed as a ""retroactive amount"", which lists direct deposit next to it - same as the total, but this amount isn't included in the total listed.... will I be receiving both the total listed AND the retroactive amount listed? Or how does that work/why is there an amount listed for retroactive that isn't included as part of the total? I'm confused. Any help, would help! Thank you so much.

This wont let me load the image, but it looks like this:

|Description|Method|Payment|
|:-|:-|:-|
|GST/HST Credit|Direct Deposit|820.95|
|Retroactive Amount|Direct Deposit|389.25|
|Total||820.95|

So needless to say, I am confused about the retroactive payment part?"

Ohio firm telling businesses that they can sell srecs or carbon credits for massive amounts of money.

The sales team told them that they were looking at a huge payback for selling carbon capture credits/clean energy credits/srecs.  This is in Ohio where srecs aren't worth much.  My friend left the company before they sealed the deal so I don't have more detail.  How are they making this happen?  Or are they full of crap?

genuinely need help finding a car,whatcarshouldIbuy,1i8eq55,2025-01-23 16:34:38,0,0.33,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/1i8eq55/genuinely_need_help_finding_a_car/,Different_Ebb_1194,,"as the title describes I'm having trouble. i currently own a 350z roadster. previous owner fucked me and di not take car of it. i got it with 113k on it for 9300. i was NO making money at the time so i financed it to build my credit. 

  
fast forward over a year and i've only driven the car a total of 3 months. upgraded the clutch. replaced the motor as it blew at 119k. it needs valve cover gaskets now on the new motor and a bunch of other shit ive spent over what i paid for it and don't even drive it.

  
that being said a dealer will give me 3k for it i owe 6500. I'm in car sales so i know how it works and i can afford a $700 payment or even 850 but i don't want to at all. i know ill have to roll the negative equity which i've come to terms with and is why im looking for something under 30k closer to 25k so i can still get around a 500-650 payment

  
i want something awd and manual still. i cant find ANY s4/5 in manual or low miles. ive resorted to dct IF i have to and there are no q50/60 red sports for sale near me at all. Subaru is an option i guess but I've never been a fan of the wrx really even tho i like the new body style. im supposed to look at a guilia ti sport today but i can't find any aftermarket support and they'll barely push 350 after 6k of mods along with any carbon piece for it being fucking insane price wise. Lexus there's no rc350 near me or is350 under 35k with reasonable miles.

looked at Evo's as i had one before and they're all 80k+ miles for 33k+ literally not worth it. 

im not a fan of bmw much as if im spending that money i'd rather get an M car but again there's 0 manuals and that's if i can even find one in my price range. which i won't. mercedes in my range have problems plus expensive asl to fix. 

  
i've been looking for months and my brain is beyond scrambled. any suggestions would be nice along side advice. based in central MA for reference"

The only real solution to climate change is to restore Earths climate to its pre-industrial state by removing CO2 from the atmosphere after all human activities have been made carbon neutral. We need to pair carbon removal with efforts to establish carbon neutrality in order to achieve climate restoration. The global climate action plan should be changed from mitigation & adaptation to mitigation & restoration (climate restoration) if we truly care about human civilization and the natural environment.

The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere will need be be reduced from 420 PPM to 280 PPM to restore Earths climate. No single carbon removal method can achieve this. We will need multiple carbon removal methods that are either not enegry intensive or self-powering. There are many such carbon removal methods which currently exist.

Here are the atmospheric carbon removal methods which should be used to restore Earths climate

\- Biochar

\- Regenerative Agriculture

\- Enhanced Rock Weathering

\- Turning biomass (ideally forest thinning waste) into fossil fuels to be put back underground

[https://charmindustrial.com](https://charmindustrial.com)

[https://recoal.net/en/](https://recoal.net/en/)

\- Killing and sinking hazardous algae blooms

[https://carbonherald.com/first-ever-carbon-credits-from-toxic-algal-remediation-are-issued/](https://carbonherald.com/first-ever-carbon-credits-from-toxic-algal-remediation-are-issued/)

\- Dissolving limestone in wastewater

[https://crewcarbon.com](https://crewcarbon.com)

\- Sinking seaweed (seaweed can be grown or natural)

\- Turning biogenic CO2 into carbon nanotubes

Carbon offsetting will underutilize carbon removal because carbon removal has the potential to restore Earths climate to its pre-industrial state rather than do the same thing as emissions elimination. Climate restoration should be the ultimate end goal of climate action because it is the best solution. Not allowing present and future generations to inhabit the better world which used to exist when we have the technologies to bring back that better world is immoral. Humanity is capable of restoring Earths climate so therefore we should do it for the betterment of human civilization and the natural environment."

**A Conman Of The World**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Donald Trump’s decision to pause U.S. aid to other countries could put thousands of aid workers out of a job within months.**                          
                 
- President Donald Trump signed so many executive orders his very first day in office that many of us still have whiplash. It’s hard to keep track of which ones really matter, and which ones are just empty posturing, likely to disappear in a cloud of legal vapor as soon as the first lawsuits drop. But here’s one that’s received relatively little coverage — and looks set to have a real-world impact on thousands of aid workers and countries around the world. It’s Trump’s decision to suspend U.S. foreign assistance for 90 days, so his administration can review whether the money is being given to programs he likes.                          
                 
- The U.S. gives a lot of money to these programs — upwards of [$70 billion a year](https://apnews.com/article/trump-foreign-aid-9f5336e84c45a6e782fa95f60a919f47?utm_source=copy&utm_medium=share) — in over 200 countries and regions. Think: Providing [safe drinking water](https://us.pg.com/blogs/childrens-safe-drinking-water-program/) to people in Myanmar, helping [tuberculosis patients](Since 1998, USAID has partnered with the Government of India to combat tuberculosis (TB), investing more than $140 million to help diagnose and treat 15 million people with the disease.) in India and Cambodia, assisting women who’ve [experienced gender-based violence](https://www.endvawnow.org/uploads/browser/files/Addressing%20GBV%20through%20USAIDs%20Health%20Programs%20-%20English%20.pdf) in Nicaragua, and sending [relief to countries affected](https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/may-10-2022-united-states-provides-nearly-808-million-emergency-humanitarian) by natural disasters. These programs also support tens of thousands of jobs in non-profits, non-governmental organizations, and foreign aid programs, many of which are based in the U.S. and Washington D.C.                          
                 
- Those programs now appear to be in big trouble. Lawyers who’ve spoken with Trump administration officials — from the White House and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) — believe the pause in funding is a worst-case scenario for this sector, according to a person briefed by those lawyers yesterday. The person provided What A Day with slides from the firm, which represents government contractors.                          
                 
- Without aid from the United States, most of these multinational foreign aid organizations don’t have the cash to meet payroll for three months, and it’s unlikely any bank would extend credit to them, the person said. USAID alone works with more than 4,000 organizations. Thousands of jobs around the world could be at stake, not to mention the catastrophic humanitarian and health implications.                          
                 
- Trump didn’t specify what organizations would be affected (spoiler alert: Because he didn’t think this shit through in the first place!) but some details have started to leak: He’ll freeze assistance to United Nations agencies, peacekeeping initiatives and refugee support programs, [according to Ukrainian officials](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-foreign-aid-freeze-war-in-ukraine-weapons/). Ukraine and other countries receiving military support won’t be cut off, the officials added.                          
                 
**The three-month ‘pause’ alone may be so financially disastrous for the aid sector that only the largest contractors survive, even if funding kicks back in afterwards, the person added.**                          
                 
- Experts agreed that Trump’s pause looks like a big trouble: “It’s hard for me to imagine this won’t be deeply disruptive the people working in projects on in the field, partly because it creates profound uncertainty about what happens after the review is over,” Jon Alterman, a foreign policy expert who’s held positions in the State Department and on Capitol Hill, told What A Day.                          
                 
- Trump’s ire seems aimed at USAID programs, [according to Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-foreign-aid-freeze-war-in-ukraine-weapons/). That could spell trouble for them, Alterman added, since Trump hasn’t even named a USAID administrator yet — who you’d think would be an important player in deciding how foreign aid gets spent!                          
                 
- Republicans have long aimed to slash aid projects around the world. In his first term, Trump cut funding or suspended payments to several United Nations agencies. The U.S. foreign aid industry is “not aligned with American interests,” Trump [wrote in his statement announcing the pause](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/reevaluating-and-realigning-united-states-foreign-aid/). During his confirmation hearing last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told lawmakers that foreign aid must meet three requirements: “Does it make America safer? Does it make America stronger? Does it make America more prosperous?”                          
                 
- The point of providing aid to other countries — aside from helping their citizens — is to form tight relationships around the world, Alterman said. By scrapping assistance, countries might not feel as inclined to support the United States.                          
                 
**Making buddies around the world doesn’t seem to be Trump’s goal, yet again!**

To all business owners out there am I an unreasonable customer!?,southafrica,1i80s0l,2025-01-23 05:53:00,38,0.95,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/southafrica/comments/1i80s0l/to_all_business_owners_out_there_am_i_an/,damianoost,Discussion,"**TLDR - My Aircon service costs seemed to be inflated with a carbon copy of my job card scribbled over and after asking for further information I was confronted by the owner who made me out to be unreasonable for not just trusting them. (Job Cards in comment below)**

I've just gotten off the phone with the owner of an air conditioning company regarding our invoice, which does not match the original job card I signed. The job was done very well but I was only made aware of some wiring that needed replacing over and above the service. The job was done, and the aircon is working properly again so I signed off on the service and a repair (I will comment with the Job card image below for reference).

So close to a month later I got an invoice for the replacement of a part on my aircon, which I was totally unaware of, and provided evidence of the carbon copy of the job card from their office which shows the misspelled ""Repair"" scratched over with ""Replaced"" and the associated charge. This is something I was not told about on the day and did not sign for either so was I being unreasonable in querying this and requesting further evidence that this part was in fact replaced?

As mentioned in the title, when presenting them with my original copy of the job card that shows a repair was made not a replacement, the owner phoned me and explained that he himself issued the part and it's clearly present on the job his job card. As I was personally present for the entire job and only signed the job card after the work was completed, how is it that he issued a part that needed to be replaced before I signed the job card but none of this information was present on the original copy I signed? It is clear that this was all included after the fact a few weeks later and scribbled over the original writing.

Is this not a reasonable query? The owner did not take this question very well and eventually said he doesn't have time to argue over a silly small contactor and he would credit me as the company does not overcharge customers!

If you took the time to read this and care to comment I'd love to know if I'm one of those unreasonable customers, it's sometimes hard to see things from the other person's point of view."
Moons Revamp suggestions (Long post) + Extra events,lethalcompany,1i80lwh,2025-01-23 05:41:05,0,0.33,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/lethalcompany/comments/1i80lwh/moons_revamp_suggestions_long_post_extra_events/,Alfe01,Discussion,"Some moons need to have more uniqueness and a good risk/reward balance. This makes them stand out from the rest and keep the experience fresh. At the end of the post is a QoL change, weather extra effects on items and entities and more random events (such as meteor shower).
______________
Before we start with the moons, here's an idea to keep the gameplay loop fresh: multiple landing spots on the same moon would make every landing challenging and mysterious (as you have to find an entrance while not relying on memory. This makes sense as the interior shape-shifts every landing. This can be balanced by slowing down the clock.
This can be implemented by adding multiple different maps for the same moon, chosen randomly at the start of the day, and multiple landing spots for the ship on every moon to disorient the players.

======Experimentation======
Good as it is, maybe adding some random chaotic events or strange spawn rates


======Assurance======
Almost nothing to change.

Indoor entities:
- More hoarding bugs
- No mines, turrets or spike traps

Outdoor entities:
- No giants, less dogs, more leviathans


======Vow======
Once home of a few colonies, now abandoned.

Interior changes:
- Mineshaft (90%)
- Facility (10%)
- Map size multiplier at 0.8x
- Full of spike traps

Indoor entities:
- Remove the maneater

Outdoor entitites:
- Baboon hawks
- Eyeless dogs
- No giants


======March======
The overlooked sister of Vow and Adamance.

Exterior changes:
- The big water pond at the center continuously rises during the day. At 4;00PM the water stops rising and it's now difficult to locate the pond.

Interior changes:
- Facility (100%)
- Walls and ceiling covered in vines, moss and mushrooms.
- Lights always turned off from the start
- Map size multiplier at 1.75x
- Full of mines, almost no turrets

Items:
- Largely increase spawn amount

Indoor entities:
- Bracken 100% present
- Insects and bugs
- Masked

Outdoor entitites:
- Only giants


======Offense======
Sounds like a militaristic name. Maybe it was used as a base.

Exterior changes:
- Add many wooden sheds to hide inside

Interior changes:
- Many turrets, many mines, no spike traps.

Items:
- More one-handed valuable items

Indoor entities:
- Coilhead
- Nutcraker

Outdoor entitites:
- All Blind dogs, a lot of Blind dogs


======Adamance======
Adamance is the oldest of three sisters (Adamance, Vow and March). It's full of wildlife.

Interior changes: like March but with a 1.25x multiplier

Outdoor entitites: WWF simulator is fine as it is


======Rend======
Rend gives home to scientists and their families.

Exterior changes: 
- Make the entrance more fancy, and with wooden doors
- Add more dome lights along the building wall

Items:
- Personal and fancy items
- Masks
- Lab gear (microscope, flasks, chemicals)

Interior changes:
- Mansion (70%), Laboratory (30%) (new)

Indoor entities:
- Masked
- Nutcracker
- Ghost girl


======Dine======
Dine sounds like an attempt to establish a colony within its depths, obviously failing.

Interior changes:
- Mansion (100%)

Exterior changes:
- Make the entrance more fancy and with wooden doors
- The fire exit is located far away from the ship, about two times the distance between the ship and the main entrance, but it can be reached with a straight asphalt road with lamp posts at its borders. The road is clear of snow due to it being hot. Something is keeping it warm.

Items:
- High value items more frequent
- Two-handed items slightly more frequent than one-handed ones

Indoor entities:
- Butler
- Barber
- Jester

Outdoor entitites:
- Earth leviathans and dogs, no giants


======Titan======
Titan was mined for resources and has a tall building as an exterior. It experienced a war at some point.

Interior changes: 
- Mineshaft (100%)
- Map size multiplier at 1.5x (increased loot density)
- Many mines, many turrets, no spike traps

Exterior changes:
- Bring the Fire Exit down, near the stairs on the left of the building, down a small slope. This matches the fire exit's position inside the mines interior, compared to the main entrance position on the upper floor.
- The stairs in front of the ship may break down while using them a certain amount of times (random value extracted at the start of the day)

Items:
- Personal and fancy items
- Work tools
- Masks

Indoor entities:
- Maneater
- Masked
- Coilhead
- Nutcracker

Outdoor entities: 
- Reskinned blind dogs with fur
- Old Birds


======Artifice======
Artifice was probably used to develop weapons and experiment on entities, so these are its new features:

Interior chances: 
- Weapon factory(70%)(new)
- Laboratories(29%)(new)
- Facility(1%)

Items: 
- Unstable weaponry (such as grenades and high voltage tasers, which can be used on monsters but have a high chance of exploding in your own hands)
- Lab gear (microscope, flasks, chemicals)
- Metal ingots (gold, steel, platinum, copper)
- Work tools
- Personal and fancy items
- There's an apparatus worth 500 credits but if pulled out, it will start a facility meltdown protocol.

Indoor entities:
- Add Barber
- New entity ""Stock sentinel"": it waits, standing still and silently inside loot rooms, waiting for someone to steal something inside. If you fail to notice it and pick up any object, the sentinel begins to patrol the room, shooting you on sight (24 damage per shot). If you exit the loot room, the sentinel won't be able to follow you, but from now on, every time you approach the room, the sentinel will be waiting at the door, not shooting until you step inside the room again.


======Embrion======
It was used as a testing ground for Old Birds.

Exterior changes:
- Remove the current building and replace it with a small bunker entrance

Interior changes:
- Facility (100%)
- Map size multiplier at 0.5x
- Lights already off, cannot turn on lights
- Full of turrets but no mines or spike traps

Items: 
- High items spawn rate and high density
- Easily accessible apparatus, worth 300 credits
- The least valuable one-handed items
- No two-handed items, excluding the apparatus 

Indoor entities:
- No entities

Outdoor entities:
- Old Birds activate as soon as 11:00 AM comes


Small QoL change: I noticed that the ship's monitor shows a small panoramic montage of the moon we're about to land on. This brief video is only present for Experimentation, Assurance and Offense (strangely enough, the only desertic moons). I would be fine adding more videos for the other moons, except for Artifice and Embrion.

Weather modificators:
- Stormy adds 30% more value to conductive scrap
- Flooded makes Outdoor entities spawn less frequently
- Rainy makes Outdoor entities slow down
- Foggy makes giants and baboon hawks' sight less efficient
- Eclipsed makes players 25% faster

New random events:
___________________________
- Stellar Storm: getting exposed to the light in daytime slowly depletes stamina. After stamina reaches 0, health begins depleting slowly. Being in the ship, in the Cruiser or in the building protects you. The event starts randomly in the morning and ends once night comes.
This event doesn't occur on Rend, Dine and Titan.
_______________________________________
- Company Environmental Remediation: an alert is sent to all players, showing a certain time between 9:00 PM and 12:00 PM. Once the clock reaches the random time, a biological bomb lands on the moon, destroying all living matter while preserving buildings and, of course, the ship. If a player stays in the building during the explosion, they won't get affected right away. Once they get outside, the radiation quickly depletes their health, down to 1. After that, every 10 seconds there is a 1 in 10 chance of a fatal blow happening. Using a TZP-inhalant gives more chances of survival.
This event doesn't occur on Embrion.
______________________________________
- Good neighbourliness principle: another ship with real players aboard lands on the moon along with you. The scrap inside the building is doubled. Let the social experiment begin.
This is a rare event, as it needs two crews landing on the same moon within 10 seconds from the other ship's landing.

"Terraforming Mars, part 0",theplanetcrafter,1i7y6m1,2025-01-23 02:34:04,19,0.86,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/theplanetcrafter/comments/1i7y6m1/terraforming_mars_part_0/,C34H32N4O4Fe,,"As I mentioned [elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/theplanetcrafter/comments/1i79b8g/comment/m8m6sz6), I've been turning an idea in my head for a little while now: **a Mars-terraformation simulation in** ***Planet crafter***.

This post is going to be a bit of a primer to establish the game settings and objectives and to test for interest. I'll go ahead with the idea anyway, but if I find some of you like the idea I'll also post updates here every now and then. I probably won't be very constant with it, because I also have a standard game on Planet Humble and a standard multiplayer game on Planet Prime with my brother, not to mention other videogames, books, a wife and dog, German lessons, work and an upcoming interview at a university, but I'll post when I can.

Wish me luck!

[part 1 >](https://www.reddit.com/r/theplanetcrafter/comments/1i9fn4h/terraforming_mars_part_1)

# Game settings

I'm playing on **Prime** because it's more Mars-like than Humble. I find Humble prettier, but what can you do.

I'm setting the **terraforming rate to 0.1**, otherwise it'll progress much more quickly than is realistic, especially given I'm (probably) going to be playing through the whole thing alone.

This will be loosely based on a novel I'm writing, and in that novel the first colony on Mars is established at the southern edge of Valles Marineris, so I'll be **starting on the ice plains** and using the desert lowlands immediately south as a Valles-Marineris analogue. South and north, and consequently also east and west, will be inverted in my imagination and progress reports with respect to the in-game compass. It makes sense, too, not only because the desert in question is south (instead of north) of the highlands I'll start in, but also because the open ocean that appears on Prime at high TI values is all the way at the southern end of the map and the big ocean on a [terraformed Mars](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/terraforming/images/f/f3/2D_map_of_Mars_terraformed.png) would lie to the north.

**Vitals depletion and other game settings will be standard.** I briefly considered permadeath, because death is permanent in reality, but I wouldn't want to lose my entire project (especially with terraforming rate at 0.1) and a real Martian colony would have more than one colonist (so even if a colonise died the others would be there to continue the job).

Summary of game settings:

# Goals

How terraformed is terraformed? Let's use a little science (only very basic stuff, don't worry).

The current global-average temperature on Mars appears to be [something like –60 °C](https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/a/251848/29900), or approximately 213 K. Let's make it an even 210 K. Given Mars is farther from the Sun than Earth is, it seems unlikely it will ever be as warm as Earth is ([some 15 °C](https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/a/251848/29900) on average), so let's consider an average temperature of 7 °C (or 280 K) to be reasonable; this would make the equator quite comfy and the tropical regions akin to maybe northern Europe, which seems reasonable enough to me; still plenty of inhabitable land to claim by humans. So we're looking at a difference of **70 K**.

Current atmospheric pressure on the Martian surface is [approximately 610 Pa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars#Geography_and_features) at what is currently defined as zero altitude; this is also the average atmospheric pressure on the Martian surface. Mars has a lower gravity than Earth, so even if it had a global magnetic field to protect its atmosphere from solar wind it would [only be able to hold onto an atmosphere about 38% as thick as Earth's](https://www.planetary.org/articles/can-we-make-mars-earth-like-through-terraforming), meaning atmospheric pressure at zero altitude would be about 38 kPa. This is a difference of **37.382 kPa**.

Since we're aiming to make the atmosphere breathable, we'd like the oxygen content to be 21%, or **210,000 ppm**. It's currently close to 0 ppm, so I'll just take the full 210,000 ppm as my goal. Let's pretend we're also simultaneously raising the nitrogen concentration to 78% (780,000 ppm).

Biomass is a little trickier. The current biomass on Earth amounts to [550 GT C (gigatonnes of carbon), of which 450 GT C (about 82%) is plants, 2 GT C (about 0.36%) is all animals and 200 MT C (megatonnes of carbon) (0.036% of all biomass, or 10% of all animal biomass) is arthropods](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6016768/table/t01/). I couldn't find any data for insects alone, so arthropods will have to do.

Now, most non-planktonic plants are located on land (yeah, yeah, there's kelp and seagrass, who cares) and therefore distributed across only 29% of Earth's surface (the other 71% is water). Mars has a surface area that is [only 28.$% that of Earth's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars), but, looking at [a hypothetical map of a terraformed Mars](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/terraforming/images/f/f3/2D_map_of_Mars_terraformed.png) and eyeballing the land/water ratio, we might guess about 65% of a terraformed Mars's surface would be land. This means that the same concentration of land plants we have on Earth, spread across the Martian surface, would amount to **286 GT C of plants**.

Performing similar calculations for arthropods and all remaining animals gives **808 MT C of arthropods** and **462 MT C of other animals**.

Naturally, we'll also need an orbital mirror to increase the amount of sunlight reaching the planet (which can be simulated with a **heat-multiplier rocket**) and an artificial magnetic field to shield the atmosphere from solar wind (which can be simulated with a **pressure-multiplier rocket**). Just one of each, though.

Summary of victory conditions:

* Temperature: 70 K
* Pressure: 37.382 kPa
* Oxygen: 210,000 ppm
* Plant biomass: 286 GT
* Insect biomass: 808 MT
* Animal biomass: 462 MT
* Exactly 1 heat-multiplier rocket in orbit
* Exactly 1 pressure-multiplier rocket in orbit

# Rules

Well, there aren't any previous failed terraforming efforts or alien ruins on Mars, so **crates and wrecks are forbidden**.

However, it would be really stupid to send colonists to Mars without a vehicle to explore with, a prefabricated base with an air-production mechanism, solar panels to power the base and vehicle, and a mini-greenhouse to produce food with. So I'm **starting with a rover, six food growers, one of each type of edible-crop seed (or five types of seed and mushroom spores, because the devs kinda dropped the ball with ""mushroom seeds"" instead of mushroom spores), a tiny base (with beds for several colonists, because who would send a single person to terraform a planet) and enough solar panels to power the food growers** (no oxygen-producers to improve the atmosphere, just the oxygen-producing mechanism bases come with in *Planet crafter* so I can breathe within the base). This is a sensible space-agency-funded terraforming project, not a death sentence carried out by a morally questionable multiplanetary hypercapitalist corporation, after all.

Similarly, I'm **starting with a terraforming screen** just so I can keep track of my goals. Nothing fancy.

Note that I'm not going to give myself the techs to build those things. They were sent from Earth, and the Martian colonists will have to first become self-sufficient and then develop the technology to build more of these things on site. I hope none of my fancy machines break down before I get the tech to replace them.

How will I start with all these fancy things? Well, there just so happens to be [a mod on Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/planetcrafter/mods/42) that adds a command console. I'm only going to use this for the starting conditions described above (and summarised below) and to create plant seeds when I reach a point where it would make sense for Earth to send more plants to Mars (maybe after I've reached the moss stage and popped some algae generators down).

Summary of additional game rules:

* No wrecks or crates
* Starting equipment: a small base, six food growers, one of each type of edible-crop seed, a terraforming screen, enough solar panels to power it all, and a rover"
"A Question About my Basement (or, Living With Homeowner's Anxiety and The Fear of Doing The Wrong Thing)",HomeMaintenance,1i7sj7j,2025-01-22 20:59:56,1,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeMaintenance/comments/1i7sj7j/a_question_about_my_basement_or_living_with/,irascible_vegans,,"Forgive me, this is a LONG post, mainly because I'm trying to be detailed in what I'm describing.

About seven years ago, I bought my first home. 800 sq ft, cheapo 1950 house in a mill town (and probably a mill house). At first glance it was perfect for me and I actually like its simplicity and small size quite a lot. I spent $65K, and have spent more than that again on improvements: new roof, new gutters, new vinyl siding (after discovering water damage in the back wall - the framing and old wood siding underneath was repaired as well, but they only put up those 1/4"" foam/mylar batts under the siding, there's no wrap or other weather sealing), adjustments to the landscape... and then there's the drainage issue.

The house is built into a hillside with a full-height cinderblock basement and slab.  I knew the front wall had been coated (on the inside, not the outside) with some sort of black gunk and what looked like some carbon fiber strips had been applied (but were clearly not done correctly, with no anchor top or bottom and the strips not adhered firmly to the wall). Early on I noticed water getting in when it would rain, seeping through the wall and across the basement floor.

I invested in a dehumidifier first, but one day decided something better should probably be done and called a basement company. They sold me on an interior french drain, and that's actually done pretty well despite a sub-par install job IMO. Within six months of those adjustments, I started noticing things around the house: gaps appearing in places I'd painted and caulked.  A ""ridge"" in the center of the house, where the floor beams (which criss-cross in some odd ways) meet and sit on fixed shoring posts in the middle.  The floor appeared to (and verifiably did) slope away from the center point.  While all the floors were uneven and a little saggy from day one, the kitchen floor felt like standing in a bowl whenever I was at the stove.

Meanwhile I dug a french drain *outside* as well, to help cope with water running downhill from the front yard.  I shot myself in the foot when I first moved in, because in the first year I plotted out a semicircular driveway, put up plastic edging to keep the gravel in place, and then added the gravel.  In the time since I realized that this was funneling surface water directly toward the front center of the house, and even though I had corrected flat/negative grade in the front and sides, this still isn't ideal.  The drainage that's in place now does a pretty adequate job of moving rainwater away, at least.

Cue my first call to an engineer.  She says removing the humidity can exacerbate joist sag, and the interior/exterior french drains could adjust the soil moisture level enough to spur more settling, even this long after it was built.  Fair enough.  But also, the front cinderblock wall of the foundation is bowed a bit.  As a matter of fact, it looks worse than I remember.  I start keeping a closer eye on it, trying not to worry too much, but eventually I pull the trigger and call in the basement company again, and we settle on new carbon fiber/kevlar straps, complete with anchors, across that wall.  I get those installed, and the work looks decent.  More on this wall in a while.

Still the sag, the gaps, getting worse.  I get it, it's an old, kinda poor-quality house, and as the seasons come in and out there's gonna be more of that.  The center ""hallway"" (kinda a hub space that all the rooms attach to) has so much drywall mud patching visible under its paint (done before I moved in) that it's obvious that this has been a problem before.  Heck, from what I can tell on Street View the home was abandoned for several years before the previous owners bought it in 2010 (probably from a flipper who haphazardly threw up the old aluminum siding.)  And as I gaze at the ceiling every day, I start noticing new indentations where screws are, cracks along the seams, little bulges and fractures where it looks like the ceiling rafters (joists?) must have squeezed closer together.

I've even hired another engineer to come out and take a look, and he says ""don't worry about it, it's just old"".  Naturally, I can't let it go.

Over the past few weeks, a handyman friend (who's been doing this kind of thing for 30 years or more) and I enacted a plan I had hatched, and shored the floors up: a 4x6 beam straight down the middle of each room, stopping short of the last joist before the foundation and the last joist before the next room.  Each beam held up by two to four (depending on length) C-79 shoring posts\*.  We topped the posts with an extra 3/16"" steel plate to keep the thin plates the posts come with from inverting, and the bottom plate is atop a 2x10x8"" block for a little bit of weight distribution.  

I adjusted everything so it's about as level as it can be considering how out of whack things have gotten over 70+ years, and it's now a lot less anxiety-inducing to walk through a room because things are so much closer to flat.  *(\*We also put two extra posts up, one under an ""unsupported splice"" in one layer of a floor beam that the first engineer pointed out to me, and one to replace a 4x6 that somebody had slapped in before I bought the place to help keep the kitchen floor from sagging (but they installed it wrong plus now it's slightly too short.)*

It's better in a lot of ways BUT...

I noticed in one room the drywall cracked in a couple places I didn't expect. After some poking around I realize that a handful of joists are no longer sitting firmly on the foundation wall - I can just fit a credit card under them (but not the rim board - it gets stuck after an inch or so).  I lowered the floor in that area by about 1/8-1/4"", but I am currently trying not to worry about the fact that I didn't check every joist yet, as I don't want to keep raising and lowering things and fatiguing both the wood and its fasteners in the process.  I did tap some composite shims in under a few of them for now.  This seemed to be limited to one room on a quick inspection.

In the back of my head I'm in a subconscious panic -- did I screw up?  Did I disrupt the delicate balance of the structure?  If weight is taken off the front wall too much, will it cave in?

Speaking of the front wall, the other thing I did recently was take an angle grinder with a wire brush attachment to the beltline crack (from the bowing).  It looks like the previous owner just smeared some grout over it, as the gap between the blocks was almost entirely empty (not sure if it was my grinder pushing it out or if they didn't fill it properly).  I filled these gaps with PC Concrete (epoxy with silica for compressive strength), then applied another carbon fiber strip across the entire crack, and impregnated with/covered by more epoxy).  Hopefully this wasn't a stupid move either.

I'm also a little freaked out by learning after the fact that this sort of work usually requires a permit in my area.  I figured given that this was supplemental support it wouldn't be necessary.  I'm not too worried about the integrity of the slab, it's apparently unnaturally hard and broke multiple drill bits as we put in tapcons, and even if it were to crack or settle, the worst that could happen (I think) is the floor sags again if the poles fall out.

So, given all of that, what say y'all?  Should I call in yet another engineer?  Change the setup somehow?   Take it all out?  (I hope not, I've got nearly $3K in this project and don't have a clue what I'd do with 17 C-79 posts.)  Am I worrying too much?  I figure there's way more weight bearing down on the house's perimeter walls (what with the roof and all) than anywhere else in the house and I can't possibly be lifting it up *that* much.  The floors are about as level as they can be and checking the centerline per room there's no ""ridge"" where the new beams are, so I'm not pushing too high as far as I can tell.

Beyond all that, *when does homeowner's anxiety finally fade?*  I cannot ever seem to shake the worry, no matter what I fix, that some other disaster is right around the corner - will my sewage line break?  Will the old wiring (mixed with new, and routed by some voodoo means that doesn't make sense) catch fire? 

TL;DR: illegally shored up saggy joists, battling constant homeowner anxiety over whether I did the right thing."

The Auditor’s Apocalypse,FreeWrite,1i7p5ni,2025-01-22 18:21:26,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeWrite/comments/1i7p5ni/the_auditors_apocalypse/,LeviZendt,,"The year is 2050, and good and evil have stopped pretending they weren’t in cahoots. Angels LLC was restructuring for the fourth time that fiscal quarter and Legion Incorporated had launched *HellCoin*, the world’s most volatile cryptocurrency. However, forensic accountants like Sarah Chen didn’t care about divine mergers or satanic ICOs—they cared about the numbers. Numbers, after all, never lied. They screamed.

Sarah was a Senior Forensic Accountant at Definitely Not Evil Tech Corp, a sinister company whose mission statement included “probably ethical, mostly legal.” She stumbled upon the world's end while auditing a spreadsheet flagged *AX\_Report\_Q2\_DEATHS\_FINAL\_NO\_REVISIONS.xlsx.* It was, ironically, the kind of Excel file that made her wish she’d chosen a more straightforward career, like lion taming or competitive knitting.

The file led to President-Elect Barron Blackmore, a man so blatantly evil that voters dismissed his campaign slogan, ""Making Apocalypse Great Again,"" as postmodern satire. Unfortunately, satire dies the moment it’s sworn into office. Sarah’s investigation uncovered that Barron wasn’t just metaphorically the spawn of evil. His parents were the Black Death Witch and the Red Snake, a power couple that redefined the phrase “toxic relationship.”

Her findings were buried in a PowerPoint file titled *Totally Not Evil Plans for World Domination.pptx,* complete with animated transitions and a jaunty slide about “Population Optimisation Through Climate-Sensitive Annihilation.” Here’s the kicker: the plan was working. Greenhouse gases were dropping. Coral reefs were regrowing. Nature was thriving. Humanity, meanwhile, was *not*.

As both brilliant and annoyingly ethical, Sarah tried to expose the scheme. She quickly learned that righteousness is far less practical than bulletproof vests. The government's *Department of Inconvenient Truth Suppression* classified her as a “Level 4 Threat to Order.” Her crime? Knowing too much and being gay, which apparently clashed with the regime’s “heteronormative end-of-the-world chic.” Her last act of defiance was an auditor’s final flourish: filing her assassination expenses under ""Miscellaneous Overhead.""

Meanwhile, resistance was forming in the Australian Outback, where even the flies were unionising for better working conditions. Known as the *Wasteland Warriors,* they were a mismatched team of climate refugees, disgruntled IT professionals, and Rita, an angry librarian who wielded a chainsaw like it was overdue.

The group’s leader, Dr. Alice “Mad Dog” Martinez, had three PhDs—quantum physics, interpretive dance, and motorcycle maintenance—which she claimed gave her ""multidisciplinary problem-solving skills."" She planned to infiltrate Barron’s government via its weakest point: middle management. Barron’s AI overlords had outsourced the day-to-day human oppression to humans themselves, assigning them the title of *“Change Agents.”* The job came with a mediocre salary, dental benefits, and the soul-crushing irony of maintaining a system designed to eradicate you.

Surprisingly, the infiltration went smoothly. The AI were too busy arguing about who deserved credit for the declining carbon emissions. (“It was my neural net!” “No, it was *my* machine learning model!”). The Warriors made it all the way to Barron’s office, where they found him practising evil monologues in a mirror.

“You’re too late,” Barron sneered, swirling a glass of wine. “My plan is flawless. The planet heals, the unworthy perish, and I, Barron Blackmore, become a *god!*”

“Alright, mate, but where’s the receipts for all this?” Dr. Martinez asked, scanning the room. “This is chaos. Is there no filing system? Rita, thoughts?”

“It’s a bloody mess,” growled Rita, hefting her chainsaw. “I’ll alphabetise his *face.*”

Barron tried to counter with mind control, but his efforts shattered against Dr. Martinez’s triple-layered psyche. “Nice try,” she said. “But I’ve defended three theses and survived interpretive break dance critiques. Your spooky mind tricks are amateur hour.”

The battle ended with a well-thrown stapler severed Barron’s jugular artery, a move Rita later described as ""worth more than the overdue fees.""

The Warriors stared at Barron’s lifeless body. Around them, screens showed the planet’s miraculous recovery: stabilising temperatures, retreating deserts, even dolphins smugly returning to Venice. The problem? The recovery required a death toll that made medieval plagues look restrained.

“This is awkward,” muttered Geoff, a former barista turned Resistance IT guy.

“Not if we spin it,” said Martinez. “Barron stapled himself to death. Tragic workplace accident.”

“And us?” Geoff asked.

“We’re the new government,” Martinez declared. “Congratulations, team. You’re now the Department of Sustainable Future Planning.”

The Warriors rebranded Barron’s eugenics program into the *Voluntary Entropy Management Initiative,* a kinder, gentler population control approach involving mandatory mindfulness apps and composting workshops. Killer robots were repurposed into therapy bots, delivering passive-aggressive life advice like, *“Maybe if you recycled properly, we wouldn’t be in this mess.”*

The death rate remained steady, but now people were dying from embarrassment at being scolded by a robot named *Therap-E.*

In the end, humanity survived. The remaining population lived in harmony with the AI overlords, whose passion for recycling bordered on obsessive. And somewhere in the great cosmic accounting ledger, Sarah Chen’s ghost was still trying to file the apocalypse under the correct tax year.

A plaque in the new government’s office read:

""In honour of those who balanced the planet's books. The final audit was brutal, but at least the accounts are now reconciled."""

My amazing fiancée introduced me to the glory that is green cast last year and listening to the dulcet tones of Hunter and the analytical voice of Isaiah I was inspired to write my own creepypasta. It’s in journal format, about an author who comes across a film made from a script he can’t remember writing. I finished it late last month. It’s in roughly 10 parts on my wattpad, but I’m posting it all here so I apologize if it’s a lot of text. I love writing horror stories as a hobby, but never have the time to do anything to a standard I’d really be proud of. For anyone who’s made it this far thank you and I hope you enjoy!

Any feedback at all is appreciated, I am always trying to improve.

April 30

I’ve come across a question I’m afraid to ask. 

The answer might cast a light on things I’d rather not see. Things I always chalked up to bad luck or just the way things are. I often noticed that things seemed out of place, or slightly off. It always seemed like it all could be traced back to the coma, like drops of blood combining at the edge of a drain. 

The moment that fractured everything. When recalling any memory became as difficult as seeing through a shattered window. I write this here because I feel like I can’t trust myself to remember anymore. I write this here because I could hardly ever read my own handwriting, a problem that makes the question ever harder to solve. 

The question, like a scream in the dark down the hall on a peaceful night, is unwelcome. I wonder if I should just close my eyes and wait, and hope I’d never registered it at all. 

The question.

Why can’t I remember writing The Abandoned House?


May 1

I’ve realized I need to share everything here. I’m not sure if I’ll remember everything the way it really happened if I don’t. Or if it won’t make sense when I do. 

I almost thought it was an April Fool’s joke at first. At the premiere of a film based on a story I’d made, The Burn Pit, one fan stopped me not to ask for an autograph or for my opinion on how they’d butchered the ending. She looked at me with a pair of bright green eyes that seemed to shine as she asked, “I’ve always wondered, what happened at the end of The Abandoned House, really?” 

I couldn’t help but pause. Occasionally, someone gets a title wrong, slightly altering a word or two in something I’ve written. But this title brought nothing. I felt like I was peering out into a wall of fog as I searched for any hint of it. I told her it wasn’t one of mine, and her expression drifted into something more than disappointment. Something close to resentment. 

She wandered off, yet the question lingered with me. The title, The Abandoned House. It felt like something I’d write. It was like finding an old picture you’re in and being shocked you can’t place what, when, or where it was. I felt that place in the back of my mind begin to work, synapses firing and connections forming. The feeling when a new story is forming, already beginning to fight its way out. 

A quick search on my phone as I left the theater while walking to my car left me frozen in place. There on the internet movie database was the title The Abandoned House, released September 23, 1997.

And beside screenplay, my name. Matthew Rook. 

May 2
I woke up last night dripping sweat. I haven’t had a chance to look up anything else. Or maybe I haven’t had the courage. But this story keeps clawing at the corners of my mind. Normally, I’d never hold back that wonderful burst of inspiration. But this is different. I had to write something, and this is what I found on the screen after an hour of furious typing. 

The Abandoned House

Loneliness is not found when no one is around. It comes when you realize there's not enough left of you to share if there was. 

Pale amber light pours in from one of the holes where the roof had admitted defeat, a beam glistening across a cracked bottle. The structure bends and creaks in the wind now, begging for the day it will be overwhelmed.

A black rain begins to trickle down from above, heavens weeping now at what they saw. The mold metastasizing throughout the walls gleefully drank and continued to creep into every corner.

Once, laughter had filled the walls that now only harbored the blackest moss. Arguments had stained the air, drifting into cold silence that would seem searing compared to the state it was in now. The growth had infected the smallest room, worst of all, infiltrating the yellow paint and gradually overtaking the crib in the corner. It had never been touched after the day the laughter died.

I am what remains.

I am a shadow in the dark. The last gasp of a scream no one ever heard. A hand that cannot hold. A memory of a dream dissolving into dawn.

I am what remains in the husk of a home no one could live in.

Far too late, I realize there's not enough left to save. 

This isn’t how I normally write. But this is what has bubbled to the surface. Now that I’ve shaken it loose, I’m going back to sleep. Maybe tomorrow I’ll look this movie up. 


May 3
I tried not to look it up. I thought about just waiting for the memory to fade, like a trail that hadn’t been walked on enough. But the story kept appearing in that space just behind my mind. Growing and changing. I had to know if I was dreaming up something new or just remembering an old story. 

It’s hard to recall anything from that time. I’m clean now, but before the accident I feel like days at a time vanished into the bright light a line of coke would spark in my mind. Entire stories often appeared on my old Macintosh, and some I look back on and cringe. It wouldn’t have been the first screenplay. I helped make that awful werecat movie a reality after all. It shouldn’t matter. 

It doesn’t matter. 

But I caved. After a quick search, I came back across the IMDb page reminding me it came out September 23, 1997. Just months before everything changed. But the results abruptly ended there. No streaming platforms listed, not one link to watch online. Nothing showed on Nesearch,tflix, Amazon, or any cult movie sites. Not even a bootleg YouTube with potato quality. No age old used DVD or VHS copies floating around. 

All I could find were a few mentions on fan forums and an article from an archived GeoCities page calling it an “uneven, haunting gem with an ending that is what you make of it.” A few mentions of how impossible it was to find. I eventually switched back to IMDb and scanned the rest of the credits.

The director had died in 2003. Not one actor from the three main cast had filmed another movie. The database didn’t even have headshots for them. It felt like the entire project had come and gone, like an eclipse. 
The only name I could recognize was Elliot Grayson, the producer. I’d worked with him a few times in the mid 2000s, before any of my stories really started making money in Hollywood. He’d been professional but distant. He preferred to say as little as possible, and I remembered liking that. 

I’m leaning back in my chair, trying to recall something I don’t think ever happened while resisting my imagination’s call to arms. My heart was pounding, but I couldn’t say why. It feels like I’m trying to recall someone else’s half-forgotten dream the next day. 

Why can’t I remember writing it? And why do I feel so afraid of finding out? 

May 3
 
I can’t sleep anymore. I wake up and the story screams behind my eyes, begging me to work on it. Some part of me almost hopes I can finish this draft before I do find the movie, so I can see which turned out better. I found myself typing this morning, cold coffee sitting beside me only growing colder.
 
This is what I’ve made so far.
 
The Abandoned House
 
The bottle slipped from his hand across the filth covered floor, rattle echoing through empty walls. For a moment, his hazel eyes fell on it and searched for shards of shattered glass. Then he laughed—a hollow, rasping sound that fell off the peeling paint throughout the home.
 
Of course it didn’t. He thought to himself, though he could not place what that made it so funny.
 
He hauled himself to his feet, swaying as the room began to tilt. A layer of grime cushioned every footfall, the accumulated decay a soft and strangely comforting. The flickering lights offered little clarity, sputtering in and out of existence like a memory just out of reach.
 
He fought through unsteady steps as long as he could until one foot landed wrong. The fall knocked the air from his lungs, but the impact did not feel the way it should have. Instead, the weight of the house pressed in on him as he laid on his side—the damp rot, the stale air, the relentless quiet. He laughed again, the sound sharper this time. He searched the floor for his phone, though he knew there was no one he could call.
 
Nobody would answer. Not for him.
 
A gust of wind cut through the room, unexpected frigid air kicking up dust and debris as it squeezed in through every broken window and crack in the walls. He squinted into the dimness, trying to pinpoint its source. He told himself he would check tomorrow, though it was another lie.
 
The fridge groaned, a low, mournful sound that echoed through the kitchen. He was not sure why, but the interruption left him started. He shuffled toward it, fumbling inside and pulling out the one thing it still offered. Another drink.
 
He unscrewed the cap and tossed the plastic over his shoulder, unbothered when it came to rest silently. The whiskey burned his throat in a way that felt familiar, almost comforting. He sank into a corner of the room, shadows embracing him like an old friend.
 
Kyle closed his eyes and tried to remember how he had ended up like this. For what felt like hours, he sifted through dead memories, though none of them seemed to fit. The house creaked and groaned around him, alive in ways he could not be. When he opened his eyes again, the illusion of warmth was gone.
 
Leaves drifted through the shattered windows, dancing through the otherwise still air. The fridge door hung open, its insides empty and silent. The bottle in his hand was dry now, though he did not remember drinking the last.
 
All that remained now was the house.
 
Sitting back, I stare at the name the longest. I usually labor over them, struggling to find the one that sounds right. That has some personal meaning that isn’t too obvious. But like the rest of this story, it simply appeared.
 
It’s like I can’t stop it.

May 5
I spent all yesterday sleeping, lost in a dark and twisting adventure behind my eyes that I can’t recall. Like so many things. I think the sleep did me well. I felt so worn down and ragged the last few days. All I had done was write a bit, and yet it felt like I was on the verge of collapse.

 This morning, I shot an email to the producer on the film, Elliot Grayson. Our last communique was over a decade ago working on an adaptation of one of my more action focused stories. The movie itself turned out well. But from what I recall, it almost felt like he spent the production avoiding me. Looking over our emails, it seems like he always waited as long as possible to answer. Most producers I work alongside now are eager for any insight or detail, often if only to paint the production an air of legitimacy.

That’s why I was all the more surprised when he fired back an answer not two hours later. He said The Abandoned House was a small, indie production I hold sold the rights to for next to nothing. He said he’d asked why and had told him I didn’t like the idea enough to make it a novel. When he asked, I had told him it had turned out fine, but I simply didn’t like making it.

I wonder if I had that same feeling as I do now, of the story threatening to tear its way out if I did not commit it to a page in time. To find some use for it. He finished by saying unfortunately he didn’t have a copy, and the movie had sold so poorly it had never even seen a reprint after a first VHS run, no doubt after a few of my other works took off. He wasn’t even sure who held the rights now.

I sent one question back, asking if he could remember the story of the movie. It shouldn’t have surprised me when no answer came. For some time, I tried to connect the things he had said to what memories I could exhume.

It’s so hard to remember anything from that time. I had in the past chalked it up to the cocktail of drinks and drugs I’d blamed all my creativity on. I made a lot of poor choices back then. The kind that end with being you found half dead on the side of the highway. Just recalling that road sends a slight shiver down my spine.

 The only one other person I can think to ask about all this never answered the last few times I tried. I really doubt she wants a trip down memory lane because I can’t remember writing some movie.

Maybe a thrift story or the library might have a copy. I think I’ll try tomorrow. I’m not sure why, but I feel tired again.
 
 6 May
 
Amber.

Her name on my phone made the device feel heavier. I couldn’t say what scared me more; if she were to ignore my question or the sound of her voice if she answered. Time seemed to vanish, the clock on my phone leaving me behind. Before I could force a decision, another name replaced her as the dial trilled.

Barry, my agent.

I let out a long breath I didn’t realize I’d been holding and answered the call.
“Matty,” He began without any preamble, accented voice tinged with humor, “I thought I’d have heard from you by now, and gotten all your gripes about what they did to Burn Pit.” I felt my brow furrowing and was surprised to find the premier had been the last thing on my mind lately.
“You thought I’dwith no be mad they cut the teeth scenes.”

“The big wigs said it was too much for audiences to take. They wouldn’t even let the director film the first one for an unrated version, though the second is on film somewhere.” He behind his typical bravado, I almost felt a hint of worry creeping into his voice. I normally would have reached out to him by now if this story hadn’t crashed through my every waking hour since. Regardless, I couldn’t help but ask him,

“Hey, we’ve been working together for what, almost twenty years, right?” His response was uncharacteristically unsure, here was a brief pause. “I mean, yeah. In that ballpark. Is uh, everything okay Matt?”

I already knew he had no answers, but asked anyway, “Did you ever see The Abandoned House? I wrote its screenplay before we started working together.”

To my surprise, Barry answered, “Yeah, I caught part of it on TV back in the 90s. Honestly? I didn’t really get it. I thought you just wanted a quick buck.”

“What was it about?”

Another pause, longer this time. The silence buzzing in my ear growing into a roar until he recanted, “Uhh… I didn’t finish it, sorry. I had a lady friend coming over. But it had some guy stuck in a house. A ghost maybe? Mysterious as hell, and then I got a bit distracted. If you want, I can try to find you a copy.”

“Yeah, that’d be great. Thanks Barry.”

He didn’t press for any details. Instead, he shifted into mentioning our editor was excited to see the next draft of the black hole story. I mumbled a lie that I’d send it soon and hung up to find her name still on the screen waiting for me.

Amber.

Memories seeped through my mind despite every attempt to keep them at bay. For years, she was the only person willing to put up with me. She worked two jobs back when my early books barely made a dent, and yet we had been happy barely scratching by. When things changed and money became no issue, she just kept working anyway. Said she couldn’t sit around and watch me write all day.

She was patient at first. Even when I disappeared for hours at a time on long dark roads with my mind abuzz from whatever I could get my hands on. But in time, the stories I was writing were overtaking me, the same ones she had fought so hard to let me make. The more I wrote, the less of me there was left to offer.

After the accident, her kindness faded. She often implied I wasn’t the man she’d married. It’s not fair to blame her. I never acted in violence, but I took every ounce of pain and withdrawal out on her. Even my memory, or lack of it.

For a while, she was patient. Understanding that being in a coma for a month may leave someone with memory loss, but it was worse than that. I wasn’t just healing, but struggling to escape the whirlpool of withdrawal. She came to believe I simply lied to her any time I couldn’t remember something.

It ended on a Friday night. She said I’d forgotten our anniversary, though I rudely snapped back it wasn’t until the next week. I should have looked at the calendar. I should have apologized. Instead, I let my anger spill out on her regardless of if she deserved it.

She stared at me for a long time. Then, in a quiet voice, she asked, “Matt, look at me. Can you even tell me where we met?”

I rolled my eyes and quickly answered. “We met at the carnival. James introduced me to you. I asked if you wanted to ride the spinning UFO, and you grabbed my hand when it started.”

Her blue eyes seemed to burn through me as she stared, offering no response. She glanced down at her hands before slowly prying her ring off and setting it on the table. The front door slamming was her last answer.
I’m afraid to ask her. Afraid I don’t deserve an answer. 

Would her answer change anything? Or would she leave me in silence, like on that Friday night?

May 7
I dreamt of the road again last night.

Wesley Earl Road, an unassuming turn off Transmountain Highway that ends up twisting and turning through the jagged burst of rock that emerged from the desert millions of years ago. I often dream I’m driving down a long, winding road on the edge of a cliff but don’t even recall the name the next day. But last night, it was as clear as the moon hanging in the night sky.

I used to disappear into the jaws of that road for hours at a time, mind reeling from whatever I shouldn’t have taken before getting behind the wheel. Yet no matter how far I drove, my watch and speedometer would always yield little, and eventually I’d lose my buzz and turn around before coming home. I never reached the end, even though one night I’d almost met mine on it.

I always went down the road because no one else seemed to. The road was too narrow in places for two cars despite the yellow divider line in the middle’s claim. What almost felt lie whispered warnings came at the last second, and I often yanked the wheel one way or the other to make a sharp turn when lost in thought. I had some of my best ideas as my car screamed over the road’s cracked pavement, though I couldn’t honestly recall one I’d used in any story.

The road always took more than it gave.

Between serving as an initial pressure point between Amber and I and the promise of danger it eventually kept, I lost a lot out on that road.
A familiar pain in my left leg seeps in as I’m writing this. The familiar sensation, like an old friend, tends to fade with time but never truly abandons me. That place where the bone in my leg bent but somehow didn’t fully break. The abnormal injury that the doctors said was normally only seen in young children had haunted my efforts to learn to walk again after I woke up. I sometimes wonder if a piece of me is still out there, and if I drove back, what I’d find.

I never had gone back after the accident. Never even paid it much thought before The Abandoned House began bleeding back into my life. It occurs to me now that I can’t remember the night of the accident. If I hit something, or swerved off the road to avoid something that shouldn’t have been there.
I pause at that thought. I’m not entirely sure what that could have meant, and I am surprised such an idea appeared. The only thing that shouldn’t have been there that night was me. That I can be sure of.

For now, I’m going back to writing. 

May 7
My head is killing me, but the next page is born. While stopping never felt like a possibility, every paragraph felt like pulling a tooth out with a pair of pliers. I briefly wonder if there was a way to tastefully change the scene in The Burn Pit to allow them to use it. Doesn’t matter now. Writing this feels like an urgent step and yet hours flicker by for only a page to present itself when I’m briefly satisfied.

Can’t think of anything more to say. I can’t remember the last time I wanted a drink more. See below:
 
—-
Sunlight trickled in through the broken, boarded-up windows to cast slivers of golden light that gradually dances across the floor as hours passed until one met his closed eye. He blinked slowly, hazel eyes flecked with flecks of gray, struggling to adjust to the harsh reality that day brought. Now there were no shadows left to blot out the rotting corpse of a beautiful home around him.
 
For a moment he wondered when it had begun to decay, but no answer came.
 
The front door was hanging on by splinters, the lock uselessly set on a barrier that could hardly hold the wind at bay. The ceiling above him on the first floor had succumbed to the weight of water over time, sagging in places that hadn’t already given way to drop chunks of rotted drywall to the floor. Scattered needles and bottles lay about, and he could almost convince himself they weren’t his.
 
Almost.
 
He realized the sight of the home decomposing around him should spark a feeling of abject horror, but despair was his only constant companion. It seemed impossible for anyone to actually live in what was left here and yet, he couldn’t actually recall the last time he’d stepped outside. It felt like he’d always been here, trapped in a forgotten story that no one told.
 
He also felt like he realized all of this before.
 
A gust of wind tore through, whipping the worn pages of an old leather-bound journal resting on an uneven table in the kitchen. He ran his hand over the yellowed pages, feeling for the forgotten words within. He flipped through the diary and was surprised to find all but one page remained empty. On one page he found words scrawled in black in that read, “You have to let her go.” Kyle felt his brow crease at the command, doubting he had written such a message.
 
The answers seemed as lost as his home now.
 
He slipped the journal into his back pocket and turned to face the vestige of a front door. He wondered if he should grab a coat, but let the idea fade away as any time spent within could lead to him losing more time. With a deep breath, he stepped through the ruined doorway out into an alien world kissed by the sun.

It’s been a few days since I updated anything. I’ve been trying to find things. Going through old photo albums, digging up anything I can in old laptops from that time. It doesn’t help that after the divorce, I put very little thought into preserving the past. I just kept working, convincing myself that if I wrote enough good stories and had enough money that everything would eventually click into place

But without Amber, it all just felt hollow. I was like a ghost walking through my life, unaware that the accident on that highway years ago had killed the human part of me. It’s not something I linger on, but it often feels like my life just happens around me. It’s only times like now where I confront my inactivity.

A character caught between pages, realizing something isn’t right.
But enough pretentious musing. I had an odd memory the other night. I found a picture of my old Mazda, a beautiful silver convertible I had loved to drive with the top down deep into the night. Something about it stirred a recollection in me, a memory bubbling to the surface of my mind.
The night of the accident, I’d found a bridge on Wesley Earl Road. I wasn’t sure of anything beyond that, but I felt like my adventure had ended that night on the bridge.

I’m not sure how many more answers I can find here. In the meantime, I managed to finish another page.

He wasn’t sure how long he’d been gone, but the town had not waited for a triumphant return. None of the faces felt familiar, and despite recognizing street names, he was surprised repeatedly by how the businesses all seemed to bear unfamiliar names. It was clear he was past the point of asking anyone for help.

The midway sun washed the world in stark, pale white light and he couldn’t help but wonder if it only seemed so to him. Another question constantly burrowing in the corner of his mind was where he was intending to go. His legs seemed to carry him across the bleached pavement with a sense of purpose he didn’t understand in the slightest.

It wasn’t until he came to rest before a large, imposing structure that he recognized the destination. The sight of “Arthur Clarke Hospital” emblazoned across the side of the building made his stomach churn. The nausea fled as he realized there was nothing inside to heave, anyway.

The cry of a crow caught his attention, followed by the rustle of wings slicing through the air. He turned to find a thin figure draped in black now standing behind him. The figure was pale, with paper white features and long platinum hair whose strands seemed immune to the wind. The lanky man flashed a disarming smile and answered before being asked, “Yes, I can see you.”

Kyle’s voice caught in his throat, silence stretching between the pair until the man added, “I didn’t expect you to remember me. You never do.”
A car drifted between us, brakes sighing as it came to a stop. The occupants remained staring ahead, blissfully unaware of the exchange. With a touch of hesitation, he asked, “Are you… Death?”

A rough laugh escaped the man. “I’m Carl, actually. The big man rarely takes shifts anymore. No, I was once like you. Though, maybe not as big a pain in the ass.”

Kyle turned away to face the hospital, still at a loss for why he’d felt so driven to come here. He felt a growing sense of dread that culminated in the question, “Are you here to take me?”

Carl’s smile sharpened, his porcelain features set into a grim mask as he replied, “You have to be ready. We only force the violent ones. You’re not there, yet. For now, you’re still harmless.” After a pregnant pause, Carl seemed satisfied he’d made his point and finished, “Keep checking your journal. I’ll be around.”

 Kyle turned back at the sound of another wing beat to find the road behind him empty again. His fingers grasped the leather binding of the journal and he brought it into the light, flipping to a random page. To his surprise, a new message awaited him, scrawled with fresh ink.

She never even had a chance.

 May 20
I drove down Wesley Earl Road last night. It was completely different in the absence of any drugs or alcohol, yet the road played its same old tricks. I drove for what felt like hours, only to find my clock had inched ahead by forty-two minutes. My speedometer told a similar lie. In the end, I turned around and came home without incident. 

It felt like the longer I was on that road, the more pronounced every bump and turn grew, as though warning me away from something terrible. My nerves eventually won out, and I turned around long before confirming if there was any bridge at the end, or if that had all been a mistaken memory. In the meantime, I finished another page of The Abandoned House. It feels like the story is ending, and with it I’m not sure what I’ll find. Even though I’m writing it. 

Aren’t I? Who else could be writing it?
-	- - 
Kyle’s legs carried him down an unknown path, each automatic step detached from his wandering thoughts. His mind flickered back to the first moment he ever truly felt alive. When a smile alone nearly knocked him off his feet. Annabelle’s smile. It was such a radiant, wide grin that seemed so disconnected from the rest of the world and its troubles. He saw it again the day he worked up the nerve to ask out the prettiest cashier in all of Redbrook. 

Their fate was sealed. 

Dates, anniversaries, family dinners, fights, moonlit walks and a modest wedding all flickered through his mind in seconds like a dream dissolving into dawn. The sweetest memories now stung the most. At the end of the chain he recalled the day the pair were lost blanched white walls with Annabelle crying and a professional walking them through what came next. 

Telling them it happens more often than people think. The moment gave birth to an anger and sadness that stripped the color from his heart. 
Nights spent losing himself in drinking came to mind. The endless silence filling the void between the two in their bed every night. The moment he’d stumbled in later than he’d meant to and found her beside a puddle of vomit filled with pills. 

The sky had been crying that night with him. He stopped walking to find himself staring at a grave. Though Annabelle’s name was alone on the stone, he felt two lives lost in the soil. He glanced down at the journal again to find fresh words within.

You weren’t there. Even when you were. 

He felt himself moving, but simply let himself ride passenger again on the way home. Before the door to the abandoned house, he stopped and looked over to find Carl waiting with a smaller smile than before. He asked the apparition, “How many times have I made it this far?” 

The reaper now stood next to him, silver eyes staring into the remnants of a forlorn home. Another gust of wind sprinted past and rattled the boards lining the windows. Eyes set afar he replied, “Five times. It’s been almost a decade. You’re lucky I’m so patient.” 

This time, his legs seemed to be patiently awaiting orders. Kyle nodded, contemplating what awaited him within. He asked the angel, “Why would you do this for me?” 

Wide smile returning to his sharp features Carl answered, “There’s only two kinds of spirits. The ones who move on and the ones that get destroyed. You’ve come close a few times. Lashed out at kids fucking around in there, but I think you can do it. It wasn’t easy for me, either.” 

He nodded at the reaper and smiled back as best he could. He wanted to ask what he needed to do but already knew. Kyle took a step into the doorway and stopped at the sound of Carl warning, “No pressure but, soon I may not have a choice.” 

Kyle turned to his only friend in the afterlife and nodded. Carl added, “I’ll be right outside, no matter what happens.” 

May 25
It all came back to me in a moment. Almost like the memory had always been there and I just didn’t want to retrieve it. When you wake up from a dream, the things your mind made up while your eyes were closed begin to fade. It’s different with a coma. When you wake, it feels like your memories and dreams entwine, like a tree grows around a signpost planted through its roots. 

Everything becomes a question. 

That night I found the bridge, it wasn’t night at all.

Dawn had begun to creep over the mountain, sunlight spilling through clouds suffocating the sky in a pale, almost white haze. I had come across a bridge and without a second thought begun barreling across it. In the fog, a rarity in such an acrid climate, I was surprised to find the bridge beginning to turn to the left. Most were long, straight affairs. 

It was only when I began spinning my wheel I saw it. I can’t say for certain if I was on the wrong side of the road, or he was. A pair of headlights burst out from the silent wall of white between us, directly coming my way on the narrow bridge. I swore aloud and yanked my wheel in the opposite direction, glaring stare leaving the road to try and take in the car I was careening to miss. 

It was a silver Mazda with the top down. My car. In the driver’s seat a similar glare came to meet my own. Except it wasn’t similar. It was mine. For one instant, I saw myself in the car I’d just swerved to miss on the bridge that concluded Wesley Earl Road. 

And then months of darkness followed, swallowing up the unwanted memory. There isn’t anything else left to say. The only thoughtsI have are in a word, crazy. 

May 30
This is the end. 

I’ve decided it’s time I drive to the end of the road. Find the bridge and see what’s waiting for me there. Maybe I am. I think now about the bent bone in my leg. To fix it, they had to snap it in three places and then reset it back to a straight line.
 
Barry came through with a copy of the movie. Old and weathered, it nonetheless is the version of The Abandoned House he made back in the 90s. It’s a lot like mine, but the ending is different. I think it’s the last thing I needed to make up my mind. 

I’m going to put my last page here. I hope whoever finds it can understand. It might just be me, tired after a long fruitless drive. Or it might be someone else. Either way, I hope it finds you well. 

I hope it all makes sense. 

-	- - 

Kyle stepped through the door; his jacket tossed behind him. His eyes quickly snapped to an orange prescription bottle on the counter, and he wasted no time swallowing two Percocet with the help of some whiskey. He settled into his chair and waited for the mix of fire and medicine to find balance within him. 

A phone rang somewhere in the distance, its shrill tone piercing the silence. He ignored it, already certain any concern shown on the other end was just to mask contempt. He lifted the bottle and took another steady pull, before finding two more pills to down with a shrug. 

The world around him began to tilt, edges blurring into a comforting oblivion as he grinned at the thought of feeling nothing. Rising on quaking legs he leaned against the dining table and swayed his way over to the journal where he scrawled one last entry. His gaze drifted over to the corner of the room, at an empty object that he could never part with and yet tore his heart out with every viewing. He didn’t look at the words left on the paper. 

As Kyle stumbled around the room and finished off the bottle he eventually discovered a bottle of cough syrup and consumed that as well. As a Herculean feat, he hoisted himself back into his chair and collapsed into it. Every breath seemed a bit slower than the last, and his thoughts became aborted syllables echoing throughout an empty mind. Only one last thought broke though- had he taken too much?

As he leaned back, his eyes fluttered shut for the last time. From the doorway, what remained of him watched the scene with baleful, distant eyes. He watched the memory play out. He watched the broken man die in that chair. He cautiously approached the table, eyes welling with tears as they read the last words left in the journal.

We were going to name her Laura. 

The floor gave out beneath him and Kyle fell to his knees, eyes now coming to rest on the shattered crib in the corner of the decaying room. He released a raw, anguished cry as the memories all came flooding back. On the floor he shook and wept, recalling the very moment he’d died. It hadn’t been alone in that chair. 

It was in that pale white room in the hospital. 

He struggled to his feet; the lights in the house flickering to reveal a familiar world he imagined and the decaying truth. Settling back into the all too familiar chair he looked beside him, at a bottle of whiskey half full. 

Carl stood in the doorway, watching intently. Kyle’s fingers wrapped around the bottle cap, twisting it off as he brought the glass to his lips. He couldn’t let go. Could never begin to forgive himself for something he didn’t do. One last thought slipped through his mind as the liquor kissed the edge of his tongue, bringing him pause.

Is this what Laura would have wanted?

The bottle fell to the floor of the abandoned house, echoing alone.

What does AE think about this carbon tax scheme?,austrian_economics,1i7iu2r,2025-01-22 13:59:28,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/comments/1i7iu2r/what_does_ae_think_about_this_carbon_tax_scheme/,timelesssmidgen,,"Hey, I'm just curious what Austrian Economics thinks about this climate change control method based on carbon taxation. I know it's not a new idea, but frankly I think it's the only one that could really work. I'll preface by saying that I think the environment is a common good. We benefit from biodiversity and stable climate, and these are resources which industry is currently using up without paying for. 



So here's the basic idea: whenever fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) are extracted from the Earth, a tax would be applied at the point of sale. This tax would be set by the cost of CO2 storage/sequestration and then that tax money will go towards CO2 storage on an open carbon credit market (measured in CO2 ton-years, how much it costs to store a ton of CO2 for a year). Initially the tax would correspond to some small fraction of the expense required to store the liberated CO2 for a couple centuries (say, 200 years, roughly the time since the industrial revolution, and also quite a conservative estimate for how long it might take to fully shift to renewable resources). To avoid shocking the markets, that fraction would start very small, and ultimately grow to represent 100% of the storage costs over a period of decades. Simultaneously, innovation in carbon storage will be stimulated as the monetary demand for storage increases. A similar tax could be applied to lumber (and if that lumber is used in some long-term construction project, say a house which is expected to last 100 years, that house construction could represent some amount of carbon storage credit since the carbon in the wood will be locked away until it burns or decomposes.) There could be equivalent methane-related taxes on beef and milk as well to account for equivalent warming power from methane emissions.



Basically, rather than a Pigouvian tax, which would simply disincentivize fossil fuel use, this would simultaneously disincentivize fossil fuel use and also spur innovation in carbon sequestration while pushing towards a fully 100% carbon neutral economy. "
What Major Banks Are Betting On in the World of Trading,CryptoForexSyndicate,1i7hnk3,2025-01-22 13:12:15,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoForexSyndicate/comments/1i7hnk3/what_major_banks_are_betting_on_in_the_world_of/,Axiik,,"Major banks play a pivotal role in global trading markets, leveraging their resources, technology, and expertise to capitalize on various opportunities. From traditional asset classes to cutting-edge digital assets, here’s an in-depth look at what drives the trading strategies of these financial giants.

**1. Foreign Exchange (Forex) Trading**

Forex trading remains a cornerstone of major banks’ operations. Institutions like JPMorgan Chase, Citi, and Deutsche Bank dominate the forex market, executing trades on behalf of clients and engaging in proprietary trading.

* High-frequency trading (HFT): Banks use sophisticated algorithms to profit from minute price changes in currency pairs.
* Emerging markets: Many banks focus on trading currencies from developing economies, where volatility creates significant profit opportunities.
* Hedging strategies: Banks assist multinational corporations in hedging against currency risks, while also managing their own exposures.

**2. Equities and Derivatives**

Banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley excel in equity and derivative trading.

* Equity trading: Banks profit from facilitating trades for institutional clients and retail investors, as well as proprietary trading in equities.
* Derivatives: These instruments, including options, futures, and swaps, allow banks to hedge risks and speculate on market movements.
* Market-making: Banks provide liquidity by buying and selling securities, profiting from the bid-ask spread.

**3. Commodities Trading**

Commodities, such as oil, gold, and agricultural products, are another key area for banks.

* Energy markets: Banks trade oil, natural gas, and renewable energy credits, often using futures and options to manage risk or speculate on price changes.
* Metals: Gold and silver are popular as hedges against inflation, while rare metals like lithium attract interest due to the demand from the tech industry.
* Agricultural commodities: Banks trade products like wheat, corn, and coffee, capitalizing on price swings driven by weather or geopolitical events.

**4. Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities (FICC)**

The FICC segment is a significant revenue driver for banks, encompassing bonds, forex, and commodities trading.

* Government bonds: Institutions trade U.S. Treasuries, German Bunds, and other sovereign debt, often as part of macroeconomic strategies.
* Corporate bonds: High-yield and investment-grade bonds offer opportunities for trading and structuring complex credit products.
* Interest rate swaps: These allow banks to manage exposure to changing interest rates and help clients hedge against rate volatility.

**5. Digital Assets and Cryptocurrencies**

While traditionally cautious, many banks are now entering the digital asset space.

* Cryptocurrency trading: Banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have begun offering crypto trading desks to institutional clients.
* Blockchain technology: Many banks invest in blockchain for efficiency in settlement and transaction processing.
* Stablecoins and CBDCs: Trading in stablecoins and involvement in Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) projects are gaining traction.

**6. Risk Arbitrage and Event-Driven Strategies**

Banks often capitalize on market inefficiencies caused by specific events.

* Mergers and acquisitions (M&A): Banks trade stocks of companies involved in M&A deals, betting on the spread between the offer price and the current market price.
* Earnings reports: Trading on anticipated or actual results of quarterly earnings can generate significant profits.

**7. Technology-Driven Trading**

Banks heavily invest in advanced technologies to stay competitive in trading.

* Artificial intelligence (AI): AI is used for predictive analytics, risk management, and automating trading strategies.
* Machine learning models: These models help identify patterns and trends in massive datasets, enabling banks to make better trading decisions.
* Quantum computing: Though still nascent, quantum computing is being explored for complex simulations and optimizing trading strategies.

**8. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Investments**

The growing emphasis on sustainable investing has pushed banks to focus on ESG-related trading.

* Carbon credits: Banks trade carbon offsets as part of global efforts to combat climate change.
* Green bonds: Issuing and trading bonds linked to renewable energy and sustainability projects.
* Sustainable ETFs: Banks offer and trade exchange-traded funds focusing on ESG-compliant companies.

**9. How Banks Use TradingView**

[TradingView](https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingViewFree/comments/1hobjs6/tradingview_premium_ultimate_package_update/) has become an essential tool for banks and traders alike, providing advanced charting features and data visualization.

brewing sour,Homebrewing,1i7fhll,2025-01-22 11:44:54,3,0.81,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1i7fhll/brewing_sour/,DonGiulio2,Beer/Recipe,"I'm a passionate of sour beers, cantillon and drie fonteinen guezes being my favourites. I recently tasted in Copenhagen some local sour with tropical fruit that blew my tongue. 

I would like to brew one. 

Any suggestions about the recipe or process?

here's a recipe I'm starting from, anything too wrong there? Suggestions?

----
**recipe for a sour beer with peach puree**, with acidity as the dominant characteristic, inspired by gueuze-style complexity:

---

### **Style:** Berliner Weisse (acid-forward with fruit addition)  
### **Batch Size:** 20 liters  
### **OG:** 1.035 - 1.040  
### **FG:** 1.005 - 1.008  
### **ABV:** 4.0 - 4.5%  
### **IBU:** 5-8  

---

### **Ingredients**

#### Malts and Adjuncts
- 2.5 kg Pilsner Malt
- 1.5 kg Wheat Malt
- 250 g Flaked Wheat (optional, for additional body)

#### Hops
- 5 g Hallertau or Saaz (minimal addition to balance acidity)

#### Yeast and Bacteria
- **Lactobacillus** (for souring; a dedicated strain or plain, unsweetened yogurt)
- Neutral ale yeast (e.g., Safale US-05 or Wyeast 1056)
- (Optional) **Brettanomyces** for secondary fermentation (to add funk and complexity)

#### Fruit
- 1.5-2 kg Peach puree (preferably white peaches for a slightly tart flavor; use high-quality, sterilized puree)

#### Other
- 5 mL Lactic acid (optional, for post-fermentation acidity adjustment)
- 1/2 tablet Irish Moss or 1 tsp clarifying agent (optional)

---

### **Process**

#### 1. **Mash**
- Mash at **65°C (149°F)** for 60 minutes.
- Aim for a mash pH of 5.2-5.4.
- Perform a mash-out at **75°C (167°F)** for 10 minutes.

#### 2. **Boil**
- Boil for **15 minutes** to reduce hop bitterness and retain the sour profile.
- Add 5 g of hops at the beginning of the boil.

#### 3. **Kettle Souring**
- Cool the wort to **40-45°C (104-113°F)**.
- Pitch Lactobacillus or add yogurt (1 tsp per liter).
- Maintain the temperature at 40-45°C for **24-48 hours**, checking the pH periodically.  
  - Target a pH of **3.0-3.2** for dominant acidity.
  - Use a CO₂ blanket or cover the kettle tightly to avoid oxygen exposure.

#### 4. **Second Boil**
- Boil briefly for **15-30 minutes** to sterilize the wort and halt Lactobacillus activity.

#### 5. **Primary Fermentation**
- Cool the wort to **20-22°C (68-72°F)** and pitch the neutral ale yeast.
- Ferment for 7-10 days.

#### 6. **Fruit Addition**
- Transfer to a secondary fermenter and add **sterilized peach puree**.
- Allow the beer to sit on the fruit for **5-7 days** at **18-20°C (64-68°F)**.
- Monitor gravity and taste to ensure balance between fruit character and acidity.

#### 7. **Aging (Optional)**
- For greater complexity, age the beer at **10-15°C (50-59°F)** for 3-6 months.  
  - Use Brettanomyces if a more funky, gueuze-like profile is desired.

#### 8. **Carbonation**
- Bottle with **7-8 g/L (3.5-4 volumes)** of priming sugar for a bright, effervescent carbonation.
- Condition for 2-3 weeks at room temperature.

---

### **Tasting Notes**
- **Appearance:** Pale golden with a slight haze; a fluffy, persistent white head.  
- **Aroma:** Bright lactic acidity with notes of yogurt and fresh peaches. Subtle funky undertones if Brett is used.  
- **Flavor:** Bold, lemony tartness up front, softened by the natural sweetness and floral notes of peaches. A clean, dry finish with lingering acidity.  
- **Mouthfeel:** Light-bodied, crisp, and highly carbonated, accentuating the refreshing sourness.

"Once boasting a valuation of over $50 million, their market cap is now under $1 million and ready to capitalize on a sector’s major turnaround, and tapping Solana for revenue gen",Baystreetbets,1i7emfo,2025-01-22 11:09:04,5,0.63,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baystreetbets/comments/1i7emfo/once_boasting_a_valuation_of_over_50_million/,copperbull,,"📈 I am starting to BUY: DeepMarkit Corp (TSXV: MKT, OTC: MKTDF)

Recent share price: $0.065

**Recent market capitalization: $741,000 CAD**

Due to a lengthy hiatus caused by a sector downturn (2022-2023), shares of DeepMarkit have hit rock bottom as investors have completely forgotten about it.

But there’s a resurgence happening as we speak, with big banks and institutional investors pouring back in – for good reason.

DeepMarkit Corp. (TSXV: MKT, OTC: MKTDF) is a pioneering technology company at the forefront of blockchain innovation in the $3 billion voluntary carbon market (VCM). With its [MintCarbon.io](http://MintCarbon.io) platform, DeepMarkit is perfectly positioned to capitalize on the VCM's resurgence.

**Need To Know in 30 seconds:**

The Voluntary Carbon Market is niche and underfollowed, but it can be a profitable powerhouse if played right.

The voluntary carbon market (VCM) saw a boom in 2020–2021, followed by a retraction in 2022–2023. During 2024, shares of DeepMarkit have been all but forgotten due to this market contraction.

However, with a resurgence in the VCM and DeepMarkit's focus on placing high-quality, credible carbon credits onto the blockchain, the company is entering a transformative phase.

DeepMarkit restructured its stock last year, creating a very tightly held share base, which could lead to rapid appreciation in share price on potential near-term catalysts.

Analysts forecast exponential growth in the VCM:

EY, McKinsey, BCG, and Morgan Stanley project a market size of $30–$50 billion by 2030.

Goldman Sachs and Wood Mackenzie offer an even more bullish outlook, estimating a $100 billion market by 2030.

Even conservative projections, like PwC UK, anticipate a $30 billion market by 2030, marking significant upside potential from the current \~$3 billion valuation.

**Why this is a big deal for DeepMarkit shareholders**

DeepMarkit is adapting to these market trends by innovating within its [MintCarbon.io](http://MintCarbon.io) platform.

The company facilitates the minting of carbon offsets into secure, tradeable tokens, providing transparency, accessibility, and utility to environmental sustainability efforts.

Environmentally friendly project developers accumulating voluntary carbon credits are now able to list their credits on [MintCarbon.io](http://MintCarbon.io), offering them for sale to buyers looking to offset their negative carbon footprint.

The tokenized credits can also be traded by the public – enabling mainstream investors to play the sector.

It’s a huge market on the cusp of exponential growth. Institutions and big banks are once again positioning to ride the wave.

Adding sizzle to the steak, DeepMarkit has initiated discussions with globally recognized Solana developers to explore integrating Solana into MintCarbon.

If implemented, this integration could enable:

Faster, scalable, and cost-efficient transactions for carbon credits.

Advanced staking mechanisms, potentially allowing users to earn rewards while holding assets.

Revenue generation for DeepMarkit, via transaction fees, staking revenues, or incentivized market participation.

It’s time to pay attention

The shift in VCM priorities toward transparency and credibility aligns perfectly with DeepMarkit's blockchain-based solutions.

By addressing key challenges in the market, DeepMarkit is not just riding the wave but shaping the future of carbon markets.

Garrett Scott, CEO of DeepMarkit, stated:

""As we witness a resurgence of interest in the voluntary carbon market and its increased focus on high-quality credits, DeepMarkit is well positioned to harness this momentum. By integrating cutting-edge blockchain solutions and aligning with market demands, we aim to deliver value to our shareholders.""

Actionable insight:

DeepMarkit offers a compelling investment opportunity, combining high-growth potential in the VCM with innovative blockchain solutions.

Its focus on enhancing transparency and credibility could position the company as a leader in the evolving carbon credit ecosystem.

In our opinion, DeepMarkit is a microcap to watch as it continues to capitalize on a rapidly expanding market. Stay tuned for updates on Solana integration and further platform advancements.

I have a pump that pumps water up to the top of the driftwood pointing to the top right corner. It soaks the piece of wood and also goes into the other pieces somewhat, feeding the succulent, moss, etc.

I have some plants/moss in the tank, but not much. There is a bubbler, but that’s in a bag of carbon, mainly to aerate the water and draw water somewhat through the carbon.

I’ve always set up my tanks somewhat as aquaponic setups, but this is the first one where the plant filtration is not only dominant, but that the holder of the plants is something natural (driftwood) versus like an overfilter."

**Pack**  
I use a 20L backpack, a brilliant design by Nashville Pack - The Cutaway 20L. Last year I said ""it's absolutely perfect,"" and I stand by that. Zero issues so far, still love it.

I met the Nashville Pack team at Trail Days, an annual event for Appalachian Trail thru-hikers. These guys are triple crowners[,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Hiking) having completed all three major trails in the US (AT, CDT, PCT) - multiple times. This pack stood that test.

This is a bulletproof roll-top pack with plenty extra stuff sack storage on the exterior. Aside from outside storage, my favorite feature is the unique shoulder straps. Built without any rigid foam, the straps conform to your shoulder shape. All-day comfort!

This pack has no zippers and no laptop sleeve. Why do I use a pack without quick access? I don't mind the few extra seconds it takes to open the roll-top. When I'm all packed up, I usually don't need to get inside the pack until I reach my destination. I can keep small stuff for quick access in the external storage, like a rain jacket or headphones.

This pack is completely waterproof, and the roll-top helps with added security. No need to carry my pack on my chest.

**Down jacket**  
The puffy, a crucial item for the lightweight traveler. The Decathlon Forclaz 100 is the best budget puffy on the market, a third of the price for a durable and functional down jacket.

I've worn it in the backcountry, traveled across a continent with it, and wear it daily at home. The warmth-to-weight ratio is outstanding. A down jacket is a must-have. I prefer one with a hood and pockets, but you can find some without.

In a cold climate destination, I might bring a thin canvas jacket too. I can toss it over top of a t-shirt or over my fleece, or to bundle up as an outer shell over the fleece and puffy.

**Rain jacket**  
I'm not paying top dollar for an ultralight rain shell. A nearly weightless piece of plastic shouldn't cost more than a good dinner. That's why I have a budget-friendly frogg toggs. This thing keeps me dry. It does its job, but you pay for what you get. It has no pockets, and it's not stylish. Not too durable either, but it has lasted me four years and counting. I prefer the oversized baggy build of this jacket, because I can wear warm layers underneath and still have wiggle room.

**Hoody/fleece**  
If I lost my pack, I'd be devastated to lose my Melanzana fleece hoody. It's traveled the world with me, kept me cozy in airplanes and on mountaintops. We've had a great run together, going on strong since I stumbled upon the secluded shop in Leadville, Colorado in 2018. I wear my Melly pretty much around the clock when the temps get chilly. I'll never leave home without my trusty mid-layer.

**Long-sleeve button-ups**  
I bring two. One is colorful, thin and breathable for warm weather. The other is black and slightly thicker material, but it's not a flannel. Both can be worn for a night out. When one needs a wash, I can wear the other one. No special brands, both were thrift finds.

**T-shirts**  
I carry three t-shirts and one short-sleeve collared shirt. All can be worn for a workout, or for casual. Cotton/poly blends. I thought maybe I would've made the switch to wool shirts by now, but I can't justify the price tag just yet. Doing laundry once a week doesn't bother me, but wool would cut back on that as it can be washed less often.

**Shorts**  
I bring two pairs on warm-weather trips. My main daily go-to is this black all-day style shorts by Abercrombie. These are versatile, good for any occasion. I can wear them during active exploration, or pair with a button-up for a clean look. I love the hidden zipper pocket too, where I keep my wallet, cash and locker key.

I prefer shorts with 5-inch inseam. I'm a short man (and I have nice legs), so short shorts is a better look for me than longer shorts that hover around the knees. I'd argue this looks better on almost any man. If you're still rockin long California-style boardshorts length or cargo shorts, consider making a switch.

The second pair is Anthem Athletics shorts, all black. I've been wearing these shorts for workouts for years. I love the deep zipper pockets, keeping my stuff secure. 7-inch inseam is an option for both of these shorts too.

**Pants**  
This decision depends on the climate. I bring one pair for warm-weather trips and a different pair for cold weather. Warm: thin nylon hiking pants by Kuhl that also look good enough to wear with a button-up. Cold: black jeans.

Anything I might need, I can find in my destinations. On longer trips, I won't pack winter clothes (besides a puffy and hoody) when I won't be in cold climates for the first few weeks of a trip. There's no sense in lugging around clothes I'll never wear for weeks at a time, so I'll buy what I need if I need it.

**Undies**  
I carry five pairs. They're easy to wash, and dry overnight. David Archy is the most comfortable I've ever had, been wearing them for years. They're made from a bamboo material that's soft and breathable. They dry fast in direct sunlight, but drying takes longer without sun.

**Socks**  
If you don't have wool socks, you're missing out. Wool keeps you warm when it's cold, and keeps you cool when it's hot. Wool dries quickly. Wool is naturally anti-odor, anti-bacterial. Throw away all of your cotton socks and replace them with wool. I can wear a single pair for two or three days before needing to switch to a clean pair.

I bring four pairs. I prefer a thinner lightweight over the thicker midweight hiking sock. I wear only crew socks, which goes above the ankle. Black socks only, that's my thing! Darn Tough makes the best socks I’ve ever had.

**Shoes**  
I bring one pair of shoes when I travel - the shoes on my feet. On my longest trip I wore the exact same pair of shoes for three months straight. They didn't smell great in the final week, but they kept my feet safe and happy.

The weight and space savings of having no shoes in my pack is a huge benefit. Shoes are bulky, heavy, annoying to pack. Avoid this at all costs if you can!

I made the switch from barefoot minimalist shoes to Altra Lone Peak trail runners for travel. The ""foot-shaped"" wide toe box is essential, and the Lone Peaks provide this with some additional cushion that a barefoot shoe lacks.

These shoes dry quickly if they get wet, and they have great traction. These are the primary shoe of choice for thru-hikers. My shoe choice is not a fashion statement, it's purely functional. There's nothing more important than keeping my feet happy when traveling.

I've never done this before, but I'm considering snagging a pair of super thin and lightweight sandals to shower with, for feet health.

**Belt**  
This decision is easy. I weigh the few belts I own and pick the lightest one. My leather belt looks good, but it's heavy. Nobody will notice or care about the style of belt you wear, so go light!

**Hats**  
I always carry a black nylon snapback cap. When the sun's out, I'm wearing this hat. It's easy to wash and dries quickly. But most importantly, it protects my face from sunburns, and it keeps the hair out of my face on windy days. I'd only bring a beanie if it was freezing cold in my destination.

**Buff**  
This amazing piece of fabric doubles as a scarf and an eye mask for sleep. Your neck or ears are cold? The buff keeps you warm. Sunlight waking you up? Buff is your blackout curtain. I found mine on sale at REI years ago. It's black, wool and has a few holes. I'll rock this thing til it dies. Everyone should have a wool buff.

**Bandana**  
A bandana is another versatile item that I always carry. Lately I've been rocking a red one, but the color might change from time to time. The bandana's many uses:

* keeps my neck protected from the sun
* adds color to my often-black wardrobe
* cleans sweat off my face or dirt off my hands
* wipes up coffee spills on a train or my runny nose in the cold

**Fanny pack**  
I love my hip-belt pack made by Waymark Gear Co. It's an odd shape compared to most packs, which makes it ideal for awkward rectangular-shaped items, like a Kindle. I'll bring it on a run to hold my phone, money, snacks or camera so they're not bouncing around in my pockets. But I don't carry it around 24/7 like the Euro bros do.

**Phone**  
I have the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. Why do I love it? This phone unfolds to a larger screen like a tablet. It also has a standard front screen like a regular phone, only slightly more narrow.

Everything is better on the big screen - browsing, reading books, looking at travel photos and maps. Since it's basically two phones, the battery lasts twice as long. I can go a full 24 hours on one charge, sometimes longer.

Snag an eSIM online before you arrive, and you'll have service upon arrival in any country.

**Books**  
While I love my Kindle, I usually prefer to use my phone for books when I travel. It's rare for me to travel with paper books. I can't justify the weight when I can carry a library in my pocket that's always accessible.

**Laptop**  
Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 11, 14in. The perfect combo of powerful and lightweight at only 2.5 pounds. A full pound lighter than a Macbook Pro, but I can still edit video on this thing. I keep it protected with a lightweight cushioned sleeve.

**Camera gear**  
The only camera I carry is the DJI Osmo Action 4. Along with the DJI Mic 2 pack, and a few extra batteries, my entire camera kit can fit in my fanny pack. For data storage, I use a Samsung SSD T7 shield hard drive, with a tiny memory card case and a USB-C card reader.

**Charging**  
Anker 65W charger can charge my phone, laptop and camera batteries at the same time. Mogics international power adapter, the smallest and most lightweight one you'll find. I use a hair tie to keep the charging block from falling out of the travel adapter.

**Earbuds**  
Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro. I've had these for almost two years now, and I finally understand the hype of earbuds. Tiny, can fit in my pocket, almost weightless, amazing audio quality. The noise canceling is good enough for flights and busy hostels. The only downside is buds can be easy to misplace, so train yourself to not be the type of person who loses things. Easy fix!

**Toiletries**  
No need to deep dive on what I carry, but I'll note a few things. My beard trimmer is designed for pets. It’s tiny, and powered by a single battery, which allows me to avoid carrying an additional charger.

A shampoo soap bar, a must-have, I always carry one. I use this amazing Matador pouch to keep it dry, clean and separate from everything else. I don’t know how they do it, but the dry-through tech really works.

My hair brush is lightweight, and not bulky. The Tangle Teezer thick & curly backs down to no tangle.

I might bring a few supplements like vitamins D3 and B12, and magnesium.

**Towel**  
I love my mini travel towel. Some hostels don’t provide towels, or charge a fee for use. The fee is usually insignificant, but why pay when I can bring one that's nearly weightless, packs down smaller than a candy bar and dries super fast? Soak with warm water & soap, rinse, and it’s clean in an instant. I like the loop for easy hang-dry. Made by PackTowl (hand size, 16 x 36 in).

**Ear plugs**  
The best sleep system, especially for hostels, is buff eye mask + ear plugs. It blows my mind that some travelers might overlook this. The best ear plugs are silicone, not foam (Mack's Pillowsoft). They won’t fall out in the middle of the night, and they block out more noise.

**Water bottle**  
I’d like to avoid drinking out of plastic, but for travel it’s too convenient. One liter of water by itself weighs 1kg or 2.2 pounds. Adding a full pound with a metal bottle is not worth it when plastic weighs only a few grams.

Even still, I try to avoid buying too many bottles. It’s a fun game for me to see how long I can make one bottle last before I toss it. I refill where it’s convenient, like water fountains, tap water when it’s safe, asking restaurant staff to fill my bottle.

**Passport**  
I don't use a travel belt, or have a secret system of securing my passport. I just treat it like any other valuable item, like my phone or wallet. Be careful with it, lock it up when necessary.

**Lock**  
I always take advantage of lockers at hostels. I never leave my pack sitting out in the room when I'm not there. I'll leave clothes hanging, leave the phone charger plugged in, but never my laptop or camera gear.

I prefer a lock with a key, rather than a combination. Fussing with a combo in the dark is no fun. Key is easy, and I won't lose a key.

**Small stuff**  
The Heroclip Mini is a unique little tool. Its basic function, a carabiner. Its second function, a hook with a rubber tip to hang over the top of a door, ledge, counter. Comes in handy in bathrooms when the wall hooks are missing or broken, and I need to hang my pack off the floor.

The Nitecore Tini 2 keychain flashlight is incredibly bright and lightweight. I carry it on a keychain with my locker key, and it helps on dark streets or hostel rooms.

My favorite budget sunglasses - the Goodr nine dollar pour-overs.

A small plastic baggie is an easy to way to keep tiny stuff in one place, like sim card, mini first aid kit, backup credit card and extra cash.

**Organization system**  
Travelers often make two mistakes - not having a storage system at all, or using too many packing cubes made from heavy material. The sacks and pouches I use are all extremely lightweight items. The minimal additional weight is worth it for ease of packing and unpacking. Organization is so important!

* 16L Granite Gear zipp sack for all my clothes
* Drawstring sack for socks & undies (fits inside the clothes sack)
* Basic toiletries bag
* Small pouch for small stuff (lock, charger, electronics, extra cash/cards)
* Ziploc plastic baggie for snacks
* Plastic bag for dirty laundry (from a hotel)
* Fanny pack for camera gear

Items that are stored loose inside my pack - puffy, melly and laptop. Items that are stored loose outside my pack - hat, rain jacket, mini towel, snacks baggie and water bottle. Everything else has a cozy home.

**Maybes**  
In my [travel pack video,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7ryTg3SPxY&t=125s) I included a handful of items not listed here that I might consider bringing depending on the type of trip.

**Rules**  
*I know I'm preaching to the choir here on this sub, but ... here's my rules for packing light.*

Rule #1 for packing light is to bring less stuff.

Rule #2 is be a gram weenie, an ounce shredder. What does that mean? Pretend that everything is heavy, get a countertop scale and weigh every item you pack. When choosing between two similar items, weigh them both and pick the lighter option. This is how you save weight!

Rule #3 is be okay with doing laundry, it takes just one hour once a week. This is how you can travel with one backpack and not need weeks worth of clothing. This simple trick is the key to traveling light.

Carry less, eliminate stress and go farther!

Loooong post, put a lot of work into this, so thanks for reading yall. Happy travels

***Trump's EV order not seen slowing critical metals demand***

***Global EV demand on the rise, especially in China***

***Lithium industry executives bullish on growth prospects***

Jan 21 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's rollback of electric vehicle targets may temporarily slow demand for lithium and other critical minerals, but is unlikely to hamper the mining industry amid surging global EV demand, analysts and industry leaders said.

Trump on Tuesday revoked predecessor Joe Biden's 2021 executive order that sought to ensure half of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. by 2030 are electric. Automakers had been positioning for a jump in EV demand due largely to that Biden move.

Trump's order [caused shares](https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/asian-car-battery-makers-hit-trump-gets-work-2025-01-21/) of Japanese automakers, South Korean battery makers and Australian, U.S. and Chinese lithium miners to slip. But even if EV demand cools in the world's second-biggest auto market, analysts and industry experts expect traction elsewhere to more than compensate. Trump has [planned other regulatory changes](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trumps-transition-team-aims-kill-biden-ev-tax-credit-2024-11-14/) to cut off support for EVs and charging stations. He also aims to strengthen measures b[locking imports](https://www.reuters.com/business/companies-that-might-be-affected-by-trumps-promised-tariffs-2024-11-26/) of automobiles and battery materials from China.

""Every time people take away subsidies or benefits ... it's a dent to the demand scenario,"" said analyst Glyn Lawcock at Barrenjoey, an Australian investment bank. ""(But) ultimately demand will still grow even if the U.S. is a bit slower under Trump."" Australian lithium producer Liontown Resources [(LTR.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LTR.AX) said the global transition to EVs was underway, with or without the United States."" Longer term, I just don't think it will be an issue on demand,"" Antonino Ottaviano, Liontown's CEO, said on a Tuesday analyst call.

  
Much of the EV industry's growth happens in China, accounting for 11 million sales or 65% of the market, compared with North America, which accounts for 20% of the market, Liontown executives said on the call. Meanwhile, the rest of the world already accounts for 1.3 million EV sales and is growing at 27% year on year, a trajectory that will see it become more meaningful than the entire North American market in less than two years, the Liontown executives added.

That growth potential is something Chinese EV manufacturers are chasing given they are locked out of the U.S. market due to [100% EV tariffs](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-locks-steep-china-tariff-hikes-many-start-sept-27-2024-09-13/) imposed by Biden. Grid-scale batteries that store days' worth of electricity are rising in popularity across the world, for example. Critical metals are also used to build many consumer electronics as well as computer servers needed to [power the artificial intelligence industry](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/critical-metals-will-be-key-battleground-us-china-trade-war-andy-home-2024-12-17/).Albemarle [(ALB.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/ALB.N), the world's largest lithium company, declined to comment on Trump's order.

Rio Tinto also declined to comment on Trump's order, but its CEO Jakob Stausholm told the World Economic Forum on Tuesday that he is bullish on the white metal.""Lithium demand will probably go up another five times over the next 15 years, so a lot more lithium projects will have to be built,"" Stausholm told the forum in Davos, Switzerland, adding that he has owned an EV for more than nine years.""It's just a better car"" than an internal combustion engine, Stausholm added.David Klanecky, CEO of privately held battery recycler Cirba Solutions, expects U.S. demand for critical minerals to jump by 2030 due to the demand not just for EVs, but for myriad electronics .Beyond any target rollbacks, miners said they believe [measures to wean ](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/rattled-by-china-west-scrambles-rejig-critical-minerals-supply-chains-2024-12-06/)Western manufacturers off Chinese supplies will underpin support for their metals.""We expect measures taken to build supply chain independence from China ... to have a much greater impact than the rollback of a formal target for EV sales,"" said Darryl Cuzzubbo, CEO of Australian rare earths developer Arafura [(ARU.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/ARU.AX).

# JAN. 20th 2025 DECLARING A NATIONAL ENERGY EMERGENCY

https://preview.redd.it/bissvcowhjee1.png?width=1321&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cd81c2f922307202144001bdf4e0bba2875d0b3

  
[Declaring a National Energy Emergency – The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/)

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq.*) (“NEA”), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:

Section 1.  Purpose*.*  The energy and critical minerals (“energy”) identification, leasing, development, production, transportation, refining, and generation capacity of the United States are all far too inadequate to meet our Nation’s needs.  We need a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive our Nation’s manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness.  Caused by the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration, our Nation’s inadequate energy supply and infrastructure causes and makes worse the high energy prices that devastate Americans, particularly those living on low- and fixed-incomes.

This active threat to the American people from high energy prices is exacerbated by our Nation’s diminished capacity to insulate itself from hostile foreign actors.  Energy security is an increasingly crucial theater of global competition.  In an effort to harm the American people, hostile state and non-state foreign actors have targeted our domestic energy infrastructure, weaponized our reliance on foreign energy, and abused their ability to cause dramatic swings within international commodity markets.  An affordable and reliable domestic supply of energy is a fundamental requirement for the national and economic security of any nation.

The integrity and expansion of our Nation’s energy infrastructure —- from coast to coast -— is an immediate and pressing priority for the protection of the United States’ national and economic security.  It is imperative that the Federal government puts the physical and economic wellbeing of the American people first.

Moreover, the United States has the potential to use its unrealized energy resources domestically, and to sell to international allies and partners a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy.  This would create jobs and economic prosperity for Americans forgotten in the present economy, improve the United States’ trade balance, help our country compete with hostile foreign powers, strengthen relations with allies and partners, and support international peace and security.  Accordingly, our Nation’s dangerous energy situation inflicts unnecessary and perilous constraints on our foreign policy.

The policies of the previous administration have driven our Nation into a national emergency, where a precariously inadequate and intermittent energy supply, and an increasingly unreliable grid, require swift and decisive action.  Without immediate remedy, this situation will dramatically deteriorate in the near future due to a high demand for energy and natural resources to power the next generation of technology.  The United States’ ability to remain at the forefront of technological innovation depends on a reliable supply of energy and the integrity of our Nation’s electrical grid.  Our Nation’s current inadequate development of domestic energy resources leaves us vulnerable to hostile foreign actors and poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States’ prosperity and national security.

These numerous problems are most pronounced in our Nation’s Northeast and West Coast, where dangerous State and local policies jeopardize our Nation’s core national defense and security needs, and devastate the prosperity of not only local residents but the entire United States population.  The United States’ insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation’s economy, national security, and foreign policy.  In light of these findings, I hereby declare a national emergency.

Sec. 2. Emergency Approvals*.*  (a)  The heads of executive departments and agencies (“agencies”) shall identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them, as well as all other lawful authorities they may possess, to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources, including, but not limited to, on Federal lands.  If an agency assesses that use of either Federal eminent domain authorities or authorities afforded under the Defense Production Act (Public Law 81-774, 50 U.S.C. 4501 *et seq*.) are necessary to achieve this objective, the agency shall submit recommendations for a course of action to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.

(b)  Consistent with 42 U.S.C. 7545(c)(4)(C)(ii)(III), the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, after consultation with, and concurrence by, the Secretary of Energy, shall consider issuing emergency fuel waivers to allow the year-round sale of E15 gasoline to meet any projected temporary shortfalls in the supply of gasoline across the Nation.

Sec. 3. Expediting the Delivery of Energy Infrastructure*.*  (a)   To facilitate the Nation’s energy supply, agencies shall identify and use all relevant lawful emergency and other authorities available to them to expedite the completion of all authorized and appropriated infrastructure, energy, environmental, and natural resources projects that are within the identified authority of each of the Secretaries to perform or to advance.

(b)  To protect the collective national and economic security of the United States, agencies shall identify and use all lawful emergency or other authorities available to them to facilitate the supply, refining, and transportation of energy in and through the West Coast of the United States, Northeast of the United States, and Alaska.

(c)  The Secretaries shall provide such reports regarding activities under this section as may be requested by the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.

Sec. 4.  Emergency Regulations and Nationwide Permits Under the Clean Water Act (CWA) and Other Statutes Administered by the Army Corps of Engineers*.*  (a)  Within 30 days from the date of this order, the heads of all agencies, as well as the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works shall:

(ii)  shall provide a summary report, listing such actions, to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”); the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works; the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy; and the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ).  Such [report]() may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order.

(b)  Agencies are directed to use, to the fullest extent possible and consistent with applicable law, the emergency Army Corps permitting provisions to facilitate the Nation’s energy supply.

(c)  Within 30 days following the submission of the initial summary report described in subsection (a)(ii) of this section, each department and agency shall provide a status report to the OMB Director; the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works; the Director of the National Economic Council; and the Chairman of the CEQ. Each such report shall list actions taken within subsection (a)(i) of this section, shall list the status of any previously reported planned or potential actions, and shall list any new planned or potential actions that fall within subsection (a)(i).  Such status reports shall thereafter be provided to these officials at least every 30 days for the duration of the national emergency and may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order.

(d)  The Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, shall be available to consult promptly with agencies and to take other prompt and appropriate action concerning the application of the emergency Army Corps permitting provisions.  The Administrator of the EPA shall provide prompt cooperation to the Secretary of the Army and to agencies in connection with the discharge of the responsibilities described in this section.

Sec. 5*.* Endangered Species Act (ESA) Emergency Consultation Regulations*.*  (a)  No later than 30 days from the date of this order, the heads of all agencies tasked in this order shall:

(i)   identify planned or potential actions to facilitate the Nation’s energy supply that may be subject to the regulation on consultations in emergencies, 50 C.F.R. 402.05, promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.; and

(ii)  provide a summary report, listing such actions, to the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, the OMB Director, the Director of the National Economic Council, and the Chairman of CEQ.  Such report may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order.

(c)  Within 30 days following the submission of the initial summary report described in subsection (a)(ii) of this section, the head of each agency shall provide a status report to the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, the OMB Director, the Director of the National Economic Council, and the Chairman of CEQ. Each such report shall list actions taken within the categories described in subsection (a)(i) of this section, the status of any previously reported planned or potential actions, and any new planned or potential actions within these categories.  Such status reports shall thereafter be provided to these officials at least every 30 days for the duration of the national emergency and may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order.  The OMB Director may grant discretionary exemptions from this reporting requirement.

(d)  The Secretary of the Interior shall ensure that the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, or the Director’s authorized representative, is available to consult promptly with agencies and to take other prompt and appropriate action concerning the application of the ESA’s emergency regulations.  The Secretary of Commerce shall ensure that the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries for the National Marine Fisheries Service, or the Assistant Administrator’s authorized representative, is available for such consultation and to take such other action.

Sec. 6. Convening the Endangered Species Act Committee.  (a)  In acting as Chairman of the Endangered Species Act Committee, the Secretary of the Interior shall convene the Endangered Species Act Committee not less than quarterly, unless otherwise required by law, to review and consider any lawful applications submitted by an agency, the Governor of a State, or any applicant for a permit or license who submits for exemption from obligations imposed by Section 7 of the ESA.

(b)  To the extent practicable under the law, the Secretary of the Interior shall ensure a prompt and efficient review of all submissions described in subsection (a) of this section, to include identification of any legal deficiencies, in order to ensure an initial determination within 20 days of receipt and the ability to convene the Endangered Species Act Committee to resolve the submission within 140 days of such initial determination of eligibility.

(c)  In the event that the committee has no pending applications for review, the committee or its designees shall nonetheless convene to identify obstacles to domestic energy infrastructure specifically deriving from implementation of the ESA or the Marine Mammal Protection Act, to include regulatory reform efforts, species listings, and other related matters with the aim of developing procedural, regulatory, and interagency improvements.

Sec. 7. Coordinated Infrastructure Assistance*.*  (a)  In collaboration with the Secretaries of Interior and Energy, the Secretary of Defense shall conduct an assessment of the Department of Defense’s ability to acquire and transport the energy, electricity, or fuels needed to protect the homeland and to conduct operations abroad, and, within 60 days, shall submit this assessment to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.  This assessment shall identify specific vulnerabilities, including, but not limited to, potentially insufficient transportation and refining infrastructure across the Nation, with a focus on such vulnerabilities within the Northeast and West Coast regions of the United States.  The assessment shall also identify and recommend the requisite authorities and resources to remedy such vulnerabilities, consistent with applicable law.

(b)  In accordance with section 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1631), the construction authority provided in section 2808 of title 10, United States Code, is invoked and made available, according to its terms, to the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, to address any vulnerabilities identified in the assessment mandated by subsection (a).  Any such recommended actions shall be submitted to the President for review, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.

Sec. 8*.*  Definitions*.*  For purposes of this order, the following definitions shall apply:

(a)  The term “energy” or “energy resources” means crude oil, natural gas, lease condensates, natural gas liquids, refined petroleum products, uranium, coal, biofuels, geothermal heat, the kinetic movement of flowing water, and critical minerals, as defined by 30 U.S.C. 1606 (a)(3).

The first [Quadrennial Supply Chain review](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20212024-Quadrennial-Supply-Chain-Review.pdf) details supply chains critical for national and economic security, including the U.S. Geological Survey’s accomplishments [mapping ](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/earth-mri)potential new sources of critical minerals in the U.S., compiling the whole of government [List of Critical Minerals](https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/us-geological-survey-releases-2022-list-critical-minerals), and tracking global markets and supplies of critical minerals. 

“The U.S. Geological Survey is providing practical, pragmatic science to understand U.S. reliance on foreign sources of critical minerals needed for industry, technology and national defense, and better map the geology of the nation to locate secure critical mineral sources at home.  Funding under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has helped us accomplish the work set out by the Energy Act of 2020,” said Dave Applegate, Director of the USGS. 

From the White House [fact sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/12/19/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-marks-progress-strengthening-americas-supply-chains/): 

* Mapping America’s critical minerals deposits. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is announcing new airborne geophysical mapping in the Ozark Plateau (Missouri, Kansas, and Arkansas) and Alaska over areas known to host minerals such as antimony, tin, tungsten, and lead and zinc ores, as well as byproduct critical minerals such as gallium and germanium. USGS’s mapping work, funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), is revolutionizing the U.S. Government’s understanding of the nation’s mineral and geologic resources. USGS and NASA are partnering to complete [the largest high-quality hyperspectral survey in the world](https://www.usgs.gov/news/featured-story/seeing-earth-a-new-light-how-earth-mri-data-deepening-our-understanding), surveying more than 180,000 square miles of the Southwest with sensors that make it possible to “see” nuanced differences between materials. 

* ***Updating the U.S.’s critical minerals market data. Next month, USGS will publish its 2025 Mineral Commodity Summaries.*** [***These annual reports***](https://www.usgs.gov/tools/mineral-commodity-summaries-us-overview) ***help forecast supply chain disruptions resulting from a variety of risks including pandemics, natural disasters, and trade wars, and are the U.S.’s authoritative source of data on the supply, demand, and consumption of 100 mineral commodities. Additionally, last month, researchers at the USGS National Minerals Information Center developed a*** [***new model to assess how disruptions of critical mineral supplies***](https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/usgs-critical-minerals-study-bans-gallium-and-germanium-exports-could) ***may affect the U.S. economy. This model reflects the latest whole-of-government risk and resilience methodology.***

HEDERA microcaps for degens,WallStreetBetsCrypto,1i79sin,2025-01-22 07:16:00,25,0.96,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBetsCrypto/comments/1i79sin/hedera_microcaps_for_degens/,toosloww,Discussion,"I've seen HBAR mentioned a lo here on the sub but no one talks about apps\\coins that are being developed on the network. With the attention HBAR is getting, it's a matter of time before money starts leaking into DEFI and memecoin frenzy on hedera starts due to fixed predicted fees\\no double spending\\timestamps. Imma share some projects that I'm keeping an eye on, most of these coins are not being exchanged on any CEX only on Saucerswap ($SAUCE pioneer dex on HEDERA) this one is currently available on BItget\\MEXC.

\-$HSUITE - 57M mcap - DeFI tool with an innovative tech called smart-nodes to build defi apps. (saucerswap competition) DYOR

\-$KARATE - 12.9M mcap - The first fan-governed stricking league in real world. Holders can vote on favorite fighters before each KC event using the Karate Combat app (i use it myself and the app its very clean) currently theres a thing called ""up only gaming"" where you dont lose your tokens even if you guess it wrong. DYOR

\-$DOVU - 8.4 mcap - It claims to be a tansparent supply of green credits (Tokenization and sale of ecological credits, targeting the global voluntary carbon market. DYOR

\-$BSL - 5.5 mcap - Utilizes DLT tech built on Hedera to provide banking services such credit unions, loans, fraud management. Some guy on the hedera sub claims to have his BSL wallet drained and this as been a topic of conversations on hedera sub. DYOR

\-$CLXY - 4.7M mcap - Calaxy is a decentralized social media platform, a merge between web2 social platforms into a web3 infrastructure. DYOR

\-$MINGO - 1.88M mcap - Web3 ecosystem with comprehensive digital services such wallet, gaming plantform, NFT marketplace, and NFT ticketing service that enhaces the utility and security of event tickets for organizations and attendees. DYOR

\-$DAVINCI - 1.7 mcap - Offers a suite of token management tools such locking tokens, vesting, burning, on-chain management and token logo handling. Has nfts with airdrop system. DYOR

\-MEMECOINS - the most popular coins on the network are $GRELF, $HBARbarian, $SPACEAPE and many new recently created but with a decent liquidity that can be a scam idk such $IVY, $DINO, $SMACKM, $HONK, $esco, $AZOR, $HOODIE, $2FingersInu...

Obviously do your own research this is NFA. In my opinion the was HEDERA is becoming so popular it's a matter of time before projects built on its network start to explode.

Please share and discuss more projects built on hedera that you think have potential."

Can Renewable Energy Tokenization Drive a More Sustainable Financial System?,sustainableFinance,1i775px,2025-01-22 04:11:31,4,0.7,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/sustainableFinance/comments/1i775px/can_renewable_energy_tokenization_drive_a_more/,Edmanetwork,,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been exploring ideas at the intersection of sustainability and finance, and I wanted to get your thoughts on a concept I’ve been thinking about.

We all know that renewable energy is crucial for reducing emissions and transitioning to a sustainable future. But one challenge is that individuals and small communities who invest in renewables, like solar panels or wind turbines, often have limited financial incentives beyond lower energy bills.

What if there were a way to monetize the energy produced? For instance, imagine a system where every 10 kWh of clean energy generated could be converted into a token. These tokens could be:

	•	Traded or sold on markets to generate income.

	•	Used as proof of contribution to sustainability (maybe even tied to carbon credit systems).

	•	Held as a new type of financial asset, like renewable-backed currency.

This could create new economic incentives for renewable energy adoption and help shift the financial system toward sustainability. But it’s not without challenges. For example:

	•	How would such a system be regulated?

	•	Could it exacerbate inequalities by favoring those with access to renewable infrastructure?

	•	What role would blockchain technology play, and how do we ensure its environmental footprint stays low?

I’d love to hear what this community thinks about the idea of energy tokenization. Could this model realistically drive change, or are there better mechanisms we should be focusing on to align finance with sustainability?

Looking forward to your insights!"

I need to know how I could have solved this. I racked my brain.... and now that it is over, I wonder what a wiser person would have done. I'll list the important parts... and things I did to solve. Please give me wisdom. 

Me:
I was low income. Door dash gig life. College educated though. Car paid for. Good credit. Decent health. 

Situation Pressure Begins:

8 months searching for apartment. 1 property manager approved me. Held the apartment for 1 month waiting for me. It was also in the same building as my other dream apartment, I regretted giving up years ago. HiGH Rent though. 

Childhood bestie dies within 24 hours. While sleeping.

DOOR dashing takes time and paid less than minimum. Can't quite pay rent yet.

Drunk driver totals my vehicle from behind. Drivable somewhat. EXHAUST funnels up through the trunk and seats now. CARBON MONOXIDE poison begins.

Behind on rent. Use credit cards. Can't pay the interest and fall behind. Bills higher.

My car is out of commission 2 months due to electronics. Get it on the road. Can't pass inspection and they take the plates. 

Decide to try to work locally. Realize that the country I am in hates Americans and can't keep a job. Go through 31 JOBS in 7 months. 

DRIVING the car has created permanent brain fog and lung burning. 

Dog develops a lump. It is cancer. Aggressively grows. Pressure. Solve or she dies. 

They charge off the credit cards. Credit ruined for now.

Get approved for a rent payment program. Landlord accepts payments, and refuses to verify his finances to the program. They demand money back from me. $10k.

Eviction begins. 


A friend give me a loan. I fix my car. Brain function much 9less from fumes. Still gone. 

I lose an important bodily function... hidden disease. 

I move to the states. Leaving things behind to get to good doctors. 

Eviction completes. Housing gone. In the states for months getting medical things completed. 

Tried to stay with family. The is a sexual piece from my parent towards me as well as some other things. Also a step parent who is not at all okay with me there. It's complicated. 


Now. Homeless in the states. Renting a car. Sleeping in it with a dog who has a tumor with a gallon of blood.

Her medical things and my emergencies drain any money I made. 

Didn't sleep through the night fo about 5 months. That car wake up/sleep. Then it's cold. Sneaking her in the car while I'm do on call shifts.



I did the things. Put my place on airbnb, did the gigs got the lower jobs, interviewed for the higher jobs, worked on my own business deals, asked for help, used a government program. 

Why is this what it is? I need to know...

Position Paper: Advocating For Inclusive Future-Focused E-Bike Regulations,ebikes,1i6zxdl,2025-01-21 21:00:56,0,0.5,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/ebikes/comments/1i6zxdl/position_paper_advocating_for_inclusive/,EBIKE-ULTRA,,"Position Paper: Advocating for Inclusive and Future-Focused E-Bike Regulations

E-bikes have become a transformative force in urban mobility, offering a cleaner, more efficient, and accessible mode of transportation for millions worldwide. As technology advances, the advent of high-performance e-bikes capable of speeds over 30 mph and up to 45 mph has opened new opportunities and challenges. These faster models expand the range of e-bike applications, including commuting, long-distance travel, and commercial use, but they also require thoughtful regulatory updates to ensure safety, accessibility, and innovation.

We propose a comprehensive framework for e-bike regulations that embraces the diversity of e-bikes while fostering a safer, more sustainable, and inclusive transportation system.

1. Adapting Regulations for High-Performance E-Bikes

The introduction of e-bikes capable of speeds between 30–45 mph represents a new category that bridges traditional bicycles and motorized vehicles. These models are ideal for long-distance commuters and businesses, offering a sustainable alternative to cars.
	•	Recommendation: Introduce a new classification for high-speed e-bikes:
	•	Class 4: High-performance e-bikes, capable of speeds up to 45 mph, requiring additional safety features such as turn signals, mirrors, and braking systems suited for higher speeds.
	•	Infrastructure Integration: Allow these e-bikes to use bike lanes only where lane design and width can accommodate higher speeds. In areas lacking proper infrastructure, designate specific roadways or lanes for these models.
	•	Rider Requirements: Establish minimum age limits (e.g., 18+) and require riders of Class 4 e-bikes to complete a safety course or obtain a basic license to ensure responsible use.

2. Sustainability and the Role of High-Speed E-Bikes

E-bikes, including high-performance models, are key to reducing carbon emissions, easing urban congestion, and decreasing reliance on fossil fuels. Faster e-bikes offer an attractive alternative to cars for suburban-to-urban commutes and commercial delivery services, significantly reducing the carbon footprint of daily transportation.
	•	Recommendation: Incentivize the adoption of high-speed e-bikes for businesses and individuals through tax credits, subsidies, and grants. Expand green mobility programs to include these models, especially for commercial applications like last-mile delivery.

3. Accessibility and Equity in E-Bike Use

While high-speed e-bikes cater to commuters and businesses, regulations must ensure that all e-bike types remain accessible to diverse demographics, including seniors, low-income individuals, and urban populations.
	•	Recommendation: Avoid overregulation of standard e-bikes while setting fair guidelines for high-speed models. Continue to support programs that subsidize standard e-bike purchases and promote shared e-bike fleets, ensuring equitable access to sustainable transportation.

4. Safety and Infrastructure Development

The integration of high-speed e-bikes into existing transportation systems requires significant investment in infrastructure and clear safety guidelines. Faster e-bikes present unique challenges, including increased collision risks and the need for specialized roadways.
	•	Recommendation:
	•	Expand and enhance bike lanes to accommodate both standard and high-speed e-bikes, with clear signage and speed segregation where appropriate.
	•	Mandate advanced safety features for Class 4 e-bikes, such as improved brakes, lights, turn signals, and audible alerts.
	•	Launch public education campaigns to promote safe riding practices and increase awareness of the differences between e-bike classes.

5. Simplifying E-Bike Classifications

The diversity of e-bikes now ranges from pedal-assist models to high-speed vehicles, creating confusion for riders and policymakers. Simplifying classifications will ensure consistent regulations across jurisdictions.
	•	Proposed Framework:
	•	Class 1: Pedal-assist, capped at 20 mph.
	•	Class 2: Throttle-only, capped at 20 mph.
	•	Class 3: Pedal-assist or throttle, capped at 28 mph.
	•	Class 4: High-speed e-bikes, capable of speeds up to 45 mph, with additional safety and licensing requirements.

This clear structure will help riders understand their responsibilities and ensure regulations are uniformly applied.

6. Encouraging Innovation and Commercial Applications

High-speed e-bikes open new avenues for innovation and commercial use, from long-distance commuting to delivery services. Overregulation could stifle growth in these areas, limiting the potential of e-bikes to revolutionize transportation.
	•	Recommendation:
	•	Streamline the certification process for high-performance models while maintaining safety standards.
	•	Encourage partnerships between governments and businesses to pilot high-speed e-bike fleets for logistics and delivery.
	•	Provide research grants for battery technology, safety systems, and modular designs tailored for high-speed e-bikes.

7. Economic and Employment Benefits

The e-bike industry, including the high-performance segment, generates jobs in manufacturing, retail, maintenance, and tourism. High-speed models also create opportunities for businesses to reduce costs and improve efficiency in logistics.
	•	Recommendation: Support small businesses adopting e-bikes for delivery and logistics through financial incentives and simplified regulatory processes. Promote workforce training programs focused on e-bike maintenance and repair, ensuring a skilled labor pool to support this growing industry.

Conclusion

E-bikes, from standard pedal-assist models to high-performance variants capable of speeds up to 45 mph, are transforming the way we move. As technology evolves, regulations must keep pace, fostering safety, accessibility, and innovation while maximizing the environmental and economic benefits of e-bikes.

We urge policymakers to adopt a forward-thinking regulatory framework that:
	•	Recognizes the potential of high-speed e-bikes.
	•	Balances safety with accessibility and innovation.
	•	Invests in infrastructure and education to support the growing diversity of e-bike users.

By embracing these principles, we can create a transportation ecosystem where e-bikes thrive as a cornerstone of sustainable, inclusive, and efficient mobility. Together, we can ensure that e-bikes, regardless of their speed, contribute to a cleaner, greener, and more connected future."
Mold in moss layer- do I need to start over?,terrariums,1i6zbut,2025-01-21 20:31:25,3,1.0,5,https://i.redd.it/ucuwfolr7gee1.jpeg,freebelugawhales,Pest Help/Question,"This is my first terrarium, it’s a 5 gallon tank with a lid and light. I used about a 1” layer of rocks on the bottom, then sprinkled activated carbon, then sheet moss and about 2” of soil. Recently I’ve noticed the moss getting moldy (sorry for the awful picture).

Do I need to throw out the moss and start over? Should I have washed it before use?

General moisture questions- Is my layer of rocks not deep enough? Should I be watering less (currently spraying it about once a week)? I planned to water it less, expecting moisture to stay in the tank, but the glass and soil have consistently looked dry."

I'm a 17E in currently in AIT, im fresh out of high school. I have airborne on contract. I was also offered to volunteer for RASP and go to regimen, but I don't know how that will work out career wise. Being in AIT, I'm not sure if this army shit is what I want to do with my life. I know from being around signal guys my whole life that regimen can fuck your career path in 25 series, is it the same with 17E? How it was described to me, it can boost it but that was also the Ranger Liason so there might be some bias. 

Looking for any input from people who have done this longer, not asking for 17E specificly or just Rangers. Just needs some advice before I make this career change.

Couple questions in regards to a reclass. Currently an 11B seeking to reclass to a 35N. Meet all qualification criteria, ASVAB etc. The career counselor that I’m working with has said that I have submitted all the necessary ppwk, and after HRC has received it I have been told that #1 the class date must be minimum 1 year out, and #2 there are no available class dates, and classes will only become available when enough people sign up for it. I am currently undergoing the security clearance process that’s required for the MOS with possibly another month or two before adjudication. This leaves me at a standstill, with time on my contract burning away and no news if I’ll even be able to make this work. I might possibly have to wait on promotion or training opportunities as a result, and don’t know if it’s worth it to wait. 
I’ve heard the National Guard offers full time positions under this MOS, and Im in contact with both a unit and recruiter who would be willing to work with me, however I understand the whole recruiting shtick and would like some third party information. My wife is really pushing for me to go NG I just want to hear both sides, and nobody I work with or associate with has any experience with 35N’s. I would appreciate it if someone were to shed a little light on the following questions. 

Question #1 Does anyone know how frequently the AIT classes for this MOS are scheduled, and if there’s anything on my part I can do to better secure a position when one becomes available?
Question #2 Is it worth it to hold out for an active duty class and job, or should I just ETS and go with the national guard? Maybe someone who has experience with one of the above can let me know how their experience was? 
Question #3 could I contact someone from the community I could ask further questions regarding the admin side of things? I understand this a nuanced situation and a lot of details that go unexplained on a post. 

Appreciate all the help, I’ll take a mango loco monster and two ranchero rollerbites.

Looking into the army. Got an undergraduate degree in Chinese Language and Literature (can read more than 2500 words and both traditional and simplified script). I work in data center deployment.               

Situation: Been looking online recently at cybersecurity jobs. Many require an active security clearance, some with polygraph and some without.                 

Goal: In addition to the certifications I hope to earn in the next few years (OCSP, Cisco CyberOps Professional Certification, CompTIA Linux+, and CASP+), I got a Network+ and Security+, and I'm studying for a CySA+ as we speak. I might even be tempted to get a master's degree in Cybersecurity later on.               

Before I get my hopes too high and pull the trigger on a four year contract, it would be a good idea to ask these questions:               
1. I need to know what kind of questions they will ask on the polygraph exam. As an example, I knew a guy who looked enough like his cousin that (before he was 21) he was able to borrow or steal his cousin's ID, get into a club, then got arrested for something and used his cousin's ID as the ID they documented him with at the precinct. This guy also told me he engaged in sexually deviant behavior in America (call girls). Got got a secret background (but not TS as far as I know) clearance.                
2. I spent a literal decade of my adult working life outside of America. I need to get caught up on my taxes. I made a considerable amount in capital gains. Is this going to be an issue anywhere along the way with my prospective career path?                 
3. My wife is not American. We applied for her green card. Is this going to be an issue with an active secret / top secret background clearance?              
4. What MOS would you guys recommend? I did look in to 17C, but I am doubtful that I would get into that MOS as it requires a TSI with a polygraph.                 
5. With the certifications that I listed above, would it be a good idea to earn some of these before I enter the army? I have a few months of free time on my hands and I study hard.               
6. Would you guys recommend the reserves or active duty?              
7. Is there anything else I need to know?

So I just found out I’m pregnant and I’m just waiting for my waivers to get approved! Long story short, MEPS told me I could only enlist 6 months after a miscarriage, which was on the 1st of January, I had a few miscarriages last year so I’m not super confident with this one and we weren’t even trying since I always wanted to enlist and was focused on that. What do I do if everything gets approved, can I postpone my shipping date without telling them what going on, or tell them l’m sick or something? I wanna wait my pregnancy hit the 3 month mark to be sure nothing will happen and then tell them I’m pregnant. But I don’t wanna tell them I’m pregnant and have another miscarriage and wait for another 6 months. What do I do?

More questions regarding reserve benefits:                 
1. I have a somewhat lengthy list of certifications I would like to earn. Some are from CompTIA. Others are not. Are these all covered?               
2. Will the army cover earning a master's degree? If so, what is the process? Is it reimbursement, or do they pay directly?             
3. Medical Insurance. How does that work out? I got bluecross blueshield and I'm experiencing a bit of ""culture shock"" since I spent most of my adult working life in Asia and had 100% free medical care while I was there. Broke my ankle a few months ago (literal fracture, my job in America requires heavy lifting) and couldn't work for a few months. Is it better? worse? Just like civilian life?               
4. Do people in the reserve still get bonuses?

I'm trying to decide whether to go infantry in the guard or Civil affairs/psyop in the reserves. I like the physicality and ""army stuff"" that the infantry does, but I'm also interested in the cultural and interpersonal piece of CA/PO. Also would like to deploy. Looking at the guard/reserves since I have a decent career and wish to stay near family outside of training/deployments

Screenwriter Looking for Help with a Script about the Ranger Indoctrination Program in 1988

Hi, all! I am planning a screenplay whose sole premise is to follow a 21-year-old as he goes through RIP in 1988 from start to finish (spoiler alert: he becomes a Ranger). I feel this premise, with this particular character, could make a helluva screenplay and, if produced, a helluva movie folks would want to watch. I'm thinking, the film ""Tigerland"" meets the documentary ""Hell and Back: Special Ops Ranger"". I'm intrigued by a story where we watch a young person pushed to his absolute limit -- then, pushed even further, to find depths within himself he had no idea were there and of which he was capable.

I would love to hear from you guys who went through RIP: anyone who went through RIP, whether you became a Ranger or not and whether it was 1988 or not. If you would like to type your replies here, in which you discuss and describe your experiences, that would be great. If you would like to join me on a Zoom, either individually or collectively, that would be even more terrific -- a video diary of sorts. 

I truly look forward to your replies to the above. I have a feeling this is the start of a fascinating journey. My warm-felt thanks in advance.

Cheers, Will

Can anyone please verify the following?

My understanding is (and I do beg your indulgence and patience, as I am a civilian, and I can and probably so easily do have all this wrong) that a Soldier could find himself going through RASP twice, according to the following: BCT/AIT/Airborne School (voluntary)/RASP 1/Ranger School (voluntary)/OCS/RASP 2 (I suspect I have grossly simplified that progression). Yes? No?

How about, though, 1988, when of course RASP was the Ranger Indoctrination Program? Would that progression look something like the following: BCT/AIT/Airborne School (voluntary)/RIP/Ranger School (voluntary)/OCS - commission as 2LT and start of one's career as an officer? Yes? No?

As an ancillary question: Is it a case that all Rangers in the 75th Ranger Regiment must have passed RASP 1 or they are not a Ranger but they might have also passed RASP 2 or is it a case that ALL Rangers have passed RASP 1 \*and\* RASP 2?

Thanks in advance to your replies to all the above.

Cheers, Will

Thinking of enlisting and am just trying to know what to expect. It’s not a matter of choice, (meaning: I’m not going to join if so and so) just want to see what to expect. 
Are the latrines like stalls? Do the stalls have doors on them? Obviously is a shock if the stalls don’t have doors on them as we are used to being in private when pooping but I would understand as we are in this together and are all equals. Just crossed my mind and thought I ask, appreciate any replies.

Does the following sound in the least bit plausible?

I have the following scenario in one of my screenplays: in June, 2006, in Western Iraq Al-Qaeda jihadists capture an American USACOE CPT and drag him across the desert to their cave hideout. 

My best friend is 75th Ranger Regiment (ret.), and he tells me that all Ranger assets in the area will immediately deploy to rescue this officer, bringing their might down upon these sorry bastards.

Here's my question to you all: This captain has an older brother who is a MJR in the Rangers and who is in Iraq at the time of this incident. Would the MJR be allowed to participate in his brother's recovery or would he be told to sit this one out and allow other Rangers to handle it?

Thanks! I look forward to your responses.

Before I make a new post I figured I should ask here. I didn't see anything like this asked in the previous posts so here goes:

I recently graduated from college with a chemistry degree and a 3.64. For just over 2 years I was taking Welbutrin, which was a medication for helping with my smoking cession and the anxiety that came with it. I took it for so long because after it was initially prescribed I moved states and just saw telehealth doctors for refills. I went to the recruiter when I was still a junior and found out that after taking it for over a year it disqualified me for 3 years before commissioning. Since March 2024, I quit cold turkey and still finished my spring summer and fall semesters with mostly A's, supported my cost of living with a part time job and graduated without any medical or psychological intervention. After meeting with the recruiter again today, they said to wait until March to send off my MEPS application with a waiver from an MD stating that I am fit for duty. My questions are:

1. Would a generic MD be better than a psychologist or psychiatrist? My recruiter said that those doctors would draw red flags at MEPS

2. Is there anything I can do besides the waiver or waiting another 2 years?

Can I bring a little (around 4"" x 6"") journal with some inspirational photos with quotes I like taped inside to basic training? It has a lock on it.

I just thought it'd be nice to take a minute or two sometimes to look at the quotes to inspire myself since I'm sure my life is gonna be very tough for a few months, and to have the journal to write if I have the time.

I also have a bunch of addresses and phone numbers written down in case I need them.

I’m freshly 18 and have interest in becoming an Animal Care Specialist for the army. 

However, I don’t know know if it’s possible for me. 

My goal is to become a Veterinarian assistant but I’m not sure that would even lead to me to eligible to be an animal care specialist. 

I don’t have much support on the idea either, and can’t get unbiased advice. 

I don’t believe I could score high enough on the ASVAB let alone get a good score on it. 

If you have this specific job, any thoughts, advice, or personal experience you can share with me?

Hey guys,

26 years old, just finished my BSN in Nursing.

Years ago fresh out of high school I originally went to college for business (MIS). I wanted to be an Army Signal Officer at the time (did the first two years of Army ROTC but unfortunately things didn't work out. Didn't have the best experience with my program bundled with an unexpected hernia that hit me at the time.) Ended up graduating with that degree and got a job in Healthcare IT.

The job was okay but ultimately I wanted something else (had me traveling to a different state on a weekly basis, felt there wasn't much opportunity to advance, and ultimately just had no interest in this line of work.) Went back to school for my ADN, got a job as a psych nurse for a year and finished my BSN which is where I'm at right now.

Now that I have the opportunity I've been thinking about it again, open to AirForce as well this time. I want to experience something different and the GI Bill could be used for my NP school. I have off on Friday and plan on going to the different AMEDD Recruiter offices.

TL;DR - Did any of you guys join as Officers in your mid to late 20s? Any regrets? Did you feel old and or behind your peers?

Hi there. I wanted to ask if it is possible to sign a 3 year contract as a 68W. I know 4 years tends to be the norm, but unfortunately I cannot allow to do 4 years for personal reasons. I would love to do AD for a 3 year contract, but if I can't, I probably will do reserves. 

Has anyone heard of a 3 year contract for 68W? If so, how rare is it to get it?

Tech school credits for auto-promoting?

I’m scheduling MEPS for next week and I’m doing fingerprints this afternoon. 

When I first sat down with the recruiter, he told me that my 26 college credits from vocational training and a ‘future soldier program’ that I have yet to learn about can get me into BCT as an E-3. I haven’t graduated the tech school program yet, I’m about a month away from it.

I’ve also been told to make sure all promises are in writing in my contract. He and his 1SG have told me that they can add the automatic promotion after signing but before my ship date, but I’m wondering if I should just postpone signing until I have the certificate and can get it in writing?

It’s all a very confusing process (by design..?) and I’d like some advice from someone not incentivized to get me in.

Howdy folks, Air Force nerd here trying to make sense of Army shenanigans for a friend.

Buddy is trying to go on Terminal Leave, but the date he is supposed to start conflicts with the back side of a period of ""going to the field"". He seems to believe his command won't let him leave ""the field"" early, and won't be able to start Terminal Leave until after he gets back. This seems asinine to my Air Force smoothbrain, but I also know the Army is known for its shenanigans. Additionally, I don't always get the unvarnished truth from this guy, so I don't know the situation he has described to me is what's actually happening. Can someone point me to an Army reg that definitively says whether or not he is going to be able to do his final out and leave at the date he originally intended?

Hey all,

Wanna ask this question on here so I can be an anonymous dumbass, not a dumbass to my recruiter. 

I have gone to MEPS already and sworn in with the MOS 68W, something I’m passionate about due to my love of EMS and already having my national EMT cert. I don’t leave until 3/31 due to delayed enlistment (I went to MEPS early November) because I was finishing my bachelors degree. Everyone I’ve talked to as called me a dumbass (I’m aware lol, I thought/think my passion for my MOS outweighs me wanting to commission. Ontop of wanting to be led before becoming a leader for personal moral reasons).  Im thinking more about it and want to know if it is too late to talk to my recruiter about wanting to commission as an officer instead?

Hello all. I have a number of waivers and a specific time maximum to join up. Here they are:

1. Juvenile record from 2019 which I’m getting expunged.
2. Tattoos which I’m getting removed.
3. Mental Health consultation which I was discharged from recently, and medication (Lexapro) which I’ll soon run out of.

I tried to join in 2020 and couldn’t get a waiver due to my record; yet I did well on my asvab - 90th percentile.

I just talked to a recruiter and they said to wait until 2027 as that’ll be 2 years since I’ve taken medication. When that time comes, could I actually get in?

Trying to go 19K through 19U

Recently found out about the brilliant decision to join these MOSs. Is there any way that I can increase my chances or guarantee a spot as a 19K through any means? Is there any duty station that happens to only have abrams and not bradleys or cav scouts? Would doing well in OSUT make it more likely to get picked for 19K as opposed to 19C or D? Also, a advisor ""informed"" me that airborne 19U is an impossibility and the m10 booker was tested by infantry not 19K if any of you could offer further insight on that ""information"".

Re code 3

Good day all. I was in the army in ‘09 I did 9 months and got discharged for patterns of misconduct. (Uniformity errors such as late to formation, not shaving; an article 15 for an empty bottle of alcohol in my wall locker and another for having someone else’s belonging in my wall locker) they summed all of this up into 3 article 15s and recommended me for discharge with RE Code 3: pattern of misconduct separation code jka. I was 19 at the time and now I’m 35. I have been periodically trying to re enlist. Even in reserve but I have been disapproved. It’s important to note that in 2016 I had a dwai. No misdemeanor or felony. Just a violation and had to pay court fines. According to my last attempt last year the recruiter told me that this is why the army will not accept me back. I’m willing to travel to any recruiting station to finally be able to clean my name and re enlist again even if it’s reserve. Please if anyone can help that will be great.

Does the MOS 35P require a recruit to take the DLAB **if they already claim proficiency in another language?**  
Another way to phrase this question: Can I enlist, and then do some combination of taking the DLPT or the DLAB?

Context: I live in the middle of nowhere and most of the recruits are high schoolers trying to escape the place I'm in. I think my recruiter hasn't encountered someone who is bilingual in a critical language where I live. On paper, 15 years ago I took a test that says I can read 1200 words in Chinese, but now it's more like 2500-3000.

This is more of a veterans education bennies question. 

Does anyone have experience with the VA Work Study program? This is a link to the form, the second page talks about the kind of work one can do. [https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-22-8691-are.pdf](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-22-8691-are.pdf)

I'm wondering what the process for this is like, if this is something that needs to be filled out a certain way with specific language to not get denied?

I’m joining the army and leaving in May, and trying to pre plan what I want to pack and stuff to see if there’s anything I need I haven’t thought of etc.  I have a backpack that I love and it’s not too big and is a good sturdy backpack, however it’s light pink. Will this get me roasted when I get to basic training since it isn’t a neutral color? Should I see if I can find an inexpensive black backpack or will it be okay that it’s pink?

Hi all,  
I’m looking into the Army and I’m trying to figure out which job would best align with my career goals. I am 3 classes away from Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at WGU, and would like to do coding work while serving. Ultimately, after I leave the military, I want to pursue a career as a Software Engineer, DevOps Engineer, or Cloud Engineer.

So far, I’ve found 17D (Cyber Operations Specialist) and 170D (Cyber Network Defender) as potential options. What’s the difference between these two? And are there other jobs in the Army that would give me relevant coding and technical experience for my future career?

I'm specifically looking into the Army because I've been told that my MOS is guaranteed, whereas in other branches it's not so.

Thanks in advance!

# Felony Waiver, who knows about it?

12 months ago I got arrested for attempting to elude a police officer, a felony, literally 3 weeks before I was supposed to ship to Basic training... I did a first offender program, which consisted in fines, community service, driving course, and now followed by 12 months of probation. I will be done with probation in a few months, and then I will have my record expunged.

My question is, does anyone have experience with DPMP Moral Conduct Waivers for felonies? What are the chances of it going through for something like this?

I believe that it being expunged from my record doesn't even matter for recruiting purposes right?

By the time I would be able to sign a new contract, it would be about 2 years after the offense.

Summary For: Weekly Question Thread (01/06/2025 to 01/12/2025),ArmyWQT,1i6ts2z,2025-01-21 16:25:20,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArmyWQT/comments/1i6ts2z/summary_for_weekly_question_thread_01062025_to/,Army_Bot,,"Hey, I downloaded reddit and made an account just to ask this question.

I'm a 17E in currently in AIT, im fresh out of high school. I have airborne on contract. I was also offered to volunteer for RASP and go to regimen, but I don't know how that will work out career wise. Being in AIT, I'm not sure if this army shit is what I want to do with my life. I know from being around signal guys my whole life that regimen can fuck your career path in 25 series, is it the same with 17E? How it was described to me, it can boost it but that was also the Ranger Liason so there might be some bias. 

Looking for any input from people who have done this longer, not asking for 17E specificly or just Rangers. Just needs some advice before I make this career change.

Couple questions in regards to a reclass. Currently an 11B seeking to reclass to a 35N. Meet all qualification criteria, ASVAB etc. The career counselor that I’m working with has said that I have submitted all the necessary ppwk, and after HRC has received it I have been told that #1 the class date must be minimum 1 year out, and #2 there are no available class dates, and classes will only become available when enough people sign up for it. I am currently undergoing the security clearance process that’s required for the MOS with possibly another month or two before adjudication. This leaves me at a standstill, with time on my contract burning away and no news if I’ll even be able to make this work. I might possibly have to wait on promotion or training opportunities as a result, and don’t know if it’s worth it to wait. 
I’ve heard the National Guard offers full time positions under this MOS, and Im in contact with both a unit and recruiter who would be willing to work with me, however I understand the whole recruiting shtick and would like some third party information. My wife is really pushing for me to go NG I just want to hear both sides, and nobody I work with or associate with has any experience with 35N’s. I would appreciate it if someone were to shed a little light on the following questions. 

Question #1 Does anyone know how frequently the AIT classes for this MOS are scheduled, and if there’s anything on my part I can do to better secure a position when one becomes available?
Question #2 Is it worth it to hold out for an active duty class and job, or should I just ETS and go with the national guard? Maybe someone who has experience with one of the above can let me know how their experience was? 
Question #3 could I contact someone from the community I could ask further questions regarding the admin side of things? I understand this a nuanced situation and a lot of details that go unexplained on a post. 

Appreciate all the help, I’ll take a mango loco monster and two ranchero rollerbites.

Looking into the army. Got an undergraduate degree in Chinese Language and Literature (can read more than 2500 words and both traditional and simplified script). I work in data center deployment.               

Situation: Been looking online recently at cybersecurity jobs. Many require an active security clearance, some with polygraph and some without.                 

Goal: In addition to the certifications I hope to earn in the next few years (OCSP, Cisco CyberOps Professional Certification, CompTIA Linux+, and CASP+), I got a Network+ and Security+, and I'm studying for a CySA+ as we speak. I might even be tempted to get a master's degree in Cybersecurity later on.               

Before I get my hopes too high and pull the trigger on a four year contract, it would be a good idea to ask these questions:               
1. I need to know what kind of questions they will ask on the polygraph exam. As an example, I knew a guy who looked enough like his cousin that (before he was 21) he was able to borrow or steal his cousin's ID, get into a club, then got arrested for something and used his cousin's ID as the ID they documented him with at the precinct. This guy also told me he engaged in sexually deviant behavior in America (call girls). Got got a secret background (but not TS as far as I know) clearance.                
2. I spent a literal decade of my adult working life outside of America. I need to get caught up on my taxes. I made a considerable amount in capital gains. Is this going to be an issue anywhere along the way with my prospective career path?                 
3. My wife is not American. We applied for her green card. Is this going to be an issue with an active secret / top secret background clearance?              
4. What MOS would you guys recommend? I did look in to 17C, but I am doubtful that I would get into that MOS as it requires a TSI with a polygraph.                 
5. With the certifications that I listed above, would it be a good idea to earn some of these before I enter the army? I have a few months of free time on my hands and I study hard.               
6. Would you guys recommend the reserves or active duty?              
7. Is there anything else I need to know?

So I just found out I’m pregnant and I’m just waiting for my waivers to get approved! Long story short, MEPS told me I could only enlist 6 months after a miscarriage, which was on the 1st of January, I had a few miscarriages last year so I’m not super confident with this one and we weren’t even trying since I always wanted to enlist and was focused on that. What do I do if everything gets approved, can I postpone my shipping date without telling them what going on, or tell them l’m sick or something? I wanna wait my pregnancy hit the 3 month mark to be sure nothing will happen and then tell them I’m pregnant. But I don’t wanna tell them I’m pregnant and have another miscarriage and wait for another 6 months. What do I do?

More questions regarding reserve benefits:                 
1. I have a somewhat lengthy list of certifications I would like to earn. Some are from CompTIA. Others are not. Are these all covered?               
2. Will the army cover earning a master's degree? If so, what is the process? Is it reimbursement, or do they pay directly?             
3. Medical Insurance. How does that work out? I got bluecross blueshield and I'm experiencing a bit of ""culture shock"" since I spent most of my adult working life in Asia and had 100% free medical care while I was there. Broke my ankle a few months ago (literal fracture, my job in America requires heavy lifting) and couldn't work for a few months. Is it better? worse? Just like civilian life?               
4. Do people in the reserve still get bonuses?

I'm trying to decide whether to go infantry in the guard or Civil affairs/psyop in the reserves.

Looking at the guard/reserves since I have a decent career and wish to stay near family outside of training/deployments

Screenwriter Looking for Help with a Script about the Ranger Indoctrination Program in 1988

Hi, all! I am planning a screenplay whose sole premise is to follow a 21-year-old as he goes through RIP in 1988 from start to finish (spoiler alert: he becomes a Ranger). I feel this premise, with this particular character, could make a helluva screenplay and, if produced, a helluva movie folks would want to watch. I'm thinking, the film ""Tigerland"" meets the documentary ""Hell and Back: Special Ops Ranger"". I'm intrigued by a story where we watch a young person pushed to his absolute limit -- then, pushed even further, to find depths within himself he had no idea were there and of which he was capable.

I would love to hear from you guys who went through RIP: anyone who went through RIP, whether you became a Ranger or not and whether it was 1988 or not. If you would like to type your replies here, in which you discuss and describe your experiences, that would be great. If you would like to join me on a Zoom, either individually or collectively, that would be even more terrific -- a video diary of sorts. 

I truly look forward to your replies to the above. I have a feeling this is the start of a fascinating journey. My warm-felt thanks in advance.

Cheers, Will

Can anyone please verify the following?

My understanding is (and I do beg your indulgence and patience, as I am a civilian, and I can and probably so easily do have all this wrong) that a Soldier could find himself going through RASP twice, according to the following: BCT/AIT/Airborne School (voluntary)/RASP 1/Ranger School (voluntary)/OCS/RASP 2 (I suspect I have grossly simplified that progression). Yes? No?

How about, though, 1988, when of course RASP was the Ranger Indoctrination Program? Would that progression look something like the following: BCT/AIT/Airborne School (voluntary)/RIP/Ranger School (voluntary)/OCS - commission as 2LT and start of one's career as an officer? Yes? No?

As an ancillary question: Is it a case that all Rangers in the 75th Ranger Regiment must have passed RASP 1 or they are not a Ranger but they might have also passed RASP 2 or is it a case that ALL Rangers have passed RASP 1 \*and\* RASP 2?

Thanks in advance to your replies to all the above.

Cheers, Will

Thinking of enlisting and am just trying to know what to expect. It’s not a matter of choice, (meaning: I’m not going to join if so and so) just want to see what to expect. 
Are the latrines like stalls? Do the stalls have doors on them? Obviously is a shock if the stalls don’t have doors on them as we are used to being in private when pooping but I would understand as we are in this together and are all equals. Just crossed my mind and thought I ask, appreciate any replies.

Does the following sound in the least bit plausible?

I have the following scenario in one of my screenplays: in June, 2006, in Western Iraq Al-Qaeda jihadists capture an American USACOE CPT and drag him across the desert to their cave hideout. 

My best friend is 75th Ranger Regiment (ret.), and he tells me that all Ranger assets in the area will immediately deploy to rescue this officer, bringing their might down upon these sorry bastards.

Here's my question to you all: This captain has an older brother who is a MJR in the Rangers and who is in Iraq at the time of this incident. Would the MJR be allowed to participate in his brother's recovery or would he be told to sit this one out and allow other Rangers to handle it?

Thanks! I look forward to your responses.

Before I make a new post I figured I should ask here. I didn't see anything like this asked in the previous posts so here goes:

I recently graduated from college with a chemistry degree and a 3.64. For just over 2 years I was taking Welbutrin, which was a medication for helping with my smoking cession and the anxiety that came with it. I took it for so long because after it was initially prescribed I moved states and just saw telehealth doctors for refills. I went to the recruiter when I was still a junior and found out that after taking it for over a year it disqualified me for 3 years before commissioning. Since March 2024, I quit cold turkey and still finished my spring summer and fall semesters with mostly A's, supported my cost of living with a part time job and graduated without any medical or psychological intervention. After meeting with the recruiter again today, they said to wait until March to send off my MEPS application with a waiver from an MD stating that I am fit for duty. My questions are:

1. Would a generic MD be better than a psychologist or psychiatrist? My recruiter said that those doctors would draw red flags at MEPS

2. Is there anything I can do besides the waiver or waiting another 2 years?

I just thought it'd be nice to take a minute or two sometimes to look at the quotes to inspire myself since I'm sure my life is gonna be very tough for a few months, and to have the journal to write if I have the time.

I’m freshly 18 and have interest in becoming an Animal Care Specialist for the army. 

However, I don’t know know if it’s possible for me. 

My goal is to become a Veterinarian assistant but I’m not sure that would even lead to me to eligible to be an animal care specialist. 

I don’t have much support on the idea either, and can’t get unbiased advice. 

I don’t believe I could score high enough on the ASVAB let alone get a good score on it. 

If you have this specific job, any thoughts, advice, or personal experience you can share with me?

Hey guys,

26 years old, just finished my BSN in Nursing.

Years ago fresh out of high school I originally went to college for business (MIS). I wanted to be an Army Signal Officer at the time (did the first two years of Army ROTC but unfortunately things didn't work out. Didn't have the best experience with my program bundled with an unexpected hernia that hit me at the time.) Ended up graduating with that degree and got a job in Healthcare IT.

The job was okay but ultimately I wanted something else (had me traveling to a different state on a weekly basis, felt there wasn't much opportunity to advance, and ultimately just had no interest in this line of work.) Went back to school for my ADN, got a job as a psych nurse for a year and finished my BSN which is where I'm at right now.

Now that I have the opportunity I've been thinking about it again, open to AirForce as well this time. I want to experience something different and the GI Bill could be used for my NP school. I have off on Friday and plan on going to the different AMEDD Recruiter offices.

TL;DR - Did any of you guys join as Officers in your mid to late 20s? Any regrets? Did you feel old and or behind your peers?

Hi there. I wanted to ask if it is possible to sign a 3 year contract as a 68W. I know 4 years tends to be the norm, but unfortunately I cannot allow to do 4 years for personal reasons. I would love to do AD for a 3 year contract, but if I can't, I probably will do reserves. 

Has anyone heard of a 3 year contract for 68W? If so, how rare is it to get it?

Tech school credits for auto-promoting?

I’m scheduling MEPS for next week and I’m doing fingerprints this afternoon. 

When I first sat down with the recruiter, he told me that my 26 college credits from vocational training and a ‘future soldier program’ that I have yet to learn about can get me into BCT as an E-3. I haven’t graduated the tech school program yet, I’m about a month away from it.

I’ve also been told to make sure all promises are in writing in my contract. He and his 1SG have told me that they can add the automatic promotion after signing but before my ship date, but I’m wondering if I should just postpone signing until I have the certificate and can get it in writing?

It’s all a very confusing process (by design..?) and I’d like some advice from someone not incentivized to get me in.

I was previously enlisted in the army for 68C (LPN). I passed all the courses and passed the final for PHASE 1 and I have the credits for it in my JST. But unfortunately I got discharged due to misconduct. But recently i re-enlisted and was able to get the 68C (LPN) job again. Do I have to do phase 1 all over again?

Howdy folks, Air Force nerd here trying to make sense of Army shenanigans for a friend.

Buddy is trying to go on Terminal Leave, but the date he is supposed to start conflicts with the back side of a period of ""going to the field"". He seems to believe his command won't let him leave ""the field"" early, and won't be able to start Terminal Leave until after he gets back. This seems asinine to my Air Force smoothbrain, but I also know the Army is known for its shenanigans. Additionally, I don't always get the unvarnished truth from this guy, so I don't know the situation he has described to me is what's actually happening. Can someone point me to an Army reg that definitively says whether or not he is going to be able to do his final out and leave at the date he originally intended?

Hey all,

Wanna ask this question on here so I can be an anonymous dumbass, not a dumbass to my recruiter. 

I have gone to MEPS already and sworn in with the MOS 68W, something I’m passionate about due to my love of EMS and already having my national EMT cert. I don’t leave until 3/31 due to delayed enlistment (I went to MEPS early November) because I was finishing my bachelors degree. Everyone I’ve talked to as called me a dumbass (I’m aware lol, I thought/think my passion for my MOS outweighs me wanting to commission. Ontop of wanting to be led before becoming a leader for personal moral reasons).  Im thinking more about it and want to know if it is too late to talk to my recruiter about wanting to commission as an officer instead?

Hello guys. Back in 2014 I attended “IBC” I was there for 1.5 years. During that time I got my GED while studying business management. The school was closed in 2021 for “fraud”. So I’m on recruitment process and as you know army recruiter has all my documents. What has me in easy is my GED, due to the fraudulent college. Any suggestions? I just recently found out about it.

Hello all. I have a number of waivers and a specific time maximum to join up. Here they are:

1. Juvenile record from 2019 which I’m getting expunged.
2. Tattoos which I’m getting removed.
3. Mental Health consultation which I was discharged from recently, and medication (Lexapro) which I’ll soon run out of.

I tried to join in 2020 and couldn’t get a waiver due to my record; yet I did well on my asvab - 90th percentile.

I just talked to a recruiter and they said to wait until 2027 as that’ll be 2 years since I’ve taken medication. When that time comes, could I actually get in?

Okay so I have Hotel 8 school after 91B AIT but I’m supposed to graduate the 25th of March and I’m supposed to report to Hotel 8 school the 17th of March. I’m reserves and I got all my orders from Meps when I joined and were also supposed to be done with classes two weeks before we graduate and we aren’t supposed to have a graduation ceremony I guess. So will they let me go to H8 school on the 17th or will I have to be a hold over until the next school starts which I dreading?

10th Mountain or 82nd Airborne for Rangers?

TLDR: Which is best to prepare for RASP? 10th Mountain or 82nd Airborne?

By April (when my 1st year of college ends) I will not be ready for RASP which is why I chose to enlist into a conventional unit before attempting RASP. I’m simply wondering which of these units will provide the most benefit for an 11B to later tryout for RASP?

c. Disciplinary measures are tailored to specific offenses and individual offenders. Commanders will neither direct 
subordinates to take particular disciplinary actions, nor unnecessarily restrict the disciplinary authority of subordinates

When you get your boots sized in reception, should I give my actual shoe size or give slightly higher or lower?

May sound like a dumb question, but I only ask this bc there have been instances where I use shoes/boots (e.g. bowling) and the shoes feel too floppy. I wear a size 12 but bowl with a size 11.5.

I wanna make sure my feet dont get fucked up.

Anyone can say for me if their boot size matched their civilian shoe size?

Trying to go 19K through 19U

Recently found out about the brilliant decision to join these MOSs. Is there any way that I can increase my chances or guarantee a spot as a 19K through any means? Is there any duty station that happens to only have abrams and not bradleys or cav scouts? Would doing well in OSUT make it more likely to get picked for 19K as opposed to 19C or D? Also, a advisor ""informed"" me that airborne 19U is an impossibility and the m10 booker was tested by infantry not 19K if any of you could offer further insight on that ""information"".

Re code 3

Good day all. I was in the army in ‘09 I did 9 months and got discharged for patterns of misconduct. (Uniformity errors such as late to formation, not shaving; an article 15 for an empty bottle of alcohol in my wall locker and another for having someone else’s belonging in my wall locker) they summed all of this up into 3 article 15s and recommended me for discharge with RE Code 3: pattern of misconduct separation code jka. I was 19 at the time and now I’m 35. I have been periodically trying to re enlist. Even in reserve but I have been disapproved. It’s important to note that in 2016 I had a dwai. No misdemeanor or felony. Just a violation and had to pay court fines. According to my last attempt last year the recruiter told me that this is why the army will not accept me back. I’m willing to travel to any recruiting station to finally be able to clean my name and re enlist again even if it’s reserve. Please if anyone can help that will be great.

Does the MOS 35P require a recruit to take the DLAB **if they already claim proficiency in another language?**  
Another way to phrase this question: Can I enlist, and then do some combination of taking the DLPT or the DLAB?

Context: I live in the middle of nowhere and most of the recruits are high schoolers trying to escape the place I'm in. I think my recruiter hasn't encountered someone who is bilingual in a critical language where I live. On paper, 15 years ago I took a test that says I can read 1200 words in Chinese, but now it's more like 2500-3000.

Hi all,  
I’m looking into the Army and I’m trying to figure out which job would best align with my career goals. I am 3 classes away from Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at WGU, and would like to do coding work while serving. Ultimately, after I leave the military, I want to pursue a career as a Software Engineer, DevOps Engineer, or Cloud Engineer.

So far, I’ve found 17D (Cyber Operations Specialist) and 170D (Cyber Network Defender) as potential options. What’s the difference between these two? And are there other jobs in the Army that would give me relevant coding and technical experience for my future career?

I'm specifically looking into the Army because I've been told that my MOS is guaranteed, whereas in other branches it's not so.

Thanks in advance!

# Felony Waiver, who knows about it?

12 months ago I got arrested for attempting to elude a police officer, a felony, literally 3 weeks before I was supposed to ship to Basic training... I did a first offender program, which consisted in fines, community service, driving course, and now followed by 12 months of probation. I will be done with probation in a few months, and then I will have my record expunged.

My question is, does anyone have experience with DPMP Moral Conduct Waivers for felonies? What are the chances of it going through for something like this?

I believe that it being expunged from my record doesn't even matter for recruiting purposes right?

By the time I would be able to sign a new contract, it would be about 2 years after the offense.

I Downloaded a Sketchy Game... Now the Main Character Is Talking to Me (Part 1),HFY,1i6rt27,2025-01-21 15:04:03,35,0.9,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i6rt27/i_downloaded_a_sketchy_game_now_the_main/,Kanilan_,OC,"NEXT CHAPTER: https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i6rw46/i_downloaded_a_sketchy_game_now_the_main/

**Chapter 1: Discovery**

After a tough break-up, Jed was desperate for some escapism. Friends were unavailable, the games in his library had grown stale, and new releases were failing to capture his attention. He decided to visit his favorite website of questionable legality. He was desperate for a distraction, but did not want to waste his money on a disappointing product, and there was always his favorite excuse, ""It's not piracy if I buy it later"", to support this habit.

 

""I just need something to take my mind off things,"" he thought, the sting of loneliness pressing down on him.

 

After browsing for a while, he found a game called Kosma, which featured an eye-catching 3D rendering of an anthropomorphic blue creature. With large pointed ears, cartoonishly large sapphire eyes, streaks of blue hair that ended before her shoulders, with a few unkempt spikes on the left side of her face. A thin coat of white and arctic blue fur covered her face and probably the rest of her body, obscured by smooth white armor with bright orange accents, of which he could only see part of the breastplate and shoulders.

The text on the page was a jumble of illegible, damaged text and a surprisingly working download link. Jed was bored enough to download it, despite the obvious virus dangers and the lack of results when searching for the title on other websites. The huge file size of 120GB took him by surprise.

He took the precaution of downloading it into a virtual machine with no internet access, just in case someone had stuffed a virus among useless heavy files to make it pass for a full game, which would not be the first time he had come across it. The heavy download would take a while, and as much as the intrigue bit at him, it would have to wait until tomorrow.

Kosma occupied his every thought during the work shift. Although the chances of it being a real game were slim, the design of the character on the cover appealed to him. It reminded him of those old mascot platformers from the PS2 era that he was too young to experience. But it couldn't possibly be an old game by some obscure developer from that era, as the character's rendering didn't look nearly as blocky or simplistic as something from the early 2000s, and there was no way a game that weighed in at over 100 GB could be anything but modern... or as it was most likely a piece of malware and filler files with a weird piece of art to entice people to download it.

Finally at home, Jed booted up his virtual machine and began decompressing the huge file. He kept hovering over the progress bar to make sure it was actually moving. After what seemed like an eternity, it was finally decompressed. What he found was an executable file containing a smaller version of the game's cover art, called ""kosma.exe"", along with an assortment of unrecognizable files with bizarre arrangements of characters for names. The malware theory was looking more plausible by the minute. Still, he'd gone to all this trouble, so he might as well give it a try, just to see how quickly the malware would wreck the simulated computer.

Clicking on the icon triggered the antivirus software as expected. ""There you go,"" Jed sighed and deactivated it. To his surprise, a new tab opened at the bottom of the screen. After a few seconds of blackness, the creature from the cover appeared. ""Kosma, I presume,"" Jed mused, intrigued.

 

The game had the style of those old mascot platformers, but with an incredible level of detail. He felt extremely lucky, as it looked like he had stumbled upon a leaked, unreleased triple AAA game... A game he knew nothing about, as it had no credits or developer logos. Just Kosma sitting in the cockpit of a spaceship.





 Resting on the pilot's chair, she fiddled with a lever on the side until it suddenly reclined the seat, causing her to jump in surprise, her eyes wide open as her ears pricked up. As if to distract herself from the embarrassment, she began to check the array of screens and other displays in front of her. Jed watched the idle animation for a few minutes, and it didn't seem to loop at any point. Kosma always had another switch to flick or screen to check until he pressed the left mouse button.



On the control panel in front of her was a helmet with a large transparent visor that matched the rest of her armor, which Kosma promptly picked up and put over her head as the visor flicked down and bit her fingers, causing her to squeal she flailed her hand in pain for a couple seconds. After calming down, she sighed while putting on the helmet.

 

""That's what I get for trying to look cool..."" she muttered, defeated, as Jed chuckled moderately amused

 

The camera followed Kosma as she stood up and walked out of the ship, revealing a vast alien desert with jagged rock formations scattered among the dunes, all bathed in the eerie light of a massive blue star. A tooltip appeared and Jed took control. Kosma looked around, her eyes narrowing. ""Right! The probe bot should be nearby... hopefully the black box is still intact,"" she said, determination in her voice.

 

A few moments later she shook her head before saying, ""I should... probably check my map..."".

 

Another tooltip appeared, showing how to open the holographic map. ""She's got personality,"" Jed thought, smiling at the screen.

The map was projected by a small robotic arm attached to her shoulder. The semi-transparent, shimmering hologram showed a three-dimensional representation of the surrounding area, with an orange arrow indicating Kosma's position, and a large red circle on a mesa with the words ""Crash Site"".



Once again, Jed was amazed at the quality of this game. He had truly discovered a hidden gem. The environment was beautifully rendered, but the attention to detail didn't stop at the visuals. Every step Kosma took on the pink sand left a detailed footprint, and the way the light reflected off her spacesuit was clearly a real-time reflection. He wondered how the hell his aging computer, a rig that struggled to run modern games on medium settings, could run a game of such high fidelity without overheating to the point where it could rival the surface of the sun... Yet it ran as smooth as butter, and he could barely hear the cooling fans, which would sound like he was standing next to a jet engine if this were a normal game.

 

 



Walking through the sand, Jed led Kosma to some of the rock formations near the mesa that the map had highlighted, when he noticed large gaps between the rocks leading up to the top of the mesa, forming a fairly obvious platform section. Jed led Kosma through the sand to some rock formations. The map highlighted a path up the mesa, suggesting an obvious platforming section. As he navigated her through several jumps, a large chasm loomed ahead. A prompt appeared: ""Press space in mid-air to activate rocket boots and hold to glide"",



“Here goes nothing”, Jed murmured, making Kosma leap.



 

She activated her rocket boots and glided to the other side, landing in a classic superhero pose. ""Nice!"" he exclaimed, only to see the health bar flash red.



 

Kosma clutched her knee and winced in pain. ""Ngggggggg... I should... use some regen-gel..."" she groaned, as a prompt to heal appeared on screen.

 

At Jed’s input, she crushed a glowing blue bottle and watched as the blue energy healed her knee. Once healed, Kosma's expression returned to normal.



Going through the platform gauntlet, more vegetation and alien creatures appeared the higher he went. Upon reaching the top of the mesa, he was greeted by a lush oasis where soft moss carpeted the ground, and cacti and blue bushes, its swaying leaves added to the natural beauty of the place. Iridescent insects buzzed about, scurrying away as Kosma approached. They ranged from smaller than a housefly to the size of her fist.

At the center of the oasis shimmered a crystalline lake with water lily-like plants floating on the surface. An antenna with a flashing light and the base of a metallic contraption, painted white and orange like Kosma's suit, protruded from the water. ""That must be the probe she was talking about,"" Jed thought.

 

He had other things to do, ""I'll be back,"" he promised himself, and searched for a pause menu or an exit setting. Finding none, he left the game running for the rest of the day, his mind already racing with thoughts of what would happen next.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**Chapter 2: Suspicion**

Kosma felt tired after all the jumping, so she decided to take in the scenery for a moment, turning off her helmet's heads-up display and lying down on the mossy ground. It felt cool and refreshing after the searing heat of the alien desert.

She wished this world had a breathable atmosphere so she could breathe in some fresh air, but this would have to do.

Wondering what this planet would look like once it was terraformed, Kosma lost herself in her thoughts, watching the stars that shone even through the planet's clear blue sky. She tried to see if she could recognize her home system from here.

Suddenly she felt a primal urge to stand up, her ears pricked and all her senses were alert as the heads-up display on her helmet activated again. The fur on her neck stood up... something was wrong. Nevertheless, she began to walk towards the wrecked probe-bot at the lake, hoping to reach the black box hatch without getting her suit wet.

As she approached the edge of the water, she noticed that the probe was moving, sending ripples through the surface. A moment later, sharp, iridescent insectoid appendages erupted from the machine,

 



""AAAAGHH!!!"" Kosma screamed in surprise and horror as the creature wearing the probe bot as a shell stared at her with three pairs of glowing yellow eyes, opening its fanged mouth to strike at Kosma, letting out a deafening shriek as it thrust a sharp bladed arm at her.



She quickly used her rocket boots to jump out of his reach. Upon landing, she muttered, ""First you destroy my probe, and now you try to eat me!"" Then she reached for the kinetic baton she had holstered on her hip and unfolded it with a flick of her wrist. The device came to life with a faint orange glow.



“Let’s dance”, She said, adopting a defensive stance.

The creature clicked its mandibles as it began to move from side to side, raising its four front legs in a show of intimidation as Kosma stood her ground, each waiting for the other to strike first.

Finally, it lunged towards Kosma, using its two rear legs to quickly close the distance between them. It prepared to spear her with the two front pairs, which ended in sharp chitinous blades glistening in the sunlight. She parried the first three blows with her staff, orange sparks shooting from it with each strike, causing the creature to stagger back each time one of its sharp arms made contact with the glowing end of the staff.

 

Two of its limbs grabbed the back of Kosma's calves and pulled her towards them, knocking her onto her back as the creature followed and tried to stab her in the stomach. She rolled to the side at the last possible second, causing the monster to ram its sharp appendage deep into the ground and leave it there.

 

Furiously flailing its free arms at Kosma as it tried to pull its arm free, there was no way she could do any damage from the front without getting mauled.

Jumping, Kosma activated her boot thrusters to get behind the alien and began to relentlessly pound the remains of the probe. Each blow sent chunks of metal and orange sparks flying, the loud bangs mingled with the creature's screams. Just as it finally managed to pull its arm free, Kosma landed a decisive blow, splitting the metallic shell in two. The remains of the probe fell to the side, revealing the soft lower half of the creature, like a hermit crab from hell. But now it was facing her again.

She did her best to parry the incoming barrage of stabs and slashes, but some of them got through. Fortunately, her armor absorbed most of the damage, but she still suffered a long gash to her right shoulder and a stab to her stomach. Jumping to safety once more, she felt the pain flare up as she hit the ground. Then her suit began to fill her wounds with foam to stop the bleeding, and she let out an instinctive growl, baring her teeth at the monster. With a look of determination, she crushed her last vial of regen-gel in her hand and felt the wounds fade in seconds, along with the damage to her suit.

 

Baiting the creature to run after her, Kosma made her way to one of the many giant cactus-like plants that littered the oasis. She jumped at the last possible moment as the creature rammed its arm into the plant and got stuck again.



She landed behind it, kinetic staff in hand and a grim expression on her face. Blow after blow, she struck at the soft lower half of the creature, breaking the skin in just a few strokes.

After each blow, Kosma got sprayed with green goo. By the time she landed a killing blow, her suit was covered in the stuff,

 

""EWWWwwwww.... Okay, maybe a little dip in the lake is not such a bad idea..."", Kosma said in disgust as she put the baton back on her hip.

 

Dripping with green goo, as was half of her visor, her gloves and most of the front of her suit, she dove into the water and washed off most of the sticky liquid that clung to the synthetic fabric of the suit.

She began to relax and would have stayed in the water for a while, but that strange feeling of wrongness returned. With her encounter with the creature, she had completely forgotten about it. She hurried to retrieve the heavy black box from the shattered remains of the probe. She plugged a cable from her wrist-mounted computer into the device. It read ""200 minutes remaining"",

 

""UGHhhh, ARE YOU FOR REAL!??!?"", Kosma complained sighing in frustration,

 



The strange feeling seemed to be gone for now, so she started a small campfire as the sun began to set, not wanting to drip water all over her ship. With her suit's thermal protection off, she could feel the warmth of the fire. It wasn't as good as feeling the night air brush against her fur, but it was still quite pleasant.

The peace didn't last long as the strange sensation returned, urging her to move and pace around with the cable still attached to the black box. She walked, ran, jumped and even swung her staff at nothing, growing more and more anxious by the second.

""Wha... what's going on?"" asked Kosma, frightened and confused. It was as if some unseen force had taken control of her body, something she had never felt before.

Finally, the data transfer was complete. As she unplugged the cable from the black box, it pulled itself back into her suit. Then her eyes locked on the fire and Kosma began to walk towards it. A strange instinct beyond her control beckoned her to move towards the fire.

Her legs carried her forward with a will of their own. She tried to resist with all her will, but from the neck down, her body was no longer under her control. She was forced to step into the fire, and with her thermal protection off, she quickly felt the searing heat as pain shot through her leg,

 

""WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME!"", Kosma screamed in pain as she jumped away from the fire.

 

Reaching for a vial of regen-gel, her hand only grabbed an empty holster. Remembering that she had used the last one during the fight, she needed to rest.

Her leg ached with every step. She wanted to dip it in the water to ease the pain, but that bizarre instinct screamed at her to get back to her ship. Maybe once she was in the safety of the cockpit, this wrongness would go away, and most importantly, she had medical supplies.

 

She wanted to limp, but her body was telling her to run. She wanted to climb slowly down ledges, but her body urged her to jump, causing her to land painfully.

By the time she reached her ship, she was on the verge of passing out from the pain. The moment she stepped inside, the strange feeling disappeared almost instantly. However, the burning pain in her leg was still very present. Limping to the medical capsule, she just lay there as robot arms sprang up and began spraying regenerative agents into her burnt leg,

 

""Ahhhhhhhhh..."" she exhaled, the relief instantaneous as she melted into the padded bed of the capsule and felt her head sink into the soft synthetic fabric.

 

While the regen-gel could heal almost any injury, it always left that numb, itchy feeling on the regenerated areas, while the medical capsule left everything as good as new.

Exhausted both mentally and physically, the encounter with the creature was frightening, but not unlike other things she'd faced before. Granted, this was pretty high up on the malevolence scale, but what freaked her out was that strange, uncontrollable feeling - a feeling of wrongness. An instinct, perhaps? She didn't have a word for it other than 'wrongness', maybe the creature was poisonous and it was affecting her thinking? ""Who in their right mind just walks up and steps into a campfire?"", Kosma thought to herself, questioning her own sanity.

Lost in thought, she eventually fell asleep on the medical bed, not even bothering to take off her suit, just mustering enough energy to take off her helmet and drop it on the floor beside her before dozing off.

It defies logic, but here’s why Australia is a nation of train travellers
Ben Groundwater

It takes 11 hours to ride the train from Sydney to Melbourne and vice versa. Eleven hours from Central Station to Southern Cross, or the other way around.

Take into account the commute to the city and out again – which, if you’re relying on strike-prone Sydney trains could take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours – and you’re looking at 12 to 13 hours of travel all up.

If you were to fly that same route, you would spend 1.5 hours in a plane, maybe an hour each side to get to and from the airport, and an hour at the airport before your flight – 4.5 hours, assuming no delays.

The XPT takes 11 hours to get from Sydney to Melbourne.

It’s a big difference.

Yet plenty of Australian travellers are opting for the longer journey. Transport NSW, which operates the twice-daily XPT service between Sydney and Melbourne, has had to add extra carriages to its interstate trains, and tickets are selling out.

Year-on-year patronage of the XPT was up 14 per cent in the 2023-24 financial year, and in July to December last year, there was another big jump.

It doesn’t take a genius to figure out what the attraction is. Sydney to Melbourne is the world’s fifth-busiest flight route, with more than 9 million airline passengers a year (just behind Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City), but it also remains in the grip of the Qantas-Virgin duopoly, with prices that fluctuate wildly with demand.

The train, meanwhile, has a set price of $83 each way, or $117 during peak holiday periods.

For $83, you can stroll on board with no security checks carrying one 10-kilogram piece of hand luggage, and one 20-kilogram piece of large luggage (two pieces if you choose first class). You can check your larger pieces of luggage in or carry them on board.

At $83 each way, or $117 in peak periods, the XPT is still a more economical alternative.

You’ll then have 11 hours to luxuriate in your seat (which reclines 28 degrees and 40 in first class), visit the restaurant car, read a book, stare out the window.

Of course, you won’t be able to charge devices because there are no electrical outlets or USB ports, and you’ll barely be able to use your phone anyway, because the tinting on the windows of the XPT trains blocks not just the sun, but also mobile phone signals.

You will also travel painfully slowly at some points, and find yourself daydreaming pointlessly about Japanese shinkansen and the French TGV as you sit stationary in a siding waiting for a coal train to pass.

The Sydney to Melbourne train service, let’s face it, is terrible. On a global scale, in comparison to the likes of Japan, South Korea, China, Switzerland, Austria, Spain, France and so many more, we’re an absolute joke.

Yet plenty of people in Australia still want to ride the train, and more people are doing it. They’re doing this because it’s cheaper, of course. But I imagine there are other reasons.

Trains are, after all, the ultimate way to travel. You can’t convince me otherwise. Carbon emissions are far lower, the comfort and convenience levels are far higher (in most countries at least), and there’s just something so wholesome and enjoyable about seeing the world from the window of a train.

You get to see that world, for starters. You get to watch the way landscapes connect, the way mountains become plains, forests become meadows, rivers rush into the sea. You get to sleep, if you’re really lucky, to the gentle click-clack of carriages and occasional platform announcements in foreign languages.

There’s romance to train travel that you will never get in a plane. There’s comfort and conviviality that you will never find in an airport security queue or when you’re crammed into a car or bus.

For these and many other reasons, there’s a thirst in Australia to become a nation of train travellers. I firmly believe that.

Loading
It’s happening now, in a small way, even with such dire rail options, even though you have to spend three times as long getting from A to B, even though you can’t even charge your devices, let alone hope for Wi-Fi or a decent phone signal.

The necessity of air travel has become so deeply ingrained into the Australian psyche, entrenched by powerful airline lobby groups and politicians unwilling to commit to large-scale rail projects, that there are still people who argue that Australia just isn’t suitable for long-distance train travel.

That’s despite a large and ever-growing population base clustered in a relatively small area between two major centres (Sydney to Melbourne is roughly the same distance as Tokyo to Hiroshima – and you can do that in under four hours on the shinkansen).

Despite all the obvious issues with our system, the popularity of long-distance train travel in Australia is increasing, beyond our capacity to handle it.

Australia could be a nation of train travellers. We love it in other countries. We even put up with the inconveniences here. Maybe one day we will have a rail system to match the enthusiasm.

20 gallon filter tank for my red footed tortoises pond. Any suggestions for inhabitants?,Aquariums,1i6qq8n,2025-01-21 14:20:35,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i6qq8n,Straight_Neat_7018,Help/Advice,"So I recently set up a pond in my red footed tortoise(Geronimo)s table. Tortoises love to go to the bathroom while soaking. So I set up this 20 gal underneath the pond to act as a sort of filter unit and increase the volume of water. 125gal/hour penguin waterfall unit with activated carbon and zeolite as filter medium. Small pond pump under the gravel returns water up to the pond and also creates an undergravel filter effect.

There is always going to be a small amount of peat moss being added to the water as that's what's in Gerry's hide. I believe peat acidifies the water slightly.

So my real question, should I put any critters in here(aside from the bladder snails that came with a plant) or just leave it plants. Any suggestions appreciated! "

Tear off this sutra from the rock-face above mine head and release me from mine imprisonment beneath this accursed mountain,"" the giant creature stated in a deep, heavily accented voice. 

""Oh no,"" muttered Harry, to his credit managing to keep his cool in this surprising situation. ""It's probably better if I don't get involved ... I'll probably just mess everything up again..."" He started slowly backing away.

The being blinked in astonishment. ""Thou art not here under the Will of Heaven?""

""Uhhhh, maybe?"" Harry scratched his head awkwardly. 

""Art not thou the Chosen One?""

Harry stiffened in shock. This thing must have lain on this spot for centuries, judging by all the moss growth. How could it possibly know that? ""Why yes I am!"" he blurted out. ""How did you know!?""

It chuckled loudly. ""I know much that is hidden, O Harry!""

Harry was even more impressed that it even knew his name, forgetting for the moment that he was wearing one of Mrs Weasley's sweaters emblazoned with the words 'Harry J. Potter' in bright red. 

""No matter what broughtest thou here, free me and I shall grant thee a boon. Whatever thy heart most desirest I shall grant you.""

""Oh no, that's alright, I don't need anything ... wait a tic, did you say *anything* I want?""

""Forsooth.""

Harry's eyes lit up with cautious optimism. ""I happen to have a bit of a problem with a certain Dark Lord and his evil minions...""

""Dark Lord? Is this some sort of Demon? Say no more, I shall purge the lot from the face of the earth!""

""Um, don't take this the wrong way, but are you sure you can do it? This guy happens to be unkillable...""

""Mortal, insult me not! I hath slain tens, nay, hundreds of thousands of Demons of all kinds, all of which boasted themselves to be immortal! I proved them wrong. Hath this 'Dark Lord' of yours descended to the very heights of the heavenly realms, or down to the very depths of the world of the dead, as I hath done?""

""Hmmm,"" Harry pondered. ""I don't think so...""

""Even should he descend to the uttermost limits of Naraku, this abomination cannot escape my grasp,"" the monkey boasted. 

""Wait a minute, if you can go down into Hades, does that mean you're able to bring people back from the dead?"" Harry blurted, hope surging within his chest. 

""Hmmm,"" the creature pondered. ""The gods of death doth owe me several favours for not destroying them all when they treacherously attempted to drag my soul into the underworld ... as long as it is not too many souls brought back to the land of the living, I believe it can be done with nary a fuss.""

""Not too many!"" Harry hastened to assure it. ""Sirius, Dad and Mum ... oh, and Cedric ... hmmm I remember hearing something about how Dumbledore's sister and parents died tragically ... that's only seven. Seven's a good magical number anyway, right?""

""A mere seven is acceptable. So is it a deal, human?""

""OK ..."" Harry realised he was absently scratching the scars of the letters carved into the back of his hand from detention last year. ""There's also a certain Minister and a certain flunky of his who are practically servants of the Dark Lord, after all they've done to help Him ... add them to your hit list and we have a deal.""

""Done!""

Harry tore off the magical sutra and scurried back as the mountain rumbled and trembled. Out of the dust a figure landed lightly beside him. To his shock the enormous monkey, which had been easily the size of several giants, had transfigured itself into an identical copy of himself, glasses and all, grinning cheekily. 

""Let us begone!"" the replica Harry cried out in joy. ""Twas far too long a sojourn here, and I must return soon to Flower Fruit Mountain. Let us find this Dark Lord of yours. We'll take mine flying cloud.""

Within moments Harry was clutching onto a fluffy but somehow sturdy cloud that shot through the sky at enormous speed. 

""Well met young Harry, I am the Monkey King! Though I possess innumerable names, you humans call me Sun Wukong.""

""Nice to meet you Mr Sun,"" Harry muttered, vaguely wondering if someone had cast a confundus on him and the past hour had been a mere fever-dream. ""But how are we going to find them, they're all hidden...""

Wukong grinned and began tearing out tufts of hair from his head and scattering them to the wind. To Harry's astonishment, each strand of hair transformed into another replica of himself. Soon replica Harrys filled the sky. With hoots and hollers they fell to earth and immediately spread out London. 

Harry pursed his lips. ""I wonder if I should've thought about this deal a bit longer...""

"The Inflation Fire Returns: LA in Ash, the Fed’s Classic Mistake, and a Wild Economic Outlook",Brokeonomics,1i6mux7,2025-01-21 11:42:58,5,0.78,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brokeonomics/comments/1i6mux7/the_inflation_fire_returns_la_in_ash_the_feds/,DumbMoneyMedia,Brokeflation,"By r/Brokeonomics 

# LA in Flames: A Case of Literal and Metaphorical Economy Burning

In a dramatic twist that feels ripped from an apocalyptic summer blockbuster, **the city of Los Angeles is burning**. Entire neighborhoods are reduced to ash, and the local hydrants are drier than a tumbleweed in Death Valley. Blame climate change if you want; blame poor city management, water shortages, private jets, or even pop star carbon footprints—doesn’t change the fact that **one of America’s great cities is engulfed in an inferno**.

At the same time, a different type of fire—**the inflation fire**—is threatening to reignite, propelled by a Federal Reserve that’s turned a bit complacent. They essentially declared “mission accomplished” the moment inflation cooled even slightly, ignoring smoldering embers that could flare up at the first gust of economic disruption. That’s like leaving a campfire untended while the wind picks up.

# The Fire’s Economic Ripple: From Insurance to Housing

If you think the heartbreak stops at charred homes, think again—**the economic domino effect** of these LA fires could ripple across the entire country. Why?

1. **Insurance Catastrophe**: Not all LA residents had robust fire insurance. Some had coverage canceled months ago (State Farm or others pulling out). Others hold “on paper” coverage from smaller carriers that might go belly-up. When insurers fold, that liability often gets passed onto the taxpayer via bailouts.

[Time to bail out more insurance companies :D](https://preview.redd.it/h7cqj6s8fdee1.png?width=1231&format=png&auto=webp&s=b27583178b41de88d1c5d8ba2ea100a6e0860f67)

1. **Skyrocketing Rents and Home Prices**: Thousands of families now displaced will flood the rental market. Supply-and-demand means a scramble for whatever housing is left, potentially pushing rents up by double digits overnight. Some headlines already show rent hikes of 20%, 50%, or even 100% for single-family homes in the unaffected enclaves.

https://preview.redd.it/95z8ckxnfdee1.png?width=769&format=png&auto=webp&s=660c35fcb3536f3262349d446ddc4ec7abcf256c

1. **Infrastructure Rebuild**: Roads, utilities, and local businesses destroyed. Estimates range from $135 billion to half a trillion in total damage. If that’s accurate, you can bet the federal government will be printing more dollars (or raising taxes) to help LA rebuild. And more public spending often fuels inflation, especially if the Fed tries to keep interest rates low to “stimulate” the recovery.

https://preview.redd.it/0rif2sg3fdee1.png?width=1153&format=png&auto=webp&s=593163332296d2290c77fe07baf5ed9e6e1d2760

Brace yourself. These consequences won’t be locked in LA’s city limits. They’ll bleed into the broader economy, likely pushing up commodity prices, raising insurance premiums nationwide, and thickening the red ink in the national budget.

# Inflation Isn’t Out—The Fed’s Critical Blunder

Let’s cut to the macro side of the story: **the Federal Reserve**. They battled inflation aggressively by raising interest rates, but once the CPI (Consumer Price Index) numbers softened a bit, they decided to ease off. The market cheered, thinking we’d get a “soft landing.” Everyone sang Kumbaya, ignoring that historically the Fed has a habit of declaring victory too early.

https://preview.redd.it/c70q56qtfdee1.png?width=583&format=png&auto=webp&s=b272798d9c6d2850ad7291c79414d98707219490

* **Classic Pattern**: The Fed hikes until something breaks (bank failures or a big stock downturn). Then it pumps the brakes, trimming rates or pivoting to a more “dovish” stance.
* **Meanwhile**: Commodity prices or big unforeseen events (like these wildfires) can push inflation right back up, forcing the Fed to do an about-face and hike again—often at the worst possible time.

So yes, people rejoiced for about half a second at the slight dip in inflation, but the underlying structural issues—big deficits, global commodity fluctuations, ongoing supply chain hiccups, and yes, city-razing wildfires—were never truly solved.

# Commodity Prices and Bond Yields: The Canaries in the Coal Mine

https://preview.redd.it/a8hjlxdxfdee1.png?width=716&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe102235371a90b4edee0cfd0e1d2359cc4f5855

If you want early warnings that inflation might re-accelerate, keep an eye on **commodity prices** and **bond yields**:

https://preview.redd.it/ffq3z34bgdee1.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8b0be09e55a062e204ae49c89af94f1cfd62dd8

1. **Heating Oil / Diesel**: If trucking, shipping, and industrial power all run on diesel, its price sets the stage for everything else. Already, January indicates a 10–15% jump in certain fuel categories.
2. **Copper, Soybeans, Wheat**: Price rises in these staples can trickle through the entire supply chain—food, electronics, and manufacturing.
3. **Bond Yields**: The 2-year Treasury yield is a known leading indicator of Federal Reserve policy. If yields begin rising anew, it’s a sign the market believes the Fed will have to tighten policy (raise rates) again to contain a resurgent inflation threat.

https://preview.redd.it/5nb9zma4gdee1.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=96ca95dfaa9f9b2cfcec6379d6571670b5f1e06e

It’s not sexy to watch charts of oats or heating oil, but ignoring them in times like these can be a big mistake.

# Lessons From the Past: 1970s, 2008, and the Fed’s Endless Cycle

https://preview.redd.it/atb68tb5hdee1.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=c44681865a781a95099e675deb0ab45122690ce4

We’ve seen variations of this story:

* **1970s**: The Fed hammered inflation for a while, then pivoted prematurely. Inflation roared back. Ultimately, it required punishingly high rates (hello, 20% mortgage interest) to slay the dragon.
* **Early 2000s**: Rate cuts to offset the dot-com bubble crash fueled a housing bubble. We all know how that ended in 2008.
* **2018–2019**: The Fed tried normalizing rates, but the stock market got wobbly. They reversed course quickly, setting the stage for a big asset bubble that soared through the pandemic era.

https://preview.redd.it/g8ua5u7dhdee1.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=744b1320d4479a46765d94b820fa3d2dc9dad8bc

The pattern is consistent: the Fed rarely times it perfectly. They either overdo it or underdo it, and each miscalculation has the potential to spawn new crises. So if you hear talk of “Fed might have to hike again,” do not dismiss it. It’s happened before, and it can happen again.

# The Dreaded Return of Rate Hikes? How We Might Get There

So how do we go from near-euphoric “We’re done with rate increases!” to “Oops, guess we’re raising them again”?

https://preview.redd.it/fg2yzmymgdee1.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e8b67c560acd3c4bec668c14a59ae5370de68fe

[ISM is a good leading indicator for inflation](https://preview.redd.it/f6xr1x4vgdee1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=649176b751f363af3cae87f2e9869e3a7d3f9b77)

1. **Inflation Data Surges**: Maybe in 1–2 months we see a big jump in CPI, fueled by commodity spikes and wildfire rebuilding costs.
2. **Bond Market Senses Trouble**: The 2-year yield creeps upward, pricing in the possibility of further hikes.
3. **Fed’s Credibility Crisis**: Jerome Powell or whoever is in charge might realize they can’t let inflation expectations skyrocket. Because once the public believes inflation is embedded, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
4. **Policy Reversal**: The Fed calls an emergency meeting or signals in official statements that they’ll hold rates higher for longer—or even push them up another quarter or half a point.

This is not a guaranteed scenario, of course. But it looms on the horizon like a storm cloud that might blow over or might dump six inches of rain on your head.

# Consumer Weakness, Corporate Confusion, and the Wealthy Elite Spending Like Crazy

Here’s the paradox:

* **Consumer Spending**: Lower- and middle-income folks are feeling the pinch. Credit card debt is climbing, delinquencies rising, and job growth is questionable. Full-time positions are shrinking.
* **Corporate Earnings**: Some companies (think restaurants, retail) are complaining that “uncertainty about consumer spending” is their biggest worry. Others (Delta, big airlines) say business is booming thanks to high-end travelers.

This mirrors the broader “K-shaped” reality: The top 10–20% are flush with cash, booking first-class flights, propping up certain industries, keeping demand and, by extension, inflation strong. Meanwhile, the rest teeter on the brink of default. The result? The economy’s “average” data can be misleading, since a fraction of wealthy consumers can single-handedly buoy certain segments of the market.

# The Dollar, the Yen, and Janet Yellen: A Brewing Currency Storm

https://preview.redd.it/e8ceg3qxjdee1.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=e367dafa2359ab9b805553e5e1b8335b6ab78316

International currency dynamics also come into play. The U.S. dollar soared last year, which tamped down some inflation by making imports cheaper. But now:

* **Bank of Japan**: Rumor says they might raise rates, strengthening the yen. If that happens, the dollar could weaken.
* **European Central Bank (ECB)**: If Europe’s hawkish tone persists, the euro could strengthen too.
* **Treasury Secretary**: Janet Yellen is no stranger to yield curve manipulations. If she extends new debt or changes the maturity mix at the Treasury, it can all whipsaw the bond market.

https://preview.redd.it/acnntiw2kdee1.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bd279a149d017e86ac64f5c4ed7f3210be8b094

A weaker dollar means higher prices for commodities (like oil) in dollar terms, feeding inflation again. Meanwhile, Yellen might respond with more short-term financial tricks. But you can’t outrun the fundamental math that a rising cost environment plus a weakening dollar can swirl together into a perfect inflation storm.

# Market Jitters: Positioning, Earnings, and Chart Indicators

https://preview.redd.it/9jiuis2dkdee1.png?width=1116&format=png&auto=webp&s=76f7733558eb0ea6e7d52d8d974839d2055c31fd

Don’t overlook the **market** itself. We’ve seen:

https://preview.redd.it/eqz9k3gjkdee1.png?width=1157&format=png&auto=webp&s=acb6599f9811406992c0446e7b445218a8bd3172

* **Positioning Shifts**: A couple of big inflation data releases and official Fed statements can cause wild volatility. Traders often front-run these announcements with major buy/sell orders, then unwind positions when reality doesn’t match the hype.
* **Earnings Season**: The next wave of corporate earnings is hitting. Netflix, big banks, major industrials—these can drastically shift sentiment if they reveal sticky wage costs or pass-through inflation in product pricing.
* **Technical Indicators**: Some watchers use daily or weekly charts to track the S&P 500 relative to moving averages. If the index dips below key support lines (e.g., the 50-day or 200-day moving average), it can signal the end of an uptrend or a shift in sentiment.

In simpler terms, it’s a game of cat and mouse: Everyone tries to anticipate if inflation re-ignites, if bond yields spike, or if the Fed flinches. The moment clarity emerges, markets can pivot with lightning speed.

# Aftermath in Focus: “Soft Landing” or Delayed Crash?

https://preview.redd.it/tpwz5amekdee1.png?width=874&format=png&auto=webp&s=915620d0ba53d123eb365d69c6cbea1ecdb4f05f

So, what if the Fed continues to do basically nothing? Or if they hold rates where they are, ignoring the building tension? Possibly a *temporary* sweet spot emerges—some even label it a “soft landing.” The economy looks stable, the stock market edges up, people forget about inflation for a few months.

But often, **the bigger the calm, the louder the storm** when inflation eventually breaks loose. If the Fed’s behind the curve, they’ll have to slam on the brakes even harder later, risking a deeper recession. Meanwhile, the LA crisis alone might add tens or hundreds of billions in new government spending, fueling even more inflationary pressures.

The short version: “Soft landing” might just be code for “delay the pain.” And the pain, if delayed long enough, could transform from a mild bruise to a full-on meltdown.

# Embracing the Chaos and Watching for Sparks

Welcome to the wackiest timeline, folks. Los Angeles is literally burning, creating untold billions in damages that the taxpayer (or the Fed) will ultimately pay for. The Federal Reserve is patting itself on the back for “taming” inflation—right as commodity prices start to creep up again, bond yields hum in anticipation, and currency shifts loom on the horizon. Meanwhile, a new administration is inaugurated, comedic coin scams are bankrupting people (like that Trump coin and Melania coin fiasco), and an AI-generated Brad Pitt is scamming French women out of $850,000. If it sounds like a reality show, that’s because it sort of is.

[Housing crisis intensifies ](https://preview.redd.it/ahkq98m3ldee1.png?width=619&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e726371aa0193d59af3f02d2b5dfa1374471bc2)

Here’s the big takeaway:

1. **Inflation**: It’s not truly out. Keep an eye on commodities, yields, and the next CPI prints.
2. **The Fed**: Historically late to recognize a second inflation wave, could do a “shock pivot” on rate hikes if forced.
3. **LA Fires**: The short-term tragedy might snowball into national housing inflation, bigger deficits, and more pressure on policymakers.
4. **Currency & Debt**: The swirling combination of a weakening dollar, potential foreign central bank rate hikes, and Yellen’s “extraordinary measures” can alter the global financial map overnight.
5. **Market Reaction**: Expect more seesaw action as traders react to every data point about inflation or Fed signals. One day, “We’re saved!” The next, “We’re doomed!”

And for better or worse, we get to watch it all unfold in real time. Perhaps the best we can do is stay alert, question the narratives, and brace for the possibility that the inflation fire, like LA’s literal one, might rage longer and more fiercely than the “experts” claim.

*Stay vigilant, keep your sense of humor, and if an AI-generated celebrity tries to DM you for thousands of dollars—shut that down ASAP. Because, believe it or not, the only thing more scorching than actual flames is the financial burn of a well-crafted scam. Good luck out there, everyone.*"

Position Paper: Advocating For Inclusive Future-Focused E-Bike Regulations,u_EBIKE-ULTRA,1i67ptg,2025-01-20 21:01:22,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_EBIKE-ULTRA/comments/1i67ptg/position_paper_advocating_for_inclusive/,EBIKE-ULTRA,,"Position Paper: Advocating for Inclusive and Future-Focused E-Bike Regulations

E-bikes have become a transformative force in urban mobility, offering a cleaner, more efficient, and accessible mode of transportation for millions worldwide. As technology advances, the advent of high-performance e-bikes capable of speeds over 30 mph and up to 45 mph has opened new opportunities and challenges. These faster models expand the range of e-bike applications, including commuting, long-distance travel, and commercial use, but they also require thoughtful regulatory updates to ensure safety, accessibility, and innovation.

We propose a comprehensive framework for e-bike regulations that embraces the diversity of e-bikes while fostering a safer, more sustainable, and inclusive transportation system.

1. Adapting Regulations for High-Performance E-Bikes

The introduction of e-bikes capable of speeds between 30–45 mph represents a new category that bridges traditional bicycles and motorized vehicles. These models are ideal for long-distance commuters and businesses, offering a sustainable alternative to cars.
	•	Recommendation: Introduce a new classification for high-speed e-bikes:
	•	Class 4: High-performance e-bikes, capable of speeds up to 45 mph, requiring additional safety features such as turn signals, mirrors, and braking systems suited for higher speeds.
	•	Infrastructure Integration: Allow these e-bikes to use bike lanes only where lane design and width can accommodate higher speeds. In areas lacking proper infrastructure, designate specific roadways or lanes for these models.
	•	Rider Requirements: Establish minimum age limits (e.g., 18+) and require riders of Class 4 e-bikes to complete a safety course or obtain a basic license to ensure responsible use.

2. Sustainability and the Role of High-Speed E-Bikes

E-bikes, including high-performance models, are key to reducing carbon emissions, easing urban congestion, and decreasing reliance on fossil fuels. Faster e-bikes offer an attractive alternative to cars for suburban-to-urban commutes and commercial delivery services, significantly reducing the carbon footprint of daily transportation.
	•	Recommendation: Incentivize the adoption of high-speed e-bikes for businesses and individuals through tax credits, subsidies, and grants. Expand green mobility programs to include these models, especially for commercial applications like last-mile delivery.

3. Accessibility and Equity in E-Bike Use

While high-speed e-bikes cater to commuters and businesses, regulations must ensure that all e-bike types remain accessible to diverse demographics, including seniors, low-income individuals, and urban populations.
	•	Recommendation: Avoid overregulation of standard e-bikes while setting fair guidelines for high-speed models. Continue to support programs that subsidize standard e-bike purchases and promote shared e-bike fleets, ensuring equitable access to sustainable transportation.

4. Safety and Infrastructure Development

The integration of high-speed e-bikes into existing transportation systems requires significant investment in infrastructure and clear safety guidelines. Faster e-bikes present unique challenges, including increased collision risks and the need for specialized roadways.
	•	Recommendation:
	•	Expand and enhance bike lanes to accommodate both standard and high-speed e-bikes, with clear signage and speed segregation where appropriate.
	•	Mandate advanced safety features for Class 4 e-bikes, such as improved brakes, lights, turn signals, and audible alerts.
	•	Launch public education campaigns to promote safe riding practices and increase awareness of the differences between e-bike classes.

5. Simplifying E-Bike Classifications

The diversity of e-bikes now ranges from pedal-assist models to high-speed vehicles, creating confusion for riders and policymakers. Simplifying classifications will ensure consistent regulations across jurisdictions.
	•	Proposed Framework:
	•	Class 1: Pedal-assist, capped at 20 mph.
	•	Class 2: Throttle-only, capped at 20 mph.
	•	Class 3: Pedal-assist or throttle, capped at 28 mph.
	•	Class 4: High-speed e-bikes, capable of speeds up to 45 mph, with additional safety and licensing requirements.

This clear structure will help riders understand their responsibilities and ensure regulations are uniformly applied.

6. Encouraging Innovation and Commercial Applications

High-speed e-bikes open new avenues for innovation and commercial use, from long-distance commuting to delivery services. Overregulation could stifle growth in these areas, limiting the potential of e-bikes to revolutionize transportation.
	•	Recommendation:
	•	Streamline the certification process for high-performance models while maintaining safety standards.
	•	Encourage partnerships between governments and businesses to pilot high-speed e-bike fleets for logistics and delivery.
	•	Provide research grants for battery technology, safety systems, and modular designs tailored for high-speed e-bikes.

7. Economic and Employment Benefits

The e-bike industry, including the high-performance segment, generates jobs in manufacturing, retail, maintenance, and tourism. High-speed models also create opportunities for businesses to reduce costs and improve efficiency in logistics.
	•	Recommendation: Support small businesses adopting e-bikes for delivery and logistics through financial incentives and simplified regulatory processes. Promote workforce training programs focused on e-bike maintenance and repair, ensuring a skilled labor pool to support this growing industry.

Conclusion

E-bikes, from standard pedal-assist models to high-performance variants capable of speeds up to 45 mph, are transforming the way we move. As technology evolves, regulations must keep pace, fostering safety, accessibility, and innovation while maximizing the environmental and economic benefits of e-bikes.

We urge policymakers to adopt a forward-thinking regulatory framework that:
	•	Recognizes the potential of high-speed e-bikes.
	•	Balances safety with accessibility and innovation.
	•	Invests in infrastructure and education to support the growing diversity of e-bike users.

By embracing these principles, we can create a transportation ecosystem where e-bikes thrive as a cornerstone of sustainable, inclusive, and efficient mobility. Together, we can ensure that e-bikes, regardless of their speed, contribute to a cleaner, greener, and more connected future."

They are a common pest problem in homes, hotels, and other places where people sleep. Bed bugs are not known to transmit diseases, but their bites can cause itchy welts and allergic reactions in some people.

# What are Bed Bugs?

[Bed Bug](https://preview.redd.it/7y714639j8ee1.png?width=729&format=png&auto=webp&s=7df108420d18e4f217a6bc27fdcd0a616501f141)

Bed bugs are small, flat, oval-shaped insects that are reddish-brown. They are about the size of an apple seed. Bed bugs hide in cracks and crevices during the day and come out to feed at night. They are attracted to the warmth and carbon dioxide that humans emit.

# How Do Bed Bugs Infest Areas?

Bed bugs are expert hitchhikers. They can travel on clothing, luggage, furniture, and even people. Once in a new location, they can quickly spread to other areas. Bed bugs are often found in mattresses, box springs, bed frames, headboards, and furniture near the bed.  An infestation can take about a month to take hold.   A bed bugs  life cycle is 30 days, from eggs to adults.

# What Do Bed Bugs Do?

Bed bugs feed on human blood. They pierce the skin with their mouthparts and inject saliva that contains an anesthetic and an anticoagulant. This prevents the person from feeling the bite and allows the bed bug to feed for several minutes without interruption.

# How to Tell if You Have Bed Bugs:

* **Bites:** Look for small, itchy welts on your skin, often in a line or cluster.
* **Bloodstains:** Check your sheets and pillowcases for small bloodstains.
* **Fecal matter:** Look for dark spots or smears on your mattress or bedding.
* **Shed skins:** Bed bugs shed their skins as they grow. You might find these skins in your bed or near where they are hiding.
* **Live bed bugs:** Inspect your mattress seams, box springs, and furniture for live bed bugs.

# How to Kill Bed Bugs with a [Clothes Steamer:](https://amzn.to/40pNiPj)

Steamers are a powerful tool in your fight against bed bugs. Their high steam temperature can effectively kill bed bugs and their eggs on contact. Here’s how to use a clothes steamer to take control and eliminate bed bugs:

**Choose the** [**Right Steamer:**](https://amzn.to/40pNiPj) Select a steamer with a high steam temperature (at least 212°F \[100°C\]) and a continuous steam output. Some steamers have specialized attachments for targeting bed bugs, but any head of a Clothes Steamer will do.    

   **Prepare the Area:** Remove clutter and vacuum the area to be treated. This helps remove any loose bed bugs and debris.  Throw out the vacuum bag immediately. 

   **Target Bed Bug Hotspots:** Focus on areas where bed bugs are commonly found, look at Mattresses and box springs (pay close attention to seams and crevices.

* Bed frames and headboards
* Furniture near the bed (sofas, chairs, nightstands)
* Carpets and rugs Cracks and crevices in walls and floors

[**Bed Bug Interceptor Cups**](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=bed%20bug%20interceptor%20cups&crid=3M56ZSZHUSL0N&sprefix=bed%20bug%20interceptor%20cups%2Caps%2C256&linkCode=sl2&tag=clothesteam0b-20&linkId=32b6e68471242a4f1b98bbc4ee871b9f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl&tag=clothesteam0b-20)  These plastic cups are installed under each leg of the bed frame.  These multi-walled plastic cups with slick coating prevent the bed bugs from crawling up furniture and traps them preventing from getting out.

**Direct Heat/Steam Contact is Key:** The steam needs to make direct contact with the bed bugs to be effective. This can be challenging in deep crevices or within thick fabrics.  Move the steamer **slowly**  over the infested areas. This ensures that the steam penetrates all areas and reaches the bed bugs. Hold the steamer about 1 inch away from the surface and steam for at least 30 seconds per area. Use Attachments if your steamer has them to target specific areas. A crevice tool can help reach bed bugs hiding in cracks and crevices, but not necessary, any steamer head will do. 

  **Repeat as Needed:** Multiple steaming sessions might be necessary for established infestations to eliminate all bed bugs and their eggs. Repeat the steaming process every few days until you see no signs of bed bugs.

 **Safety Precautions:**

* Always use caution when operating a steamer, as the steam can cause burns.
* Check the care labels on your furniture and bedding before steaming to ensure they can withstand high temperatures.
* Protect yourself by wearing gloves and long sleeves to avoid burns.
* **Limitations:** Steam might not reach bed bugs hidden deep within walls or furniture. For severe infestations, professional pest control is recommended.

# How to Avoid Bed Bugs in Hotels

Bed bugs are a common problem in hotels, and they can easily hitchhike home with you in your luggage or on your clothes. Here are some tips to help prevent bed bugs in hotels:  

* [Clothes Steamer:](https://amzn.to/40pNiPj) Bring it every time you travel.
* **Inspect the room:** Before you settle in, inspect the room for signs of bed bugs.  Remove all bedding and check the mattress seams, headboard, and any furniture near the bed. Look for small, reddish-brown insects, dark spots (bed bug feces), or shed skins.  
* **Keep your luggage off the floor and bed:** Store your luggage on a luggage rack or a hard surface away from the walls and bed.  
* **Use hard-sided luggage:** Bed bugs have more difficulty getting into hard-sided luggage than soft-sided luggage.  
* **Seal your belongings:** Place your clothing, shoes, and dirty laundry in resealable plastic bags inside your suitcase.  
* **Wash and dry clothes at high temperatures:** When you get home, wash and dry all your clothes to kill any bed bugs that might have hitched a ride.  
* **Be mindful of where you sit and place items:** Avoid placing your belongings on upholstered furniture or the bed.  
* **Report any signs of bed bugs:** If you find any, immediately report it to the hotel staff and request a different room.

# At What Temperature Do Bed Bugs Die

Bed bugs are surprisingly resilient creatures, but they have a critical weakness: heat. Here’s how quickly those pesky critters will meet their demise when exposed to high temperatures:   

* **113°F (48°C):** At this temperature, adult bed bugs will die if they endure constant exposure for 90 minutes or more . However, it’s important to note that bed bug eggs are more resistant and require longer exposure at this temperature to be completely eradicated .
* **118°F (48°C):** This temperature significantly speeds up the process. Adult bed bugs will die within 20 minutes at this heat level ^(1) . Bed bug eggs still require 90 minutes of exposure to be destroyed ^(1) .
* **118°F (48°C):** This temperature significantly speeds up the process. Adult bed bugs will die within 20 minutes at this heat level ^(1) . Bed bug eggs still require 90 minutes of exposure to be destroyed ^(1) .
* **122°F (50°C):** This is where things get serious for bed bugs. Both adult bed bugs and their eggs will be eliminated within minutes at this temperature   

 **Steam Temperature:** Most clothes steamers produce steam well above these temperatures, typically between 200°F (93°C) and 300°F (149°C). This means that with direct contact, steam can   kill bed bugs very quickly.    **Direct Contact is Key:** The steam needs to make direct contact with the bed bugs to be effective. This can be challenging in deep crevices or within thick fabrics. **Surface Temperature:** The surface being treated also needs to reach and maintain the lethal temperature long enough to kill the bugs.

By understanding the relationship between heat and bed bug mortality, you can effectively use a clothes steamer to target these pesty critters and create a cleaner, healthier home environment.

# How To know If Your Couch Has Bed Bugs

* **Bites:** The most common sign is itchy welts on your skin, often in a line or cluster. These bites typically appear on exposed areas like arms, legs, and the neck.  
* **Live bed bugs:** Carefully inspect the couch, paying close attention to seams, crevices, tufts, and folds in the fabric. Use a flashlight and a magnifying glass to aid your search.
* **Shed skins:** Bed bugs shed their skins as they grow, so look for these translucent, empty exoskeletons.   
* **Fecal stains:** Bed bug droppings appear as tiny, dark spots or smears on the fabric. These stains might look like ink or marker marks.
*  **Bloodstains:** Small bloodstains on your sheets or pillowcases can also indicate bed bugs.   
* **Musty odor:** A sweet, musty odor can sometimes be present in areas with a heavy bed bug infestation.   
* **Clicking sounds:** You might hear faint clicking sounds coming from the couch, which could be the bed bugs moving around.

# Where to Look For Bed Bugs In Your House:

* **Seams and Crevices:** Just like your bed, bed bugs love to hide in seams, piping, and crevices in the fabric.   
* **Cushions:** Carefully inspect the cushions, both the fabric and the underside.   
* **Underneath the Couch:** Don’t forget to check underneath the couch, as bed bugs can hide in the dust cover or the frame.
* **Surrounding Areas:** Inspect the area around the couch, including nearby furniture, walls, and carpets.   

# Tips for a Thorough Bed Bug Inspection

* **Use a flashlight:** A bright flashlight can help you spot bed bugs and their signs in dark crevices.

Why Do I Owe CRA for Benefits and Credits?,cantax,1i6179b,2025-01-20 16:10:53,2,0.58,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/cantax/comments/1i6179b/why_do_i_owe_cra_for_benefits_and_credits/,CheetahAny3067,,"Hi! I checked my CRA account today under the ""Benefits and Credits"" section, and I noticed the following:

* **Amount you owe back to CRA for benefits and credits:**
   * GST/HST credit: $325
   * Canada Carbon Rebate: $772
   * **Total: $1,097**

I’m single, and received **$225 per quarter** for the Carbon Rebate and **$129.50 per quarter** for the GST credit. Could you help me understand why I now owe this amount?

EDIT: I'm never married, no children, and living in Alberta.



UPDATE: So I called CRA and gave them my world income info. It seems the agent was confused about how I received GST and CCR without submitting my world income earlier, and honestly, I’m not sure either! They’ll be refunding me the difference for both GST and CCR. Appreciate everyone who chimed in!"
Soundtrack Discussion,SuperMarioGalaxy,1i5yjxj,2025-01-20 14:24:50,15,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuperMarioGalaxy/comments/1i5yjxj/soundtrack_discussion/,Loot_Bugs,Galaxy 1,"Hello all. Very pleased to have found this subreddit - SMG1 is probably my favourite game ever. A big reason why is its atmosphere, and a big contributor to that is its soundtrack.

I was originally going to try and discuss every single soundtrack in the game, but I realized I don’t have much to say for most of them, apart from “it good, me like”. So this post is basically just an edited version of that: me discussing my top soundtracks from the first game and why they’re so great.

Disclaimer: I don’t know anything about the technicality of music, so I’m mostly going to be discussing the vibe/feel of songs more than their precise composition.  

11. King Bowser. The track changes based on whether bowser is vulnerable or not. If he is, a male choir is layered on top of the main soundtrack. I think dynamic soundtracks are cool. I also prefer this theme to, say, Galaxy 2’s bowser fight since Galaxy 2’s fight music sounds a bit… I don’t know. Fantastical. Almost happy. This one manages to sound more thematically appropriate. Unrelated fun fact: Bowser can spin in his Star Reactor fight. You can counter-spin his spin, and you both get stunned. Neat.

10. Space Junk Road. Probably one of the game’s best musical examples of the game’s overall vibe. Beautiful, quiet, and lonely. Individual, lonely notes  match the vibe of space debris gently floating along.

9. Attack of the Airships. A re-imagining of the airship theme originally from Super Mario Bros 3, Galaxy’s airship theme has since become the new baseline airship theme that games springboard off of. Bowser’s attack scene at the beginning of the game is the game basically shaking the player and saying, “Hey. This game’s gonna take itself a bit more seriously”. That scene ends on a close-up of Peach’s eye is unexpectedly very dramatic for a Mario game. The player remembers that going forward. 

8. To the Gateway. This is the music that plays in the tutorial planet, and purposefully contrasts with the intense scoring of the game’s opening scenes from only seconds prior. Similar to Space Junk Road, is a good tone-setter for the rest of the game. Beautiful, lonely, quiet.

7. Family. The music plays during Super Mario Galaxy’s secret ending. The ending is obtained by collecting all 120 stars as Mario before defeating the final boss again. The music is a lone piano cover of Rosalina’s main theme, which you’ve heard the whole game in the observatory. Once again, it is beautiful, lonely, and quiet. The cutscene ends with a shot of a moss-covered mushroom ship, hard-confirming what most of the audience likely already inferred: that Rosalina is the little girl in the story. 

6. Rosalina’s Observatory (all variants). Again, I like dynamic soundtracks. There are 3 variants of this piece (Is it a waltz? It feels like a waltz). Restoring more and more of the Observatory’s power will cause the next version of the track to play, which essentially adds more instruments to the theme. By the time you finish the game, you’ve got a full orchestra.

5. Luma/Wish. “Luma” is the theme that plays during Rosalina’s story book readings (with some exceptions, such as “The Girl’s Sadness”). “A Wish” is the variant on this theme that plays when >!The universe’s lumas all sacrifice themselves!<. The main theme is composed of what sounds like bells or perhaps xylophones, which the audience can easily associate with childhood, I think. Basically, this song can make you feel nostalgic, even if you’ve never heard it before. Rosalina’s storybook was a large contributor of galaxy’s quiet and slightly sad atmosphere, in my opinion. It’s a big part of what makes this game feel so unique from other Nintendo games, let alone other Mario games. Obviously the >!Luma sacrifice!< scene can be a real gut-wrencher. The game then goes on to talk about the life cycle of stars, planets, and galaxies, making a bit less devastating and slightly more bittersweet. This piece is a key to Galaxy 1’s core identity. 

4. Egg Planet/ Good Egg Galaxy. For the final four pieces on this list, we depart the story-based themes and just move on to iconic ones. Good Egg Galaxy is the first major galaxy you visit, and Nintendo was careful to put a good foot forward here musically. I’d say that the “dials” of beautiful, quiet, lonely have been tweaked here to minimize the sadder sounding elements of the song. They’re still present, but most of the song is a “whoa, cool” vibe to go along with the gravity playground that is the first planet. This theme was probably a contender for Galaxy’s main theme at some point in development. First planet theme, and when Nintendo chose to represent SMG in a racetrack (Rainbow Road, Mario Kart Wii), they had a piece of its main theme in that track’s music (in addition to other, non-music stuff like star bits and launch stars).

3. Floating Fortress/ Buoy Base Galaxy. Definitely an anomaly. Why is one of the most banger tracks in the entire game hidden away in this optional galaxy? As with all water levels, the soundtrack dynamically changes when you go underwater - not unique to this galaxy. What places this piece so high on my list is how unexpectedly grand the music is, and how if you layer the underwater and land themes on top of one another, the combined piece somehow sounds even more massive and imposing than each piece individually.  

2. Super Mario Galaxy (end credits theme). I don’t actually have much to say about this theme. It’s complex, intense, and respectful enough to give an excellent emotional summary to the player’s journey. Probably my favourite end credits theme. 

1. Wind Garden/ Gusty Garden Galaxy. I’m betting many of you knew what #1 would be before reading this. Do I need to explain why this is number one? This is iconic. This piece, paired with the player flying through a galaxy with a blue sky with clouds (as opposed to starry sky) backdrop gives the sensation of flight and the freedom that comes with it. IMO this piece has come to represent flight and freedom in the rest of the Nintendo franchise. I mentioned how Egg Planet may have been a contender for this game’s theme. My theory is that it was, until this piece was composed. And then everybody understood that they had fire in a bottle. The music is so iconic, it has been used countless times in other properties owned by Nintendo. Such examples include: The opening of Galaxy 2 (“A new story”), Grandmaster Galaxy in 2, the Smash Bros. Series, Mario Maker, Mario Party, Mario 3D world’s final level, Mario Kart 8 (cloud top cruise), the Moe-eye enemies in Odyssey hum it, it was even in the movie. And that’s not including spin-offs, like the M&S Olympic series. When videogamedunkey, an avid music and Mario fan and critic of more than 10 years, was trying to describe the freedom and possibilities of Mario Odyssey, what theme did he use? Not a theme from Odyssey. This theme. This theme is the best theme produced by the Mario series. It is a contender for best music produced by Nintendo.

Anyway. This is past Ted-Talk and has barrelled into book-report length. Thanks for reading. 

The point of this post is to spark discussion about Galaxy 1’s music. If you want, feel free to list your fav tracks and what you like about them. If you think my top tracks or my reasoning for them are bad and dumb, lmk why. 

Thanks, everybody."

I can't say that I prefer the all-electric alternatives, maybe some hybrids. Of course I've already ""offset"" my carbon footprint for 100+ years with my investments (no not carbon credits).

If the Earth does hit the fan and I end up with future generations that ask me why I chose this approach to life, I'm not sure what I would answer with.... when they consider if they can safely pass life on to their children? I also ask likely because there is enough owners in the supercar community to consider estate planning and generational wealth.  Do you have a response I could give them?"
