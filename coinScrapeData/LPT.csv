I am new to the Livepeer community, and recently started diving deep into the protocol after learning about plans for expanding into the AI space.  I've read the developer docs, have listened to Doug's various podcasts and blogposts, but have a few questions (unrelated to AI plans) remaining that I can't seem to find answers for.  Would anyone be kind enough to help?

  
Questions

Does Livepeer the protocol support decentralized CDN?  It appears like orchestrators are focused on video transcoding only.  However, Livepeer studio does support delivery and CDNs.  Is this decentralized?  How does this work? 

  
Livepeer token inflation - my understanding is that LPT is inflationary when and if the protocol staking rate is 50%.  I am unable to find info on how the inflation actually changes per round.  There is apparently an inflationChange parameter in the codebase, but I am not able to find its value.  Can anyone point me in the right direction?  What is the actual formula that determines the inflation?

Broadcasting algorithm - how are transcoding tickets allocated among the active orchestrators?  I believe that the alogrithm takes staked LPT into account when determining which orchestrator receives a ticket, but how does this work exactly?

Fees - how are transcoding fees determined?  Is this a competitive market, where each orchestrator is able to somehow advertise their price, and it is as simple as that?

  
Would really appreciate some help on this!"

### Emerging Trends in​ the ‍Cryptocurrency Market Amid Economic Optimism

Altcoins Surge in Response‍ to Positive U.S. Economic IndicatorsOn a recent Friday, the cryptocurrency ​market⁢ saw significant gains, particularly among ​alternative cryptocurrencies, ‌commonly known as altcoins. This uptick was⁤ influenced by a combination of easing geopolitical tensions and an optimistic economic outlook from the United States.

Among these​ altcoins, Bittensor’s tokens associated with its‌ artificial intelligence-focused protocol and Render’s⁢ tokens both experienced notable increases.‌ Bittensor surged by 14%,​ while Render recorded an 8% rise within ​a 24-hour period. This activity greatly contributed to the overall performance of ⁢the CoinDesk Computing Index, which tracks AI-related tokens and emerged ⁢as one of the top performers in this period.

### Investment ⁤Shifts ‌Highlight Confidence in Decentralized⁢ Technologies

In response to these trends, Grayscale,‍ a leading asset management firm, made significant ⁣adjustments within its decentralized ​AI-focused crypto fund. The⁣ firm ‌increased its stake in‍ TAO from 3% to an impressive 27%, while integrating The Graph (GRT) into its portfolio and phasing out Livepeer (LPT). These changes reflect a growing confidence in decentralized solutions driven by innovative technologies.

Bitcoin Maintains Steady Growth​ Amid ⁤Broader Crypto RallyDuring this same time⁣ frame,‍ Bitcoin demonstrated solid ⁤growth during U.S trading hours with it ​climbing to $62,300—a gain of ​2.2% for ‌the day—mirroring broader movements seen across ‌various​ crypto⁣ indexes such as‌ Coindesk’s own benchmark index that rose by 4.2%.

🧣 Il nuovo fondo di Grayscale mira a capitalizzare il settore dell'intelligenza artificiale decentralizzata



🧤 Grayscale Decentralized AI Fund LLC: Una nuova frontiera per la DeFi



🧣 Grayscale ha lanciato un nuovo fondo dedicato alle criptovalute legate all'intelligenza artificiale decentralizzata. Il fondo includerà cinque token: $TAO di Bittensor, $FIL di Filecoin, $LPT di Livepeer, $RNDR di Render e $c di Near Protocol. Questi token rappresentano protocolli che sviluppano servizi AI decentralizzati, affrontano problemi generati dall'AI e offrono infrastrutture critiche come condivisione dati e computazione.



🧤 Scelte discusse e polemiche tra gli appassionati



🧣 Le scelte di Grayscale hanno già suscitato dibattiti, con l'esclusione di progetti come $ASI, $AGIX, $OCEAN e $FET. La composizione del fondo, che sarà ribilanciata trimestralmente, riflette una strategia mirata a protocolli con un potenziale significativo nel settore AI. Tuttavia, alcuni appassionati ritengono che le esclusioni possano limitare la diversificazione e l'efficacia del fondo.



🧤 Impatto del fondo AI di Grayscale e scenari futuri



🧣 Il fondo di Grayscale, disponibile solo per investitori accreditati, rappresenta un passo importante verso l'integrazione delle tecnologie AI nella DeFi. Questo sviluppo potrebbe accelerare l'adozione di criptovalute AI e spingere altre piattaforme a seguire l'esempio di Grayscale. Tuttavia, la scelta dei token e l'esclusione di altri progetti promettenti potrebbero influenzare le dinamiche del mercato e sollevare ulteriori discussioni tra gli investitori e gli appassionati del settore.

"A dormant wallet that spent $30 for 100 ETH in 2015 has sent them to other wallets after 8.5 years; today's value $230,000",ethtrader,1ajdkqq,2024-02-05 05:39:28,28,0.84,35,https://i.redd.it/hzzylyknwqgc1.jpeg,yamaniac123,News,"A dormant Ethereum wallet that hadn't seen any activity since July 2015 sent 100 ETH, worth about $230,159. These 100 ETH were purchased for $30 (the ETH ICO price in 2015). The price per ETH was $0.30 at that time.

The wallet first sent 20 ETH to one wallet and, in a few minutes, sent another 77 ETH to another wallet address. Right now, this wallet holds 3 ETH.

**The wallet address that received 100 Genesis ETH is:** 0x2E8Eb30a716e5fE15C74233E039bfb1106e81D12

**Transaction Hash:** 0xa346196ae27468a66da110f5ed05ccebb1b6e57bf76eb37709a7e9ce90236591

Another similar event happened this week. A dead wallet woke up from the eternal sleep of 8.5 years, with 492.5 ETH worth around $1.1 million.

**This wallet address is:** 0x1ea334b5750807ea74aac5ab8694ec5f28aa77cf

If you carefully check both of these wallets, there's one common crypto available in both of these dormant wallets: Livepeer Network tokens (LPT). 

Both wallets have ~2 LPT worth around $15 each. Maybe LPT opted to send two tokens to ETH ICO participants."
"Apple Vision Pro is setting a trend, and the Metaverse narrative can return in the crypto world during the next bull run; don't ignore the AI and GPU rendering projects",ethtrader,1aivee3,2024-02-04 13:58:18,13,0.67,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1aivee3/apple_vision_pro_is_setting_a_trend_and_the/,coindoing,Sentiment,"You might have seen the videos going viral, where people are wearing Apple Vision Pro headsets and doing tasks such as opening emails, watching videos, replying to social media posts, browsing the internet, and doing more online tasks. Apple launched these Vision Pro headsets two days ago and has been trending on Twitter and Instagram since then.

&#x200B;

[User interacting with Apple's new VR headset](https://preview.redd.it/c39tn2lq7mgc1.jpg?width=4240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da92fe8715a906625b38708db273fe828d49a380)

This is Apple's newest technological advance and a big step forward in hardware. The advancement is now blurring the lines between virtual and real life. It shows what interactive experiences will be like in the future, when digital and real environments will be mixed together to create new ways to engage and interact.

# How can this new trendsetter help the crypto industry?

  
**Apple Vision Pro + Metaverse = more opportunities to open up for users and projects.** People who wear this can explore virtual worlds, interact with virtual objects, and talk to other participants in real time. For blockchain and crypto companies that work in the metaverse, this could be a big step forward. GPU rendering industry can benefit as well.

# MANA (Decentraland) and SAND (Sandbox)

&#x200B;

Both of these crypto projects are known for their unique and competitive metaverse interfaces for gaming and other metaverse-related online events. These metaverse tokens were the main narrative in the last bullmarket cycle. Imagine running around and playing a game on Sandbox Land or Decentraland wearing Apple Vision Pro headsets. This could be a game-changer for these two biggies in the crypto industry.

&#x200B;

[This is what Sandbox tweeted in June 2023](https://preview.redd.it/k0h381h76mgc1.jpg?width=601&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b787c7c1070165c9b63725ecce73e6dd000582b)

# Render Network (RNDR)

Apple Vision Pro is already connected to the Render Network. Apple talked about [Octane X](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/octane-x-classic/id1548355081?mt=12), a GPU rendering feature that can be downloaded from the Mac App Store. Because OTOY is the company that makes both Octane and the RNDR, they are linked. As CEO of OTOY, Jules Urbach created Render Token in 2016 to offer decentralized GPU-based rendering solutions. Now do the calculations, predictions, and some DYOR.

&#x200B;

What other crypto projects can benefit directly or indirectly from the growth of Vision Pro headsets? Including tech and similar VR headsets that will be flooding the market by other tech firms like Samsung, Microsoft, and Facebook's Oculus.

# Any crypto with a 1000X potential on your radar?

&#x200B;

Can we expect more gaming and metaverse projects on the Ethereum Mainnet or Layer 2 networks? I hope you know that the L2 gas fee will be 80% lower than the current gas fee after the Dencun upgrade. Another round of metaverse narration for the next bullrun?

# Bonus: Livepeer Network

I have recently started following Livepeer Network (LPT), they are aggressive on AI and decentralized video rendering service, etc. Please keep an eye on Livepeer. DYOR.

Like the whole package. Whereas Livepeer serves to transcode your video only. So why would anyone choose Livepeer over Theta? Becauee then they would have to need storage services and delivery services too. 
Livepeer is said to be open source whereas Theta is not. You have to go for the whole package is you opt for Theta. Does this mean if a decentralized social media platform chooses Theta for its video services, it will always be like embedding a YouTube video to Facebook for example? I'm wondering why anyone would choose Lpt+Fil over Theta."

So the 2 sudden increases in the last 12 months seen on supply chart are not correct and he also said in a previous post that Livepeer has no VC attachments for the last several years meaning all Lpt is already circulating and there is no lpt left to be unlocked or something.
Lfg! That was a relief to be honest."

I delegated a test amount of LPT to an Orchestrator. I can verify this at My Account > History > Clicking on the Transaction Receipt.
