Whether you‚Äôre looking for an elegant indoor setting or an outdoor wonderland, Las Vegas offers a variety of spaces to create an unforgettable experience for your little one. With the right venue, you can transform your event into a fairy tale come to life. Here‚Äôs a list of top venue ideas for hosting a truly memorable **Las Vegas princess party**.

# 1. Luxurious Banquet Halls

For a grand princess party, a banquet hall provides the perfect setting. These venues are spacious, allowing you to create a royal atmosphere with castle backdrops, chandeliers, and elegant d√©cor.

You can set up areas for activities like a royal ball, interactive storytelling, or craft stations where kids can make their own crowns and wands. The flexibility of these spaces lets you design a party that‚Äôs both magical and sophisticated, making your child feel like true royalty.

# 2. Scenic Parks and Outdoor Spaces

If you‚Äôre looking to take advantage of Las Vegas‚Äô warm weather and sunny skies, a local park or outdoor venue can serve as a picturesque backdrop for a princess party. Many parks feature open spaces perfect for setting up tents, decorations, and activity areas.

Decorate with floral garlands, pastel-colored drapes, and fairy lights to create a whimsical garden theme. Outdoor venues also work well for activities like treasure hunts or princess-themed relay races. The natural beauty of these locations adds an extra layer of charm to your celebration.

# 3. Indoor Play Centers

For a stress-free and weather-proof option, consider hosting your princess party at an indoor play center. These venues are perfect for kids, offering plenty of space for games, crafts, and dancing.

Many indoor centers are equipped with amenities like soft play areas or interactive games, which can be incorporated into your party. With the right decorations, you can turn these spaces into a magical princess kingdom where kids can play and explore to their hearts‚Äô content.

# 4. Garden and Botanical Venues

If you‚Äôre seeking a serene and enchanting atmosphere, garden venues and botanical spaces in Las Vegas are ideal for a princess-themed celebration. These venues naturally evoke a fairy tale vibe, with lush greenery, colorful flowers, and elegant pathways.

Host a royal tea party in the garden or set up an outdoor photo booth with a castle backdrop. Add fairy lights and whimsical d√©cor to enhance the magical feel, creating a setting that looks straight out of a storybook.

# 5. Private Event Rooms

For a more intimate celebration, private event rooms in restaurants or community centers offer a great option. These spaces can be customized to match your princess theme with ease, from table settings to wall decorations.

Private rooms allow for a cozy atmosphere where kids can enjoy activities like storytelling, face painting, or singing along to their favorite princess songs. They‚Äôre perfect for smaller parties or families who prefer a relaxed yet magical setting.

# 6. Pools and Water-Themed Venues

For a unique spin on the traditional princess party, consider hosting your event at a pool or water-themed venue in Las Vegas. This is a perfect choice for a summer celebration or for kids who love water activities.

Add an ocean princess or mermaid theme to tie the venue into the party, with decorations like seashells, aquatic props, and pastel-colored balloons. Organize water-based games or activities like a ‚Äúroyal swim‚Äù to keep the kids entertained while they splash and play.

# 7. Residential and Backyard Parties

Sometimes, the best venue is right in your own backyard. With the right decorations and a little creativity, you can transform your home into a magical castle for your princess party.

Backyard parties are especially great for incorporating outdoor elements like a royal garden, a mini dance floor, or a crafting station. Plus, hosting at home allows you to have full control over the schedule and setup, making it easy to create a personalized experience for your child.

# 8. Themed Event Spaces

Las Vegas is known for its one-of-a-kind themed venues, and some of them are perfect for a princess party. From castle-inspired locations to spaces designed for kids‚Äô parties, these venues offer a ready-made atmosphere that requires minimal decorating.

Themed venues often come equipped with props, furniture, and d√©cor that complement the party‚Äôs fairy tale vibe. This option saves time on setup while still delivering a magical experience for your little one.

# 9. Las Vegas‚Äô Unique Entertainment Venues

Take your princess party to the next level by hosting it at one of Las Vegas‚Äô entertainment-focused venues. Some spaces offer stages or performance areas, perfect for adding live entertainment like a princess performer or musical act.

These venues let you create a larger-than-life celebration that feels like a royal gala. With Las Vegas‚Äô flair for showmanship, your party can truly stand out as a memorable event.

# 10. Hotel Party Suites

For an upscale experience, consider hosting your princess party in a hotel suite or event space. Many Las Vegas hotels offer spacious suites with luxurious amenities, making them a fantastic choice for a royal celebration.

You can decorate the suite with castle-themed elements, set up activity stations, and even use the hotel‚Äôs catering services for a feast fit for royalty. Hosting in a hotel suite adds a touch of luxury that makes the event feel extra special.

# Final Thoughts

Las Vegas offers a variety of venues that are perfect for hosting a magical and unforgettable princess party. Whether you choose a garden setting, a glamorous banquet hall, or a cozy backyard celebration, the key is finding a space that reflects your child‚Äôs dream and brings the fairy tale to life.

With its unique blend of charm and excitement, Las Vegas is the ultimate location for crafting a one-of-a-kind **Las Vegas princess party** that will leave your child and their guests enchanted."

May lalaki na gustong manligaw sa akin pero ang trato niya parang girlfriend niya na ako.

Context:
Yung guy na ito matagal ko nang kilala pero ngayon lang siya umamin sa akin na may gusto siya. Ako naman, na-interesado naman akong masubukan kami. Yung hinahanap ko sa lalaki nasa kanya naman at napansin ko na naghuhulog siya ng mga hints na meron siyang gusto sa akin bago siya umamin. Kaso nga lang, hindi pa naman kami nasa ligawan phase dahil naghahanap ako ng trabaho kasi kagagraduate ko lang, yung trato niya sa akin parang girlfriend na.

Iniisip niya agad yung magiging future namin pero hindi pa kami talaga nagsisimula. Gusto niya agad ako dalhin kung saan saan, pati sa malalayo. Tapos, nung sabi ko sa kanya na ayokong mag-isip parents ko na kami na dahil gusto niya panay gala kahit na kakakita lang namin, sabi niya, ""Bahala na. Mangyayari naman yung magiging tayo"" pero hindi ko naman siya sinasagot pa? Hindi ko pa nga alam kung gusto ko siya maging boyfriend. Sabi ko gusto kong testing lang, tingnan kung compatible kami, kung saan kami mapupunta, at alam naman niya iyon from the start. Yun ang sabi ko, pero parang kala mo kami na. 

Hindi ko maintindihan pero ang bigat talaga sa pakiramdam ko. Minsan talaga di ko na lang siya pinapansin. Parang gusto kong takasan pero alam ko na kailangan kong mag-tapat rin sa kanya eventually about sa nararamdaman ko. Sobra din yung nararamdaman kong guilt dahil sabi ko okay ako na ligawan niya pag stable na ako pero ngayon gusto ko nang mag-back out kasi sobrang na-o-overwhelm ako. Paano ko ba dapat i-approach ito? Kinakabahan talaga ako kasi baka masira yung friendship naman."

so many times over the seasons Tim seems to be open and forthright when he and Lucy are dancing, episode 6 is the valentines episode and they will be at some kind of Gala (LAPD related I guess) I think that is when we will see a more open and vulnerable side of Tim and start to see a lot from his perspective going forward.

I shall attempt to keep this concise. I cannot provide many details as I [M87] am a member of a very powerful and influential family and the CEO of our company.


Not long ago, at a gala to promote an innovative initiative at our company, my daughter ‚ÄúElena‚Äù was scheduled to speak. In attendance was our board, pivotal politicians from which we are seeking support, and myriad other important persons.


Energy was palpable, the atmosphere abuzz, it felt as if we were at the precipice of something truly magnificent. However, as Elena began to address the guests, all crumbled to dust.


Out of her mouth came malice poisoning the audience and eroding the very principles by which she was raised. In just a few sentences our company, our family, our very way of life, all were severed from our aspirations and the promise that could be felt that evening.


Elena was escorted gently from stage to collect herself in the restroom. Although some time had passed when I found her, I was still reeling, inundated with rage. When I spoke all I could muster was a despicable curse I had heard as a child.


Fetid moppet.


I stared into her eyes and declared her a fetid moppet. She tried to plead but I could not bear it and left her.


She has since apologized and attempted to make right her wrongs, however, the damage that has been done is likely irreparable. AIO?"

I don't think The Board knows that _____ is actually _______,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,1i9o8wn,2025-01-25 09:37:01,139,0.94,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1i9o8wn/i_dont_think_the_board_knows_that_is_actually/,helly_r-efined,Theory ,"Let me just start by saying that I‚Äôm not here to convince you that Helly R. is actually Helena‚Äîthere are plenty of posts that already dive into that theory in great detail. So, for the sake of this post, let‚Äôs go with the assumption that Helly is, in fact, Helena.

Now, what I want to explore here is why **I don‚Äôt think The Board knows that Helly R. is Helena, and why I believe Helena is doing this of her own accord, at her own risk...**

**Understanding Lumon‚Äôs Hierarchy**

First, you have to understand Lumon as a corporation and its managerial structure. At the very top is The Board (essentially the ‚ÄúC-suite‚Äù), which I think Jame Eagan is part of. Below The Board is Helena, then higher-ups like Mr. Dummond and Natalie, then managerial employees like Mr. Milchick, and so on. Each descending layer of employees is beholden to their direct superiors, taking orders and reporting only to their immediate supervisor. 

This is why the hierarchy of businesses exists: higher-ups like Helena, Natalie, and Mr. Dummond are there to ensure their direct subordinates are implementing what‚Äôs needed to achieve the C-suite's desired results. The Board, therefore, only cares about results‚Äîthey aren‚Äôt concerned with how those results are achieved. In this case, their primary objective is ensuring Mark S. completes the Cold Harbour file.

This focus on results is why I believe The Board isn‚Äôt involved in figuring out what happened when the OTC was triggered. Instead, it‚Äôs Helena who appears to be handling the situation by directly instructing Mr. Milchick to deal with the MDR outies however he sees fit; *‚ÄúShould I fire them?"",* and Helena replies, *‚ÄúLet the hand of Kier guide you.‚Äù*

This moment is important because it shows that Helena is managing the response to the OTC incident entirely on her own, delegating the responsibility to Milchick. The Board doesn‚Äôt care about this level of detail‚Äîthey trust the chain of command to handle the fallout and report back only on the key outcomes.

There‚Äôs no indication that The Board was directly involved in any of this decision-making. Helena is the one who instructs Milchick to deal with the MDR outies, emphasising how Lumon‚Äôs hierarchy works: The Board stays removed, leaving the implementation to their managers while they just wait to hear of the results. 

**The Board‚Äôs Demands vs. Helena‚Äôs Autonomy**

While Helena has significant autonomy, she is still beholden to The Board‚Äôs demands. For example, when Mr. Dummond says, *‚ÄúIncluding Helly R.,‚Äù* Helena‚Äôs reaction makes it clear that she has no say in this decision and must comply with their instructions, despite it appearing like she doesn't want to. Even if she has authority over her subordinates, The Board still calls the shots on big-picture decisions‚Äîlike ensuring Helly R. is returned to the MDR team so Mark S. will complete the Cold Harbour file.

This obligation is also why any secretive actions Helena makes on her own are so risky. For instance, in Season 1, when Helly attempted suicide, The Board didn‚Äôt even know about it until Milchick informed them later on. This strongly suggests that Helena instructed Mrs. Cobel not to escalate the incident. Helena was managing the situation herself, keeping The Board in the dark.

This shows how Helena uses her position in the hierarchy to exercise control and protect her own interests. However, it also means she‚Äôs willing to take huge risks by withholding information from The Board‚Äîespecially if her decisions could disrupt their goals.

**The Eagan Family Philosophy: Punishment and Control**

The Eagan family views innies as expendable, lesser beings who exist to serve the company (a.k.a - slavery). This mindset also extends to how they treat their own family members. Jame Eagan referring to Helena as a ‚Äúfetid moppet‚Äù reveals the disdain she endures even from her own father. **This insult reinforces how the Eagans view rebellion or failure as something to be scorned and punished, aligning with their broader philosophy of control through suffering.** And this is also evident from Helena's apology video where she is profusely apologetic while being 'publicly' humiliated.

Now, in Season 1, when Helly threatened to cut off her fingers, Helena‚Äôs response is in line with how the Eagan family would react to such a thing, as her video reply was cold and brutal‚Äî*‚ÄúIf you ever do something to my fingers, know that I‚Äôll keep you alive long enough to horribly regret that.‚Äù*

This response demonstrates Helena‚Äôs commitment to the Eagan family philosophy of punishment and suffering as tools of control. Yet, despite this, when Helly actually tried to kill herself‚Äîa far greater rebellion than threatening harm to her fingers‚ÄîHelena hasn‚Äôt appeared to ‚Äúpunish‚Äù her innie in the same way that was threatened. This raises an important question: **Why hasn‚Äôt Helena punished Helly for her suicide attempt yet?**

With the added context of the OTC incident and the gala rebellion, it seems even more likely that the Eagan family‚Äîand Helena herself‚Äîwould want Helly R. to suffer consequences for her actions. Simply keeping Helly alive and active on the severed floor could be seen as a form of punishment in itself. For the Eagans, forcing Helly to continue working under would reinforce their dominance to prevent her from defying them further by showing her she cannot escape their control over her life. 

This also aligns with The Board‚Äôs priorities. To ensure Mark S. completes the Cold Harbour file, The Board has already stated that ""*Helly R.*"" will be returning to work. I think they would agree that the best way to ‚Äúpunish‚Äù Helly is to force her back into the severed floor environment, where she remains under their control, while also ensuring Mark completes his file. 

**Helena‚Äôs Fascination, Jealousy, and Motivation to Go Down as Herself**

Now let‚Äôs talk about Helena‚Äôs emotional reactions to her innie‚Äôs life to explore how they would inform her motivations to return to the severed floor as herself. When Helena watches the video of Helly and Mark, there are two key moments:

1. Helena smirks at the joke her innie makes, recognising/appreciating her own humour.
2. She replays the kiss multiple times and tears up slightly, suggesting she finds it intriguing, even endearing.

This moment is significant because it reveals how Helena views her innie‚Äôs life as an alternate reality‚Äîone where she is freer, more confident, and able to express herself authentically, without the weight of her family‚Äôs expectations.

Helena‚Äôs own life is rigidly controlled, both by her family‚Äôs oppressive influence and her role within the Lumon company. But through her innie, she gets to experience a version of herself that is unshackled from these constraints. Watching her innie joke, kiss, and connect with others provides her a glimpse of a life she has never experienced and will never truly have.

This ‚Äúalternate reality‚Äù is enticing because it allows Helena to explore a version of herself that is entirely separate from the pressures of being an Eagan and a representative of Lumon. Ironically, the severed floor‚Äîdespite its constraints‚Äîbecomes the only place where Helena can experience feeling free. Ultimately, Helena‚Äôs longing and curiosity drive her to make the deliberate choice to assume Helly‚Äôs role on the severed floor.

**This is easy to do without The Board's knowledge as Helena‚Äôs higher position in Lumon‚Äôs managerial hierarchy grants her significant authority over the severed floor. This is evident in how Milchick‚Äîand previously Mrs. Cobel‚Äîtake direct instructions from her. With this level of control, Helena has the ability to instruct Milchick or security to bypass activating her chip, enabling her to step into Helly‚Äôs role seamlessly. While this decision could be framed as a tactical move to gather intel, it seems far more likely that it‚Äôs driven by her own personal intrigue, jealousy, and a longing to experience this alternate life for herself.**

And her jealousy may explain why Helena would want to withhold Helly‚Äôs autonomy. If The Board is forcing her to send Helly R. back to the MDR team, Helena might think, '*Fine, but I‚Äôm not going to give my innie her life back just like that when I don't get to experience any of those freedoms and joys for myself'.* Instead, she could use her authority over Milchick and the severed floor to manipulate the situation in her favour, like she did by hiding her innie's suicide attempt, possibly framing it to Milchick as a tactical decision to gather intel while secretly acting out of intrigue.

**What Happens From Here?** 

I think the MDR team will eventually figure out that Helena isn‚Äôt really Helly‚Äîperhaps because she struggles to complete even 1% of her file, as we‚Äôve only seen innies work on the MDR files. **This realisation would almost certainly prompt Mark S. to demand his real friend and co-worker back, yet again.**

The Board has already promised Mark his team, ‚Äúincluding Helly R.,‚Äù to ensure he completes the Cold Harbour file. If Helena‚Äôs deception disrupts his progress, The Board might find out and intervene, demanding the real Helly to return, and potentially leading to furious backlash against Helena (perhaps another ‚Äúfetid moppet‚Äù moment?) for delaying their primary goal.

**This discovery could also tie directly into the trailer scene where the elevator doors open, and Helly somewhat sheepishly says, ‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù‚Äîa moment that may show the real Helly waking up for the first time since the gala incident, with her tightly closed fists suggesting both confusion and physical frustration.**

If this theory is right, I wonder whether Helena will face consequences for her decisions? What private repercussions might she have already faced for hiding the suicide attempt from The Board, and what might happen if The Board discovers she pretended to be her innie?"

But one unexpected moment stood out among the glitz and glamour.

When a journalist attempted to provoke Melania Trump with a confrontational question about her time as First Lady, her son, Barron Trump, stepped in with quiet strength and remarkable maturity. In a calm but firm voice, Barron defended his mother, calling out the opportunism of the journalist and protecting her right to focus on art and culture, not public scrutiny.

Watch as Barron‚Äôs composed yet powerful defense receives an overwhelming wave of support from the room, and social media erupts with praise for his courage. A young man‚Äôs voice emerges as a beacon of respect, standing up for his mother with poise and dignity in a moment that will be remembered by all.

Questions after probably my tenth read through,redrising,1i9mku5,2025-01-25 08:08:03,1,1.0,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/redrising/comments/1i9mku5/questions_after_probably_my_tenth_read_through/,thisISSmax,All Spoilers,"Love this series. Here are my lingering questions throughout the books. Thoughts?

Red Rising: Roque quotes ""blood begets blood"" after the passage, but gets Lorn quotes wrong in GS, and misattributed Lorn's quotes. It's established that Roque love stories of Gold heros. Why does he get these quotes wrong? Wouldn't he know the quotes and who said them perfectly?

Golden Son: Darrow forces Lorn's hand in joining the war by setting Lorn a counter trap die to Plin betraying the team. Why did Nero raiding Ganamyde not have a counter trap?

Golden Son: When Darrow's team announces the key enemies before the rain on Mars,, they use ""imperator"" title for Tiberius. Why? They don't use titles for any of the other enemies. 

Golden Son: Quinn's death. Why does Roque blame Darrow so fervently ? Mustang brought her back, and she definitely does in the hot springs without Darrow, but he saved her and the whole team from that situation and gave her a chance.

Golden Son: During the rain, Cassius just knew Darrow's plan to come in through the grate to capture the sovereign in Agea? Cassius knew Darrow knew the sovereign was in Agea ahead of time? How?

Morning Star: Darrow offers the Rim lords the identities of the Sons of the Rim before playing his nuclear weapons gambit. Why? The nuclear weapons argument was more convincing. He could have saved the sons and not mentioned them, or at least mentioned them after the nuke stuff.

Morning Star: During Victra and Servos wedding. Clown bows to cut in and dance with pebble. Howler rule 1?! Not egregious haha but still 

Morning Star: During the final gambit, Darrow asks Orion to let the ship leave that will have Cassius on it. Why not tell her the whole plan? Orion could disobey and shoot it down, or exigent circumstances could confuse the situation and Orion might think the ship should t be allowed to leave for whatever reason. If he can't trust Orion, it's all over anyway. 

Morning Star: The Jackyl is so set on getting his father's approval, and snaps when his father says he doesn't have a son. Why wouldn't the Jackyl have told his father about Darrow before he breaks down the Gala? He told Roque. And his father might have actually been impressed and helped Adrius. That might have been a turning point for the relationship.

Iron Gold: In the beginning, Dancer is insanely trusting of Bellona and the society Golds peace offering. Seems out of character. 

Irong Gold: Tongueless. Why not give him a pen a paper to write out what happened? Maybe he knew about the upcoming Volsong Fa plot? He is a cultured obsidian. Reminds me of the Fear Knight's inner circle. 

Iron Gold: When Eph steals the kids, he seems to not immediately recognize Kavax. Just says he's a large gold with a red beard. But then Eph recognizes him the second time he sees Kavax. Hard to imagine he wouldn't recognize Kavax immediately due to Kavax's popularity and Eph's diligent research.

Dark Age: Pytha says ""bloody"" a lot. Curious Lysander never brings it up.

Dark Age: Why did Screw not warn of Atalantia attacking Mercury? I know we've discussed this here a lot, but it's very bizarre.

Dark Age: Virginia  conducts human testing on Duke of hands. She doesn't know how the memory download will impact the Duke, and seems flippant about it. Feels inconsistent with her showing him the compassion of letting him tell his dark origins story and saying it would be immoral for her to ""take that from him"".

LB: Cicero au Votum is very different from DA to LB. 

LB: the scene before Virginia meets Pax at the blue school is super interesting.Virginia and Kavax's conversation about Virginia's source for counter intelligence information begs so many questions. Who is the source? Clone? Fear Knight?"

AITA for Telling My Sister Her Wedding Was Boring?,AITAH,1i9limg,2025-01-25 07:02:33,3,0.58,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i9limg/aita_for_telling_my_sister_her_wedding_was_boring/,SharonDream,,"So, my (27M) sister (30F) had her wedding last weekend. It was an all-day event, super formal, with a no-kids policy and a strict black-tie dress code. The venue was beautiful, the food was fine, and everything ran smoothly‚Äîbut here‚Äôs the thing. It felt so... lifeless.

No dancing until after 9 PM, a string quartet playing all night (no DJ or band), and the vibe was more like a corporate gala than a celebration of love. People mostly just sat at their tables sipping wine and making awkward small talk. I tried to liven things up, but it felt like stepping on eggshells. Even her closest friends seemed bored.

When we caught up the day after, she asked what I thought of the wedding. I gently said it was beautiful but felt a little too formal, and I think people were expecting something a bit more lively or fun. She got super offended and said it was her dream wedding and that I was being rude for criticizing it.

Now the family group chat is divided. Some agree with me but say I shouldn‚Äôt have said anything, and others think I‚Äôm completely out of line. I thought honesty was the way to go, but now I‚Äôm wondering: AITA for saying her wedding lacked a fun vibe?"

Wayback in high school I‚Äôm really not interested to be in a relationship. May nagkacrush naman sakin and paramdam but at that time I think I‚Äôm a bit immature pa and aside sa bawal pa ako magBF hindi ko talaga siya priority. Study first din ako and being with my friends sa school is enough for me. Hanggang crush lang talaga ko that time. 

Also, maybe because I received so much love from my parents and friends to the point na I don‚Äôt seek love to anyone because I feel that I don‚Äôt need it that time. But now that I‚Äôm already graduating in college, naiinggit na ko to my friends because most of them already have BF na and I‚Äôm left alone lmao. Out of boredom, I even tried bumble na but I think I won‚Äôt find any decent guy there, nagiipon lang ako ng kamatch pero hindi ko minemessage then uninstall it again coz nakakatamad magpakilala? Wala rin talaga kong nakausap na umabot ng week haha, sometimes boring yung makakausap (no sense of humor/lacks emotional intelligence) and they are just there for fun and other ‚Äúthings‚Äù that I don‚Äôt want.

I know 22 is young pa naman para problemahin ko ang lovelife but nakakainggit lang if my friends will talk about their lovelife and I can‚Äôt relate. Gusto ko lang din maexperience kiligin. Idk what‚Äôs wrong with me pero hindi kasi ako marunong lumandi in person lol. I don‚Äôt even have guy friends and I‚Äôm not close to my guy classmates. I have my standards but I just want someone decent, kind, respectful, responsible, have emotional intelligence, have a sense of humor, family-oriented, God-fearing‚Äîbasically, someone with all the good qualities in a man, haha. This is why it‚Äôs hard to find‚Ä¶

I think online dating is not for me, hindi rin ako para makipagmeet-up agad to someone I don‚Äôt even know and I don‚Äôt trust people easily, especially online. I‚Äôm kinda introvert, very lowkey person even in socmed, and taong-bahay lang din but when I‚Äôm with people that are close to me, I‚Äôm a bit extrovert. I also prefer na in person ko makikilala and not online, but paano naman ako makakahanap if hindi me gala lol. Pwede ba may bumangga na lang sakin habang naglalakad and sabay naming hahawakan bag kong nalaglag then magkakatitigan kami mga ganong level sana, kidding. I just want someone to talk to about my daily ganaps in life, who will listen to my rants, and who is fun to talk to kasi lagi na lang sa friends ko hahaha. I know hindi ko dapat madaliin but naiinip na po ako huhu."
