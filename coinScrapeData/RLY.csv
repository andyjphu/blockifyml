I need help figuring out the meaning of my war dream,Dreams,1i3kq3m,2025-01-17 11:48:21,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1i3kq3m/i_need_help_figuring_out_the_meaning_of_my_war/,Careless-End1596,Long Dream,"I rly don’t know how to feel about it and had to miss work cause of it I didn’t and still don’t feel like myself, I was in a war, it felt like ww2 cause I’m almost completely certain the enemy where Axis forces but it didn’t feel like that time period, I was commanding a squadron of about 10 men in a ruined city I wasn’t able to make out completely but it wasn’t American (where I live) we where patrolling checking in on sniper positions our forces had set up, we came up to a building with a sniper that had not checked in for a long while as we clear each room and move up the stairs I remember leading and seeing dried blood underneath a door, we burst through only to be shushed  by a young spotter (the poor kid had to be like 16-17) who had taken over the sniper position with the older sniper lied dead next to him, the kid was visibly shaken and distressed and wouldn’t take his eye off the scope. Me and one of my squad mates tried calming him down and eventually we forced him off the scope where I took a look through and I could feel my stomach drop as a massive army was moving towards us, trying to find the old snipers cause of death was irrelevant to me as there was a huge army moving towards us. I sit there for a while and signal my squad mate to get everyone to rally up near us, once everyone was in the room I explained our situation, there was a long period of silence before I broke it radioing into command explaining the situation, they said backup was three hours out because they weren’t expecting a move on this city we where one of three squads patrolling, I don’t think we had a vehicle cause my only thought was we need to hunker down, guard our position and try to hold out for reinforcements, I radioed command again saying we probably wouldn’t make it telling them to take care of our family’s and let the kids family know that he died a hero and not that he died in a one sided slaughter, my team was terrified but they listened to orders, I stayed with the kid staring down the scope at the oncoming army, I got a sinking feeling bht tried to push it aside cause I knew everything was about to go sideways. And then I see the army begin to shoot at something and I hear the screams of allies as they get cut down by tank turrets and machine gun fire. Eventually they reach our position and we try to keep quiet but they already knew we where here as they begin shooting the building bullets rain through the walls as we try desperately to defend I hear my teams bodies hit the ground and as I turn to the kid to tell him to hide a high caliber round shoots through his head making it partially explode blood and grey matter splattering all over me and the room I drop the sniper and grab my machine gun and stare at the door trying to stay near the middle of the room away from sight of the window as I try to radio command my dream ends and I woke up in like a clam/panicked state. In my dream I didn’t recognize anyone in my team and I swear I could feel everything, I still remember it vividly. I’m on medications and I have had vivid dreams before but never anything this bad "

I went 4-4 with this at top∼100 a couple days ago so it is surely the nuts (and not just a worse version of both regular deathwing rogue, every other pirate rogue including the next deck).

The idea is our dragons are tradeable so they arent complete bricks, protodrakes are 2 dragons in one draw, and we can gear shift the deathwing to unbrick. Its still a lot of slots so you have to give up a lot of good cards but its a fun gimmick. Could easily go 40 cards with how much draw is available (just add 2 preps, 2 distributors, 2 bone spikes, raiding party and 2 dubious purchase)

[Spacerock Pirate Rogue](https://preview.redd.it/c6v0n03qb9de1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a024163b0255ca46778eb51d7c87b9dae060901)

AAEBAYO6AgKRvAL2nwQO9bsC3voCu64D6bAD890D958EiskE9d0E16MFv/cF/KUG/KgG6uUGnesGAAA=

Same concept but we use spacerock instead. Its less of an instant swing turn but its much much more sticky and utilizes the deathrattle gaining/activating much better since its not just one or two hand vomits, but waves and waves of rocks. Even the 8 drops themselves are playable as you have coins, preps and bone spikes to get them out, its just so much meat on an otherwise light deck and makes it possible to grind out slower decks.

Im 3-1 with this so confirmed meta breaker (ignore the fact pirate rogue already has a rly good combo in hooktusk that also naturally hard counters making big spacerocks)

[Oracle 5 Cold Bloods](https://preview.redd.it/blkfs9uub9de1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=35f818adc60781dbfe4a7826f8ad1e106e89c518)

AAEBAaIHBMygBZG8Aq3FBvsPDfylBu4GmtsEiskE16MF1AXqxAbk6gaMAvTdBPPdA/yoBumwAwAA

Ok this is just a freak amalgamation of garrote and the regular windfury pirate rogue, but it makes sense to me. Every spell is a way to draw/make more cold bloods and oracle draws them all. Its a lot of mana to setup but should do the combo more consistently than the regular list

[All In Smokescreen](https://preview.redd.it/gnnwyztyb9de1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fc6d2e4a932062be8a3c82eeb5f9e7ee4783ac8)

AAEBAaIHBqbwAufdA5oU9qMGn7AC3bkGDOfhAvO7A53rBqzUA976Ar2ABP2sBNW2BPTdBMTHBaztBNSVBQAA

Ive seen this deck here and there but with the release of spacerock i think its time to drop all the backup plans like kobold illusionist, masked reveler or anka and make the smokescreen as juicy as possible. You cannot win without highrolling smokescreen anyway unless you que into a control deck that folds to the raw amount of big minions in the deck, and in that case you dont need the 5 and 6 drops anyway.

Im like 5-5 with a similar list. Flesh behemoth requires hand space so so it can be awkward as a lot of the time youre smokescreening with a crammed hand (dragonlord can save you though by making handspace), but cheating out exactly anubarak or the dragons seems very nice.

Another deck trying to *abuse* ethereal oracle, by tutoring the relics and mana burns. All the cards that serve to play multiple relics also work really well with mana burn. You can even setup a vargoth and mana burn the opponent turn after turn basically de-ramping them by 4.

Polkelt gets you xymox (and just in time for it to get infused) and sets up for relic of dimensions hitting bigger cards as most of the deck is low curve (relic vault+the relic of dimensions hitting free 4 drops, including vargoth to recast it and dig deeper into the deck looks very sexy) Also polkelt puts mana burns on the bottom of your deck so finley becomes 3 mana: burn 5 of your opponents mana, perfect when paired with cheese or relic of phantasms

A lot of greed could be added, like bran, zola, zai, zihi, jotun but its likely all unecessary even though you could have infinite value.

Theres just enough damage spells to bloat this deck to 40 cards. If fetch hits the oracle you should be good on gas. Stag Charge has a 1/3 chance to get you 8 dmg with the weapon on top of being otherwise decent tempo and a quest proc. Rexxars gift into quick shot is a lot of fuel once you run out of cards (assuming you arent bricked by baku)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

[40 Gallon QL Hunter](https://preview.redd.it/q3cmrtjec9de1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd97b947dfb24d4cf9516c0d067131cf995dccd4)

The 2 mana cards are very tempting so might be worth giving up baku. Ten gallon hat draws practically your whole deck by hitting oracles, even though its a lot of mana along the way to do so. Dragonbane shot and conjured arrow also make sure you dont run out of spells to play, so youll probably hit fatigue before your hand goes completely dry

Same idea but highlander so youre tutoring out all the no duplicate payoffs with the ten gallon hat, and theres just enough damage spells to fill out the deck. I ran into someone a while ago playing this but he had a messmaker and a hollow hound somewhere in there.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

[40 Quelthalas Hunter](https://preview.redd.it/gwy80h4nc9de1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebebc07a407cccdc18daec91e938fbc824607725)

Surely space pirate is what this deck was missing. We play hope of quelthalas as early as possible and try to swing with it every turn, using air guitarist and hoard pillager for extra durability. The beast package and polkelt all get you hollow hound which is the biggest handbuff payoff, and always a bigger jormungand makes it a good finisher as your opponent should already be softened up from eating 4 dmg attacks every turn.

Now that i look at the list Ethereal Oracle could go in since it tutors all the hollow hound synergy but it would need something like snake oil salesmans to have enough stuff for the spellburst

[40 Deathrattle Hunter](https://preview.redd.it/ha84ae7rc9de1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=80c13f5e61096717c721f0ab2cdbfa352b4394b8)

Maybe with extraterrestrial egg we've reached critical mass and this this type of egg hunter can return.

Buzzard, Observer of Myths and Hope of Quelthalas can all buff your eggs, the 4 cost spells all utilize wide boards

Spawn of nzoth was always fun in these kinds of decks but its too slow these days

Same idea but highlander. Theres Gorm the Worldeater, Shando Wildclaw and Tundra Rhino in etc for the dream combo. You can also shando for 2 king crushes at 10 mana, copy a kraken or lion, or just throw it out for the deck buff.

Reflecto Engineer, on top of being tech for drakkah/alex rogue, also pre-pops all the eggs in our hand, buffs theldurin to 4 attack, and makes our Spurfang a mightly 5/2!

AAEBAa0GAvWYBtfSBg7OwAbyDIqjBPv4BdIKiaME0QqR5AOWoAbz4QaGgwX44Qb74wO7uAUAAA==

Ill take any chance to put Rally! into a hearthstone deck. Here it can res an anchorite and hidden gem for an instantly snowballing half stealthed board. The cheap mass heals can be used for cycle on clergy, clear with Shadowtouched Kvaldir or board buff with Anchorite (it is symmetrical but unless youre in the mirror it shouldnt matter much since youll use the hp buff for lethal very quickly anyway)

Another deck where we hope to get carried by orbital halo.

 With 2 slots left in the deck i realized theres a good spread of holy and shadow spells so lightmaw netherdrake should be active most of the time, and i doubt the opponent will ever play around it.

Augmented Elekk (+bran and felosophy) lets us fill our deck with parachutes and we can convert that to damage using Mindbender and or Lions Frenzy. Bran and Gaslight ramp up the mindbender damage, and the elekk can be used to refill your deck using glides and the gaslight (also dispose evidence). Feast of souls is another way to draw a ton of cards on the combo turns and shouldnt be too hard to cycle otherwise.

I chose 40 cards so the 5 bad cards i added are 1/8 of the deck and not 1/6 so it should only make the regular quest stuff more consistent on top of free 10hp

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

[40 Holotechnician Aluneth Mage](https://preview.redd.it/pbe5ameid9de1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=26782d7220904f1854e04fe459e8666c2a0757fd)

Another attempt at Aluneth Kiljaeden mage. I posted something very similar last time but the overplanner aluneth synergy is too cute not to share, and should make 40 cards still very consistent. Rats give you a chance vs combo, they work well with holotechnician clears and can give you a sleetskater target if your opponent tries to play around it after seeing masadune drop.

Could slot in devolving missiles or something like cult neophyte

Back to my attempts to make a space pirate metabreaker. Theres crystology and instrument tech to tutor the horns. Paly control tools are good so this deck should work, but you will get farmed by hostage mage and combo decks like any other slow deck without disruption.

Could add solemn vigil, service bell, maki roll, and other big minions like kologarn

(this code wont work for me for some reason, probably chirurgeon having both core and caverns copies both of which tend to brick the codes. If someone can make a working code please post in comments so i can edit it in)

I messed around with this concept a lot when pirate dh was everywhere, XL shadow priest with spirit lashes and the 2 mana spells to discover them,+ street tricksters, thalnos and talented arcanists. Vs aggro id just assemble the 3 dmg spirit lash and instawin, and otherwise its a scuffed shadow priest with some extra burn. Now we have Ethereal Oracle which is basically the perfect card for the deck, so we drop the bad discover and spell damage cards and have it as a small package in whats already the best deck in the format.

Pip makes sense to utilize the street trickster better, and also works with mixologist, griftah, the grub, and narain to dupe fortunes if you hit a 1 drop. In theory you can play like control vs aggro, aggro vs combo, and combo vs control and have the perfect deck. Its ambitious but basically cannot fail, you can put almost anything in xl shadow priest and it'll work

AAEBAZ8FCI7TAuWwBNYR+NICh60DorMG1RPdCgvLzQOS1ATA/QLVrASWlgaL+AOD3gPO6wPA4gTPhgPt0gIAAA==

This has been a pet deck of mine for a long time, and my main seedlock farming deck, I have like 200 games with the deck, around 50%wr including games before order in the court buff

Over time i slowly cut clears for draw in exodia paly and ended up with this. Youre all in on drawing order in the court, after that your deck is stacked to get your whole otk and time outs to set it up.

The main weakness of exodia paly has always been having to spend a turn playing uther, so you need either a wave of apathy or enough clears to exhaust all the threats of board based decks. In this list we circumvent that by having emperor+time out into uther time out setup by order in the court. So we can give up on board clears completely and go all in on cheesing games with the highroll

You can either go noz on t3/4 into the emperor time out, uther time out, call to arms setup, OR you go emperor on t4/5 into noz time out, uther time out, call to arms if you get order in the court and enough draws to dig into the cards that need to be hit by discounts You can also just instantly drop uther so dont tunnel vision on the setup

Vs aggro you need to hit the OITC and hope they dont have a good opener, vs control just hope you dodge disruption (the 2 drops are hidden in deck so dirty rat usually does nothing unless they drop it early and hit a noz) and vs combo you can actually outrace them a lot of the time since emperor on 4/5 is gg if you see the next turn.

And stuff like seedlock and miracle rogue were very good matchups but i see very few of them these days so this decks niche is basically dead and theres no reason to not just play it as a normal control deck stacked with play control tools and 40hp. Libram paly should be a good matchup too but it depends on how many rebukes/cold feets theyre playing at your mmr (even then wave of apathy can buy you a turn post uther)

The first couple games with this are tricky since youre setting up the otk as early as the mulligan when you see an order in the court in it (decktracker is very helpful). But after you get a hang of how many draws and discounts are needed its the perfect autopilot deck while watching youtube

There was lots of deathrattle synergy in perils in paradise, and now we got space pirate to get skull out earlier. I started brainstorming regular cubelock but realized theres not much reason to not go reno.

Stratagem works very nicely with malchezaars imp and tiny knight of evil, but it does need more demons to be worth it. Voidwalker having taunt is actually a downside as your aggro opponent will always clear it, but spirit jailer can get disrespected and leave you with a body for buffs (and the 4 healing is actually relevant since this deck can draw a ton, especially with clumsy steward)

Ive been looking for a place where felwing+felosophy makes sense and this is as much synergy as you can get. Felosophy can also set up some nice turns with multiple imps or tiny knights.

The 2 32 draenei that adds 3 temporary ones to hand could be interesting for juicing up imp and tiny knight, and kiljaeden in a zoo deck with stratagem is a rly nice alternate wincon but here it interferes with discards too much. I tried to build a fully demon based zoolock that has it as scam top end but theres not much you can do in that shell without hitting your face too much in a shadow priest meta"

Meditation: A Simple Honesty Beyond Methods and Routines Acharya Ji's Column in The Sunday Guardian ,AcharyaPrashant_AP,1hjws1t,2024-12-22 06:31:39,12,1.0,0,https://i.redd.it/onvughalyd8e1.jpeg,JagatShahi,,"""Meditation is not about sitting with closed eyes for fifteen minutes every morning. It is about being aware every moment. You cannot schedule awareness. You cannot say, ‘I will meditate for twenty minutes and then go back to living a chaotic, unconscious life.’ True meditation means you are fully observant in everything you do—whether you are studying, working, or just sitting silently. Meditation is not something you do at a particular time of day; it is about the quality of your whole life, your being itself.""

Why do these matches take so long we have three times their kill?,DeadlockTheGame,1fn9ls9,2024-09-22 21:55:06,0,0.27,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1fn9ls9/why_do_these_matches_take_so_long_we_have_three/,Extreme_Tax405,Question,"Me and my friend.

We check our match histories: there are literally people with zero objective damage lol.

A lot of people seem to treat this like a free for all shooter.

Our last match we were literally in the base 2v4 ending the game while two enemies never based and the rest of our team was in base, or in the jungle lol.

How do you deal with this effectively? Typing or pinging doesn't rly rally them, and often times some of these people actually have a ton of kills. 

What are your personal tips to deal with people who don't play to win the game or don't realiae objectives are important?

When im solo unusually glue myself to my strongest teammate if they never group bc at least then im certain they are with me."

I just found this community & it's SO amazing. You guys are so nice and just....wow. I saw a post about someone asking if their drinking problem was outted and it had me wanting to share something that's been in my head for 3 years now. Since it has to do with SA, I'm putting the details under a spoiler & I marked this as NSFW. I'll try to keep it brief. I just want to get this off of my chest & I haven't found a community online that I felt wouldn't rly judge me. Or maybe I'm being the idiot here worrying that I'll be judged lol

>!I'm in a relationship with a guy (we're both male, i'm in 30s and he's late 20s) and we've been together for 10 years now. This happened 3 years ago. My drinking got really bad during covid, down to having a seizure while withdrawing. My partner was there when it happened and called the ambulance. That was beginning of 2020. At the end of 2021, I was doing a lot better but still had some moments where I'd go back to sneaking alcohol. I did this on New Year's Eve at my family's house. I wasn't wasted or anything, but he caught me. !<

>!Years ago I opened up to him about SA that happened to me in 5th grade. I told him in confidence & had never told this to anyone else. So of course this is playing a part in my drinking, obviously. I had only recently started seeing a new therapist and started seeing a psychiatrist around that time. So, that night he caught me and went into the kitchen. It was just my mom, him & me awake at the time. She knew I was having issues with drinking but since I don't live with her, she didn't know how bad it had been. So he felt the need to tell her I was sneaking drinking (which didn't hurt me--if anything that was probably the best place to stop) and then he pointed at me and told me to tell her ""why"" or else he would. He told me to tell her what happened when I was a kid. I was floored at the time and didn't know what to do so I told my mom what happened to me. I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready to handle how *she* would take it. !<

>!My mom deflected at the end of the conversation and asked why he would just blurt this out. I said because it was weighing on him. I've tried telling him in recent years how much I felt like this was a breach of trust. All he says to me is that because my mom supports Trump (me + my family is white, he is black...he and I are completely anti-Trump so yes this causes a lot of friction but I'm grateful she's a soft supporter and not like going to rallies or even getting out to vote but that's neither here nor there lol) & because he's a nasty person and that's what she supports, he should be allowed to be like that...but that's a whole other convo!<"

Good morning everyone. Big time judgement day for TSLA. Even the consensus estimate.

62 cent earnings \[33% drop\]

24.74 Billion Sales \[1% drop\]

Is actually very very bad!

This is a company that now has a multiple of over 100! Earnings are expected to be about 2.50 for the year!

Full year sales are expected to grow 3-5%

Full year earnings are expected to be down near 20%

Why the hell is the stock flying?

Elon Musk! Speculation. He is a pumper.

These are facts the numbers above, by all means look it up.

If you want to have a 100x PE at least grow sales at 10% and earnings at 10%? WTF come on!

CELH now has near a 40x

48 / 1.20

CELH last report grew sales at 40%, earnings at over 100% \[13 cents to 27 cents\]

These are facts!

NVDA grew sales at 262% and earnings at 500% PE near 60

SMCI grew sales at 200% and earnings near 100% PE near 40 with sell off

NFLX grew sales at 16% and earnings near 50% PE near 45

I want you to see these companies that are executing but have a far lower multiple. TSLA makes 0 sense here!

With sales expected up 3-5% and earnings down 20%. This should have at most a fair value around 35x.

2.50 x 35 = 85-90 fair value, I can even say it should be 75 with a 30x!!!

I do not pull numbers from the sky like most analysts and even money managers. Cathie Wood says 2,600. Where the fuk is this number coming from? Other analysts are saying 400-500 by end of next year. WTF? Using numbers/math please tell me how you arrive at this…. Or just say you are guessing. WTF! So dumb! Make it make sense!

I agree after 2020, a lot of things don’t make sense but come on!

I expect TSLA to come in around the 62 cents bottom line. I see sales down 5% as I see deliveries that were down 5%, and it ran from 205 to 270! On horrible deliveries down 5%

Fake pump by CEO for 8/8 taxis that is delayed again!

I do have puts 8/16 with 185 strike, I may actually make money! As I wrote, even analysts expect bad earnings, what kind of lies Musk will spew today.. Who knows! How these analysts spin it.. Who knows?? But the actual numbers and execution will be bad..

100%

Want to impress me?

Growth in earnings and sales 10% each

Even BILL which has been getting trashed has a 20% growth in sales and earnings.

BILL will make near 2.25 a share

53 / 2.25 It now has a 23X pe ratio for a tech company..

Is TLSA a tech company? Margin last quarter was 5.5%!!! That is very close to TM which is pathetic. Let us see!

 

I sold ZIM 17.50 was in 16.75, I sold PYPL 59.90 was in 58.90…. I bought CAR 101.50 and sold 104. I am doing my best to trade as careful as possible. Since the 3^(rd) quarter of 2023, numbers have gotten better. \[Earnings/Sales\] but we have expanded way to far, way to soon. With the data now, I do not see that we will crash, but a 10% correction does seem about right… numbers can change! Pay attention to sales and earnings on the SP500 SPY VOO.

PHM had an excellent report, 90, anything over 90, it is a home builder, it is already on #Plays.

GM is on Plays and sadly I last traded it mid 30s. It would have been great to keep trading it this high. Sales and earnings at GM are up big time… not like TSLA !!! I do not want to get caught holding the bag if we do correct. No one controls the market, it is a live auction with daily sentiment.. Everyone is very bullish, just afraid of the rug pull. I do expect good earnings overall but growth near 6% while analysts model 11%... If we get 6% it doesn’t mean we sell off… it means what does the market think? Analysts wrong again do we correct? I do not control the market. August 1^(st), I will check the sales and earnings growth thru July to the best of my ability.

 

5 Trade Ideas:

CAR ZIM PYPL – I have been trading these 3 horses. I have 100 shares of CAR still at 115. But with all the few dollars I have made on CAR , I would say I have made at least 125 dollars. 12,000+ my initial investment was about 12,000. I have been trading CAR since February, earnings mediocre, it is 1 of the few plays I have done well because the stock is cheap, not great earnings like ACMR … ZIM I expect monster earnings, PYPL ok earnings and I have traded it a good amount

 

CELH – I have 2 blocks 49 and 53.60, I would like to make 1 dollar on the 49 or maybe 75 cents if I have to, I have 250 shares

 

OSCR – It did fall back to 15.25 but I bidded 15.10, they are coming off monster earnings

 

SMCI – I may bid on calls, especially if 750, I have MU shares 100 at 120, AI and CHIPS came down hard last week, I actually did bid on SMCI last week, it fell to 775 and went back to 830

 

TSLA – If this rallies 260 or close I may bid on more puts, if not I will wait on mines, I know earnings will be bad but don’t know how they will spin it

Character Design Discussion: Miya,MobileLegendsGame,1cthb9c,2024-05-16 12:41:01,40,0.95,11,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1cthb9c,Tea7ay_,Discussion,"*The aim of this post is to get people to share their thoughts on the design and story aspects of Heros in MLBB* 

*If this post does well I will make more in the near future* 

Miya is the Moon priestess for the elves as well as an archer and leader. 

She rallies the elves behind her in order to protect their homeland from the invasion of the abyss who are using the orcs as foot soldiers. 

Right off the bat I love her posture and shape language. Her clothes being emphasised towards the top of her body while fanning out at the top and then proceeding to flow down into the cape gives her a sense of agility and sleekness. The flared shoulder pads and collar do give me bird like motifs which tie into the feathers found in her hair ornament and pants however, I don’t rly know what the feathers are meant to symbolise or reference. The hair shape following the shape of the cape further emphasises the sleekness that an archer should have and the little half moon details scattered all over being back the moon priestess concept. I also like that the cape is separated into three parts as a hint towards her 3 arrow shot and they 2 silhouettes that appear beside her when she gets her stacks up. I do think the belly window is not very archer like. I much prefer the corset she shows in skins like [*Jungle Ranger*](https://www.deviantart.com/monxiomon/art/Miya-Jungle-Ranger-ML-Mobile-Legends-969833931) 

Her headband/tiara stands out to me though. If it is a tiara it tells us a lot about her. Firstly it shows us that the person we are looking at is someone of authority which hints at her being the moon priestess as well as a leader to the elves. The fact that it is subtle though makes sense for her archer concept as she would not want to draw attention to herself while she hides and waits for the enemy to come within range, it can also be interpreted as her being down to earth, crowns are symbols of lordship and authority, by her tiara being so small it shows that she is humble and maybe doesn’t want to stand out when compared to the average elf. She priorities the people over herself as she values them just as much if not more than she values herself. 

Another part of her design is her pants. I am so grateful that she wears pants as it fits what she would need on a day to day. They provide a wide range on movement while also slightly protecting her from stray branches or rough bark as she climbs through the underbrush and trees. They could have easily given her shorts and wrote it off as fan service but the conscious decision to giver her pants makes me grateful. The brown accents on the belt and boots also add to grounding her as an individual. 

 The heels however… well I can’t win em all I guess 😂

I do also wish they pushed her bow to hav more moon imagery by making it look like two half moons joined together by a stick in the middle. They could also tied her more into the tree of life by making it more organic like in [*Jungle Ranger*](https://www.deviantart.com/monxiomon/art/Miya-Jungle-Ranger-ML-Mobile-Legends-969833931) .They could hav also gone in the other direction and made it some sort of ceremonial item or artifact like in [*Moon priestess*](https://www.deviantart.com/newjer53/art/Miya-Moon-Priestess-8k-wallpaper-917685778) 

Overall I think her design is very good. I do think she could have been pushed further concept wise but I think the artists didn’t want to be too blatant with it. 

Curious to see what u guys think. :)

Let me know where you think I'm off the mark, and what you think has a chance of coming true when Winds finally comes out!

**Sam II**

* Some members of the study gang have begun to disappear (the Archmaesters are abducting/killing Marwyn’s followers) 
* Sam continues learning with the Citadel study gang (Alleras, Leo, Pate) and recognizes a description of the Horn of Joramun in a book, as one that matches the horn he found beyond the wall. fPate makes notice of this. 
* Sam breaks into a forbidden section to steal some books. The Archmaesters think Mollander is responsible, and he disappears next. 
* Sam witnesses the arrival of the Iron Fleet. Oldtown is under siege. Sam, Alleras, and Leo plan an escape. 
* During the chaos of the Battle of Blood, Sam reluctantly helps fPate steal the *Death of the Dragons,* claiming that Marwyn asked it of him. fPate/Jaqen actually plans on giving the book to his old employers, the Faceless Men, for a price.  

**Melisandre III**

* Melisandre tries to persuade Selyse to let her burn Shireen; Melisandre believes Shireen’s death will be the catalyst for Jon’s rebirth as the Lord’s Champion. Melisandre never exactly lies to Selyse, but hides her true intentions, speaking on Stannis’ dwindling strength and the far chance of his success at taking the Iron Throne. 
* Selyse acquiesces, as she resents Shireen anyway. 
* Melisandre burns Shireen at the stake.

**Bran II**

* The Weirwood Cave is attacked by the White Walkers, who have devised a way to pass. They plan on killing the Three-Eyed Crow; when Bloodraven dies, Bran takes his place. Bran wargs into Hodor while simultaneously witnessing Hodor’s past at Winterfell, and inadvertently induces a seizure that causes Hodor to only be capable of speaking the word Hodor, which is based on the last command given to him by Bran, to hold the door. Hodor dies buying the kids time to escape. Summer is killed. 

**Arya I**

* Arya has joined Justin Massey, who is sailing to White Harbor.
* At White Harbor, however, Arya is drawn to the Riverlands by her bond with Nymeria. Justin loses her. 
* In the Riverlands, Arya ventures for Riverrun. 

**Tyrion VI**

* Tyrion thinks about Tysha in Braavos, and his supposed daughter, Lanna. (It’s not actually Tysha or his daughter but he’s deluding himself into thinking he’ll reunite with them somehow and get to make amends)
* Marwyn arrives, and he and Tyrion quickly become a top tier dialogue duo.
* Victarion & Strong Belwas have a rivalry with one another for who is the greatest fighter. 
* While Tyrion works diligently to protect the new alliances, he also begins preparing the armies to invade Westeros. The Yunkai’i are still out beyond the walls, but Tyrion believes the Pale Mare will kill them all eventually. He thinks about Penny.
* Tyrion assures the loyalty of the Windblown's new leader. 
* Barristan expresses doubts about Daenerys’ return, and is interested in fAegon’s successes in Westeros.

**Cersei IV**

* Cersei foils Lady Nym and Tyene and has them both arrested. Now that the Dornish are dealt with, Cersei and Margaery go back to focusing on hating each other. 

**Barristan III**

* Barristan begins to despair over Daenerys’ fate, and, having heard of fAegon’s ascendancy in Westeros, chooses to leave Meereen to join fAegon. 

**Melisandre IV**

* Melisandre struggles with her decision to burn Shireen, and is haunted by the girl’s screams. But she convinces herself it is the Lord’s Will. 
* Selyse has hanged herself, feeling guilt over her actions. 
* Stannis’ remaining soldiers at the wall begin to desert and flee south. 
* Melisandre performs a spooky ceremony using Shireen’s ashes, and successfully brings Jon back to life. 

**Jon I**

* Jon’s mind, having been trapped in Ghost for some time, is even more tormented and disturbed than before. Jon awakens and is confused, shocked, and burning hot. He recuperates in the care of Melisandre, and then makes his public debut. The Wildlings revere him as a god and a king. Tormund and Val are afraid but glad to see him alive. Edd, Grenn, Pyp, Bedwyck and the others are present too. Jon is cold and jaded towards them all. 

**Jaime III**

* Jaime mediates the Freys’ arguments over who should succeed Walder. Battle is imminent.
* Jaime takes advantage of the chaos and breaks out the prisoners, discreetly exchanging them over to the Brotherhood, disguised as Lannister soldiers. Jaime gets them through the gates and comes with them to cover their tracks. 

**Sansa II**

* Sansa forms personal alliances with several of the Vale lords and ladies, and, with Robyn’s support, goes behind Littlefinger’s back to arrange a mission to Winterfell to free the North and defeat the Freys and Boltons. The Blackfish is behind her. 
* Littlefinger is surprised, and somewhat intrigued, by Sansa’s initiative. Littlefinger plans to use Sansa to earn the trust of the Riverlords so, as Lord Paramount of the Trident, he can retain his position and expand his political influence in the Riverlands while also controlling Sansa, who holds sway over both the North and the Vale. Sansa suspects Littlefinger also wants to marry her, as he often remarks on her resemblance to Cat. 
* The Knights of the Vale set forth with Sansa, Littlefinger, and the Blackfish to Winterfell. 

**The Exile Knight**

* JonC leads the siege of King’s Landing, now with the combined strength of the Golden Company and the Dornish.
* JonC increasingly succumbs to madness caused by the greyscale. 

**Daenerys III**

* Daenerys nears Meereen and slaughters the Yunkai’i remnant army outside the gates, unaware of Tyrion’s peace.  

**The Madman**

* JonC witnesses the brutality of the sack as it progresses, and, with the ringing of the surrender bells, JonC recalls the Battle of the Bells and completely fucking loses his shit. He orders a mass slaughter of civilians, and inadvertently causes a greyscale epidemic. 
* JonC eventually walks off the battlements in a state of confusion and rage, and falls/burns to his death. 

**Asha II**

* Stannis lays siege to Winterfell. 
* Several wildling groups who are loyal to Jon journey from the north to fight for Stannis, and they are joined by Mance Rayder, who had escaped Ramsay. Stannis was expecting Jon himself, and is perturbed to hear that Jon is dead.  
* The battle conditions are intense, though Stannis’ victory is secured when the Knights of the Vale arrive, slaughtering the Boltons and remaining Freys. 
* Ramsay is escaping back to the Dreadfort
* Asha is told where Theon is hiding. She slips off to find him. 

**Sansa III**

* Sansa has defeated the last of the Boltons during the Battle of Ice. 
* She arrives in Winterfell. She meets a grim, dying Stannis and several of the Northern Lords. Sansa has the largest army, and is recognized by several of the Northmen, proving her legitimacy. 
* The Northern Lords pay homage to a wounded Stannis, without whom the Boltons would likely remain in power.  
* A succession crisis breaks out, as Rickon's name is brought forth to be Lord of Winterfell. Littlefinger encourages Sansa to take power now, as Rickon is only a boy and she has the support of the Vale. But Sansa’s main competition is Jon, who has not yet arrived at Winterfell. There are rumors that Jon was murdered by his men after breaking his vows. Littlefinger hopes this is the case.
* The Northern Lords defer to Sansa’s authority for the most part, though they are quarrelsome and leaderless. Sansa does her best to keep the peace. 

**Davos II**

* Davos witnesses much of the Northern politics in Winterfell as the lords prepare to transition from the Boltons. 
* Davos has returned to Winterfell shortly after the Battle of Ice, with Rickon and Osha in tow. Davos reunites with Stannis on the king’s deathbed. Stannis, whose wounds have worsened, comes to terms with his failures, but Davos points out his successes, and that he did his duty. Stannis learns of Shireen’s death and comes to his senses, though is consumed by regret for the consequences of his actions. He encourages Davos to return to his wife and children, and expresses begrudging gratitude for Davos’ friendship. Stannis dies a broken man. 

**Theon II**

* After the Battle of Ice, Theon and his Ironborn allies hunt down and confront the fleeing Ramsay and the remaining Boltons; Theon’s men kill them all, and Theon gets to give Ramsay the killing blow.  
* Asha finds Theon at his hideout, and he learns of Rickon’s survival and decides to go to the wall to find and protect Bran.
* Before Theon leaves, he says his farewells to Asha, as he expects not to return. Theon, as the true lawful heir to the Seastone Chair, declares in formal writing that Asha should be the heir. The other ironborn witness this and submit to Asha. 

**Brienne II**

* Brienne travels with other members of the Brotherhood, who cannot make pace with the sleepless Lady Stoneheart. They are all heading to Greywater Watch, and Brienne has deduced that this is the current designated meeting place of the treasonous Riverlords. Their last meeting was at Riverrun. Greywater Watch was chosen because of its difficulty in locating and the protection of the marshes. 
* Brienne is wary of Stoneheart, who still resents Brienne for presumably having failed to protect Sansa and Arya.
* They arrive at Greywater Watch, and find Jaime’s group has already arrived.
* There, Howland Reed has a tense but civil demeanor with Jaime, a suspicious attitude towards Brienne, and is shocked at the sight of Stoneheart. 
* They also meet Maege Mormont and Galbart Glover, among many Riverlords. Edmure Tully and Jeyne Westerling are present. 
* The Northmen reveal Robb’s will to Stoneheart and Jaime, as well as the Blackfish’s plan; it was Tom who convinced Edmure to surrender, and it was Edmure who convinced the Blackfish to surrender, all in an attempt to go along with the planned Daven/Frey wedding massacre / Walder Frey assassination that would be committed by the Brotherhood, and to give the Blackfish a chance to recruit support in the Vale. They reveal that word has reached them that the Blackfish has discovered Sansa there as well, and that he and Sansa are heading to Winterfell to defeat the Boltons. 
* Stoneheart refuses to give Robb’s crown to Jon, however.
* Howland says he needs to speak with Stoneheart privately. 

**Arianne IV**

* A greyscale epidemic erupts in King’s Landing following the sack. 
* In King’s Landing, fAegon and Arianne take the throne. Dowager Queen Margaery Tyrell has surrendered herself to fAegon, and begins cooperating with his new rule. Although Myrcella is technically the queen, she is ousted from the throne for fAegon to claim. They learn of Quentyn’s death, and fAegon breaks off the marriage pact with Arianne in order to marry Margaery instead; Dorne has no choice but to side with fAegon, even without a marriage, as Doran will not side with Daenerys any longer. Arianne’s actions have also left herself and her friends as nothing more than hostages for fAegon to keep the Dornish in line, along with the countless Dornishmen who have died. Arianne learns that Obara has been killed in Dorne, and Nymeria and Tyene allegedly died mysteriously during the sack. 

**Jon II**

* Jon deals with the final aftermath of the mutiny. Jon acknowledges the mutineers’ cause, and admits his mistake, having broken his oath. Jon and Melisandre learn of the utter annihilation of Hardhome, and the coming threat of the Others. Melisandre urges him to pursue Winterfell, though Jon isn’t sure he wants it anymore, considering it was his desire to become Lord of Winterfell and a Stark and failure to do his duty that got him murdered, and he is especially disillusioned after learning that fArya was really Jeyne. Melisandre points out that the North is fractured and weakened, and they need a king to lead them. Jon asks about Stannis, but Melisandre is now convinced that Jon is Azor Ahai, not Stannis, whose role is still important. In addition, Desmund Grell and Robin Ryger visit Jon and reveal Robb’s will, which legitimizes him. Jon finally relents. He knows his duty is to protect the realm, to do whatever necessary to lead and unify the North. 

**Cersei V**

* Cersei tortures Lady Nym and Tyene and reveals to them that she’s had Trystane killed. She leaves them for Qyburn’s experiments. 
* Qyburn informs Cersei that during the sack, caches of wildfire were discovered beneath homes and marketplace, buried deep. This information was kept as secret as possible. Cersei summons Hallyne, the pyromancer, 
* fAegon enters the capital and plans to marry Margaery. He plans to execute Cersei, but Margaery convinces him to spare her, showing mercy to her enemy and reluctant to solidify the feud in blood. This is a mistake that will cost Margaery dearly later. Cersei is kept as a high-value prisoner and put under house arrest. Cersei still plans on killing Margaery, but wants to find a way to kill fAegon and his supporters, along with all the Tyrell loyalists, at the same time. 

**Brienne III**

* The Brotherhood plan to go north; Brienne presumes this is to recruit the help of the North and the Vale, whose strength is now all at Winterfell.
* Brienne notices that Catelyn has changed, significantly, and is seen weeping (Howland told her the truth about Jon’s parentage, and she has realized that Ned never did betray her and that her anger at Jon was misplaced) 
* Brienne and Jaime develop a romantic relationship.

**Daenerys IV**

* Daenerys returns to Meereen and learns of Tyrion’s effective strategy for rule; Tyrion has secured the support of Qarth and Volantis, and has help bring about the doom of the slave trade, and has secured her power in Meereen, rooting out any and all Sons of the Harpy, who were led by the Green Grace.

**Jon III**

* Jon leaves the Night’s Watch to elect a new Lord Commander. 
* Edd wins, to his despair. 
* Jon gives some final instructions and leaves for Winterfell with his new personal wildling army following him. Val worries about Jon’s state of mind. 
* Melisandre attempts to prepare Jon for his role in the Long Night. 

**Sam III**

* The Ironborn raid the Citadel, searching for magical artifacts. Sam finds that the Horn of Joramun has been stolen, but there is no time to search for it, as he has to escape with Alleras and Leo.
* Sam finds Gilly and Monster and takes them with her. Nobody knows where Pate has gone. 
* Oldtown is saved when the sellsails arrive, though the city has suffered greatly. 
* Sam saves some records as the Citadel is burned (like Library of Alexandria)

**Tyrion VII**

* Tyrion welcomes Daenerys back to Meereen. The two have a tense first meeting. Daenerys is horrified to learn that Skahaz has executed all of the child hostages, though feels somewhat conflicted about it after learning that Daario was killed too. 
* Tyrion and Daenerys get the measure of each other. Daenerys is somewhat impressed by what he’s managed to accomplish in so little time.  

**Jon IV**

* Jon arrives at Winterfell. The Northmen are intimidated by him, and many are wary of the wildlings. Rickon believes Jon is Ned at first, because of how much older he looks. 
* Jon and Sansa have a warm reunion, and Jon’s humanity continues to return to him. 
* Jon reveals the threat of the Others to the Northmen, sparking doubt, outrage and fear. The Northmen argue whether to crown Jon and fight with him against the Others or to not crown anybody and flee back to their homes to rebuild and wait out the winter. 
* Littlefinger gets the measure of Jon, and seems to suspect Jon may not be as similar to Ned as he had first guessed. Littlefinger will have to bring about Jon’s downfall if Littlefinger is to rule the North through Sansa. For now, Littlefinger poses at a staunch supporter of Jon, who is ambivalent towards Littlefinger.

**Arya II**

* Arya takes part in the Frey Civil War as Nymeria, leading her wolfpack to ravage the Freys. 
* She kills Ilyn Payne through Nymeria. 
* Arya plans to go to King’s Landing next, to take final revenge for her family and kill Cersei Lannister and Meryn Trant. Arya’s mind is increasingly becoming warped by her connection with Nymeria and her hatred for all those who killed her family. Learning that Jon was killed was the last straw for her. 

**Davos III**

* Davos reunites with Melisandre and his son, Devon. 
* Davos inquires about how exactly Shireen and Selyse died, only to get cryptic answers.
* Justin Massey arrives and is distraught to learn that he had abandoned Stannis to die. Justin and some of Stannis’ remaining soldiers defer to Davos to find a new leader. 
* Davos witnesses more of the Northern Politics, particularly the debacle over whether Jon will accept becoming King in the North. 

**Jaime IV**

* Jaime might continue working with the Brotherhood and remain with Brienne, as she has agreed to do. 
* Jaime receives word of Cersei’s troubles in King’s Landing. He leaves Brienne in tears. 
* Jaime sneaks out of Greywater Watch, with Howland’s help; Howland warns him to remember his honor; they will all need each other more than he can know (Howland has spooky green dreams too and believes Jaime has an important purpose in the war to come). 
* Jaime escapes by night, planning to rally his army and ride on King’s Landing to protect Cersei.  

**Asha III**

* Asha, now the rightful Queen of the Iron Islands, returns to Winterfell to find that Stannis has died, and it is Jon Snow and Sansa who rule Winterfell.
* Asha pledges her loyalty to Jon and Sansa in exchange for forgiving the Ironborn; she insists that she will lead the Ironborn in a better direction. No decision is made, and the Northmen are very wary of Asha. 
* Asha fears having to face her uncle, Euron, knowing from Stannis that the right to rule won’t make her queen; killing her enemies will make her queen. 

**Sam IV**

* Sam convinces his group that they have to leave, as there is no more good he can do here. Leo and Sam make peace; Leo decides to remain with Alleras, and he reveals that he knows Alleras is a girl. 
* Sallera and Leo remain in Oldtown to help repair the city. 
* Sam plans on returning North with Gilly and Monster to rejoin Jon. 

**Daenerys V**

* Daenerys reluctantly allows Ben to keep his head, thanks to Tyrion. Daenerys forgives Jorah. Daenerys refuses to marry Victarion, but agrees to work with him to kill Euron and raise him to power on the Iron Islands. (She might change her mind later after meeting Euron) Daenerys and Tyrion discuss her conquest of Westeros; Tyrion convinces her that now is the time, and she especially feels rivalrous with fAegon, who sits the throne she thinks was meant for her. Daenerys decides to finally leave Meereen. 

**Cersei VI**

* Cersei, having tasked Hallyne to supply her with new caches of wildfire, lights a fuse beneath the Sept of Baelor during the wedding of fAegon and Margaery. fAegon survives as he is kept away from the wedding, while the bride Margaery, her father Mace, Haldon Halfmaester, the High Sparrow, and countless Tyrell vassals all burn to death in the cataclysmic explosion. 
* The Tyrells, now led by Willas, pull all support from fAegon and focus on their own problems in the Reach. Arianne is blamed for the explosion, and fAegon is frustrated to have to marry his second choice, though he desperately needs the Martells as allies now. 
* Myrcella throws herself to her death after discovering it was her own mother who murdered Trystane. (or dies from greyscale or maybe wildfire, since she’s only 10 and might not think to commit suicide but regardless of which, I like the idea of Cersei inadvertently causing the death of one of the kids) 
* Cersei learns that Jaime has begun leading his army back to King’s Landing. Cersei gloats to herself over her victory, before discovering Myrcella’s corpse. 

**Bran III**

* Bran, Meera, and Jojen flee through the wilderness. Coldhands saves them again, but Jojen is dying. They have to cannibalize Jojen to survive. Bran has a new vision, this time of the Tower of Joy, and he learns the truth of Jon Snow’s parentage, that Jon is actually the son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, and that Ned made a promise to Lyanna to conceal Jon’s true identity for fear of Robert’s wrath.  

**Jon V**

* Jon strikes up a friendship with Davos, and is wary of Littlefinger, who cares little about the threat of the Others. 
* There is turmoil in Winterfell as a decision must be made. The Northmen finally decide to crown Jon, in accordance with Stannis’ blessing, Sansa’s support, and Robb’s will. Jon is crowned King in the North. He sets his sights on defending the north from the Others. 

**Brienne IV**

* Brienne is heartbroken by Jaime’s decision to leave, and prepares to continue north to Winterfell with the Brotherhood, who have finally begun to take a liking to her. She has still not forgiven them for Hyle’s murder. 
* Brienne finds Stoneheart, and affirms her original oath to Catelyn, to protect Sansa and Arya; she intends to do that by finding Sansa at Winterfell. But Stoneheart decides not to go on, believing that she can not fix the mistakes she made in life, now that she has been reduced to this state of misery. She does seek to make amends somewhat, and gives Robb’s crown to Brienne, with the intention of giving it to Jon. 
* Howland Reed plans to join them north. 

**Tyrion VIII**

* Tyrion and Daenerys form an official alliance, along with Victarion. 
* Tyrion successfully convinces Daenerys to finally go home to Westeros. Skahaz will take care of things in Slaver’s Bay, and finish the work she began. Tyrion plans to take a different way to Westeros, through Braavos. He wonders if Tysha will recognize him, and whether he wants her to. 

**Daenerys VI**

* Daenerys and her allies set sail from Meereen with all of her new ships from Volantis and Qarth and the Iron Fleet. 

**The Ritual**

* Aeron has witnessed the brutality of Euron’s confrontation with the Redwyne fleet at Oldtown
* Euron's ships are still engaged in battle with the sellsails
* Euron is performing some sort of ungodly ritual, using the blood of priests along with the blood of all the men he’s slain. 
* He is offered tribute from his raiders’ conquest of Oldtown, and he acquires the Horn of Joramun. Euron blows the horn and completes the ritual by slitting the throat of Aeron, whose last thought is him hallucinating Euron as a demonic eldritch god again. 

**Theon III**

* Theon gets accustomed to the Wall and helps prepare the disorganized Night’s Watch to mobilize, following Jon’s orders from Winterfell.
* Theon plans where to start to locate Bran out in the wild. 
* From the Wall, Theon witnesses the movements of the Others in the distance. Parts of the Wall begin to crumble away.

Stuff I'm most shaky on rn is Arianne and Margaery. Margaery will likely die in TWOW but killing like 70% of the KL characters is a whole lot to do in just one book. I thought about pushing Margaery's death to DOS, but in reality I don't think GRRM is going to have her make it out of TWOW. But there can't be too many factions at play in KL by DOS, and the Tyrells start out in the best spot, so I could see George knocking them back down by the end of the book by killing Mace + Margaery. I also have absolutely no clue how George plans on reintroducing Benjen into the story, but if he does come back I think it will happen in Dream, not Winds. Benjen def knows R+L=J so I assume he'll be important in the next book. 

I rly want Stannis and Margaery to survive this book as they're two of my favs but the chances are slim. This was fun to make, let me know what you guys think! Fingers crossed Winds comes soon. "
quick rant about blood vials,bloodborne,1bla03j,2024-03-22 17:00:24,0,0.5,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/1bla03j/quick_rant_about_blood_vials/,holdupnow76,Discussion,"not even kidding, but the blood vial system in this game has genuinely killed a lot of my enjoyment of it.

For context, I have beaten the game twice now, and every now and then I find myself wanting to hop right back into it and play more because of how much I love the lore and the gameplay.

But the catch is (and you can all say I’m garbage/“didn’t play the game right”, etc, whatever) But I used the “cummmfpk” dungeon each of those playthroughs to get max bloodvials and bullets because I just simply didn’t want to have to spend the pain-staking time grinding for them.

I want to keep fighting the boss until I overcome it, not stop after every attempt or two just to run through the same area over and over and over and over and over…you get the point

I had PSPlus the first two playthroughs but I don’t pay for it anymore, nor have I in a long time now. And everytime I try to play this game I hit a point where I have zero vials left, realize I either have to grind for like 20min just to ATTEMPT to beat the boss, or fork over like $10 to Sony for PSPlus just so I can enjoy the damn game.

Ik what everyone is going to say: “use rally better”, “don’t use as many vials”, “spend spare echoes on them” but honestly no matter what I am going to run out, and I am going to have to grind for them again. And honestly it rly sucks, I genuinly love this game but I just can’t bring myself to have to grind out an item that literally every other game (except demons souls) lets you SIMPLY SPAWN WITH.

I may have overexaggerated, this didn’t “kill the game” for me, but it just sucks that if I *personally* want to have fun with it, I basically need to spend $10 every playthrough because I just simply don’t want to grind for it.

Why?,Nijisanji,1apm06n,2024-02-13 00:33:56,33,0.97,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nijisanji/comments/1apm06n/why/,yuunapocky,Discussion,"Okay, Tazumi statement was probably the best we could get. Japanese people are usually (usually) serious about their apologies and they have stated things we were worry about. Nevermind we still need ongoing improvement and proof obv. 

HOWEVER, I fucking hate all the statements that’s just pointing fingers. Like for the video on Elira’s channel. I don’t believe they were forced; it was literally a legal-bound video. They were advised in some way from their lawyers and they maintained it was their voice. My question is why? Why the video?

Nijisanji was the first to let the world be known of the harassment. Ofc there’s hate. If it was any other liver, it would be the exact same result. A witch-hunt. No one even said any times. Hating on Livers/Nijisanji is not a new thing the internet did cuz of the event. It only allows a reason for them to even further rally the hate that btw is caused by the termination statement by Nijisanji.

If they wanted transparency, idk about you but that wasn’t rly the transparency I was looking for. I wanted transparency for reassurance, not to load a gun and shoot someone. Like what?

If they wanted to maintain reputation, I don’t think you realize what people think reputation is. It’s not holding dignity. It’s not being right. It’s being the bigger person. It’s being a role model, an inspiration. That’s how you hold a reputation. 

And with all their lawyers involved, why do we have to know omg Vox favoritism. That belongs in the court. Because now they’re setting off fires again to fans who frankly are tired of it.

TDLR: I vent because I’m confused. If y’all have another perspective on why pls let me know."

I just got into sim racing a couple weeks ago, and yesterday I found myself wanting to try rally. DR2.0 was free, so i gave it a go, as ive read its got rly good compatability with a wheel. 

As mentioned, im a complete beginner. But I find myself 30 seconds ahead of the AI. All assists are off, and max damage is on. What am I missing? Is the FWD1-group just dogshit, or are my settings weird? Im not saying I dont know how to drive a car, but theres just no way im 30 seconds faster right away. I can miss an apex by to cars lenght and even lose the rear and almost go to a full stop in a hairpin, and still gain time. Is this right?"

Why do people love bloodborne?,fromsoftware,16i0jza,2023-09-13 18:11:41,0,0.41,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/fromsoftware/comments/16i0jza/why_do_people_love_bloodborne/,joochee,,"Played elden ring and loved it, did a few NG+ runs aswell and decided to do all of the soulsborne games.

So i started with elden ring - loved it

After that i did demon souls on the ps5 - loved it, but kinda hated you had like the full level as runback to bosses.

Followed up with dark souls 3 - i think its my favorite, just loved everything rly

Now i just finished bloodborne, was really exicted to play it since i heared alot of people have it as a favorite.. the good:
-  i really liked the trickweapons, really cool
- the gothic atmosphere
- cool bosses

The bad:
-Kinda felt the whole game was a bit meh, maybe i hyped myself to much
- faster/more aggressive didnt feel better, i like the Tactic playstyle in the other games, won lot of fights with just spam attacking due to the Rally system. Feels better to Dodge,block, parry instead. Ofc you still need to do it, but not as punishing.
- i dont know hard to put my finger on it, lot of just small hallways
- HATED the forest places
- 30fps locked


liked ds3 and elden ring more, tied with demon souls.

ITS NOT A BAD GAME AT ALL! I really liked it i just Wonder why so many people have it as their favorite, i dont rly understand it compared to some of the other games that i find better.
Would say that maybe the best is the trickweapons and i really liked the main hub.

Again its only my opinion i dont mean to step o peoples toes here.

Now i will do ds2 or sekiro.any tips on who to do first?"

But bad!",UltimateTraders,12sxr4f,2023-04-20 08:55:16,10,0.82,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/UltimateTraders/comments/12sxr4f/4202023_daily_plays_who_is_still_tricked_by_elon/,UltimateTraders,Daily Plays,"Good morning everyone. I have been up since about 6AM reading earnings reports. The last 12 hours we have had well over 100 earnings reports. I don’t read every actual 10Q \[Official quarterly report\]. I do read the headlines, written article on just about every single company that reports! EVERY SINGLE ONE! Don’t be lazy if it comes to your money! If you care about your money, do some DD! I was writing on Twitter..

I do the DD that everyone should be doing. I understand people don’t like me. I am honest, up front, and I will rock a company that doesn’t deliver. But the good news is, is that I rock every company…. Why?

I do not favor any company. People that followed me in 2021 when I came on Reddit, knew at that time I loved FLWS TIGR NLS LL RAD . I do not erase anything. I want people to see what happened, when, why….

I do not like when people try and say I am a traitor or why did I turn on these companies.

When I had to say bye bye to TIGR because of what happened with DIDI a lot of my team even thought I was crazy, evil and a enemy…

My friends, we are not the CEOs of the company… We do not even work at the company! We generally, do not even know employees at the company…

IF ANYTHING!!!!???

THEY FAILED ME! I DID NOT TURN ON THEM!

I am not cold. I am here to make money. Of course there are faves, I like ZIM SCHW CVS CRK NYCB . These are just 5.. However, my objective is to make money. I do have some emotions with some of these.. I followed EZGO since the day it IPO’ed….

BUT WE DO NOT RUN COMPANIES!

They fail me if they no longer deliver. TIGR used to grow sales at 200%! They pulled in surprise profits, at times they grew at 100% and bottom line beat by 20 cents! NOT FUD!

Naturally, I am going to love this company, love these results… As time went on, it grew at 150, 120, 80.. Once the growth was just 40-50 and they stopped beating on the bottom line…

I DIDN’T TURN ON THEM!

The story changed! That is not my fault! That is theirs!

We do not run companies, we must decide as soon as the story changes if we are going to trade it anymore, or take the loss..

AFRM and UPST in 2021, were some of my faves…. I hate them now..

I am not the enemy.. The story changed and they failed me!

I DID NOT FAIL THEM!

I say that because people fail to understand. I have been trading for almost 30 years. Do not think I am the enemy because I loved a company and all of a sudden hate it… I am not Jim Cramer or some dumb analyst. I didn’t just change my opinion the same day or because of the stock price!

I changed my opinion when the actual execution at the company changed!

If you had a favorite baseball player, basketball player.. once upon a time, they were an All star, an MVP… You loved them while they did awesome, you gave them awards… now they arent even ok, they suck now….. Do you keep them on your team? Pay them money?

I would be so hated as an owner of a team, because I would just be honest and tell the player, your days are outnumbered, ill give you a little bit of money for being nice, we are moving on, sorry! 

Chris Paul is still good, does he deserve 40 million?

Aaron Rodgers 50 million?

Max Scherzer 43 million?

Not me! 

I wanted to go thru all this because here are my report cards for many companies that have reported since market close after 4PM on 4/19/2023.

In 2020 I made a lot of money on AXP DFS RAD . Especially AXP! I made some trades on KEY.. But these companies earned their grade on their report cards. 

If you look at these grades, nearly 100 companies, what is the common theme? The avg grade is near 60! That means companies are either beating the top or the bottom line. They are not beating both, or that would at least result in a 65! IBM TSM TSLA T AXP DFS AN AA all huge companies all failed! I am not the enemy, I am telling you the facts as I see it… The only large company with very good earnings was LVS which had a very good score of 85, but I don’t want to trade it still. ZION was a fave bank, the valuation is very low, and at 26-28 I want in, but they missed, that is not my fault…You love your kids, but some fail tests, some don’t make it in life, it isnt because I am cold… these companies are not our family, if the story has changed.. You decide if you want to leave!!!! 

So who still believes Elon Musk is the man? Who still disagrees that TSLA was meme # 1 and a ton of retail jumped on as it was near 20% short January 1st of 2020.. At that time Elon was under oath and his net worth was under 20 billion! FACTS! I tell everyone that wants to listen the truth, but most people do not want to listen. January 1st of 2020, TSLA was months away from bankruptcy, if they did not shaft retail for 18 billion. \[2 offerings of 5 billion each, and 2 convertible bonds for 8 billion\] They would be under! FACTS! TSLA has raised over 40 billion dollars on the backs of retail! FACTS If you are fine with it, ok. I don’t have a problem with it… that is what a company is public for! But at some time the company has to be profitable, at some time people need to wake up….

Is that time now? That 18 billion has now let TSLA be a real company. It is real now, they are cash flow positive and paid off most long term debt…. They were supposed to have 3+ billion of free cash flow and came in at 400 million LOL!

Some regards said TSLA should pay a dividend or buy back shares… This is done with free cash flow.. TSLA does not have the power of free cash flows, because it is a CAR COMPANY!

Fools that tried to say otherwise needs to read the facts!

I knew the price cuts would crush margins.. Just had no idea, how bad!

Last quarter overall margin was 16% and now 11.4! Other car OEMS have 6-9% So, yes, TSLA is better… but TSLA has a PE ratio near 70-80! GM has 5-6, F 7-8!!!

TSLA grew sales at 24%, they had an earnings decline 20%. FACTS. I tweeted proof.

TSLA also had 521 million of Tax credits sold. That is 16 cents of earnings coming from the sale of EV credits to other OEMS that are scared to pay a penalty for not doing EVS.

Well, news to you! EVS are coming. These Tax credit sales are going to 0! They may last until 2025 if lucky, but they are going to 0! And by 2024 those sales are going much less.

75 cents to 1 dollar of earnings this year… DON’T COUNT! I don’t count the sale of get out of jail free cards if they will disappear completely, relatively soon. Some people count unemployment as income.. I DON’T! It goes away relatively soon. And as time goes on the numbers are going to fall. 

So, I am being nice by giving TSLA a 40x multiple. Even I didn’t think margin would fall from 16 to 11.4% in just 1 quarter… Months ago, if you recall I wrote that this margin number would come down to other OEMS eventually. Let me see if it was the day after earnings!

You can go back and see I am telling what would happen with TSLA the company even 2 years ago! The execution has declined.. So believe what you want…

The saddest thing is that even with these price drops… I can not say with confidence that TSLA will deliver 1.8 million cars in 2023. They did 1.31 in 2022..

And recall, I called people dummies that said TSLA would deliver 5 million cars per year by 2025…. Those baffoons, what do you think now?? 3 million probably…. 4 million not likely….5?? LOL DUMMIES! To bad I cant bet anyone that has money and is credible.

5 Trade ideas:

CVNA MARA – I am up on both puts still. MARA was as low as 10.10 last night. I have 10 strike puts with a 6/16 date

AMZN – Big tech earnings bad so far. I want AMZN puts, but want a rally. Current fair value on AMZN is 75

CMG – It did hit a 52 week high yesterday, I was about to place a put order, just 1 contract, I will take the risk reward, this has a higher multiple than tech stocks!

GM – Down hard probably with TSLA sympathy. But as I wrote above the valuations is way different! Will GM 33 ????

SPOT – This company sucks, big tech is missing, Let me see

6 Ethereum Altcoins Targeted By SEC Ahead of Coinbase Wells Notice,CryptoCurrency,11zq6gl,2023-03-23 12:51:45,24,0.8,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11zq6gl/6_ethereum_altcoins_targeted_by_sec_ahead_of/,Sporesword,GENERAL-NEWS,"""The coins in question are Amp ([AMP](https://dailyhodl.com/currencies/amp-token/)), LCX ([LCX](https://dailyhodl.com/currencies/lcx/)), Power Ledger ([POWR](https://dailyhodl.com/currencies/power-ledger/)), Rally ([RLY](https://dailyhodl.com/currencies/rly/)), XYO Network ([XYO](https://dailyhodl.com/currencies/xyo-network/)) and DerivaDAO ([DDX](https://dailyhodl.com/currencies/derivadao/)).

At the time, Coinbase strongly [rejected](https://dailyhodl.com/2022/07/22/coinbase-rejects-sec-claim-that-nine-ethereum-based-altcoins-are-securities/)  the claim that the above crypto assets are securities, citing its  “rigorous” and “SEC-reviewed” process for determining which assets are  listed on the exchange.

Today, the SEC [sent](https://dailyhodl.com/2023/03/22/coinbase-receives-sec-wells-notice-over-listed-crypto-assets-staking-service-coinbase-prime-and-coinbase-wallet/)  a Wells Notice to Coinbase, asserting the agency has made a preliminary  determination that recommends the agency file an enforcement action  against Coinbase.""

Sounds to me that a legal analysis of the SEC's review needs to take place to prepare Coinbase for a lawsuit against the agency. If it turns out that the SEC signed off on any of these \*tokens as being acceptable then the agency is eventually going to get itself investigated by a special prosecutor.

\*SEC reviewed the process for selecting assets, though, one would think this lead to a lot of information sharing and discussion between the SEC, Coinbase's lawyers, and technical staff during this review process which would lock down criteria and even if the SEC didn't officially ""sign off"" on the final draft their participation lends the process some legal credibility.

"Thursday, 23rd March 2023",CoinwebDailySpin,11zax0l,2023-03-23 02:08:39,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinwebDailySpin/comments/11zax0l/thursday_23rd_march_2023/,ruKawin,,"*This was the first edition of The Daily Spin to be published On-Chain via* [*Mirror.xyz*](https://Mirror.xyz) *and can be collected at:* [https://mirror.xyz/rukawin.eth/w\_SagXW3TkL1MQxWkKuyOabOibd5WGFnxYjSnGuVWNc](https://mirror.xyz/rukawin.eth/w_SagXW3TkL1MQxWkKuyOabOibd5WGFnxYjSnGuVWNc)

**The Daily Spin.** *Ramadan Thursday Edition.* LFG! The FED raises interest rates for the 9th consecutive time, yesterday by 25 basis points, and stands by the narrative that “isolated bank failures” could lead to contagion and that they acted swiftly and decisively – but that the economy is strong, the banking system is strong, unemployment is low – and oh let’s not mention the $300B added to the balance sheet, the BTFP and the stealthy delay of the shit hitting the fan when bailout treasury swaps are due one year later… meanwhile, the report from Biden attacks crypto for speculation and for ESG, paving the way for a US CBDC to reveal itself as the solution – which was shrewdly opposed by Republican leaders in both Texas (Sen. Ted Cruz) and Florida (Gov. De Santis).

Then, as if with hive mind mentality, the SEC unleashes a barrage of regulation by enforcement attacks aimed at Coinbase who received a Wells Notice, Justin Sun, SushiSwap, and a bunch of other suits at influencers in connection with promoting FTX. *You know what, I’ve created an entire new section devoted to this grift with the US Government entitled,* “**US Coordinated Regulation Failures**.” It’s really starting to ratchet up as Bitcoin holders are 72% in profit, dominance approaches 48% and the eye of the storm seems to have just passed over.

As previous cycles have shown in unison with current technical analysis, when BTC hits 48% dominance the ETH/BTC trendline breaks out and then the market takes their profits and fires it into what is affectionately known as “Altcoin Season.” To summarize, the BTC 4-year cycle has come to fruition once again, leading up to the halving, and it is with more confidence that the bottom has passed – but that we’re in a new, bull run with some uniquely differentiating qualities. This time, people are in the green and moving to self-custody. The macroeconomic environment is in the gutter as the global lockdown comes to bear, the banking system is collapsing around us as we speak, and there’s been more division in politics than ever before. There is even the real possibility that the US Dollar loses its status as the world’s reserve currency – Xi, Putin and the leaders of the BRICS nations might have something to say about that. For many who have been in crypto for long enough, who have foreseen these problems come to a head and coined what is known as “The Great Flippening.” It has begun.

Now let’s get to brass tax about the other headlines of the day… Coinbase executives have been running for the door for over a month, selling shares and shouting “*the British are here!*” at the top of their lungs. Ethereum puts its Shanghai-Capella hard fork upgrade to April 12th. Arbitrum’s token $ARB launches today at Ethereum block 16890400, one of the most anticipated L2 events of the year. Ontology incubates a new layer 2 solution, “The Goshen Network.” A Circle executive (USDC) gets their Twitter account hacked. Crypto firms flock to Swiss Banks (read: UBS) after Silvergate and Signature collapses. The SEC names 6 altcoins they believe to be securities traded on Coinbase’s exchange: AMP, LCX, POWR, RLY, XYO, and DDX. XRPL is rallying in anticipation of a favorable SEC vs. Ripple outcome.

Elsewhere, Hong Kong is to release virtual asset licensing details in June. The South Korean DAXA releases guidelines for listing and relisting crypto assets. France is looking to ban crypto promotion, as their petrochemical workforce sets fire to the infrastructure and mobilizes against Macron. And concerns surface about the Venezuelan Central Bank as they no-show their economic data report, amid allegations of corruption in high political offices around crypto.

In TL today, we talk about Bank fuck-ups, Elon Musk chimes in about the current antiquated financial system, and Arthur Hayes writes a beautiful prose on the current day crises in an article entitled, “Kaiseki”… here is our round-up of curated news and opinions (surely biased) from the world of Blockchain, keeping you informed into the market news with the most trending, in-the-know, and controversial topics.

Coinbase delists OMG & other assets - the reaffirmed case for DYOR.,CryptoCurrency,11sph05,2023-03-16 05:48:13,9,0.8,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11sph05/coinbase_delists_omg_other_assets_the_reaffirmed/,jam-hay,GENERAL-NEWS,">""We regularly monitor the assets on our exchange to ensure they meet our listing standards. Based on our most recent reviews, Coinbase will suspend trading for Rally (RLY), DFI.Money (YFII), Mirror (MIR), OMG Network (OMG), Loom Network (LOOM), and Augur (REP) on March 29, 2023 on or around 12pm ET.""

Over the years OMG must have ranked as one of the most/ top shilled crypto's on r/cc

It's dropped 11% on the daily and currently sits at $1.34 down from a 2021 high of $19.7 (-93%) & 2018 ATH of $23.84 (-94%)

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/omg/

The delisting from one of the worlds largest exchanges drives another nail in the coffin. 

An example of why in crypto DYOR is so important. In crypto, investors can often receive crypto for virtually nothing via forks, faucets, airdrops, giveaways etc. This can often sway sentiment among those from being neutral to positive. This is of course not the only reason people can promote crypto, but it always worth checking if this is the case particularly when it appears like a disproportionate number of people suddenly start talking about the merits of a project certain project you've never heard of before. 

OMG has gone from once r/cc hero to almost zero. DYOR :)"

#### Key Takeaways:

* The global buzz around ChatGPT has spread to China, prompting tech giants Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and JD to unveil rival projects
* Alibaba and Tencent are tipped as potential winners over time in the commercial use of ChatGPT

By Fai Pui

Did you get a love letter from an admirer on Valentine’s Day? If so, can you be sure that the words came straight from the heart? Or maybe they were written by ChatGPT, the AI-powered chatbot that has become a global sensation.

Artificial intelligence is entering the realm of romance, according to a [**survey**](http://email.benzinga.com/ls/click?upn=sUkKIoUiX4DwenGBdXT1pTjaJPQiDUY0yJMLa2fwl7mlE4y5DDx1aSX1138tk1P6-2BHbksfYhr0ulxVjekaqRmQbBI9SqJ9cz0bz8sgVmQMr-2BDTexNrjvfdqCWJnqshkbQiqwLIDvgIfkaiUwZ6f7Kh6-2BCk91GMi5y9zRoBj-2BBybUWbBZYgaPoTkkB8zaamE54Qga_A6np-2Bq5dXU-2FiKWa-2Fp5HTh7RsUKLz6cpNRkRykbD0MirTonkm2BUyzuT1AVVrUfmnhYPqNfQcbiUhUKRYV1mA3mye5fP2lGGocPx7nCv0VAxP920iqJ8HGc9khsiDjNCo6OunhDv-2F0XUN7ehGLdXQwr0QhvKAWxsc3BhyKLPBth7CPUY6fZ3PrRp3idOQXCESH3BBQc7-2BBidj007X2-2Bly3J5Sf04dCOY0FvTIs7kMW-2FedP-2B2n1ISPAfc2BwtqGfGttrA9cX93gRIoeJHtqmNqUPRUjy3-2Fpa0TbeKYMXxWAQw-3D) of 5,000 people around the world about modern-day courtship. Of those surveyed, 26% said they would use text-generating tools such as ChatGPT to write a love letter.

The AI chatbot launched late last year by OpenAI, a startup backed by **Microsoft Corp.** (NASDAQ: [MSFT](http://email.benzinga.com/ls/click?upn=POMTzu5hkRlP2Z45Yy-2FvXaEO-2FNpIqgURGRP25VtYu7KfDBSHRg-2FPAkI6AoJq6LjNCBYzayX3mNatf1rbwPUMB4jovHPtKYdTd0sifubspHJeFIWJ4ja1Xx7Hf9xSOpighT4go1cPbKfsuvOzmIbPLQ-3D-3Dtfov_A6np-2Bq5dXU-2FiKWa-2Fp5HTh7RsUKLz6cpNRkRykbD0MirTonkm2BUyzuT1AVVrUfmn2dWmCND-2Fhc7NfjfAVgRTqBLXK06Whnb1P9VPh1qqbWrDxPwGl1SVrc-2Ffi0BAguUblvp-2B4kdmRhU1aBODsbZeRwCvgZrfLeGJpACcLxGXPYFbC1uoaVS8mjxj7vhhqcbqMLlgOg1oNhfTWV5FKhzAkmcjKWJSTBp3rU8dXJ7DNySXNvTrRGpkXWJkF56Hf65vVSg1hoc-2FT-2FN9xD4ZIsNnBiOSbJ-2FkGGTUv8K0SzEx8Po-3D)), can do more than answer questions. It is able to write essays, scripts, articles or computer programs, with greater skill than virtual assistants such as Siri from **Apple Inc.** (NASDAQ: [AAPL](http://email.benzinga.com/ls/click?upn=POMTzu5hkRlP2Z45Yy-2FvXaEO-2FNpIqgURGRP25VtYu7KBgGi2mD08WgwlEAh9yeZ6oGlpKc8tgsisk99WzpoS9oTIt7-2BNj7hp97idE1PgKR8-2FFn7Su9YKM51FhSjT6MuCST1t1E-2BREXdh6AlIN5Kg1g-3D-3DrWY1_A6np-2Bq5dXU-2FiKWa-2Fp5HTh7RsUKLz6cpNRkRykbD0MirTonkm2BUyzuT1AVVrUfmnH8lKoUK-2BqyF2ipk-2FL3S2MdTg4wW8ClIUuckcuFY3UlI3tbxe-2FO8xlhBz9t3vT4P1jS5z8iXKA-2F-2BH58OmHNtgbZrjy1-2Bu2y9r4d1FU83jm7OHEoV3FfeCB5ts7vONgXkrLn2AC7UrJgnYjZroCyWaIULd0b64TXHcLusiQyyIFnHWz1palFe0jT7EtkS2KQswNLTskL85F-2Brf9BcjJXHtv-2FRVaSYHroC3aHHLKAr17R0-3D)). Within just two months, ChatGPT has already gained more than 100 million monthly active users.

ChatGPT deploys generative AI and language-processing technology to analyze data and produce text in the style of human language. Neural network computing modeled on the human brain helps the chatbot learn how to complete tasks such as writing articles or answering questions in response to users’ instructions.

#### Trouble ahead for Google 

ChatGPT investor Microsoft recently announced it was incorporating the chatbot into its Bing search engine, potentially posing a threat to the online search dominance enjoyed by Google, owned by **Alphabet Inc.** (NASDAQ: [GOOGL](http://email.benzinga.com/ls/click?upn=POMTzu5hkRlP2Z45Yy-2FvXaEO-2FNpIqgURGRP25VtYu7LRnZVGk8y3sNi3lsLXW08tL0j2-2BN4garJg546HxtyfcMbOmdAcRiaYNImV65KmJ9a53i25qm6kV7dx8gXVVF2wRMJ-2Fx-2F-2B3c-2FaeDUP-2Bb4c5eA-3D-3DCkYx_A6np-2Bq5dXU-2FiKWa-2Fp5HTh7RsUKLz6cpNRkRykbD0MirTonkm2BUyzuT1AVVrUfmni4T-2BMoZ3Hty7LGNhWM4Urn-2BGPXYC9Ogh6lPKLJHT-2FdTubKnhf9U1aZBk89DO8EJxnkuCSvB7qV-2F42i19BjZ9RW57Fpq035iO1oK-2FmDTbGi-2Bgsdsyvb2rLe9BigdVfeeRr9lSz3rfKnnaFhsQD2-2FdlxsulfXbTZj7X-2B0Ucs8k-2B7rpNADO0gi8Mo5SwgXM4PxZAHZOrhmOhCF4T4b2r58J-2B7xZ20wS32Qe1qVvsRbzeWA-3D)).

Google’s revenues, which rely heavily on pay-per-click advertising, could be hard hit if ChatGPT draws more traffic away to Bing, until now a relatively niche search engine, says Isaac Wong, analyst at eFusion Capital.

Sensing a stiff challenge, Google hastily released a promotional clip of its own AI chatbot, Bard, last Wednesday. But the counterattack backfired when Bard gave a wrong answer to a question about the James Webb Space Telescope. Alphabet’s stock plunged 12% in the three days after the gaffe, wiping nearly $170 billion off its market value.

What about Chinese tech giants that have also been combining Big Data with AI to develop intelligent chatbots?

**Baidu Inc.** (NASDAQ: [BIDU](http://email.benzinga.com/ls/click?upn=POMTzu5hkRlP2Z45Yy-2FvXaEO-2FNpIqgURGRP25VtYu7L-2BzIQxYiPqpImUXwmlutvN0gOaQamDyKW3fYQ6ZcEMhdsrPYX5U18l4tC-2B0PUthy-2FmfYPqRatACohcuzx0ppuRmohLgUerXKd1SunCDW9G3w-3D-3DC8Nv_A6np-2Bq5dXU-2FiKWa-2Fp5HTh7RsUKLz6cpNRkRykbD0MirTonkm2BUyzuT1AVVrUfmnEO-2FT-2FhDHwWQpsGoK9C7ZubWMefzUBcw69UdKQXsprbza3t3D2vuEecENeaBlyGKHAniQCTpKmzYLEOuWqh5o7f6I74LOB5eVFl7wzJJO7Glk7DLDOP9XviTdJ4VeDU4D6EKyXhAkBzNAj1bCmBe0DfSJRoPQdZdVjgQWWyhTlxpEqDGJBUGffxkNxRrzbpudwtqWS6Kry9KutGSAUJ-2FUdU0Seo8Jh1IoHaFNppS6cTE-3D)), China’s leading AI and search engine company, was the first to jump on the publicity bandwagon with the launch last week of “ERNIE Bot,” a language-generating chatbot that is due to complete internal testing in March. Baidu’s plans to integrate the chatbot into its search engine sent the company’s shares soaring 15% last Tuesday.

Next up was **Alibaba Group** (NYSE: [BABA](http://email.benzinga.com/ls/click?upn=POMTzu5hkRlP2Z45Yy-2FvXaEO-2FNpIqgURGRP25VtYu7LeGRMSUqaTkGp2CQvBH3W818UBVj4IQQCIVh72yYXbzdn-2BKdeLNnAR-2B-2FxwafyXeOFcGhMOaSbV2KYM-2FhGghS6r064JlbFHLuwsLEd72T-2FBGA-3D-3DnN2t_A6np-2Bq5dXU-2FiKWa-2Fp5HTh7RsUKLz6cpNRkRykbD0MirTonkm2BUyzuT1AVVrUfmn1zKbvojILGMLhdpwouNtfVq-2B4C6Oinp3WwWyB4KUUSAb9fNQ-2F8lSMZEW06ho4kSOA6APXqIaqZ8SiPz-2BuM-2FVThm5F4eHD27UH9qTOTM31oLm8rWLdckstDz1Tf6WlhEc9WkdAd7JiLcPAWnLdw5Rv53OA-2FV0oVejDYjYTXb6UWzOgWYb9shB4ymia-2Fx0wXb-2Fnek93VGFbyksfnlKu7yzCvBUWot1wEvJHQXFI6TBLbU-3D)), which confirmed it was working on its own version of ChatGPT. Screenshots leaked online suggest Alibaba may incorporate its AI technology into DingTalk, a smart-office app allowing workers to communicate and collaborate online. **Tencent Holdings** ([700.HK](http://700.hk/)) is also reported to be getting in on the act, with research into ChatGPT-style AI technology and plans to invest more in content- generation tools.

The chatbot frenzy goes beyond those three Chinese tech leaders. **JD.Com** (NASDAQ: [JD](http://email.benzinga.com/ls/click?upn=POMTzu5hkRlP2Z45Yy-2FvXaEO-2FNpIqgURGRP25VtYu7IZigHvTVH-2FWWb1VMO5l0C3BDn5I5oH88mOksuI6zAbp1jMDcD72cI8ufLkH8Ih54oeAu-2FcKR5YZPhLOugA3QIyqGtPY9T0p1hrhzY2rV4oHQ-3D-3DJqIA_A6np-2Bq5dXU-2FiKWa-2Fp5HTh7RsUKLz6cpNRkRykbD0MirTonkm2BUyzuT1AVVrUfmniFdYCFqLRSJWx0j09I-2BetLeeJi3LVU5ULLSniSISpdBRWADqy0sWb8pG-2FTZ-2FBsqQ6gEyhWmpd3PE2ismvodkJPJmThHao7Srcexj096LNBU1KNWpKvgSwJQFkZQ6b500bmoP6-2FqgDIwnH3yyV5OwimYooD9gIq0DduXrKv7cQ-2FmzZIYB0hUsjwJG1ESZ9TIS5rCS3DJGARqx5zhbQO-2FYoZc8fFY9z47M-2BhxXbJzMBXA-3D)) also announced plans to launch a business version of ChatGPT called “ChatJD” on its AI platform, with applications serving retail and finance sectors.

Baidu is currently leading its rivals in the AI race, justifying a fresh look at the company’s fundamentals, says Curtis Yeung, a strategist from UOB Kay Hian (Hong Kong). Investors should note that the company’s advertising revenue is picking up as China’s economy recovers, and Baidu’s forecast price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, at about 17 times, is around the five-year average, he said.

#### Tencent and Alibaba as the winners?

But will the early leader be able to sustain its advantage? Some financial experts are tipping other big tech names as the potential winners over the longer term as the technology is put to use, leaving Baidu in a similar position to Google.

Isaac Wong of eFusion Capital noted that Baidu’s core income comes from online advertising, and its other businesses are capital intensive. If ad revenue slips, initiatives such as autonomous driving that have not yet achieved profitability could take a hit.

Wong believes that ChatGPT-style technology will be more beneficial to Alibaba and Tencent, when applied to their retail or gaming services. Alibaba can deploy chatbots to recommend products to customers on its Taobao and Tmall e-commerce platforms, helping to boost sales, he said. Meanwhile Tencent can use ChatGPT in its role-playing games, enabling conversations with characters and driving in-game sales.

As for the U.S. companies rushing into the chatbot race, both eFusion Capital’s Wong and UOB Kay Hian’s Yeung are bullish about Microsoft. Yeung believes that Microsoft, as a major investor in OpenAI, can reap synergy benefits by folding ChatGPT into products such as Azure, its cloud business.

Wong thinks ChatGPT could be woven into Microsoft’s Office software. “For example, users only need to type in a headline and ChatGPT can complete the text content,” he said. “Even if Microsoft charges $20, or even $2,000 a month, companies can still save a lot of costs, and Microsoft has a new money spinner.”

It remains to be seen how much AI chatbots will help to cut business costs in the future. But the stock market will not pass up an opportunity to shoot higher with every new tech sensation or game-changing invention.

Take the ChatGPT frenzy for example, which has even boosted companies that could end up being trampled by the rise of the chatbots. **Zhihu Inc.** (NYSE: [ZH](http://email.benzinga.com/ls/click?upn=POMTzu5hkRlP2Z45Yy-2FvXaEO-2FNpIqgURGRP25VtYu7IX5P0saz6ZW-2Bsi9wato1dHfreWonmWdNevRKfPFajrkbA-2FvhfeeG8sve-2Fv3KjX4L2SqZXRlu6wVCRNH1rjeua3sx0Bc-2BkG0TiaNgf-2FYgZwAw-3D-3DQHjA_A6np-2Bq5dXU-2FiKWa-2Fp5HTh7RsUKLz6cpNRkRykbD0MirTonkm2BUyzuT1AVVrUfmnHRa116qYytjbPjMQABWIcTg4ImHWTxZODbzQo4HxBr9eurUN2NU2aw8ix1ey2Hb7zJLFRP3OK8tsdMctgSLdXKjNE00NiHY8EDToGXkdanp7QtIrAdIpBEGjk1qpuQiMJhfpSMp-2FyF6CHvOrBkAxg8tX0yQy-2FdKaf-2Br-2FzSmfGtrIJxYGfM7n8KbLvq8cuiRbNw0T8CD6VVcQrQkMKA9YHWYeMfjVdAFdecR-2Fa-2Fc6bak-3D)), a Quora-like Q&A network, enjoyed a one-day surge of nearly 60% in the market rally even though ChatGPT is likely to steal some of its traffic in the future.

Among mainland A-shares, many ChatGPT-like stocks rose by the daily limit for several days in a row, resembling last year’s “metaverse frenzy” over virtual and immersive products.

Chinese authorities are already ringing alarm bells about the risks of the chatbot frenzy. The Securities Times published an article warning readers against rushing head-long into the market, saying some listed companies are still far from commercializing their AI chatbots and others have only just dipped their toes into the emerging technology."

Well, not exactly. But, Bitcoin smashes through $24k and most of the crypto market is in the green. Keep an eye out for $25k, as that’s the last resistance level with Bears sitting on it. TNFA.

Well it is no surprise that Bitcoin has established the highest monthly returns since October 2021, and this is just speaking of January. Ethereum’s Zhejiang testnet went live yesterday, a precursor to actual staking withdrawals to occur in later in March. Total token unlocks for the month is estimated to be at $588m. Aptos has been the month’s biggest winner, gaining over 500% in 2023 so far. Avalanche, gained 3.4% over Q4. And the new kids on the block, the Djed Stablecoin has minted over $10m in the first 24hrs after launch, boosting its L1 host Cardano by 4% in a single day.

Court examiner concludes that former CEO Alex Mashinsky of Celsius operated the business “like a ponzi scheme.” Tether immediately comes out to say that they never borrowed from Celsius (who asked you?). As the bridge wars rage on, Squid and Axelar have made 25 blockchains natively accessible. As for the gaming/meta wars, startup “Addressable” closes a $7.5m raise to enable web3 companies to onboard users at scale. Meanwhile, “Immutable Passport” has set their sights on becoming the goto Gamertag for web3.

Elon makes headlines confirming his plans to use Twitter as a payment platform, but may implement legacy technology before utilizing any blockchain. He also dispels any conspiracy theories about CBDCs — as if we can’t clearly see what is going on. Around the world, its the UK that takes the massive step of creating “a robust” policy dealing with cryptocurrencies. The Philippines receives a provider for the Bitcoin Lightning Network, a long-awaited scaling solution for the king crypto. Silvergate bank flies too close to the sun and is getting scrutinized by the US Senate for its activities with FTX.

Ride height smaller rally tires,rallycross,10kt6pd,2023-01-25 02:37:09,8,0.91,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/rallycross/comments/10kt6pd/ride_height_smaller_rally_tires/,elektrowurst,Question,I can get 15 inch rally tires with dimensions 195/50. Before that I drove 16 inch 195/50 street winter tires without reinforced sidewalls and ride height was ok! So if theoretically radius is decreased by 0.5 inch: will ride height rly be affected by 0.5 inch or will the the stiffer sidewalls result in less lowering during actual driving on gravel?
Mario kart tour 2022 review,MarioKartTour,100vcs5,2023-01-01 17:25:18,18,0.77,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarioKartTour/comments/100vcs5/mario_kart_tour_2022_review/,No_Breadfruit7951,:flairDiscussion: Discussion,"Now that 2022 has come to an end, I think it's safe to say that this has been the best year for tour ever.

We have only had, like, 2 filler tours, all the others added smt new. For nitros, we got city tracks in tours other than the ones that they debuted in and anniversary tour. Plus the quality of city tracks is way better (bangkok). Amsterdam was simultaneously introduced and finished in a year. Berlin and LA were also finished this year (WE FINALLY GOT BERLIN 1 AND LA 2, LETS GO!!!) Ninja hideaway and merry mountain returned, goated tracks. We got a brand new nitro that isn't a city, being sky high sundae (I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS, IT'S A TOUR NITRO, NOT AN 8DX ONE)

And for retros, with 2 years of only having 2 double dash tracks, we got over double that this year with baby park, daisy cruiser and dk mountain (all rly great picks). And we also got 3 more wii tracks, over double the amount we had before this year for the 2nd time, 2 of them were even introduced right next to each other, being coconut mall and koopa cape, plus both r fan faves and retro tracks from 7. And ofc mushroom gorge. We only got 2 snes tracks and 1 snes rmx track, so that's good. Super circuit has gotten loads of love, getting 6 tracks this year (the THRID time we got over double the amount we had before this year). The tracks were sky garden, bowser's castle 3, boo lake, riverside park and snow land (all good remakes except for sky garden and bowser castle 3). The first ever gba track got a RMX version. Both RMX tracks r actually good and the best ones. 7 is one step closer to having all its courses in tour. At the very start of the year/end of 2021, we got our very first, proper 3d bowser's castle. DS wasn't treated that well but we did get peach gardens, which got an amazing visual overhaul. From 64, we got yoshis valley and luigi's raceway, a great and good track. And luigi's raceway was the final retro track from 7 to be in tour. That is honestly quite impressive, what makes it even better is that this year, tours introduced 2 courses at once, like bowser's castle 3 and rmx bowser's castle 1. But that's not even the half of it.

For characters and alts, charging chuck made his mario kart debut (and also got a gold variant) and petey piranha finally came back in all his giant glory, after nearly 20 years. That may be it for new characters but alts is a whole other story. Mario and peach actually didn't get that many alts this year, THANK GOODNESS. The ones we did get were great, like samurai mario and happi peach. Luigi and daisy got loads of alts, I'm so happy. Vacation luigi is just perfect. Knight and golf luigi were unexpected but welcome. Thai daisy is stunning. And sailor and farmer daisy are cute. Dr mario has finally come into mario kart. The other 3 doctors making it in too was a very good surprise and a nice tribute to dr mario world. Gold egg yoshi and volendam rosalina are beasts in ranked. Some more cat and tanooki folks were added. We got some more colours of shy guys, pit toads, yoshis and birdos. And ofc, we got our first koopaling alt, snow larry. It's honestly a very good alt. Now we just need DK to get an alt, whenever that'll be.

Miis were also added to tour. While I'm not a fan of the forced helmets, some of the designs are pretty cool. Plus, it's just fun racing as urself in mario kart.

I don't rly know much about the karts and gliders but there have been some cool ones this year. Like petey's car also returning with him. Or the sandwich glider. Or the record setter, showing u how long u've been gliding for (there rly should be a record of ur gliding score). And, ofc, the gliders of all 4 bros' mustaches. Just show them to any tour hater to shut them right up.

We also got 4 team rallies this year, which were pretty fun. No clue y we got 2 peach vs bowser tours tho. At least peach got her revenge against bowser, she rly doesn't stop unless she wins. (Only my 2nd team rally loss btw)

Datamining got so much better too. Now, we can look at ID gaps in the files to see if there are any potential tracks coming to the game and so many new ones have been discovered due to this (I won't name any here, dw). Ik it's not apart of the game but it's awesome and I think it's important enough to be discussed.

A bunch of new quality of life features were introduced as well. A big one, the menus were changed to run at 60 fps instead of 30. And it's SO SMOOTH now. Level 8 was added to drivers, and with it, normal drivers could have their skills be upgraded, and high end drivers unlocked another track, as well as the usual stat boosts. U can now move between players in players before a race starts (and see the low poly models in all their glory). New minigames were added, like the ""big reverse race vs 100"". Quick tickets were made to actually be useful by gaining the ability swap out the daily selects with a new batch once a day. They later could be used 3 times a day for the spotlight shop once it was added. Challenges u completed could be hidden, this is so much better. U no longer have to scroll through 20 different cards just to find the right one. When finishing a course, ur best score u ever earned for that track will display. This one's a big one, get ready, now we can actually retry a course once we've finished it. COMPETETIVE PLAYERS REJOICE! U can also go straight to the next one from the completion screen, but who cares about that, no one uses that.

But the 2 main reasons that 2022 is the best year for tour are...

The battle mode. It's honestly so fun, I barely played multiplayer before this. But I play so much now. Especially due to the inclusion of the multiplayer pipe. Even tho u move pretty slow, its a top 5 battle mode for me, just cos it's actually an elimination mode. (Pls nintendo, add a stock mode to 8dx, pls I'm begging u). Hopefully they add more battle maps in the future tho.

The other big thing is the removal of gacha. Some ppl prefer the gacha but this is sm better, sure the prices r a bit too high but at least u know what ur getting and u can pick and choose what u want (providing u have the rubies ofc). And there's the aforementioned discounts for the spotlight items. The main reason the game is better without gacha is that it no longer preys on ppl with no self control, which was pretty disgusting ngl, even if it was better then other mobile games. Not to mention, the gacha removal just takes away the big, main reason ppl hate tour. It just makes the tour haters even more ridiculous then they were before.

2022 was a finominal year for tour, I love this game sm and I can't wait to see what 2023 has in store. Thank you, DeNA!"
