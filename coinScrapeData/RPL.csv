The Most Popular Esports for Gambling,SportsBetNews,1i9x61j,2025-01-25 16:11:32,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SportsBetNews/comments/1i9x61j/the_most_popular_esports_for_gambling/,NonWiseGuy,,"Esports have been going from strength to strength over the last few decades and it seems like an obvious market when there is such a large fan base that follows the professional scene. The fact that there a massive competitions with prize pools into the millions of dollars shows that have been running for a long time, shows there is huge commitment, with online streamers also contributing to the popularity of games. These high profile tournaments have strict compliance and monitoring, which allows the bookmakers to feel a little bit more secure that they are offering genuine odds. On that basis, which games do you think make up the top five when it comes to eSports betting? Here they are..

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive

The original Counter Strike all began on the 1st of November 2000, based off the half life engine. It has gone through many upgrades and revolutions, with CS:GO being released in 2012. It instantly drew in lots of avid gamers who enjoy the fast paced play and is also a hit with a variety of betting markets.

DOTA 2

The second most popular esports title in the betting sphere, behind CS:GO. It features intense 5v5 multiplayer battles where each player can choose from over 100 unique characters using special abilities. There is a huge scene for Dota 2 tournaments which frequently set new records for prize pool amounts. The main annual tournament ""The International"" has a prize pool of over $30 million

League of Legends

Stood as an epic leader in the esports world for a long time but has seen that title take a wobble in recent years. It is still massively popular and involves players seeking to crush opponents in a 5v5 battle arena, where your team has to dismantle the enemy base before they destroy yours.

Valorant

A relative newcomer in the scene, but found on most esport betting markets. It began in 2020 yet has rocketed to the top of titles that take the most bets. It's similar in concept to CS:GO. It has some competitions with top prizes of $100,000 and over.

Call of Duty

Maybe the most recognizable title as it is a mainstream brand that is very well known to console gamers and offers a cross platform version on PC's. It has an official Call of Duty League with 12 professional teams, each having it's own logo like an NFL squad. $6 million is available to be won every season and it creates huge audiences for the game.

"[M4A] (A Playing as multiple F) (Always Open) Huge Idea Drop: Harem-Themed Anime & Fandom RP Prompts Packed with Story, Action, and Just the Right Amount of Smut! (Anime, Rule 34. Fandoms, Games.)",harrypotterrp,1i9p8ah,2025-01-25 10:24:19,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotterrp/comments/1i9p8ah/m4a_a_playing_as_multiple_f_always_open_huge_idea/,septimusrp,,"18+ for smut themes.

Hey there! I’m Septimus (M) And it’s nice to meet you!

Today I’m coming forward with the desire to RP as an OC in OC x OC or OC x CC harem based prompts.(I’m greedy, I know but what’s RP without wish fulfilment?)

For my replies I only write in first person and the length of my replies vary from a singular paragraph to a few solid ones depending on how much is given, and how much is going on in a scene.

I figured I’d put a fair warning here that if you reply with low detail, I won’t be rping with you. I’m not looking for a few words as a response. While that might be your thing, that's fine and power to you! It’s just not mine.

I’m someone who likes a nice balance of build-up and story to go along with the smut. I’m not the biggest fan of constant sex, or sex that starts within one or two replies. I also like cute dates and moments, and love to type out action driven moments.

What I look for in a partner:

Third Person responses (Unless you're playing a “main” OC among the harem. Swapping between first person for each character in a harem situation puts too much stress on my tiny brain.)

Don’t take control of my character at any point. Self explanatory but if you write that he does something or has a reaction to something I didn’t write myself it’s majorly off putting and a major red flag for me.

Active: I totally understand that life may not give us time for our hobbies, this is mainly aimed towards the fellas at the back who only are able to write once a week.Sadly for me I finid it kills momentum. I personally try to get at the very least 1 reply out a day, though more is preferred if we both have the time! :)

Communicative: It kinda links in with the other but if you're not feeling the RP or you're busy. Please just let me know, I’m happy to wait for a reply so long as I have a heads up! Also we don’t both need to be online to RP I generally go off the idea that we both reply whenever we’re able to and the other will get to it once we’re up for it/online.

Please for the love of god don’t spam me every 5 mins. I get that you can get excited, and I do too! But sometimes it just comes across as extremely pushy. I’m not ignoring you, I’ll get to you ASAP, promise! Sending roleplay ideas/questions is totally fine!

Detailed responses: Anything just around a paragraph (4+ sentences though it depends on the RP AND my response.) is enough, but more is always very much appreciated.

I don’t do group RPS and I don’t play as female characters.

Now to get into the meat and potatoes, I’ll post my kinks and limits. There’s a lot there and not all of them will be applicable to the starters. Aside from Harems. Those are compulsory.

=====

Kinks:

Harems – (Which doesn’t mean playing a bunch of characters at once. If you prefer to play 1 character per scene that’s fine, though the minimum amount of overall characters I’ll take in a harem/RP would be 4 though more is heavily preferred! This kink is currently compulsory for all my rps)

Outercourse (Which is stuff like titjobs, thigh jobs, grinding, hot dogging, that kinda thing), Risky/public spaces. (Places you can get caught but don’t. Toilet stalls, changing booths, that kinda thing), Facials, Freckles (Face and body), Big, nicely shaped bums (Especially if they jiggle… just an overall fan of the jiggle if I’m honest), Creampies, Cum on tits/body, big cumshots, thigh high socks, shower/water sex (places like pools, showers, hot tubs that kinda things, and a Mutual desire for sex. I also like pubic hair as long as it’s not overly bushy, trimmed/slightly bushy is where it’s at. :). I’m also into the rougher stuff. Things like Anal, rough sex. Choking, Spanking all that as well!

Limits:

Pregnacy, which also includes lactation (Hard limit, sorry), Vomit, Piss, Blood, toilet stuff, knife/gunplay, noncon, Gangbangs (reverse gangbangs with females is fine), non hetero pairings, Rimming/pegging, cartoonishly large proportions, NTR, (There could be more that I haven’t thought of, if you’re unsure feel free to ask)

There could be more that I might be into, that hasn’t been listed so feel free to ask about it and we can work something out. And without further ado let’s head straight into it.

I’ve made an easy access list for you to read through to see if anything piques your interest before you have to scroll through this abundant list.

Of course, due to reddit’s character limits I’ll just be posting a few of the starters below, so you can get a handle on my writing, any other ideas you might be interested in feel free to shoot me a PM and I can send those to you!

Idea 1: My Harem (Hero) Academia.

(So for this one, my character will be a transfer into class 1-A. From Shiketsu. His power is that of Persuasion. With the power he’s able to convince someone to do something as if it’s their own free will. That being said he’s rather hesitant to use it on other people and due to the stigma around his quirk he’s been seen as an outcast and a freak and has been constantly harassed due to the nature of his quirk.)

(The idea I have for this RP is that the girls of class 1-A will help him come out of his shell and accept that his quirk isn’t the villainous thing that other people have led him on to be. This is more of a “Love Route” though I suppose a more selfish route is also available! Also if you wanted to branch out to internships with heroes like Mirko and Mt Lady that’s available too! It’s currently set after the training camp arc and will continue from there.)

Starter: It was a day which started like most others in Class 1-A. The students got ready in the dorms and headed to class to chat among themselves while they waited for Aizawa to enter. However, unlike most days there seemed to be an extra desk placed in the room. The seat caused some confusion which didn’t last long as the first bell rang and Aizawa entered the room.

“Morning everyone.” He stated in his mainly bored and sleepy tone which seemed to sound like he was stifling a yawn. “Today we’ve got a new student transferring in from another school. He’s from Shiketsu, some of you may recognize the name since it’s got the same level of prestige as U.A. but regardless, make sure he feels welcome.” He said, pointing a sweeping stare at everyone and finally resting on the problem student of the U.A class Bakugo.

With that he fell silent and I felt it was my cue to enter. Swallowing a little at the nerves I steeled them quickly and entered. Nervously my blue eyes sweep over some of the familiar faces in the room. Many of the students had standout performances in the UA sports festival and as well in the news reports about the villain attack on the training camp.

I had a lot to live up to if I wanted to join these legends in training but regardless, I was determined to do just that. Breathing a little and shifting my auburn hair from my eyes I smiled the best I could. “My name is Schwarzer, Chris Schwarzer. It’s a pleasure to meet you all.” I say bowing to the class.

Satisfied with the introduction, Aizawa nodded to the spare seat in the room. Taking that as an order I nodded back and headed over to my seat sitting down and getting my books out. Curiously I turned to the seat next to me noticing one of the girls in the class and gave her a slight smile as Aizawa began his lesson.

=====

Idea 2: One Piece.

(I’m not so sure how I want to approach this one, however I’ll jump in and give it a go. Much like the MHA starter this character will have the power of Persuasion. Having eaten the Persua-Persua fruit. I’m thinking for now either he makes a crew with characters from the story, or he joins the Straw Hats and goes on adventures with them. (Obviously this doesn’t have to be canon and completely made up as we go.) Either way I’m super keen on this since I love One Piece to death. I also have a list of potential crewmates I can send!)

Starter: Adventure! Freedom, Treasure and Booze! These were all the things a pirate needed in life. And exactly what every pirate set out to obtain. Two years after the events at Marineford where Strawhat Luffy himself took on the government with an army behind him, and the Whitebeard Pirates at his side in order to rescue his brother… And two years since I felt inspired enough in his absence to set forth on my own.

I gathered up a strong crew and made a name for myself. My alias, Silver Tongue Schwarzer, is a nice title which rolled off the tongue. I had no issues amassing a sizable bounty at 90 million berries. While it wasn’t as grand as other pirates, the world government saw enough of a threat in my power to provide a bounty that large. Of course, had my powers been widely known it’d have rocketed higher.

So then why was I now sitting at a bar on the Sabaody Archipelago, alone and staring into the amber liquid of booze in a mug? It was simple. Mutiny. Those whom I had trusted most among my crew turned on a dime and after reaching the Archipelago they threw me overboard and turned around. To where I didn’t know and quite frankly after their betrayal I didn’t care.

“Damn them. Damn them all.” I muttered under my breath cursing as I downed the rest of my contents. “Another!” I called out to the barkeep who approached to fill my mug.

“You’re looking a little rough there, are you sure you need another?” The bartender asked as he took the mug from me.

“I don’t have anything else to do. I don’t even know what else to do with myself.” I responded grumpily. “Just fill it up.” I demanded.

“Right.” The bartender responded as he filled it with more of the alcoholic amber liquid and slid It in front of me.

=====

Idea 3: Jujutsu Kaisen.

(So I’ve completed the anime and read up to date for Jujutsu Kaisen (No spoilers) and I really enjoy it. I’ve got an interesting idea for a curse ability, my character’s power is basically he emits smells. Mostly for support, however his ability is so strong that he’s unable to turn it off. He always smells great to anyone who smells him, almost like a pheromone. And to cursed spirits it’s a lure. Because of this he wears a lot to cover up his body so he doesn’t let out as much of his scent. He’s in Jujutsu Tech now because he wanted to learn how to use different smells for different things and one day he hopes to be able to control his powers. :) )

Starter: The sounds of fabric ripping filled the air followed up by my swearing as my scent was released into the air. This was bad. My scent leaking out meant that every cursed spirit within a few blocks would barrel down on my position.

It seemed the time for subtlety was out the window and as such I pulled the large hood back and unzipped my jacket which was usually zipped all the way up to cover half my face. Underneath my body was bare. I mean wearing a large coat all day with extra layers was just asking to make me sweat like a pig. I tossed my coat to the side and threw my gloves along with it.

My cursed energy seeped out increasing the potency and the range of my smell. My eyes narrowed at the grade three curse spirit which was staring me down. “Sleep.” I say clapping my hands together as my scent changed to that of a sleep agent.

The cursed spirit swayed a little before collapsing to the ground. My smell even caused me to sway a little as I breathed it in, however I had built up an immunity to it. The sounds of more cursed spirits barreling down on my position could be heard all around me as I grabbed my coat and my gloves and made a run for it into a nearby building. I didn’t have time to finish the spirit off before I ran into the building. This would be a better place for me to fight them given that my smell could permeate more efficiently than it would in an open space.

I wasn’t sure if help was going to come, but for now I’d operate under the assumption that it wasn't.

=====

Idea 7: Fairy Tail

(I love the girls from Fairy Tail, I find them all super hot! As for my character he’s going to be an OC Slayer called a Demon Slayer. My character will use fire based magic to increase his speed and force of attacks. I have some ideas for some missions, but we can keep it pretty casual :))

Starter: Another day in magnolia and another party being held at the large guild building at the centre of town. A large-scale job had just finished with some of the senior ranking wizards. and even though I wasn’t part of that mission, instead being on my own D-Rank job I joined in on the celebrations.

I had only been part of the guild for a couple of weeks and so far, it’s not been as exciting as I’d hoped, although I figured that it’d pick up once I proved myself. I was drinking by myself when I was approached by Makarov. He was wearing an eccentric looking orange outfit. “Schwarzer my boy!” He said as he patted me on the shoulder. “How are you fitting in?” He questioned.

“Fine sir! Everyone has been very welcoming.” I say to him in response.

“Glad to hear it! You’ve been doing a good job, although I’d like to see you do more.” The male said. “So I’ve arranged a partner for you on your next job, that way you can take on something more challenging, what do you say?” He questioned.

“Yes of course!” I say eagerly as a smile spread across my face.

“Great!” He said cheerfully. “I’ll introduce you to who you’ll be working with.” He said as he stood from his spot and led the way over to a female clearing his throat loud enough to get their attention.

=====

Idea 9: Bleach

(So a new human soul reaper makes it into the soul society. His power isn’t great to begin with simply being enough to take out the average hollow. And with the resurgence of the hollow threat the Soul Society has offered to give him a substitute badge to take out those hollows deemed too small for the soul society to handle. Maybe he’s paired up with someone or someone like Orihime steps in to help him grow.)

Starter: Another boring day at university followed by a night of boring patrols. With all the big hollows being taken care of by “Full-fledged” Soul reapers it didn’t leave me with much opportunity to train against bigger enemies.

At least that’s what I thought originally. A few blocks from me there was a rift which opened up and the pure spiritual pressure that came from the hollow that stepped out of it was enough to make me feel as though gravity itself was pushing against me.

It was hard to breathe and even harder to stand as my hand clutched my blade in my left hand tightly. I shook my head as I heard the loud roar of the large breast and could even see its towering form from my position.

It was nothing close to a menos, but it was enough to tower over a three-story building for sure. “Damn.” I hissed to myself as I knew there were no soul reapers around at this stage. With a threat this big I was sure they’d come, but until then it was up to me to buy some time and make sure no humans or souls were consumed.

Pushing myself forward I reached the park that the Hollow had appeared in. Thankfully the park was deserted at this time of night.

When he saw me, the hollow let out a low growl. “You don’t smell like much, but you’ll do as a snack.” The hollow commented as it charged forward.

“Just evade, buy time.” I commented to myself as I began to leap around the battlefield looking a bit like and feeling like an idiot.

The hollow toyed with me a little while enjoying the chase before it seemed to get bored. Just when I was thinking I was fast enough to keep avoiding it the creature’s mouth opened and its forked tongue shot out at me with faster speed than I was anticipating. I raised my blade to defend myself but it was a feeble attempt and I knew it wouldn’t be enough.

=====

Idea 21: Final Fantasy VII. (Others Can be done! :))

(So this one will be set in the world of Final Fantasy VII, however if you’re looking to do others, I’m more than happy to do so! I’m familiar with them all. Mainly 7 and 14 But this one will be focused on FF VII, since Jessie, Yuffie, Tifa and Aerith are best girls! If you wanted to mix this up with FF 14 and have them transported to Eorzea we can make something up!)

Starter: Midgar. Easy place to find work given you were capable enough. There were a lot of monsters prowling the highways between sectors and a lot of people willing to pay mercenaries to get the job done.

“Hiyah!” I called out as I cleaved my blade through the neck of a monster severing its head from the rest of its body and slaying it instantly. It was a tough fight but I overcame it. I panted a little as my muscles relaxed and I slid my blade back into its sheath. The job I was on was simple, kill the beast and return its head to a barkeep in sector 5. I scooped the beast’s head up into a burlap sack and hoisted it over my shoulder before I headed back to the bar.

By this point I was a rather well-known mercenary. Jobs exterminating monsters were easy to come by and easy enough to complete. Plus, the payout paid for my room and for most of my meals. As I entered the bar I headed up to the counter and placed the bloody burlap sack on the counter. “Got it done.” I say to the barkeep.

The older man, his hair and beard white with age frowned a little and looked at the bag. The blood splatter on the counter… which he had just cleaned was enough to let him know that I was serious and he placed the sack full of gil on the counter.

“Thanks.” I say as I picked up the purse. It was lighter than I expected, but even if it was short I wasn’t about to start an argument. In return to my manners, I got a short grunt back.

“Don’tcha forget about disposin of that thing, I ain’t want it.” He said waving his hand dismissively towards the bag.

“Right, I’ll get on that.” I say as I grabbed the sack.

“An there was a woman lookin for you.” He stated. “Said she’d be waitin for you in buildin next to the orphanage.” He stated.

“Right, thanks.” I said to the man and headed out, disposing quickly of the severed head in the sack before I headed up to the building in question. I frowned as I peered inside. My eyes looking around for any sign of someone out of place. It did seem a little crowded in the building after all. I was about to announce myself when I felt a hand tap my shoulder and turned to see who it was.

=====

Idea 26: Cyberfuck(punk) 2077.

(Recently I’ve gotten back into Cyberpunk and after watching the anime which broke my heart, I think the world will be an interesting one to RP in, I don’t have too much in mind in terms of story, but I figured we’d have a bunch of mini adventures across the setting of Night City, maybe a gang being built up or something. As for the starter, I’ve left it open ended enough for you to come in any direction, wanna be one of the Tyger Claws? The victim they had cornered? Another Edgerunner? Even a NCPD Officer, Civilian, all of it is open up! :) )

Starter: “Good morning Night City! Another busy night has passed in our beautiful little hamlet! Several corpos have turned up dead, Overdose? Or Corporate espionage? You tell me! Let’s not forget the gang wars breaking out! Everyone wants their own slice of heaven, but it seems they’re more than willing to get their hands dirty for it!”

The sound of the news broadcast was drowned out by heavy rain as I walked the neon soaked streets of Night City. Boots splashing through neon soaked puddles.This night I had found myself walking beats I’d long since abandoned, what seemed to be a lifetime ago, a different version of myself.

I shook it off, I needed air, and the streets of Watson’s back alleys, a charming concoction of half trash fire, half combat zone filled my nostrils. The pistol on my belt made for an easy-access defence while the old NCPD badge hung heavy in my pocket.

I should have turned it in when I quit, but I figured there was still a use for it here and there. I shook it off and soon the yell of a voice cutting through the heavy rain. I pressed my back against concrete, my eyes seeing four distinct shapes standing around a fifth.

Tiger Claws by the look of them, their ink and chromed out mantis blades had some poor person surrounded, the way their taunts echoed off the alley walls made it clear this wasn’t just a polite meet up.

“It’s not my problem.” I muttered to myself as I took a step back before finding a sigh escaped my lips.

Old habits die hard.

I stepped out, my boots splashing a puddle as I took a breath. “Four against one hardly seems fair.” I called out. The gangers turned to face me, their neon-lit tattoos glowed in the rain making them stand out even more.

“What the hell do you want Choom? You lost?” Came the growling voice of one of the men.

“I’m just out for a stroll, but why don’t we all just take a second to get along hm?” I offered.

The leader of this merry group sneered, his cyberoptics narrowing. “You think this is funny? You just signed your death warrant, you gonk.” He snarled.

I shook my head as my hand reached down to my pistol, pulling the piece and cocking it in one fluid motion. “Time to see if I’ve still got it.” I say bringing the weapon up and firing off a shot. As the first shot rang out the alley lit up like a war zone.

=====

Idea 30: Harry Potter.

(So to keep this one interesting I’m thinking of having it set in an AU where Voldemort and Harry don’t exist. However, there are still dark wizards who are part of a cult around. Defs looking for a Hermionie, Luna or Ginny, you could even have other known people as teachers or students for this one! Ocs are of course welcome too! I do have a reference list for this one as well. Feel free to ask me for that!)

Starter: Another year at Hogwarts, the last for some; and another year of learning was right around the corner. Although times were not peaceful in the wizarding world. Aurors who were the police of the magical world were going missing or showing up dead.

The ministry not wanting to make a panic kept it fairly under wraps, however some of the families have come forward with the information and rumours abound about what was really happening.

Stepping off the train I sighed a little rubbing my temple where a headache had begun to set in. During the train ride here, I found myself stuck next to a boy who wouldn’t stop going on about the rumours and conspiracy theories.

Glad to be off the train I looked around for a minute lost as to where I needed to go. “I know it’s around here somewhere.” I commented, although my sense of direction was always off. Usually I followed everyone else. But this time it seemed I was one of the last ones off the train.

=====

Idea 35: Multi Fandom/Dimensional hopping.

(So like a lot of these fandoms and can’t pick one? This is the RP for you! Basically my character will be given an ability/item that’ll allow him to jump to different realms and gain basic powers for each realm.It’s not super fleshed out but it’s a good starting point!)

Starter: My life was pretty usual, and nothing if not stable. Every day I got up, went to college, did my classes then trained afterwards. I wanted to be the best player on my volleyball team so I worked hard for it. Just like anyone else it wasn't like I had larger than life aspirations, I was happy to keep my head down and work hard.

Though a day soon came that changed everything. I home for my birthday when a strange package had arrived, a gauntlet of some kind, I figured it was a strange device that an aunt or uncle had given me thinking I could play games on it. I didn't think too much of it until later that night where, alone in my room I decided to see if I could test it out.

The glove seemed to form to my hand size, fitting perfectly, and before I knew it a sudden bright light shone from it. When my vision had cleared from the blinding light I realized I wasn't anywhere I recognized, and the gauntlet had changed shape and form.

(Leaving it super open ended to let you pick where we start/who we start with. It's pretty basic so far but gets us stuck in! )

=====

Those are by no means all of the starters and given the size limits of post limits I figured I’d narrow it down to some of the ones I like the most! Feel free to ask me about any of the others! Thanks so much for reading this and I hope to hear from some of you soon! :)"

2025 is going to be the year for mainstream adoption of Ethereum by public companies. It's already happening. Platforms like Rocket Pool make the bar to get into Ethereum infrastructure operations so low (compared to Bitcoin and mining operations). Also legitimized Rocket Pool greatly.

Keep an eye out for pure play Ethereum companies like $BTCS and partial Ethereum play companies like $BTBT. With ETH/BTC dominance at an all time low now, it's the perfect setup IMO. FYI CEO of this company is doing a fireside chat on Tuesday in case you wanna shill an $ETH MicroStrategy approach for him lol."

My thoughts on Pokemon Availability as someone who is trying to catch them all to send to Home.,pokemongo,1i9enmb,2025-01-24 23:05:37,1,0.6,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/1i9enmb/my_thoughts_on_pokemon_availability_as_someone/,Miyyani,Discussion,"Hi! I've been trying to capture all 865-ish Pokemon in the Pokemon Go Home Dex. You fill it out by transferring Pokemon from Pokemon Go to Pokemon Home. Right now I'm at 397. As a long time player, I thought it would be fun to mostly do brand new Pokemon that I've caught. And I was right! It is fun! It really revives the game when you have to fill out your Pokedex again.

Positives: Its really engaging utilizing all the features of the game to fill out your pokedex! Doing rockets, raids, field research tasks, eggs, nests, and of course, wild spawns! I I've been having a great time looking high and low for Pokemon, trying to strategize how to get all the ones that are currently available!

Negatives: Getting Pokemon from eggs can be somewhat annoying. It's very slow trickle, especially if you only need one specific Pokemon. Pokemon in eggs that aren't easily available in the wild are great though, because the alternative is hatching a machop or something. Also, I have a lot to say about wild spawns, specifically, how events effect them.

Wild Spawns:

This game is great fun in between events, with a ton of variety of Pokemon spawning. However, when an event is on, it feels like it's it's only the event Pokemon and the ""Rediscover Kanto"" spawns. I suppose this is great for people who really want to stock up on these event Pokemon, but as for me, I catch everything in a few hours and then wild spawns are basically dead to me. Events also ruin the Field Research Pool. Once an event is on, it's pretty difficult to get the seasonal field research that contains a wide variety of Pokemon.

Here is my suggestion for how wild spawns should work. Seasonal and Rediscover Kanto spawns should be biome dependent, with an 80 percent chance to match the Biome and a 20 percent chance of getting something from outside your biome. This makes it worth it to visit other biomes, but still gives you a chance to get something new in your regular area. Also, biomes should have an indicator in the corner, like weather.

Between events: 80 percent seasonal spawns, 20 percent rediscover Kanto spawns.  
  
During event: 50 percent seasonal spawns, 40 percent event spawns, and 10 percent rediscover Kanto Spawns

At a Nest: 70 percent nest spawns, 20 percent seasonal spawns, 10 percent event spawns.

Also, I think Nests should have some kind of boosted shiny or XL rate. Some reason to seek them out for long-time players. And they should be on the Campfire Map. And they should have a capture challenge every season to catch every single nesting Pokemon. Would be fun seeking them out!

  
With these changes I think the game could be really fun, with a large variety of spawns that make it worth opening the app and exploring. As it is right now, events and rediscover kanto are ruining my life. Thank you for reading my long af rant.

LOCKED IN DAY 25 PICKS,nbabetting,1i96t09,2025-01-24 16:41:07,81,0.99,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/nbabetting/comments/1i96t09/locked_in_day_25_picks/,Kitchen-Branch2658,,"Hey guys! Apologies for a bit of a late post today. There are only three games on today, however it was quite difficult in finding picks for these games as there is a lot less confirmations and correlations in these games. No ""very good"" status for any of the games today. Definitely one of the worser days for betting however I believe some value can still be found in the plays today although it is acceptable to skip today's betting as the day tomorrow has a lot more value!

Nonetheless, here are the picks and the analysis for them.

I will keep updating this list as it draws close to the games, there may still be changes so keep an eye on this post if you aren't certain about the bets you are going to place.

Most confident bets are marked with \*\*\*

Top picks (-135)

2-leg

\- Cavs -3.5

\- Grizzlies -3.5

4-leg (-116)

\- Jarrett Allen 10+ points

\- Deni avdija 1+ threes

\- Desmond bane 15+ points

\- Darius garland 15+ points

3-leg (risky)

\- Cavs -3.5

\- Grizzlies -3.5

\- Blazers win

**Cavaliers vs 76ers**

Cavaliers injuries - Evan mobley OUT, Caris lavert GTD

76ers injuries - Joel Embiid OUT, Jared Mccain OUT, Caleb Martin OUT

Game quality: Good

Risks: Cavaliers will be playing a second leg of a B2B tomorrow against the rockets. They will be a revenge spot and may value and plan for that game more than vsing the 76ers. This may lead to some complacency against the 76ers and the starters may not play as much to conserve energy which would result in a much closer match than it should be. 

2 Recent H2H data to be used. One on November 14th 2024 and one on December 22nd 2024. On the 14th, cavs win by 8 points over the 76ers. The cavs had their entire starting lineup while the 76ers were missing paul, tyrese and jared. The cavs played away. On December 22nd the cavs beat the 76ers by 27 points. A much better performance, and this time it was played at cavs home while the matchup was against the current lineup for tomorrow, tyrese and paul but no jared and joel. Cavs had evan mobley in that game who had a great impact at 22 points. Cavs tomorrow will be missing Evan mobley. This time, cavs will be playing away and their current away history is not great, losing to rockets, having a close game with timberwolves, losing to thunders by 20. The 76ers will have a 1 day rest advantage over the cavs. For recent performance, the cavs have not been performing as they have this season, coming off a 1 point loss to the rockets, 20 point loss to the thunders, 15 point loss to the pacers in their last 6 games, the cavs’ 3 out of 7 total losses this entire season came from these last 6 games alone. The cavs average a 121 point offensive rating this season currently while in the last 6 games, this has dropped to 116. Even raptors are beating them in offensive rating in the last 6. This is not far off the 76ers who have an offensive rating of 112 in the last 6. The cavs’ defensive rating has also worsened from a season average of 111 points allowed to 115 points allowed. 76ers have been doing very bad recently, coming off a 35 point loss to nuggets. They key thing to note about 76ers performance recently is the absence of Joel Embiid and jared mccain. In the last 9 games, they were absent, and in those 9 games, the only win was a mere 6 point win over the wizards, the worst team in the league currently, and in that game, jordan poole wasn’t even playing! This team has clearly been suffering greatly from these injuries and the point differentials against the teams they vs directly correlates to this. 5 out of the 9 games were 10+ point losses, with the closest point differential was a 5 point loss to the magic, who are also suffering from injuries and are doing just as bad, if not worse lately. Despite Cavs missing a key player evan mobley, they 6 foot 9 jarrett allen who fulfills a similar role as a center. Despite the recent decline in the performance by the cavs, they are still a very solid team and the 76ers are an absolute mess currently and there is no reason they would be able to win this match. My pick for this is Cavs -5.5. 

Straights

* Darius garland over 21.5 points

Legs

* Jarrett allen 10+ points\*\*\*
* Darius garland 15+ points\*\*\*
* Jarrett allen 8+ rebounds
* Georges niang 4+ rebounds
* Cavs -5.5\*\*\*

Riskier leg but worth

* Darius garland 20+ points\*\*\*

**Hornets vs Blazers**

Blazers injuries - deandre ayton OUT

Hornets injuries - Brandon miller OUT, Lamelo ball OUT, Miles bridges OUT

I will update this when injuries are confirmed. Check back later and I may be able to find value here depending on the confirmed injuries\*

UPDATE 1: LAMELO AND MILES BRIDGES OUT, MOST STARTERS FOR HORNETS

Game quality: Poor -> Okay

Risks: Many injuries, no good H2H, both teams are quite inconsistent. All around messy game. 

No good H2H can be used here as the H2H was long ago with different lineups. The hornets will be playing at home this time. The hornets have played quite well recently from home with a recent 5 point win over mavericks and 11 point win over the suns. The hornets will also have a rest advantage over the blazers who are going to be on their second leg of a B2B against the hornets. The blazers do not have a good B2B history, losing to a mavericks team who was missing kyrie. Along with being their third game playing away, they will be hit by travel fatigue. In terms of recent performance, the blazers are on a 3 game win streak, they won against bulls, then won against a broken heats team without tyler, and an easy win over magic who are doing terrible lately due to their injuries. Hornets have been doing quite well recently, being only 12 point down vsing the grizzlies, a 5 point win over the mavericks and win over the bulls. A spread is very hard to decide here due to many different conflicting confirmations and the inconsistency of both teams and the different lineups and injuries. For research and data collection purposes I would lean towards a blazers +6.5. 

Straights

* Toumani over 1.5 assists \*\*\*
* Blazers win (risky)

Legs potential

* Deni avdjia 1+ threes\*\*\*

**Grizzlies vs Pelicans**

Grizzlies injuries - Santi Aldama OUT, Ja morant OUT

Pelicans injuries - Zion williamson OUT,

Game quality: Good

Risks: Ja morant injury report may affect their performance, undecided

UPDATE - Ja morant is OUT now, this will affect the game. Although I still believe the grizzlies spread is good.

There is 2 good recent H2H data that can be used. One around 2 months ago, grizzlies beat the pelicans by 11 points.This was when Grizzlies had the exact same matchup vsing the pelicans. This was a game played at grizzlies home. The more recent game played 1 month ago was an 8 point win over the pelicans with the exact same matchup again. This time it was played at pelicans home. The game today will be played at grizzlies home. Grizzlies excel at playing at home with a max of 4 point loss in the last 13 home games, and those games were against difficult matchups like the rockets and clippers. Without zion williamson, Pelicans in away games have won the last two which were against the wizards and 76ers who are just absolutely terrible teams currently, they won by 12 points and 8 respectively. Before that, they lost all 11 games and often by a large margin, with the smallest losses of 4 to pacers and 5 to spurs. Spurs is understandable as they were not a good team either so the point difference was not too high, and pacers at that time were not playing too well either. Other than that, it has been 10+ point losses to teams such as rockets, heats, knicks hawks, whom are of similar skill level or below grizzlies. It’s clear that playing away and without zion shows a correlation of losses being greater towards higher rank teams and lower against lower rank teams. Now the pelicans will have a 2 day rest advantage. Despite the good recent performance by pelicans without zion, they were against lower rank teams or teams with a lot of injuries, for example jazz, 76ers, wizards, mavericks. As soon as they vs a mid-higher rank team they lose by a significant amount, blazers by 19, heats by 11, rockets by 17, knicks by 11. The grizlzlies are the much better team  and especially in point differential wise, grizzlies often blow teams out, with an average point differential of 8 this season while pelicans are at -8. Pelicans tend to lose a lot when they lose. Because of all these confirmations, I think the best spread here is grizzlies -3.5 as a leg. 

Straights 

* Trey murphy over 20+ points
* CJ Mccollum over 23.5 points (Less confident now that dejounte murray is playing)
* Daniel theis over 5.5 rebounds (Good new find, credit to comments)

Legs potential

* Jaren jackson jr 15+p\*\*\*
* Desmond bane 15+p\*\*\*
* Trey murphy 2+ threes\*\*\*
* Grizzlies -3.5\*\*\*
* Daniel theis 4+ rebounds\*\*\*

Riskier

* Ja morant 6+ assists

Stay tuned. Not the best day today, but if this helps you with any confirmations or have any thoughts please share below. I'd love to hear your picks and reasoning too!"

For the second time, Intuitive Machines will launch a lunar lander to deliver NASA technology demonstrations and science investigations to the Moon for the benefit of all. Media accreditation is open for the IM-2 launch, part of NASA’s CLPS (Commercial Lunar Payload Services) initiative and Artemis campaign to establish a long-term presence on the Moon. 

The Intuitive Machines Nova-C class lunar lander will launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and carry NASA science, technology demonstrations, and other commercial payloads to Mons Mouton, a lunar plateau near the Moon’s South Pole region. Liftoff is targeted for a multi-day launch window, which opens no earlier than late February, from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

Media prelaunch and launch activities will take place at NASA Kennedy and are open to U.S. citizens and international media. U.S. media must apply by Wednesday, Feb. 12, and international media must apply by Wednesday, Feb. 5.

Media wishing to take part in person must apply for credentials at:

https://media.ksc.nasa.gov

Credentialed media will receive a confirmation email upon approval. NASA’s media accreditation policy is available online. For questions about accreditation or to request special logistical support, such as space for satellite trucks, tents, or electrical connections, please email by Wednesday, Feb. 12, to: ksc-media-accreditat@mail.nasa.gov. For other questions, please contact NASA Kennedy’s newsroom at: 321-867-2468.

Para obtener información sobre cobertura en español en el Centro Espacial Kennedy o si desea solicitar entrevistas en español, comuníquese con Antonia Jaramillo o Messod Bendayan a: antonia.jaramillobotero@nasa.gov o messod.c.bendayan@nasa.gov.

Among the items on its lander, the IM-2 mission will deliver one of the first on-site, or in-situ, demonstrations of resource utilization on the Moon, using a drill and mass spectrometer to measure the volatiles content of subsurface materials. Other technology instruments on this delivery will demonstrate a robust surface communications system and deploy a propulsive drone mobility solution.

Launching as a rideshare alongside the IM-2 delivery NASA’s Lunar Trailblazer spacecraft also will begin its journey to lunar orbit, where it will map the distribution of the different forms of water on the Moon.

A successful landing will help support the CLPS model for commercial payload deliveries to the lunar surface, as another step toward a sustainable lunar future. As a primary customer of CLPS, NASA is investing in lower-cost methods of Moon deliveries and is one of multiple customers for these flights.

NASA is working with several U.S. companies to deliver science and technology to the lunar surface through the agency’s CLPS initiative. This pool of companies may bid on task orders to deliver NASA payloads to the Moon. Contract awards cover end-to-end commercial payload delivery services, including payload integration, mission operations, launch from Earth, and landing on the surface of the Moon. These contracts are indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contracts with a cumulative maximum value of $2.6 billion through 2028.

The Best Princess Party Themes for Denver Celebrations,u_Jinanlee,1i930f8,2025-01-24 13:58:33,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Jinanlee/comments/1i930f8/the_best_princess_party_themes_for_denver/,Jinanlee,,"Hosting a princess party in Denver is an exciting way to celebrate your little one’s special day. With so many enchanting themes to choose from, the possibilities for creating a magical experience are endless. Whether you’re planning a simple gathering or a grand royal affair, a well-thought-out theme will make the day unforgettable. Here are some of the best princess party themes that will delight your child and guests alike.

# 1. Classic Fairy-Tale Princess Party

A timeless choice, the classic fairy-tale princess theme never goes out of style. This theme brings to life the magic of storybooks with castles, crowns, and royal gowns. Decorate with glittering gold and pastel hues, and create a regal atmosphere with castle-shaped backdrops and a throne for the birthday princess. Incorporate activities like storytime or crafting royal wands to keep the little guests entertained.

# 2. Enchanted Forest Theme

For a nature-inspired twist, an enchanted forest theme transforms your party into a magical woodland setting. Think twinkling fairy lights, leafy garlands, and soft, earthy tones. Add details like faux flowers, butterflies, and fairy wings to enhance the forest vibe. Activities can include building fairy houses, creating flower crowns, or a treasure hunt for hidden gems in your backyard or a Denver park.

# 3. Winter Wonderland Princess Party

Denver’s stunning winters make this theme an ideal choice, especially during colder months. Transform your venue into a snowy kingdom with white, silver, and icy blue decor. Use faux snow, snowflake cutouts, and shimmering fabric to create a frosty atmosphere. A hot cocoa bar and winter-themed crafts like decorating snowflake ornaments can keep the little ones warm and entertained.

# 4. Under-the-Sea Mermaid Princess Party

For a splash of magic, an under-the-sea theme is perfect for Denver kids who dream of being mermaid royalty. Decorate with shades of blue, purple, and teal, along with seashells, starfish, and shimmering balloons. Activities could include making seashell necklaces or a fun “fishing” game. For food, serve snacks like “ocean jello” and cupcakes with mermaid tails.

# 5. Medieval Princess and Knights Party

Transport your celebration to medieval times with a princess-and-knights theme. This imaginative idea combines princesses, castles, and even dragons for an adventurous royal affair. Set up a castle-themed play area, and provide knight costumes or shields for the young warriors. You can also organize activities like “dragon egg” hunts or a royal jousting game with pool noodles.

# 6. Royal Tea Party Theme

A royal tea party theme adds a touch of elegance to your Denver princess party. Set up small tables with fine china, tiered trays filled with finger sandwiches, and delicate pastries. Add floral centerpieces and pastel tablecloths to create a regal ambiance. Kids can dress in fancy gowns and hats, and you can include tea etiquette lessons or a cupcake-decorating activity.

# 7. Magical Unicorn Princess Party

Unicorns and princesses go hand in hand when it comes to enchanting themes. Deck your venue with rainbows, glitter, and lots of pastel colors. Unicorn balloons, streamers, and tableware can tie the theme together beautifully. Activities might include making unicorn headbands, face painting, or a piñata filled with magical goodies.

# 8. Space Princess Adventure

For a unique and out-of-this-world experience, a space princess theme is perfect for adventurous little royals. Blend the wonder of space exploration with royal flair by using silver, purple, and blue decor with star and planet motifs. You can include fun activities like DIY rocket ship crafts, a space-themed photo booth, and a “space treasure” scavenger hunt.

# 9. Garden Princess Party

Celebrate the beauty of nature with a garden princess theme. Denver’s lovely spring and summer weather make this theme ideal for outdoor gatherings. Use floral decorations, butterfly motifs, and soft pastel colors to create an enchanting garden setting. Plan activities like planting flowers, painting flower pots, or hosting a butterfly-release ceremony.

# 10. Arabian Nights Princess Party

For a more exotic vibe, an Arabian Nights theme offers a rich and colorful experience. Decorate with jewel tones, draped fabrics, and gold accents. Create a cozy setting with pillows and rugs, and plan activities like henna-inspired crafts or a treasure hunt for jewels. This theme is perfect for imaginative storytelling and creating a magical, cultural experience.

# 11. Pirate and Princess Mash-Up

If your guest list includes kids who prefer pirates over princesses, a mash-up theme can make everyone happy. Combine pirate ships and treasure maps with royal castles and tiaras. Set up separate activity zones for pirate games and princess crafts, then bring everyone together for a treasure hunt or group dance party.

# 12. DIY Craft Princess Party

A craft-focused princess party is a wonderful way to keep kids engaged while unleashing their creativity. Provide materials for making tiaras, wands, or jewelry. Decorate tables with glitter, gemstones, and art supplies that match the princess theme. The kids can take home their creations as a fun and meaningful party favor.

# 13. Cultural Princess Celebrations

Celebrate diversity with a princess party theme inspired by different cultures. Choose a princess or royal tradition from around the world and incorporate elements like traditional music, decor, and food. This is a fantastic way to create a fun yet educational experience for the kids, while honoring cultural heritage.

# 14. Rainbow Princess Party

A rainbow princess theme is all about vibrant colors and joy. Use rainbow balloons, streamers, and tableware to create a cheerful atmosphere. Include activities like rainbow slime-making or creating colorful bead bracelets. A rainbow cake with layers of bright colors inside is sure to be a hit with the kids.

# 15. Vintage Princess Theme

Take your party back in time with a vintage-inspired princess theme. Use antique-style decor like lace, pearls, and ornate frames. Dress the birthday princess in a Victorian-style gown, and encourage guests to wear vintage outfits. Activities like designing old-fashioned fans or playing classic parlor games can add to the timeless charm.

No matter which theme you choose, the key to a successful celebration is tailoring the experience to your child’s interests and adding those magical touches that make the day truly special.

Should NBA send non-playoff teams to the Euroleague playoffs?,nba,1i922az,2025-01-24 13:18:48,0,0.31,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1i922az/should_nba_send_nonplayoff_teams_to_the/,Frankaragatan,,"NBA Playoffs for this year start April 19. Euroleague playoffs start April 22.

Last year NBA was April 20, EL was April 23.

In the Euroleague, they also have a play-in in the same vein as the NBA play-in. Literally the same format for seeds 7-10.

8 teams qualify for the Euroleague playoffs. Same in the NBA, per conference.

However, instead of 7 game series, they only do 5 game series. And that's not all the way, that's just for Quarterfinal round. Semifinals and Final are one-game knockout win-or-go-home games. 

At most, the Euroleague champion would be playing 7 games. That's two weeks worth of games stretched to five weeks.

I don't think that's asking too much.

&nbsp;

But in this proposed scenario, they would be playing at most 8 games. We would add a round.

7 teams from the East are eliminated, 7 teams from the West are eliminated. 

That's the number of NFL playoff teams.

We will simply give a bye to the last team to be eliminated in the play-in (they played two games already, that's enough).

Then this will be the other three teams:

* Winner of: other play-in team vs 15 seed
* Winner of 11 seed vs 14 seed
* Winner of 12 seed vs 13 seed 

Could be home court advantage of higher seeded team, could be a neutral court. Maybe like Las Vegas or something. One game knockout to qualify.

&nbsp;

If a player like Steph doesn't want to play extra games, then he doesn't have to. The Warriors could play whoever wants to play and if they don't make to at least 12 players, they can pull from their G League roster pool in their affiliated team.

What's in it for NBA teams? Competition. Experience for younger guys. Extra money in the bank.

The knockout games happen in the same week as the play-in games. There's a rest day in between, yeah that's where the 11v14 and 12v13 will be played.

Last play-in game has to be played at April 18, so NBA teams will get at least 3 days of rest.

In their flight for the Paris games, Spurs had 3 days off and the Pacers had 4 days off. 

&nbsp;

There will be an added round of 16 where 8 Euroleague teams will play 8 NBA teams (4 East, 4 West) in the first round in a five game series. All NBA teams will automatically have a home court disadvantage. Games 3 and 4 will be played in their NBA home court. Games 1, 2 and 5 will played at Euroleague team's homecourt. It will be #1 Euro vs #8 NBA, #2 Euro vs #7 NBA, ... #8 Euro vs #1 NBA. NBA teams will be seeded based on their regular season record.

So for example for last year, the first round of the Euroleague would look something like this:

* (Euro 1) Real Madrid vs (NBA 8) Toronto Raptors \
* (Euro 4) Barcelona vs (NBA 5) Atlanta Hawks /
* (Euro 2) Panathinaikos AKTOR vs (NBA 7) Utah Jazz \
* (Euro 3) AS Monaco vs (NBA 6) Brooklyn Nets /
* (Euro 8) Baskonia vs (NBA 1) Sacramento Kings \
* (Euro 5) Olympiacos vs (NBA 4) Chicago Bulls /
* (Euro 7) Maccabi Playtika Tel Aviv vs (NBA 2) Golden State Warriors \
* (Euro 6) Fenerbahçe Beko vs (NBA 3) Houston Rockets /

They can do this kind of bracket. Or they can do re-seeding after this round. Or they can do whatever the fuck they want.

&nbsp;

Now, historically a city hosts the final four of the euroleague. Just like in the superbowl. But instead of one final game, two teams; it's three games, four teams. Two semifinal games and the championship game.

Now in this proposed scenario there will be 7 knockout games instead of the usual 3 games. On top of the 2 semis and the championship, there will be added 4 quarterfinal knockout games.

I propose that 2 host cities will host the 4 QF games. 

So for our example, Berlin will host the final four, just like last year. Then Paris and London will each host 2 quarterfinal games.

The schedule will look something like this:

* April 23 to May 8 (First Round)
* May 18 and May 19 (Quarterfinals)
* May 24 (Semifinals)
* May 26 (Championship Game)

For our hypothetical it might go something like this for the quarterfinal round:

* May 18 2024, Saturday, Paris - Real Madrid vs Atlanta Hawks
* May 18 2024, Saturday, London - AS Monaco vs Panathinaikos AKTOR
* May 19 2024, Sunday, Paris - Sacramento Kings vs Olympiacos
* May 19 2024, Sunday, London - Golden State Warriors vs Houston Rockets

With the semifinal looking like:

* May 24 2024, Friday, Berlin - Real Madrid vs Panathinaikos AKTOR
* May 24 2024, Friday, Berlin - Sacramento Kings vs Houston Rockets 

And the final like:

* May 26 2024, Sunday, Berlin - Panathinaikos AKTOR vs Sacramento Kings

Domantas can claim a Euroleague championship just like his dad. Fox could add a Euroleague championship to his HOF résumé. He's a fringe guy but this could help his career. Could add some confidence for the next season too.

&nbsp;

I think this would help both leagues. Make some money, get some ratings. Games would likely be in the afternoon since we have to accommodate the European audiences. So, could be an appetizer to playoff games that day.

Would it be disastrous for the Euroleague if an NBA team wins it every year from here on out? Well, they just have to beat them if they don't want that to happen.

Imagine LaMelo Ball, Scottie Barnes, Jordan Poole, Shaedon Sharp lighting it up. Only 6-8 games, man. Only 40 minutes per game. You'd say it's different rules, I mean, it's still basketball. LeBron, KD, Steph and company had no problem playing basketball in the Olympics. If there were problems, it's the competition, not the rules. It's not like going from MMA to Boxing or vice versa. It's not like going from tennis to table tennis or vice versa. 

If these young guys play hard as if it were *their playoffs*, it's gonna be lit. I imagine those NBA home games will be sold out too, as people from their fanbases are probably craving for some playoff atmosphere type of games.

This is money, this is entertainment. Half true. But also this is experience, this is competition, this is reunion to some of the euroleague youth systems made current NBA players, this can be a door of opportunity for some Euroleague players wanting to have a shot at the NBA like Yabusele in the Olympics, this is overall good for the sport of basketball."

Question re: weird siting in Mexico City,UFOs_Archives,1i8qa15,2025-01-24 02:42:05,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs_Archives/comments/1i8qa15/question_re_weird_siting_in_mexico_city/,SaltyAdminBot,,"It was mid-afternoon on I think 1/18. We were on the rooftop pool of a hotel looking SSE. Extremely bright light was stationary in sky. It was very sunny out, so we both took notice. Right when I was noting it was “nuts Venus was so bright” it got a bit brighter, blinked a couple times, dimmed, got bright one more time, and then faded away.

My wife said, “hey, it’s one of the drone things.”  I tried to explain it, but couldn’t. It was very high, and Flightradar showed no traffic (didn’t look like a plane, and I don’t think they alter lights).  SkyView astronomy showed planets elsewhere and no bright stars there (again, this was totally weird in full sunlight). 

We chatted sort of awkwardly about having no explanation, and then moved on with vacationing.  

- Could this be a satellite flare? I’ve never seen anything like it.
- Something related to a rocket launch/mission?

It was so weird how bright and high it was, and then the blinking and fading was mesmerizing. It was like it was shooting us a message similar to more code (I don’t actually believe this to be true).

Any idea what it was? Before all the recent drone/woo/orb frenzy, I appreciated this sub breaking things down analytically (joined after the weird UAP shoot downs a few years back).  Mind lending me a dose of reality for whatever tf we saw?

Some context on me: I regularly star gaze, am familiar with major well known stars, planets, constellations, etc. I also live on a major flight path and am extremely familiar with planes in the day and night (at peak, they come by every 30 seconds. I’ve seen space debris flashing across the night sky, and meteors, fireballs, etc.  This was totally bizarre to us and unexplainable."
Untitled Short Fiction,creativewriting,1i8hcxf,2025-01-23 18:30:05,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1i8hcxf/untitled_short_fiction/,spasmodicjak,Short Story,"Jaykers body was singed with a tan from the heat where he worked and he maintained an unseemly tendency to constantly unhinge his jaw and then grind it back into place. He worked so hard to get here. His job had him sitting in a small cubicle of iron with no cushions or chairs, twisting knobs onto screws for hours upon hours. For many years, though the calendar was an alien concept he still knew he'd been in that cubicle for much too long, he'd gone about life in an uninterested mood. His understanding was that life is menial and sometimes painful if the knob came fresh out of the furnace but that didn't matter so much as he was alive. 
Then on his ten-minute break at some point, he met a new face, or rather half a new face. The half of the head made up completely of iron and crude tiny gears clicking away was a sign of someone previously much higher up the food chain than Jayker had ever met. Jayker approached and greeted the fellow in a low voice, almost a whisper so that his rasping wouldn’t be too apparent, “Whyve uh tey pot you don her?” Jayker straightened his back to a painful degree. 
The man had no hair, not a clogged pore like the ones that covered Jaykers scalp but his one organic eye was watery and vein obscured. He stared with a blank expression when his voice erupted with a quiet start like his mouth was an independent animal to his body. The man's throat warbled as he spoke, “What was that?” the clicking and whirring of the mechanical skull almost overpowering his nervous question.
	Jayker grunted in frustration then coughed, expelling mucus from his throat onto the floor. No one else noticed in the crowded chamber but the cyborg backed away, almost bumping into a ragged girl. “I says, whyev t-they poot you don her?” the question took an effort and frustrated Jayker, but the cyborg finally seemed to understand. 
	“Been replaced above. Poor efficiency.” he paused and the gears sounded like they sped up, and Jayker thought they might appreciate some of the grease he used on the knobs “Disposed here. Name of Livor Lobsnon.” 
	“You were a tep fella?” Jaykers eyes brightened, the people above the factories were rumored to be extraordinarily intelligent. Jaykers cubicle partner had slumped over dead a few shifts ago, and such an interesting character as this man was sure to be a good replacement. 
	“I said so.”, Livor said, and suddenly the alarm blared two times and all the other workers began shuffling to their stations. Jayker grabbed his arm and yanked him forward as he did the same, Livor put up no resistance.

Livor adapted quickly to the mundane lifestyle, and Jayker watched with perplexion as knob was stuck on screws with soft hands that cut and bruised with regularity each time the action was completed. Jayker initially found himself competing silently with the silent Livor, finding that even with great effort he could not compete with the machinelike precision of his companion. 
	In the middle of their fourth shift together, Jayker once again not matching speed stopped and gripped the knob and screw tight in his bulbously battered hands. Gritting his teeth he glared at Livor, who realized the pause and stared back. Gears turned, stopped, and sprung to life in a quiet yet enthusiastic symphony. Livor made an awkward smile, “What’s wrong friend? Your expression, unsettling.” 
	Jayker huffed once and looked shyly down at his work, “Ou’ve you gut so gut ah tis.” Jayker blushed for the first time in his life and gritted his teeth in embarrassment. He never knew how stupid he sounded, his broken speech filled with cracks and gargles. Livor maintained a friendly expression and continued laboring at a slower pace, “Watch, hands become like yours. Large marked, but precise.” 
	Jayker noticed the clicking of the gears took on a rhythmic pattern, soothing his mind like cool water being poured on his scalp. The noises of other cubicles seemed to melt away and he watched Livor closely, before long he began slowly imitating the precise motions of friendly fingers. 

Livor and Jayker were talkative, Jayker asked many questions that Livor answered eagerly, though still in an awkwardly flat fashion. Jayker learned about etiquette, fashion, and other luxuries from above though not ever grasping the deepest intricacies of any in particular.
Jayker was bothered, “An heow uo’ve learn ta spack so nice?” he began imitating some of the words that Livor uttered, but his mouth was so lumpy and malformed that his attempts at proper speech always ended up sounding like a parody. Livor showed an expression of apprehension, “Schooling, institutions for logic.” he took a screw and make scratch marks, carving little letters into the floor. “Symbols carry meaning.” that tranquil clicking pattern began again, and Jayker felt himself loosen while staring down at the drawings. “These represent sound and meaning. Know many, use few.” the sweet gear song stopped while Jayker looked on, and he felt a swell of frustration, “An why dun I knews it?” Livor was silent, Jayker gripped a knob tight in his hands. “Born down, not up.” Jayker felt a cramp in his forearm as he squeezed the knob tighter.
Heavy boots thumped slowly down the factory hall and the cubicles went silent, Jaykers anger evaporated into fear. Livor calmly prostrated himself facing out of their square, sitting on the carvings. Jayker faced the same way on his knees. 
The boots reached their cell, and a man wearing brown cloth stood facing them. He wasn't especially large, only his boots were. He wore a bronze-colored bowl helmet, and a long black and silver stick hung from his tightly drawn belt. Jayker knew that this was the first warden he ever saw back in his first few shifts. There were many all wearing the same outfit, but this one was differentiated by a bulbous growth of some kind right on the tip of his nose. Jayker had an urge every time he saw it to lunge out and pop it. But the urge was brittle in front of his survival instincts. Something about the man and his stick told Jayker to obey or suffer. 
He moved on, the duo remained in their positions until the reverberation of the boots ceased. They resumed working, not mentioning the symbols that Livor had carved.

The next shift Jayker remained bothered by his speech, “Ow’s I seposs ta gut up tup?” he asked. Livor did not look up to him “Cannot. Always down.” Jayker said nothing back. Many hours later Jayker heard a subdued but sharp whimper from Livor. He turned and saw Livor hunched over facing the corner, arms tucked in front of him and gyrating. Jayker stared curiously and in a short while a screw dropped, pinging on the ground, and rolled back between Livor's legs. The boots started thumping down the hall, which was odd because they almost never do two shifts in a row. Jayker saw Livor press his hands deep into the corner, the boots were almost upon them. Jayker turned to face the opening but when the warden, this time a tall skinny man with a slightly larger one behind him, stepped up he yelled, “Keep working!” and so Jayker did. His hands shook as he picked up another knob and screw, he heard the sticks slide out of the belts. The first strike landed square on the metal half of Livor's scalp, sending a high-pitched pang through the air. Livor didn't scream, it might’ve been that the first blow stopped his gears immediately and he was dead. The sticks still worked on him for a few minutes before the limp body was dragged away. 
Four shifts later Jayker had fallen back into his mundane life, never even asking himself questions. But on that fourth shift, he couldn't help thinking about his friend. “Cannot. Always down.” the words seemed to bounce around the stone walls. He looked over, they hadn't bothered to remove the screw that Livor dropped, nor were the words on the floor covered up. Jaykers eyes fixed on the corner where Livor had huddled. He crawled passively towards it and upon reaching it he huddled as his friend had done. He sniffed and poked the spot with a knob with nothing of interest happening. He stuck out a lumpy finger and felt a warm liquid stick to his nail. He retracted his hand at a hesitant pace and saw that a small droplet of blood trickled down his finger and onto his wrist. 
Jayker bled before, it was quick to dry. After four days though it had stayed wet, blending in with the dark corner. He pushed his hand firmly against the spot and found that a weak pulsing stream of blood leaked out and onto the floor. His hand was thoroughly soaked and the hot river ran down to his elbow. The space around him seemed to take on a malleable nature, the walls warping and the ground bouncing up and down. But he did not move at all, and while in quiet fascination he saw that the little letters were also stoic. He crawled to them and became transfixed, the face of Livor appearing in every space between the lines. In a daze, he felt his heart quicken at the thought of Livor. The soft clicking of the gears gave his skin goosebumps. 
Jayker took up a screw and the blood-covered fist. He smeared the blood all across the walls of the cubicle and took to writing down the symbols over and over again. He remembered the calm precision Livor had taught him, and the walls were soon a mural of his blood drawing. The boot's rhythmic thump began again, but Jayker had become utterly focused on Livor and the symbols. Pressing himself against the wall, he could feel soft hands gripping every inch of his body. Livor's hands were so thin and smooth before he started working, Jayker became lost in them. The boots seemed to ebb far away from him.
The hands gripped down hard, and Jayker felt cramps form in every muscle. He grunted and bared his teeth which also began to hurt. A burning sensation racked his body, he looked down and his troglodytic hands pulsed like the beating of his chest. Toes curled hard and back bent cruelly forward. “Always down.” no longer an echo, the words bashed on every side of his skull. Time resumed around him and the boots got rapidly closer. Someone was yelling.
Jayker was still afraid and started dragging himself into a kneeling position. While his forearms scraped on the floor a large gash opened in his wrist and a torrent of blood pooled on the floor in front of him. A warm sensation, not burning but wet and warm traveled down his arm and over the entire rest of his torso, legs, and head. A thick red filter obscured the world around him, only shapes differentiated objects from each other. The two wardens were back. The same wardens two times in a row? Thats odd. Jayker thought in a voice very similar to Livors before springing up to his feet and yowling at the two men. The first one began to speak with wide eyes and Jayker lashed out. His veins were bulging and his eyes were wide red disks. He panted rabidly, tearing into the guard with sharp teeth. Burying head into chest, he could feel a wave of pain rocket through his head as a stick came crashing down on his skull. It was another sensation on top of the layer of electric and visceral pain he felt. 
The heart popped open in his mouth, and his razor-sharp jaws sliced right through his tongue. He lept up like a startled frog, the corpse twitching as he knocked the second man back. He heard a clarity of the other workers that was never present before, the ceaseless screwing and breathless working ricocheted into him. The hands returned to his body, and he felt a new wave of suffering. His muscles were being cut by scissors. He shrieked and bellowed. He couldn't hear his voice; the vibrations through his chest and throat told him it was deep and powerful. Straddling the second guard he pummeled down onto his face over and over again. The face didn't become mashed, it crumbled away into dust underneath the red pressure of Jaykers rage. The gears screamed, the blood made a carpet on the ground, and Livor's voice returned in celebration and love, “Now go up!”.

Boss Guides Revamp,Terraria,1i8fmw1,2025-01-23 17:13:43,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Terraria/comments/1i8fmw1/boss_guides_revamp/,GamerTime487,PC,"Hello, this is the revamped version of my old post from a year ago. Since then, I have been playing a lot more of this wonderful game and I wanted to revamp my old Boss Guides post. If you want to check it out then here is the link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Terraria/comments/1ae6wye/boss\\\_guides/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Terraria/comments/1ae6wye/boss_guides/) This will take a while to finish, but hopefully, the result will be worth it. Also, if you have any questions, comments, or concerns, feel free to type them in the comment section. I'll try to respond to at least some of your comments so... yeah.

This post is for people who are struggling or are stuck on a specific boss. In my old post, I mentioned that any of these guides should help with any of the bosses on Classic, Expert, and Master Mode. **But this time,** I will also include and (hopefully) help with any of the bosses on Legendary Mode or GetFixedBoi (if you are like me in trying to beat the hardest secret seed). Before I start this guide, yes, most of the reference videos were recorded before the release of 1.4.4, specifically 1.4.3 or any other version related to 1.4. However, the strategies should still work nonetheless.

**Table of Contents:**

**1. Preparation**

**2. Pre-Hardmode Bosses**

**3. Hardmode Bosses (WIP)**

**4. Random Guides**

**Preparation:**

Before I discuss the actual bosses, I have some tips that should hopefully prepare you even more for a specific boss.

**1.** Use potions and/or food items

Potions and/or food items are **critical** in any boss fight in Terraria, especially if you are playing in Master (or Legendary) mode. While it is possible to beat a boss without any potions or any food items and grinding out some of these is a real pain, these 2 key things should help make the boss fight a lot easier and should make the result more worth it.

**2.** Overpreparation

If you are stuck on one specific boss, sometimes the best thing to do is to overprepare your specific boss fight if you have the option to do so. Whether it's getting a weapon or an accessory that breaks the normal progression sequence or grinding an obscene amount of potions, any method to overprepare for a specific boss is a good idea.

**3.** Add stationary buffs to your arena

This tip shouldn't be a surprise, but I'll share it anyway. Having any stationary buff in your arena is important, whether it is a Campfire, Heart Lantern, Bast Statue, Sunflower, etc., anything that benefits your character in a way is important. This is certainly the case if you are playing on Master or Legendary Mode, as getting hit by any boss is brutal.

**4.** Having good mobility

While having more defensive accessories is great in terms of tanking damage, you also want to have a good mix of mobility accessories. Having great mobility makes it so you will have a much easier time with any boss fight. Examples of mobility accessories include Speed Boots (Hermes Boots and its variants), Wings, Bottle Variants (Example: Cloud in a Bottle), etc.

**5.** Use the Shimmer pool

Sure, finding this area is an absolute pain, but it's worth it. Firstly, you can Shimmer some items to decraft said item, which can be used for a method known as ""Shimmer Crafting"". You simply grab the item you want to decraft, then grab the workstation that can craft said item. Keep shimmering said item till you get the reforge you want. If you are curious about which items can be shimmered, here is the wiki page: [https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Shimmer](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Shimmer)

This brings us to the second reason, there are a few items that can be shimmered into permanent buffs. For example, you can shimmer a Life Crystal into a Vital Crystal, which permanently increases passive regen. If you are planning to fight any boss, consider getting some permanent Shimmer buffs because they are extremely helpful. If you want to find the Shimmer without any hassle, here is the link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjkPefuAhV4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjkPefuAhV4)

With these tips out of the way, let's get on to the Pre-Harmode Boss Fights.

**Pre-Hardmode Bosses**:

King Slime:

This is probably one of the first few, maybe even **the first boss** you will encounter in this game. The gimmick of this boss fight is keeping your distance, so having any ranged weapon or any weapon that doesn't make it so you have to get close to the boss will work for this boss fight. The boss gets progressively harder over time as you deal more damage to the boss. For one, he will spawn slime minions over time as you deteriorate his health. Some of these minions even shoot out projectiles, which is another reason why keeping your distance is a good strategy when fighting this boss. Another challenge the King slime adds is he will become more aggressive and will become smaller as you damage him more, making it harder for you to hit. However, if you are confident in your dodging abilities and you have a lot of defense, then you can go aggressive with this boss by using a close-range weapon. Otherwise, keep your distance and you should be able to beat this boss in no time. The drops from King Slime aren't too noteworthy, with the only notable drops being the Slimy Hook and the Slimy Saddle.

As for Legendary Mode, keeping your distance (especially if you don't have a lot of defense) is more important as the only change is that King Slime is much bigger. He also deals a heck ton of damage on Legendary Mode, making this strategy even more viable.

Eye of Cthulhu:

This boss is one of the most iconic bosses in this entire game and for a very good reason. The fight itself is a perfect introduction to the player about the importance of mobility, and the gimmick of this boss fight is all about this one concept. At the minimum, Hermes Boots (or any of its variants) should be enough to outpace the Eye of Cthulhu. Having any Bottle accessory such as the Cloud in a Bottle or any accessory that improves vertical mobility also works here in this boss fight. As for weapons, it's like the King Slime fight, use any weapon that doesn't require you to get too close to the boss. And like King Slime, if you have the defense to tank it, you can go aggressive with this boss fight. Now, let's get on with the actual boss.

This boss consists of 2 phases. The first phase is nothing too challenging, he will occasionally spawn his Serpents and will fly above you. The second phase however changes that up drastically. This is where mobility accessories come into play. The Eye of Cthulhu becomes more aggressive and starts to dash at you, forcing you to try to outpace this gigantic eyeball. As you damage the eye more, he will start to become more aggressive to the point where if he is at a very low HP mark, this eyeball will nonstop dash at you until you defeat it. One of the drops from Eye of Cthulhu is probably the most important, as there is one accessory this eyeball drops: the Shield of Cthulhu. This drop grants you a ram dash, which not only improves your horizontal mobility but also helps with dodging attacks. This accessory is a must-use up until post-Plantera (unless you are like me who just uses it throughout the entire game).

As for Legendary Mode changes, the notable changes that I found were him spawning more Serpents and summoning said serpents in Phase 2. If there are any Legendary Mode changes I missed, please let me know.

Brain of Cthulhu

If you have Crimson as your evil biome, then congratulations, you have to fight a gigantic brain with flying eyeballs as its servants. Accessories are pretty much the same as the Brain of Cthulhu, but for weapon recommendations, it is much different. Having weapons that can pierce through multiple enemies is highly recommended for this fight. If you are doing a Ranger playthrough or you are still stuck on this boss, use Spiky Balls. They are extremely useful for this fight, which is what I am going to talk about now.

The fight contains 2 phases, one where the brain has flying eyeballs called Creepers and one where it's just the brain himself. Let's start with Phase 1, where the gimmick of this phase is to attack all 20 Creepers that the Brain of Cthulhu spawns. This is why weapons that can pierce through multiple enemies are important as you'll want to get rid of every Creeper as fast as you can. Why? Well simply put, getting hit by one of these Creepers can be devastating as these eyeballs can give you a random debuff. How? I have no f\*\*king clue. And the worst part is, these Creepers can inflict the Cursed debuff (a debuff where you cannot use any item for a short period), the Confused debuff (A debuff where it reverses your controls), and Broken Armor (debuff where it cuts your total defense by half). And yes, these debuffs can stack if you get hit too much.  Once you defeat all 20 Creepers, Phase 2 starts. The gimmick of Phase 2 is that the brain will spawn 3 duplicates of himself, forcing you to differentiate which one is the real brain. At the start of the phase, it's easy to see which one is the real one, but of course, it gets harder as you deal more damage to the brain. Also, just like the Creepers, the Brain can inflict a random debuff. Unfortunately, this is 1.4.4 so using the minimap is not an option. If you have summons or have a weapon that can inflict a debuff like fire, use it as it makes this phase much easier. If you don't, try to dash away from the Brain and you should have enough distance to damage the Brain. Spiky Balls are extremely useful for this fight, especially Phase 1. I'm not sure about Phase 2, so I am going to assume it's also useful for Phase 2. The Expert Mode drop from the Brain of Cthulhu is the Brain of Confusion, an accessory that when equipped grants you a 1/6 chance of dodging any attack. And while I don't use this accessory a lot, I think this accessory is pretty good considering you can just dodge any attack with no consequence. The only downside is the somewhat low chance, but I think it's worth it.

As for Legendary Mode changes... this is one of the bosses I am not familiar with on Legendary Mode. The only changes I know of are that the Creepers are bigger in Phase 1, and that gravity is flipped at the start of Phase 2. The only tip I can give is to use a Featherfall potion at the start of Phase 2, but other than that, this boss is one I am not familiar with in Legendary Mode. I will link the reference video, but if you have any other tips on beating this boss on Legendary Mode, leave it in the comments.

The Eater of Worlds

If you have Corruption as your evil biome, then congratulations, you have to fight a giant cancer worm that is stupidly hard on Legendary Mode. But I'll get to that later. Spiky Balls strikes again as this weapon is really useful for this boss. As for weapon recommendations, it's like the Brain of Cthulhu, try to use weapons that can pierce through multiple enemies.

Unlike the Brain of Cthulhu, this boss does not have multiple phases. Instead, the gimmick of the fight is to defeat all 60 segments (72 segments if you are in Expert/Master/Legendary mode) of this gigantic cancer worm. The catch is if you defeat any of the segments that are **not** the head or tail, you will have to deal with more than one worm. And to make this even worse, this worm also shoots vile spit which deals a stupid amount of damage, especially on Master or Legendary Mode. There are multiple strategies, but if you want to play this one safe, keep your distance and try to dodge the vile spit. The reference video will show that you can face tank this boss, but it does require a hefty amount of defense. The Expert Mode drop from the Eater of Worlds is the Worm Scarf. Again, I don't use this accessory a lot, but it reduces damage taken from enemies by 17%! And while it's slightly worse than the Brain of Confusion, I still think this accessory is pretty good as you can tank more hits when equipping it.

As for Legendary Mode changes... this is by far one of the worst Legendary Mode bosses in this game. No, seriously, it's stupid. The change this worm gets is that he is more aggressive, but the most important change is that now every time you defeat one of its segments, it turns into an Eater of Souls! And what's worse, it shoots **Vile Spit!** So, you are forced to grind for an Eater of Souls banner for this one boss fight. Even then, it is stupidly difficult to beat, to the point where at this point, I don't blame you if you cheese this fight or fight this boss using a different class weapon. If there are **any** strategies I forgot, type them in the comments.

Queen Bee

This is a boss that you can technically fight at any time, but I'll include it here simply for simplicity's sake and I don't want to count this boss as an ""extra boss"" (no seriously, idk why I included that in my old post). Before even fighting this boss, I highly recommend you get the Bezoar. While it's possible without it, constantly getting poisoned throughout this whole fight is annoying, so being immune to Poison should make your life easier for this boss.

This boss fight consists of multiple attacks you need to be wary of. The first attack is her dash attack, which there are multiple ways to counter it. You can time your dash right so the number of I-frames is enough to dodge the attack (the strategy that I use a lot) or jump above Queen Bee when she dashes. The second attack is her summoning bees... no seriously that's it. This ""attack"" spawns little bees that are extremely annoying as they have a chance to inflict Poison, hence why it is recommended to equip the Bezoar. The third attack is her shooting stingers. This attack is all about dodging accordingly, which can be quite annoying as these stingers might be hard to see if your arena does not have a ton of light sources. So far, the fight sounds pretty easy, but there is a catch. The catch is that as you deal more damage to the Queen Bee, her defense increases, making your weapons deal less and less damage as the fight goes on. She is also more aggressive as she shoots her stingers faster, dashes more frequently, and spawns fewer bees. Queen Bee has multiple drops, which will be the premise for every boss from here on out. The drops are honestly pretty good. The Bee Gun is a pretty good mage weapon, the Bee's Knees is super good for Skeletron (as long as you use wooden arrows), the Bee Keeper is a decent sword, the Honeycomb is a good accessory when combined with the Shark Tooth Necklace, and the mount is... OK. It's not bad but I normally don't use this a lot, so...

As for Legendary Mode changes, I'm pretty sure the only change this boss gets is that she has more HP and is more aggressive. For GetFixedBoi, the only change I can recall is that the Queen Bee now dashes diagonally thanks to a Waffletime video. Nothing much here to be honest. If I miss any GetFixedBoi changes, please let me know. (Edit: Ok so I fought Queen Bee in GetFixedBoi and it's the same as in Legendary Mode. I have no idea why Queen Bee dashes diagonally in Waffletime's video, but I won't complain.)

Skeletron

This boss is probably one of the most important boss fights in any Terraria playthrough as beating this boss allows access to the Dungeon. The loot in the Dungeon is really good, for example, the Cobalt Shield. But, you have to beat a skeleton with two gigantic arms if you want to access this area. This is probably a good time to mention that Rocket Boots or any variant of this item is extremely necessary for this fight, and you'll see why later.

This boss fight has 2 phases, one where he has both arms and one where he doesn't have or only has one arm. Let's start with Phase 1. Phase 1 consists of two attacks, one where he will use his gigantic arms and the other attack is him spinning his skull. For the gigantic arms, you'll want to at least try to dodge his arms, as getting hit inflicts the Bleeding debuff. This debuff makes it so it disables passive regeneration for a short amount of time. For the spinning skull attack, you'll want to keep your distance, yes that means no ram dashing on his skull as it hits like a truck. I like to go around in a circle during this attack, but just try to keep your distance and you should be fine. Also, try to get rid of both of his arms at the same time since defeating one of the arms too quickly can result in an early Phase 2. Phase 2 is just Phase 1 except he shoots skulls. These skull projectiles shoot in a circular pattern, so going around in circles is your best bet. This is why Rocket Boots or any of its variants is recommended as you can fly around in a circle to make this attack a cakewalk. Just be mindful that if Skeletron still has his one extra arm, Skeletron can use that to his advantage.   Overall, Phase 2 shouldn't be a problem once you defeat both of his arms as it is just his skull. Just be mindful of distance. The drops Skeletron has isn't too great. The Book of Skulls isn't a great Mage weapon as the projectile it shoots out is way too slow, and the Skeletron Hand is an OK hook. It's not great, but it's not bad either.

As for the Legendary Mode changes... yeah this boss is more painful on this difficulty. Not only does Skeletron hit like a truck, but he is also faster and slightly bigger. And what's worse is that now in Phase 2, Dark Mages spawn which makes this phase so much more annoying to go through as they can shoot projectiles while you are facing against a giant skull. This fight on Legendary Mode tests your dodging skills as you will have to deal with Skeletron's skull projectiles and the Dark Mage's water bolts. Overall, this is another boss that I dislike on Legendary Mode. Probably it's because I don't use Featherfall potions or it's just a skill issue.

Deerclops

This is one of if not the most obscure bosses in this entire guide. No seriously, I don't think anyone remembers this boss if at all. Sure, it was a cool collab with Don't Starve, but this boss fight is forgettable, so if you are wondering why, check out Sorbet Cafe's video on this one boss fight. But I am going to include this boss for two reasons: There are going to be people who are getting every achievement in the game, or there are going to be people fighting this boss for the first time.

Now, I would love to do an explanation on how to beat this boss, but honestly, I have only fought this boss a couple of times and that's it. It goes to show just how forgettable this boss is. Instead, I will mention some mechanics that this boss has. First of all, this is the only boss that does not despawn when the player dies. Instead, the boss despawns when an entire Terraria day passes by (24 IRL minutes) and the player dies. So, you have a lot of time before the boss despawns. Second of all, this boss forces you to be at a close range as going too far away activates Deerclop's invulnerable state. The drops from Deerclops aren't anything too special. Lucy the Axe, the Bone Helmet, Pew-Matic Horn, and Houndius Shootius are all ok drops, but they are all drops that you probably don't need in your average Terraria playthrough.

As for Legendary Mode changes... this boss only has HP and Damage changes. Yep, that is it. If you want to fight this boss, go for it. But honestly, skipping this boss entirely changes nothing to your playthrough so...

Wall of Flesh

If you have made it this far, then congratulations, you are one step away from entering Hard Mode. But before that, you have to fight a gigantic wall made out of flesh. I highly recommend that you make a long bridge in the Underworld that has little obstacles in the way, as this fight is you running in a straight line. Even then, this boss fight is challenging.

The boss fight starts with Hungry's that block both the Eyes and the Mouth. Having any weapons that can pierce through multiple enemies is good for this fight. Now, this fight is a cakewalk if you are Ranger, Mage, or Summoner, as they all have weapons that don't require the player to get too close to the boss. So, instead, I will mention the strategy for Melee. I highly recommend that you use the Night's Edge because, as of 1.4.4, most Melee weapons had a rework. This weapon is perfect against the Wall of Flesh as it can damage multiple Hungry's while simultaneously hitting the Wall of Flesh itself. This big flesh wall also shoots lasers, which normally wouldn't be a problem if you are not doing a Melee playthrough. For Melee users, try to dodge the lasers as best as you can. This can be done by flying up or running in the opposite direction then flying up. It's a lot more confusing to explain, so watching the reference video will help tremendously. The drops from the Wall of Flesh are pretty good. The most notable ones are the Demon Heart and the Emblems. The Demon Heart gives you an extra accessory slot, which is extremely good. The Emblems are determined based on class. So, unfortunately, you will have to pray for RNGezus that you get the Emblem for your specified class, as it is random. Thankfully, you can shimmer your emblem till you get the one for your specific class.

As for Legendary Mode changes, this boss is another one that I find to be the most challenging boss fight in terms of this difficulty. The most notable changes are his smaller size and the fact that he spawns **Fire Imps** throughout the **entire fight!** This forces you to find an Imp Statue, as you will need this to grind banners. This is required as these Fire Imps on Legendary Mode deal tremendous amounts of damage. And what's worse is that the Wall of Flesh now, in this difficulty, has over 20,000 HP! So if you are doing a melee playthrough, good luck as having banners is necessary. I also forgot to mention, but if you are doing a Ranger playthrough, don't use the Star Cannon. As of 1.4.4, the Wall of Flesh is completely immune to the Star Cannon, as well as other Legendary Mode fights. This is yet another fight that I hate on Legendary Mode, but at least it feels good when you beat this boss fight **unlike** the Eater of Worlds, which makes you want to uninstall this game.

**If you have made it this far, then congratulations, you are now officially in Hard Mode. Trust me, these boss fights are not going to get easier from here...**

**Hard Mode Bosses:**"
Defiler 101,TheFirstDescendant,1i8f2eo,2025-01-23 16:49:22,14,0.82,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFirstDescendant/comments/1i8f2eo/defiler_101/,VeeGeeTea,PSA/super good advice,"Have you ever wiped in a public groups vs the Defiler?  
\[Raises Hand\]

I know I have, however, there were many more successful session as well.  
This isn't meant to be an absolute must do, just a suggestion to make your life easier with this Colossus.

Things to pay attention to:  
\- Purple toxic cloud surrounding Defiler, you get close, you die  
\- Enraged, it will start monkeying around, jumping and doing Hulk smash, if you're targeted, just run  
\- Don't group up in front of boss monkey, he will drop a giant spikey pool of acid to melt you away  
\- When you see rockets launch from the back, it's always 3 shots per person, shown by green circle on ground  
\- Purple bullets, they're extremely high speed, but not penetrative, so hide behind walls

Things not to do:  
\- Do not for the love of bananas, resurrect your teammates during the rocket barrage, wait until he fired all 3 shots (unless you're Yujin, because he's MVP)  
\- Do not bring Ajax unless you're going to pop shield, and shield dome doesn't protect against rocket barrage  
\- No underage participant is allowed, do not bring anyone under 40 to this fight, you'll get wiped and burden your teammates  
\- Do not bring any other elements weapons, other than electric, or slotted with electric enchantment, otherwise you'll just be throwing pebbles at the giant monkey, he'll laugh at you then squish you

Side Notes:  
\- You don't need Antivenom or Toxic resistances, but it does help, especially on your first run to get a feel of the boss  
\- Pure DPS doesn't work, you're just asking to be steamrolled, add some HP Amplification and Increased HP  
\- If you're running Ines, use Time of the Hunting Hounds module, it'll turn all your skills to Tech, this way Secret Garden can boost all your skills  
\- Surprising the EXCAVA is doing some mad damages, especially the grenade passive skill from aiming the weapon, this is what I use to shoot while waiting for skill cooldown  
\- Whether you win the match or not, it's courteous to say GG at the end of it

PS: If anyone got anything else to add, or if something here isn't up to speed, feel free to send your pigeon letters below."

Here we go.


##Prepare for our Next Developer Livestream


Heresy is right around the corner, so we wanted to give everyone an in-depth preview of what's to come when it launches on February 4. Our amazing developers are ready to tell you firsthand about the new activities, stories, and rewards they have been working on.



[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/bltf8c09cd30402c27c/6791972979558dcf4d4d1717/Livestream_Tune-In.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/72sRCYP.jpeg)

Follow us on our [official Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/bungie) and tune in on January 28 at 10AM PT to discover what Heresy brings to the table.



Everyone watching the livestream on January 28 on the official Bungie Twitch channel for at least 15 minutes will get the Scorned Organ emblem as a Twitch Drop. It's the perfect sendoff for Revenant.


[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt360064edbcf7e982/67919c8f58fb6d18518121f0/EN_Scorned_Organ.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/eLJ8KkC.jpeg)



Don't forget about our other emblem available through Twitch at the moment. As part of Twitch's Drops Fest, you'll earn the Golden Hour emblem if you subscribe or gift a sub before January 31, 17:00 UTC.

This TWID would have been the biggest one yet if the PvP updates didn't end up having their own standalone article. In it, we covered many changes coming to the Crucible experience in general, and the Competitive and Trials of Osiris playlists in particular. We hope you are as excited about all the changes coming as we were telling you.

##Content Delivery Plans for Heresy


Something we wanted to share today is that Heresy will have weekly content and story delivery.



We understand your concerns about our return to this approach, but we have learned a lot from the ‘all-in’ format in Revenant, so in Heresy we’re striking a balance between everything dropping on day one of an Act vs. meaningful reasons to log-in throughout the Episode. To that end we made the vast majority of activities content available on the first day of an Act, with said content evolving based on the weekly story. Additionally, each week will feature a Seasonal Challenge that rewards a new tier of seasonal Weapon. Check out the livestream next week for the first look at this Heretical Arsenal!



Without stepping into spoiler territory, we can also tell you that Heresy won't rely on a fixed length for each Act like the previous Episodes. For example, Act II will last three weeks instead of the standard five or six. Additionally, all reprised Weapons for the Episode will be available at launch, while all the second half of Episodic Weapons will be when Act II launches.



Our goal is to tell a satisfying and exciting story that both serves as an epilogue to the Light and Darkness Saga and that helps pave the way for what's to come when Codename: Frontiers launches later this year.


##Weapons and Armor Updates for Heresy


Now, the longest topic of this TWID: the weapons and armor preview with all the magnificent buffs and necessary nerfs, as well as interesting reworks, that are coming when Heresy launches. We are going to make a coffee pot and leave the room to the amazing Destiny 2 Sandbox Team. Be right back.


###Exotic Armor


[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt1b38dbb3cad41a5b/67919f29e92e093e5ec659d1/Exotic_Armor.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/zxiaR63.jpeg)
####Hunter


**Sealed Ahamkara Grasps**



Sealed Ahamkara Grasps have struggled on Hunter due to the large array of alternate reload options that Hunters already had access to. We’ve reworked its behavior to have a bit more Exotic flair in terms of playstyle.



* Reworked with a weapon-swapping focus to differentiate it from other Hunter reload Exotics. Perk description now reads as follows:

   * Powered melee and finisher final blows grant Nightmare Fuel, increasing handling and airborne effectiveness. While active, freshly drawn weapons deal additional damage and grant Nightmare Fuel on final blows. Gaining Nightmare Fuel reloads all holstered weapons.

**Gwisin Vest**



With the recent roaming Super changes, we decided to give this Exotic a bit of tuning to let it shine in its role, as well as giving some utility outside of the Super.



* Now progresses its Super returns on Super hits as well as kills before becoming invisible.
* Improved the maximum possible Super energy gains per return while also increasing the amount of progress needed for maximum gains.
* Now also emits a cloud of weakening smoke when you exit invisibility while nearby an enemy.

   * Works both in neutral and while in Super.

**Renewal Grasps**



Now that Frost Armor has settled in the sandbox, we feel that Renewal Grasps can safely be more generous in granting it.



* Doubled the rate of Frost Armor gain while in the enhanced Duskfield grenade.

**Foetracer**



While Foetracer offers an excellent way to increase one’s damage, we’ve found that the benefit is too brief when compared to other alternatives. 



* Increased the bonus weapon damage duration from 10 seconds to 15 seconds.

**Radiant Dance Machines**



Radiant Dance Machines has been reworked to allow the multiple dodge charges that it grants to count as real dodges for the purposes of perks and aspects. The trigger mechanism for granting extra dodges requires more effort to compensate for that, but the overall change is a large increase in strength and utility. We have also added some flat benefits to Primary weapons that are a real gamechanger for players who prioritize gun feel and performance when mobile.



* Improves airborne effectiveness and hip fire mobility, range, and accuracy for Primary ammo weapons.
* Multi-kills with Primary ammo weapons refund dodge energy. When dodge energy is full, multi-kills grant extra charges. Powerful combatants and Guardians count as more than one kill.

**Relativism** - **Spirit of Galanor**



With the ability to regenerate a roamer more quickly than ever, it was quite easy to end up chaining roaming Supers back-to-back and effectively never need to rely on your weapons during activities. So, to combat this, we are reducing this capability a little on the armor side specifically for Silkstrike and Golden Gun.



* Reduced the maximum amount of energy refunded for Silkstrike and Golden Gun to 30% (down from 50%).

**Relativism** -**&nbsp;Spirit of the Foetracer**



Spirit of the Foetracer has inherited the changes made to Foetracer.


####Titan


**Citan's Ramparts**



Citan’s Ramparts was last adjusted to account for its problematic dominance in PVP, but that came at the cost of its value across the game. In the current sandbox, we’ve found that many of its downsides can be removed safely in PVE, even with the small buff that gives it in PVP, without introducing those toxic play patterns.



* Removed several downsides applied by Assault Barricade to bring it in line with base Towering Barricade behavior. Cumulatively, these changes result in a Towering barricade you can shoot through with no other downsides while Citan's is equipped (in PVE - see below).

   * Increased barricade health from 400 to 500.
   * No longer increases Barricade cooldown.
   * No longer decreases Barricade duration.
* Further increased damage dealt to Citan's barricades by Guardians from 125% to 160%.

   * This results in near-identical effective Barricade health in PVP (~2.5% less after these changes).

**Eternal Warrior**



We want Eternal Warrior to be an appealing option in both PvP and PvE for players interested in building into Fists of Havoc. We’re giving it increased Super duration on final blow – a nostalgic effect for longtime players that is thematically aligned with the Exotic.



* Final blows with Fists of Havoc now grant extended Super duration.

**Ursa Furiosa**



Our recent changes to Ursa Furiosa to integrate it with the Unbreakable aspect have yet to encourage significant use. So, we want to lean further into supporting Unbreakable by changing the energy returned by blocking with Unbreakable to be grenade energy.



* Blocking damage with Unbreakable now returns grenade energy instead of Super energy.

   * Grenade energy is returned at the end of Unbreakable and is scaled based on the amount of damage you blocked with it.

**Khepri’s Horn**



Khepri’s Horn is getting a glow-up: It will still causes your Barricade to emit waves of damaging Solar energy, but with this update they have been significantly enhanced.



* Now sends out three waves of flame instead of just one.

   * These waves no longer return towards the Barricade - they only travel outwards once.
   * Tracking on the waves has been enhanced.
   * Combatants damaged by these waves are enveloped in a Sunspot. Players are enveloped if they are defeated.
   * Now requires a Solar Super to be equipped to create the flame waves from the Barricade.

**An Insurmountable Skullfort**



As difficulty goes up, Skullfort can feel overly punishing when you fail to land the final blow it’s perk demands. To alleviate this issue, we are extending its effect to grant partial refunds from any melee attack to help rebuild that crucial momentum.



* Now grants energy to Arc melee abilities when hitting targets with any melee attack. Amount granted varies based on the melee used.

   * From most to least energy granted: Powered melees, non-Glaive unpowered melees while Knockout is active, and unpowered melees (including Glaives).

**Stoicism** -**&nbsp;Spirit of the Bear**



Spirit of the Bear has inherited the changes made to Ursa Furiosa.



**Stoicism** -**&nbsp;Spirit of the Horn**



Spirit of the Horn has inherited the changes made to Khepri’s Horn. On Thruster, Sprit of the Horn will now emit four waves in an X-pattern.


####Warlock


**Stormdancer’s Brace**



Much like Spirit of Galanor, we wanted to tune back how much returned energy was given for roaming Supers via Exotics. To compensate, we wanted to give Stormdancer’s Brace a little love in the potency granted to Stormtrance while you are in Super.



* Doubled the damage benefit per stack of Ascending amplitude (up to 20% per stack, from 10%).
* Now also reduces the cost of Ionic Blink during Super by 50%.
* Reduced the maximum amount of energy refunded to 30% (down from 50%).

**Geomag Stabilizers**



Part of the charm of Geomag Stabilizers was lost when sprinting to get Super was removed due to PvP issues. With the introduction of Bolt Charge to the Arc kit, there was an opportunity to bring this experience back without breaking PvP.



* Added a new perk: ""Sprinting while near max Bolt Charge will top it off.""

   * Starts at six stacks of Bolt Charge.
   * Reenabled VFX where boots spark while sprinting near max Bolt Charge.
* Increased Super energy gained from ionic traces to 7% from 2%.

**Secant Filaments (and Spirit of the Filaments)**



Ever since anti-Champion capabilities were expanded to work with elemental verbs inherently, Secant Filaments have felt like an Exotic lost to the flow of time. Giving it a satisfying loop felt like a nice way to give the perk some love for both the base Exotic and its Spirit counterpart.



* Now gives class ability energy per kill while Devour is active.

**Speaker’s Sight**



Speaker’s Sight paired with Ember of Benevolence allowed Warlocks to earn a massive amount of ability energy via the Healing Turret even if they and their fireteam were all at full health. Speaker’s Sight’s impact should be rooted in the actual healing of injured Guardians, so we are making a change to how the Healing Turret selects its targets.



* Healing Turret no longer targets allies at full health.

   * Allies need some damage done to their shields to be eligible targets.

**Verity’s Brow (and Spirit of Verity)**



The Death Throes buff is quite potent, but it is easy to let it run out and lose all your grenade benefit. We have updated this Exotic to bring it in line with how the similar Titan Exotic Wormgod Caress works: Stacks of Death Throes are now represented by a meter that decays backwards through each tier rather than falling off entirely when the duration elapses.



* Now uses a meter to track Death Throes

   * New durations per tier:

      * x1: 8 seconds
      * x2: 7 seconds
      * x3: 6 seconds
      * x4: 5 seconds
      * x5: 4 seconds
   * When one tier’s duration elapses, the buff will downgrade to the next lower tier rather than expiring entirely.
   * Bonus grenade recharge per tier:

      * x1: 0.5% per second
      * x2: 1% per second
      * x3: 1.5% per second
      * x4: 2% per second
      * x5: 2.5% per second
####Exotic Class Item Shared Perks


**Spirit of Verity**



Speaking of Verity, the above changes extend to the Exotic Class Item version as well. On top of this we are also giving some more of the base Exotic to the Spirit of version to help players build into grenades on Prismatic.



* Gained bonus grenade recharge rate, but provides 50% of the base Verity's Brow Exotic.

####Global


**Aim Assistance**



Destiny’s various aim systems are a foundational part of what makes Destiny’s guns feel like they do, but they do not come without some edge cases.



When using the controller input, we’ve taken a stab at trying to solve an issue where a quickly moving target crossing your vision could pull your aim off your previous target by introducing a time-based component.



We now weight aim assist against targets you’ve aimed at for a short time more strongly compared to brand-new targets when a new target is introduced by crossing your reticle.



We understand that this is a potentially wide-reaching change but have thus far been satisfied with the results in our playtests. Controller players, please let us know if you encounter any issues as a result of this change.



* Aiming at a target for a short time will prevent another target moving very quickly across your reticle from dragging your aim off it. Controller only.
####Weapon Archetypes & Subfamilies


**PvE Damage Tuning**



We’ve tuned up some low-performing weapon families in PvE to bring the competition a bit closer together when you are selecting weapons to use. These changes should help a number of archetypes that have been in need of some love for a while.



* Scout Rifles

   * +15% vs minors
   * +30% vs majors
* Auto Rifles

   * +10% vs minors and majors
* SMGs

   * +5% vs minors
   * Additionally, in 8.1.5.3 we increased base magazine size by 10-15% rounds based on the mag stat.
* Trace Rifles

   * +20% vs minors
* Linear Fusion Rifles

   * +10% vs all combatants

**Glaives**



Glaives have historically been a niche weapon type that has found it hard to break into mainstream usage. In this update, we are applying a sweeping buff to many of the Glaive’s baseline stats and behaviors to remove some of their unwieldiness and make them a more attractive and easy-to-use option.



With these changes, the intent is that Glaives become more agile and need to reload less often, are effective at longer ranges and more forgiving, and are more impactful when completing their full melee combo.



* Significantly increased Aim Assist, Aim Magnetism, and Damage Falloff Ranges across the board for all Glaives.
* Improved Glaive projectile hit registration.
* Increased the baseline effects at all stat values for:

   * Handling speeds, including shield ready speed and draw and stow speed.
   * Magazine size
   * Projectile speed
   * Reload speed
* Final hit of the melee combo deals double damage.

   * This hit also inflicts much more flinch on PvE combatants.

**Aggressive Frame Fusion Rifle(s)**



Only one Aggressive Frame Fusion Rifle exists within the game to date: Coriolis Force, issued back in Beyond Light. We’d like to give the subfamily a bit more love to try to sell its unique charged spread-shot gameplay with a complete rework.



The original fired its pellets all at once, so its recoil felt Shotgun-like. With the rework, we wanted to stay true to the Fusion Rifle performance of controlling your recoil over the burst, so we converted it to fire multiple bursts of pellets.



These shots suffer from damage falloff much less than conventional Fusions to compensate for their widespread angle and let the player fire into packs of PvE enemies and still score multiple kills.



Don’t worry, you won’t have to go get Coriolis Force on Europa if you want to try these changes out; new reworked Aggressive Frames with new perk pools are coming in this Episode.



* Aggressive Frame Fusion Rifles now fire three bursts of four pellets in increasingly wide spreads.
* Increased minimum damage when fully outside of damage falloff range from 45% to 65%.
* Increased range falloff start by 4m relative to normal Fusions.
* Increased range falloff end by 3m relative to other Fusions.
* Increased damage versus minors and majors by 15% relative to normal Fusions.

**Support-Frame Auto Rifles**



We’d like to support (*heh*) more Support Frame Auto Rifles in the future. Currently, their range stat is not especially desirable because of their unique projectile properties, so we took the opportunity to make range directly affect its healing performance by adjusting how far away the weapon can lock-on to and heal an ally.



No Hesitation remains close to its original behavior with this change with its base stats – this change primarily affects perks and mods applied to No Hesitation and opens more space for future Support Frames to differentiate themselves.



* Range now increases how far away you can heal another Guardian.

**Rocket-Assisted Frame Sidearms**



Rocket-Assisted Frame Sidearms shipped *particularly* potent while also being easy to use. We reduced the reserves for these in Revenant to bring their uptime a bit closer to other Special weapons, and with these changes we are moving these into a more defined niche; keeping them potent within that niche but being a bit less universally useful in all situations. With these changes they should remain a viable, ammo efficient option for clearing minor-, major-, and Champion-tiered targets with direct hits without also being great at killing everything nearby the primary target.



* Reduced PvE detonation damage by 45%.
* Increased PvE impact damage by 100%.
* Reduced Aim Assist falloff and maximum distance by 8m.
* Reduced magnetism falloff and maximum distance by 8m.
* Reduced damage by 30% vs boss, vehicle, and miniboss targets.

   * Buried Bloodline's body shot damage is unaffected, critical hit damage is buffed by 8%.
* The range stat was vestigial to the weapon subfamily, so we've removed it.

   * Range masterworks and enhanced intrinsics will be replaced with something more appropriate.
####Exotic Weapons


**Lorentz Driver**



Lorentz Driver was once a terror in the Crucible and has since caught a number of changes to its efficacy. Since then, it has struggled to compete in most activity types. We’ve made a few changes that will reward you for playing its bounty game successfully and keep it going into further encounters.



* Picking up a bounty tag now grants 1one ammo to the mag.
* Triggering Lagrangian Sight by picking up a bounty tag adds 6six ammo to the mag, the first time you trigger it.

   * Returns to adding one ammo per tag on extensions while the buff remains active.

**Delicate Tomb**



We’ve made a few adjustments to Delicate Tomb to help get it into its Tempest Cascade loop a bit more predictably and give it significantly more punch while buffed.



* Increased the chance to make an Ionic Trace from minor combatants from 4% to 10%.
* Increased the PvE damage bonus on the Tempest Cascade shot from 30% to 100%.
* Removed the timer from Tempest Cascade. Lasts until fired.

**D.A.R.C.I.**



D.A.R.C.I. has long struggled to compete with its Exotic brethren, so we are taking a stab at building a niche for it in a fireteam the way Gjallarhorn and Ergo Sum have found for their respective weapon types. This new catalyst should give you an edge up in encounters where Snipers may not previously have been viable.



* Added a new catalyst perk - Networked Targeting

   * Hits with Personal Assistant active grant you and nearby allies improved overall weapon performance and precision damage with non-Exotic Sniper Rifles.

      * Improves recoil, flinch, target acquisition, handling and precision damage.
      * Stacks up to 5x.
      * D.A.R.C.I also gets this buff itself.
   * D.A.R.C.I user also gets +15% damage after granting five stacks to a teammate.

**Edge of Action, Edge of Concurrence, Edge of Intent**



The class Exotic Glaives have felt a bit clunky since their addition to the game. We’ve made some changes here along with the global changes to Glaives that we help will smooth over the gameplay loops on each of these, as well as add additional neutral game value outside of the special shots.



* All Class Exotic Glaives

   * Special shot is no longer tied to Glaive energy.

      * Now triggered on six weapon hits to allow the special reload.

         * Increments off both shots and melee hits.
      * Edge of Concurrence

         * Effects of Jolting Feedback trait added to intrinsic perk.
      * Edge of Action

         * Effects of Destabilizing Rounds trait added to intrinsic perk.
      * Edge of Intent

         * Effects of Incandescent trait added to intrinsic perk.
         * Added Cure pulse to special shot impact.
         * Healing Turret no longer targets allies at full health.

            * Allies need some damage done to their shields to be eligible targets.

**Centrifuse**



Centrifuse’s perk that reloads the magazine while sprinting encourages pivoting and repositioning, but as it stands the magazine is just a tad restrictive and sometimes feels burdensome in PvE.



We’ve increased the magazine size to increase the potency of this perk and let you keep the weapon’s accumulated charge for longer before needing to reload.



* Increased mag size to 45.

**Dead Messenger, Hard Light, & Borealis**



We’re revisiting the Exotic perk “The Fundamentals” to modernize it a bit. Elemental keywords such as Restoration and Volatile have become a part of Destiny 2’s modern fundamentals. The stat bonus based on current element has been removed in favor of a damage bonus when you apply or receive an elemental keyword matching the current element. We’re also giving a small stat bump to Borealis since some high-skill PvP players have taken a liking to its current stat offerings.



* The Fundamentals:

   * New effect: Grants a 30% damage buff (10% in PvP) to this weapon for 10 seconds when you apply or receive an elemental keyword that matches the currently selected damage type of this weapon.
   * Removed Effect: No longer grants different stats based on current element.
* Borealis only: Increased Stability by 20 and Aim Assist by 10 to permanently grant it the Void element bonus that it will no longer have access to, since Borealis is a sleeper pick in PvP.

   * This bonus was selected over Arc, since there are more ways to gain Handling.

**Telesto**



Overall, Telesto is a solid weapon, but it lacks a solid high point in its power fantasy and does not interface with buildcrafting much. Additionally, the weapon has a unique dual identity as a weapon associated with the Awoken Harbingers in-universe and associated with a storied history of Telesto-specific bugs in our community. With that in mind, we gave it a buff that embraces both aspects and ties them together in a single, deeply self-referential package. How do you buff Telesto? Make it *more* Telesto.



* Telesto

   * Harbinger's Pulse:

      * Now only refills Telesto's ammo from reserves (instead of Telesto and your Kinetic slot weapon).
      * Now triggers with any Void final blow.
      * Final blow requirement increased from two to three, however Telesto final blows count double (in other words, will trigger from two Telesto final blows, one Telesto final blow + one other Void final blow, or three other Void final blows).
      * Multikill timer increased from 2 seconds to 4.5 seconds.
   * Catalyst

      * New perk: Harbinger Seethe
      * After three activations of Harbinger's Pulse, special reload the weapon to cause a rain of Telesto projectiles on your next direct hit.

**Vexcalibur**



With the buffs last season to Void Overshield’s effectiveness, it seemed like the weapon could use a few tweaks to take maximum advantage and emphasize the paladin-protector fantasy with its area overshield.



We’ve made it easier to generate guard energy in PvE when wading through enemies and quicker to apply overshield to your allies. As weapon made to hunt and kill the Vex, we figured this was also a good opportunity to reinforce this theme as well.



* Triggering 'Perpetual Loophole' (by scoring a melee kill while your overshield is active) now also fills your Glaive energy to full.
* Slightly increased Void Overshield trickle-on rate to nearby allies and yourself when guarding.
* Increased the potency of Vexcalibur’s (secret!) innate advantages against the Vex.

   * Vexcalibur's secret damage bonus when striking with its projectiles against a certain enemy faction has been increased from 10% to 25% to match Wish-Ender and Malfeasance.
   * Vexcalibur now briefly disorients non-boss Vex with its melee attack.

**Wardcliff Coil**



Wardcliff Coil is a classic weapon that is easy to use but lacks a niche in a lot of content. We want to double-down on the thematic chaos with a tie-in with the new Arc keyword Bolt Charge, which Wardcliff Coil will grant stacks of to all nearby allies when fired. This change should appeal to players who want to bring more firepower to their team without needing a game plan more complex than “stand near allies, look at enemies, pull trigger.”



* New intrinsic effect: Grants one stack of Bolt Charge to all nearby allies for every two rockets fired (four stacks per trigger pull).

**The Queenbreaker**



One of the most requested features for this weapon was to be able to special-reload to swap between the scopes while in game. We’ve added that functionality along with some other changes to make each scope’s firing mode feel unique.



* Players can special reload at any time to swap between scopes.
* Marksman Sights retains the previous behavior of firing a single shot that chains to nearby targets and blinds them.

   * The range of the chain has increased from 8 meters to 10 meters to make chaining easier.
* Combat Sights now alters the weapon to fire a three-round burst at a charge time of 533. Sustained damage on a target decreases the charge time of the weapon down to 300 charge time (with no loss to damage), useful for quickly dealing damage to bosses or other high health targets
* The scope that you select in the inspection screen will determine which scope is active by default when spawning into an activity.

**The Colony**



The previous changes to the Colony did some interesting things but it still ends up losing out to other grenade launchers due to its base gameplay and proximity detonation behavior. We’ve made a change to push this closer to other GLs in damage.



* Increased detonation damage by 40% -. This puts its damage per shot a little above Legendary Drum Grenade Launchers
* Increased number of bots spawned by 1one for all enemy tiers except players:

   * Player: 1
   * Minor: 1->2
   * Elite/Major: 2->3
   * Champion/Miniboss/Boss: 5->6

**Quicksilver Storm**



The previous changes to this weapon were a little too much, so we have rolled those back some.



* Reduced shots required to trigger a rocket by 17%.

**The Legend of Acrius**



Acrius has long been a viable but particularly niche pick. With the Shotgun changes doing well in the last release we wanted to give this a bit of love in that same theme.



* Reduced spread angle by 33%.
* Increased maximum projectile range from 12 to 18 meters.

**The Fourth Horseman**



Fourth Horseman has also been a particularly niche weapon. We’ve made some changes to help it excel at its mag dump weapon fantasy.



* Reduced the rate of fire slightly to give more control over wasting shots.
* Loads ammo from reserves to the magazine per kill.

**Lord of Wolves**



Lord of Wolves has had a storied history of terrorizing multiple parts of the game and has caught a number of nerfs because of it over the years. With the release and success of Choir of One, we have taken a similar approach to redesigning this iconic weapon.



* Increased range, reduced base damage.
* Removed accuracy penalties from standard fire mode.
* Release the Wolves now triggers on hip fire instead of special reload.

   * Fires full auto.
   * Greatly increased damage and rate of fire.
   * Reduced accuracy and range.
* Catalyst

   * Reload Speed and Stability boosts are now built in.
   * When Release the Wolves is active, dealing damage to targets scorches them.
   * When ADS, defeating targets spreads scorch to nearby combatants.

**Cloudstrike**



Since Bolt Charge is about creating a devastating lightning bolt, it seemed appropriate to interweave that with Cloudstrike’s gameplay loop.



For Bolt Charge, abilities are the only way discharge max stacks, unless you’re behind a Striker’s Storm’s Keep Barricade. These changes allow Cloudstrike to quickly build stacks, which can help bring back your melee abilities faster thanks to Bolt Charge, or cash in quickly with an extra Bolt Charge lightning attack when paired with Storm’s Keep.



* Added behavior to Stormbringer perk:

   * Rapid precision hits create a lightning storm at the point of impact and grants a stack of Bolt Charge.
* Added behavior to Mortal Polarity perk:

   * Precision final blows generate a lightning bolt at the target's location and grants a moderate amount of Bolt Charge.

**Thunderlord**



Since Cloudstrike was updated with Bolt Charge, it was only natural to turn our sights on the original lightning-creation menace. For Thunderlord, our goal was also to tie into what Thunderlord is already doing and reinforce its gameplay mechanic, which is generating lightning through sustained fire.



Similar to Cloudstrike, this means Thunderlord will be great at building stacks and melee ability energy but will also get an extra kick with a Bolt Charge lightning attack when paired with Storm’s Keep.



* Added behavior to Reign Havoc perk:

   * Final blows with this weapon generate lighting strikes from above. Lightning strikes grant a stack of Bolt Charge. Strong against Overload Champions.
####Weapon Perks


**Destabilizing Rounds**



Destabilizing Rounds has been a bit behind its elemental brethren since its initial release. We’ve given it a bit of love to narrow that gap and add some more value to each trigger.



* Now grants volatile rounds for 2s if any targets are hit by the volatile burst from the initial final blow.
* Reduced internal cooldown from 4s to 1.5s.

**Full Court**



With the release and popularity of Area Denial Grenade Launchers, we’ve gone back and added support for them on this perk.



* Now scales the detonation and burn damage of Area Denial Grenade Launchers.

**Ambitious Assassin**



Removed time requirements on the perk to make it more comparable to Envious Assassin, as this perk requires you to use ammo for the weapons this perk is on.



* Removed both multikill and reload timers.

**Flash Counter**



Flash counter had both a restrictive input timing and narrow activation condition that made it very difficult to consistently benefit from. Additionally, flash counter muddied our elemental rules by applying a weaken and slow off the Void element and Sstasis element.



We’ve opened the activation condition to trigger a blast in front of you while guarding against *any* damage, increased the damage of the blast, and made it disorient combatants.



* Reworked to read: ""Taking damage after guarding emits a disorienting blast.""

   * No longer requires a timed input or melee to trigger.
   * Deals moderate damage in a large cone in front of you, disorienting combatants.

##Prepare for our Next Developer Livestream


Heresy is right around the corner, so we wanted to give everyone an in-depth preview of what's to come when it launches on February 4. Our amazing developers are ready to tell you firsthand about the new activities, stories, and rewards they have been working on.



[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/bltf8c09cd30402c27c/6791972979558dcf4d4d1717/Livestream_Tune-In.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/72sRCYP.jpeg)

Follow us on our [official Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/bungie) and tune in on January 28 at 10AM PT to discover what Heresy brings to the table.



Everyone watching the livestream on January 28 on the official Bungie Twitch channel for at least 15 minutes will get the Scorned Organ emblem as a Twitch Drop. It's the perfect sendoff for Revenant.


[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt360064edbcf7e982/67919c8f58fb6d18518121f0/EN_Scorned_Organ.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/eLJ8KkC.jpeg)



Don't forget about our other emblem available through Twitch at the moment. As part of Twitch's Drops Fest, you'll earn the Golden Hour emblem if you subscribe or gift a sub before January 31, 17:00 UTC.

##A New PvP and Trials of Osiris Experience


[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/bltf9cadfa14edad6b8/679037f99d626e532611d501/saint.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/hBXJjKX.jpeg)

This TWID would have been the biggest one yet if the PvP updates didn't end up having their own standalone article. In it, we covered many changes coming to the Crucible experience in general, and the Competitive and Trials of Osiris playlists in particular. We hope you are as excited about all the changes coming as we were telling you.



If you haven't read it yet, don’t miss it. [Here's the link!](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/heresy_crucible_updates)


##Content Delivery Plans for Heresy


Something we wanted to share today is that Heresy will have weekly content and story delivery.



We understand your concerns about our return to this approach, but we have learned a lot from the ‘all-in’ format in Revenant, so in Heresy we’re striking a balance between everything dropping on day one of an Act vs. meaningful reasons to log-in throughout the Episode. To that end we made the vast majority of activities content available on the first day of an Act, with said content evolving based on the weekly story. Additionally, each week will feature a Seasonal Challenge that rewards a new tier of seasonal Weapon. Check out the livestream next week for the first look at this Heretical Arsenal!



Without stepping into spoiler territory, we can also tell you that Heresy won't rely on a fixed length for each Act like the previous Episodes. For example, Act II will last three weeks instead of the standard five or six. Additionally, all reprised Weapons for the Episode will be available at launch, while all the second half of Episodic Weapons will be when Act II launches.



Our goal is to tell a satisfying and exciting story that both serves as an epilogue to the Light and Darkness Saga and that helps pave the way for what's to come when Codename: Frontiers launches later this year.


##Weapons and Armor Updates for Heresy


Now, the longest topic of this TWID: the weapons and armor preview with all the magnificent buffs and necessary nerfs, as well as interesting reworks, that are coming when Heresy launches. We are going to make a coffee pot and leave the room to the amazing Destiny 2 Sandbox Team. Be right back.


###Exotic Armor


[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt1b38dbb3cad41a5b/67919f29e92e093e5ec659d1/Exotic_Armor.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/zxiaR63.jpeg)
####Hunter


**Sealed Ahamkara Grasps**



Sealed Ahamkara Grasps have struggled on Hunter due to the large array of alternate reload options that Hunters already had access to. We’ve reworked its behavior to have a bit more Exotic flair in terms of playstyle.



* Reworked with a weapon-swapping focus to differentiate it from other Hunter reload Exotics. Perk description now reads as follows:

   * Powered melee and finisher final blows grant Nightmare Fuel, increasing handling and airborne effectiveness. While active, freshly drawn weapons deal additional damage and grant Nightmare Fuel on final blows. Gaining Nightmare Fuel reloads all holstered weapons.

**Gwisin Vest**



With the recent roaming Super changes, we decided to give this Exotic a bit of tuning to let it shine in its role, as well as giving some utility outside of the Super.



* Now progresses its Super returns on Super hits as well as kills before becoming invisible.
* Improved the maximum possible Super energy gains per return while also increasing the amount of progress needed for maximum gains.
* Now also emits a cloud of weakening smoke when you exit invisibility while nearby an enemy.

   * Works both in neutral and while in Super.

**Renewal Grasps**



Now that Frost Armor has settled in the sandbox, we feel that Renewal Grasps can safely be more generous in granting it.



* Doubled the rate of Frost Armor gain while in the enhanced Duskfield grenade.

**Foetracer**



While Foetracer offers an excellent way to increase one’s damage, we’ve found that the benefit is too brief when compared to other alternatives. 



* Increased the bonus weapon damage duration from 10 seconds to 15 seconds.

**Radiant Dance Machines**



Radiant Dance Machines has been reworked to allow the multiple dodge charges that it grants to count as real dodges for the purposes of perks and aspects. The trigger mechanism for granting extra dodges requires more effort to compensate for that, but the overall change is a large increase in strength and utility. We have also added some flat benefits to Primary weapons that are a real gamechanger for players who prioritize gun feel and performance when mobile.



* Improves airborne effectiveness and hip fire mobility, range, and accuracy for Primary ammo weapons.
* Multi-kills with Primary ammo weapons refund dodge energy. When dodge energy is full, multi-kills grant extra charges. Powerful combatants and Guardians count as more than one kill.

**Relativism** - **Spirit of Galanor**



With the ability to regenerate a roamer more quickly than ever, it was quite easy to end up chaining roaming Supers back-to-back and effectively never need to rely on your weapons during activities. So, to combat this, we are reducing this capability a little on the armor side specifically for Silkstrike and Golden Gun.



* Reduced the maximum amount of energy refunded for Silkstrike and Golden Gun to 30% (down from 50%).

**Relativism** -**&nbsp;Spirit of the Foetracer**



Spirit of the Foetracer has inherited the changes made to Foetracer.


####Titan


**Citan's Ramparts**



Citan’s Ramparts was last adjusted to account for its problematic dominance in PVP, but that came at the cost of its value across the game. In the current sandbox, we’ve found that many of its downsides can be removed safely in PVE, even with the small buff that gives it in PVP, without introducing those toxic play patterns.



* Removed several downsides applied by Assault Barricade to bring it in line with base Towering Barricade behavior. Cumulatively, these changes result in a Towering barricade you can shoot through with no other downsides while Citan's is equipped (in PVE - see below).

   * Increased barricade health from 400 to 500.
   * No longer increases Barricade cooldown.
   * No longer decreases Barricade duration.
* Further increased damage dealt to Citan's barricades by Guardians from 125% to 160%.

   * This results in near-identical effective Barricade health in PVP (~2.5% less after these changes).

**Eternal Warrior**



We want Eternal Warrior to be an appealing option in both PvP and PvE for players interested in building into Fists of Havoc. We’re giving it increased Super duration on final blow – a nostalgic effect for longtime players that is thematically aligned with the Exotic.



* Final blows with Fists of Havoc now grant extended Super duration.

**Ursa Furiosa**



Our recent changes to Ursa Furiosa to integrate it with the Unbreakable aspect have yet to encourage significant use. So, we want to lean further into supporting Unbreakable by changing the energy returned by blocking with Unbreakable to be grenade energy.



* Blocking damage with Unbreakable now returns grenade energy instead of Super energy.

   * Grenade energy is returned at the end of Unbreakable and is scaled based on the amount of damage you blocked with it.

**Khepri’s Horn**



Khepri’s Horn is getting a glow-up: It will still causes your Barricade to emit waves of damaging Solar energy, but with this update they have been significantly enhanced.



* Now sends out three waves of flame instead of just one.

   * These waves no longer return towards the Barricade - they only travel outwards once.
   * Tracking on the waves has been enhanced.
   * Combatants damaged by these waves are enveloped in a Sunspot. Players are enveloped if they are defeated.
   * Now requires a Solar Super to be equipped to create the flame waves from the Barricade.

**An Insurmountable Skullfort**



As difficulty goes up, Skullfort can feel overly punishing when you fail to land the final blow it’s perk demands. To alleviate this issue, we are extending its effect to grant partial refunds from any melee attack to help rebuild that crucial momentum.



* Now grants energy to Arc melee abilities when hitting targets with any melee attack. Amount granted varies based on the melee used.

   * From most to least energy granted: Powered melees, non-Glaive unpowered melees while Knockout is active, and unpowered melees (including Glaives).

**Stoicism** -**&nbsp;Spirit of the Bear**



Spirit of the Bear has inherited the changes made to Ursa Furiosa.



**Stoicism** -**&nbsp;Spirit of the Horn**



Spirit of the Horn has inherited the changes made to Khepri’s Horn. On Thruster, Sprit of the Horn will now emit four waves in an X-pattern.


####Warlock


**Stormdancer’s Brace**



Much like Spirit of Galanor, we wanted to tune back how much returned energy was given for roaming Supers via Exotics. To compensate, we wanted to give Stormdancer’s Brace a little love in the potency granted to Stormtrance while you are in Super.



* Doubled the damage benefit per stack of Ascending amplitude (up to 20% per stack, from 10%).
* Now also reduces the cost of Ionic Blink during Super by 50%.
* Reduced the maximum amount of energy refunded to 30% (down from 50%).

**Geomag Stabilizers**



Part of the charm of Geomag Stabilizers was lost when sprinting to get Super was removed due to PvP issues. With the introduction of Bolt Charge to the Arc kit, there was an opportunity to bring this experience back without breaking PvP.



* Added a new perk: ""Sprinting while near max Bolt Charge will top it off.""

   * Starts at six stacks of Bolt Charge.
   * Reenabled VFX where boots spark while sprinting near max Bolt Charge.
* Increased Super energy gained from ionic traces to 7% from 2%.

**Secant Filaments (and Spirit of the Filaments)**



Ever since anti-Champion capabilities were expanded to work with elemental verbs inherently, Secant Filaments have felt like an Exotic lost to the flow of time. Giving it a satisfying loop felt like a nice way to give the perk some love for both the base Exotic and its Spirit counterpart.



* Now gives class ability energy per kill while Devour is active.

**Speaker’s Sight**



Speaker’s Sight paired with Ember of Benevolence allowed Warlocks to earn a massive amount of ability energy via the Healing Turret even if they and their fireteam were all at full health. Speaker’s Sight’s impact should be rooted in the actual healing of injured Guardians, so we are making a change to how the Healing Turret selects its targets.



* Healing Turret no longer targets allies at full health.

   * Allies need some damage done to their shields to be eligible targets.

**Verity’s Brow (and Spirit of Verity)**



The Death Throes buff is quite potent, but it is easy to let it run out and lose all your grenade benefit. We have updated this Exotic to bring it in line with how the similar Titan Exotic Wormgod Caress works: Stacks of Death Throes are now represented by a meter that decays backwards through each tier rather than falling off entirely when the duration elapses.



* Now uses a meter to track Death Throes

   * New durations per tier:

      * x1: 8 seconds
      * x2: 7 seconds
      * x3: 6 seconds
      * x4: 5 seconds
      * x5: 4 seconds
   * When one tier’s duration elapses, the buff will downgrade to the next lower tier rather than expiring entirely.
   * Bonus grenade recharge per tier:

      * x1: 0.5% per second
      * x2: 1% per second
      * x3: 1.5% per second
      * x4: 2% per second
      * x5: 2.5% per second
####Exotic Class Item Shared Perks


**Spirit of Verity**



Speaking of Verity, the above changes extend to the Exotic Class Item version as well. On top of this we are also giving some more of the base Exotic to the Spirit of version to help players build into grenades on Prismatic.



* Gained bonus grenade recharge rate, but provides 50% of the base Verity's Brow Exotic.

####Global


**Aim Assistance**



Destiny’s various aim systems are a foundational part of what makes Destiny’s guns feel like they do, but they do not come without some edge cases.



When using the controller input, we’ve taken a stab at trying to solve an issue where a quickly moving target crossing your vision could pull your aim off your previous target by introducing a time-based component.



We now weight aim assist against targets you’ve aimed at for a short time more strongly compared to brand-new targets when a new target is introduced by crossing your reticle.



We understand that this is a potentially wide-reaching change but have thus far been satisfied with the results in our playtests. Controller players, please let us know if you encounter any issues as a result of this change.



* Aiming at a target for a short time will prevent another target moving very quickly across your reticle from dragging your aim off it. Controller only.
####Weapon Archetypes & Subfamilies


**PvE Damage Tuning**



We’ve tuned up some low-performing weapon families in PvE to bring the competition a bit closer together when you are selecting weapons to use. These changes should help a number of archetypes that have been in need of some love for a while.



* Scout Rifles

   * +15% vs minors
   * +30% vs majors
* Auto Rifles

   * +10% vs minors and majors
* SMGs

   * +5% vs minors
   * Additionally, in 8.1.5.3 we increased base magazine size by 10-15% rounds based on the mag stat.
* Trace Rifles

   * +20% vs minors
* Linear Fusion Rifles

   * +10% vs all combatants

**Glaives**



Glaives have historically been a niche weapon type that has found it hard to break into mainstream usage. In this update, we are applying a sweeping buff to many of the Glaive’s baseline stats and behaviors to remove some of their unwieldiness and make them a more attractive and easy-to-use option.



With these changes, the intent is that Glaives become more agile and need to reload less often, are effective at longer ranges and more forgiving, and are more impactful when completing their full melee combo.



* Significantly increased Aim Assist, Aim Magnetism, and Damage Falloff Ranges across the board for all Glaives.
* Improved Glaive projectile hit registration.
* Increased the baseline effects at all stat values for:

   * Handling speeds, including shield ready speed and draw and stow speed.
   * Magazine size
   * Projectile speed
   * Reload speed
* Final hit of the melee combo deals double damage.

   * This hit also inflicts much more flinch on PvE combatants.

**Aggressive Frame Fusion Rifle(s)**



Only one Aggressive Frame Fusion Rifle exists within the game to date: Coriolis Force, issued back in Beyond Light. We’d like to give the subfamily a bit more love to try to sell its unique charged spread-shot gameplay with a complete rework.



The original fired its pellets all at once, so its recoil felt Shotgun-like. With the rework, we wanted to stay true to the Fusion Rifle performance of controlling your recoil over the burst, so we converted it to fire multiple bursts of pellets.



These shots suffer from damage falloff much less than conventional Fusions to compensate for their widespread angle and let the player fire into packs of PvE enemies and still score multiple kills.



Don’t worry, you won’t have to go get Coriolis Force on Europa if you want to try these changes out; new reworked Aggressive Frames with new perk pools are coming in this Episode.



* Aggressive Frame Fusion Rifles now fire three bursts of four pellets in increasingly wide spreads.
* Increased minimum damage when fully outside of damage falloff range from 45% to 65%.
* Increased range falloff start by 4m relative to normal Fusions.
* Increased range falloff end by 3m relative to other Fusions.
* Increased damage versus minors and majors by 15% relative to normal Fusions.

**Support-Frame Auto Rifles**



We’d like to support (*heh*) more Support Frame Auto Rifles in the future. Currently, their range stat is not especially desirable because of their unique projectile properties, so we took the opportunity to make range directly affect its healing performance by adjusting how far away the weapon can lock-on to and heal an ally.



No Hesitation remains close to its original behavior with this change with its base stats – this change primarily affects perks and mods applied to No Hesitation and opens more space for future Support Frames to differentiate themselves.



* Range now increases how far away you can heal another Guardian.

**Rocket-Assisted Frame Sidearms**



Rocket-Assisted Frame Sidearms shipped *particularly* potent while also being easy to use. We reduced the reserves for these in Revenant to bring their uptime a bit closer to other Special weapons, and with these changes we are moving these into a more defined niche; keeping them potent within that niche but being a bit less universally useful in all situations. With these changes they should remain a viable, ammo efficient option for clearing minor-, major-, and Champion-tiered targets with direct hits without also being great at killing everything nearby the primary target.



* Reduced PvE detonation damage by 45%.
* Increased PvE impact damage by 100%.
* Reduced Aim Assist falloff and maximum distance by 8m.
* Reduced magnetism falloff and maximum distance by 8m.
* Reduced damage by 30% vs boss, vehicle, and miniboss targets.

   * Buried Bloodline's body shot damage is unaffected, critical hit damage is buffed by 8%.
* The range stat was vestigial to the weapon subfamily, so we've removed it.

   * Range masterworks and enhanced intrinsics will be replaced with something more appropriate.
####Exotic Weapons


**Lorentz Driver**



Lorentz Driver was once a terror in the Crucible and has since caught a number of changes to its efficacy. Since then, it has struggled to compete in most activity types. We’ve made a few changes that will reward you for playing its bounty game successfully and keep it going into further encounters.



* Picking up a bounty tag now grants 1one ammo to the mag.
* Triggering Lagrangian Sight by picking up a bounty tag adds 6six ammo to the mag, the first time you trigger it.

   * Returns to adding one ammo per tag on extensions while the buff remains active.

**Delicate Tomb**



We’ve made a few adjustments to Delicate Tomb to help get it into its Tempest Cascade loop a bit more predictably and give it significantly more punch while buffed.



* Increased the chance to make an Ionic Trace from minor combatants from 4% to 10%.
* Increased the PvE damage bonus on the Tempest Cascade shot from 30% to 100%.
* Removed the timer from Tempest Cascade. Lasts until fired.

**D.A.R.C.I.**



D.A.R.C.I. has long struggled to compete with its Exotic brethren, so we are taking a stab at building a niche for it in a fireteam the way Gjallarhorn and Ergo Sum have found for their respective weapon types. This new catalyst should give you an edge up in encounters where Snipers may not previously have been viable.



* Added a new catalyst perk - Networked Targeting

   * Hits with Personal Assistant active grant you and nearby allies improved overall weapon performance and precision damage with non-Exotic Sniper Rifles.

      * Improves recoil, flinch, target acquisition, handling and precision damage.
      * Stacks up to 5x.
      * D.A.R.C.I also gets this buff itself.
   * D.A.R.C.I user also gets +15% damage after granting five stacks to a teammate.

**Edge of Action, Edge of Concurrence, Edge of Intent**



The class Exotic Glaives have felt a bit clunky since their addition to the game. We’ve made some changes here along with the global changes to Glaives that we help will smooth over the gameplay loops on each of these, as well as add additional neutral game value outside of the special shots.



* All Class Exotic Glaives

   * Special shot is no longer tied to Glaive energy.

      * Now triggered on six weapon hits to allow the special reload.

         * Increments off both shots and melee hits.
      * Edge of Concurrence

         * Effects of Jolting Feedback trait added to intrinsic perk.
      * Edge of Action

         * Effects of Destabilizing Rounds trait added to intrinsic perk.
      * Edge of Intent

         * Effects of Incandescent trait added to intrinsic perk.
         * Added Cure pulse to special shot impact.
         * Healing Turret no longer targets allies at full health.

            * Allies need some damage done to their shields to be eligible targets.

**Centrifuse**



Centrifuse’s perk that reloads the magazine while sprinting encourages pivoting and repositioning, but as it stands the magazine is just a tad restrictive and sometimes feels burdensome in PvE.



We’ve increased the magazine size to increase the potency of this perk and let you keep the weapon’s accumulated charge for longer before needing to reload.



* Increased mag size to 45.

**Dead Messenger, Hard Light, & Borealis**



We’re revisiting the Exotic perk “The Fundamentals” to modernize it a bit. Elemental keywords such as Restoration and Volatile have become a part of Destiny 2’s modern fundamentals. The stat bonus based on current element has been removed in favor of a damage bonus when you apply or receive an elemental keyword matching the current element. We’re also giving a small stat bump to Borealis since some high-skill PvP players have taken a liking to its current stat offerings.



* The Fundamentals:

   * New effect: Grants a 30% damage buff (10% in PvP) to this weapon for 10 seconds when you apply or receive an elemental keyword that matches the currently selected damage type of this weapon.
   * Removed Effect: No longer grants different stats based on current element.
* Borealis only: Increased Stability by 20 and Aim Assist by 10 to permanently grant it the Void element bonus that it will no longer have access to, since Borealis is a sleeper pick in PvP.

   * This bonus was selected over Arc, since there are more ways to gain Handling.

**Telesto**



Overall, Telesto is a solid weapon, but it lacks a solid high point in its power fantasy and does not interface with buildcrafting much. Additionally, the weapon has a unique dual identity as a weapon associated with the Awoken Harbingers in-universe and associated with a storied history of Telesto-specific bugs in our community. With that in mind, we gave it a buff that embraces both aspects and ties them together in a single, deeply self-referential package. How do you buff Telesto? Make it *more* Telesto.



* Telesto

   * Harbinger's Pulse:

      * Now only refills Telesto's ammo from reserves (instead of Telesto and your Kinetic slot weapon).
      * Now triggers with any Void final blow.
      * Final blow requirement increased from two to three, however Telesto final blows count double (in other words, will trigger from two Telesto final blows, one Telesto final blow + one other Void final blow, or three other Void final blows).
      * Multikill timer increased from 2 seconds to 4.5 seconds.
   * Catalyst

      * New perk: Harbinger Seethe
      * After three activations of Harbinger's Pulse, special reload the weapon to cause a rain of Telesto projectiles on your next direct hit.

**Vexcalibur**



With the buffs last season to Void Overshield’s effectiveness, it seemed like the weapon could use a few tweaks to take maximum advantage and emphasize the paladin-protector fantasy with its area overshield.



We’ve made it easier to generate guard energy in PvE when wading through enemies and quicker to apply overshield to your allies. As weapon made to hunt and kill the Vex, we figured this was also a good opportunity to reinforce this theme as well.



* Triggering 'Perpetual Loophole' (by scoring a melee kill while your overshield is active) now also fills your Glaive energy to full.
* Slightly increased Void Overshield trickle-on rate to nearby allies and yourself when guarding.
* Increased the potency of Vexcalibur’s (secret!) innate advantages against the Vex.

   * Vexcalibur's secret damage bonus when striking with its projectiles against a certain enemy faction has been increased from 10% to 25% to match Wish-Ender and Malfeasance.
   * Vexcalibur now briefly disorients non-boss Vex with its melee attack.

**Wardcliff Coil**



Wardcliff Coil is a classic weapon that is easy to use but lacks a niche in a lot of content. We want to double-down on the thematic chaos with a tie-in with the new Arc keyword Bolt Charge, which Wardcliff Coil will grant stacks of to all nearby allies when fired. This change should appeal to players who want to bring more firepower to their team without needing a game plan more complex than “stand near allies, look at enemies, pull trigger.”



* New intrinsic effect: Grants one stack of Bolt Charge to all nearby allies for every two rockets fired (four stacks per trigger pull).

**The Queenbreaker**



One of the most requested features for this weapon was to be able to special-reload to swap between the scopes while in game. We’ve added that functionality along with some other changes to make each scope’s firing mode feel unique.



* Players can special reload at any time to swap between scopes.
* Marksman Sights retains the previous behavior of firing a single shot that chains to nearby targets and blinds them.

   * The range of the chain has increased from 8 meters to 10 meters to make chaining easier.
* Combat Sights now alters the weapon to fire a three-round burst at a charge time of 533. Sustained damage on a target decreases the charge time of the weapon down to 300 charge time (with no loss to damage), useful for quickly dealing damage to bosses or other high health targets
* The scope that you select in the inspection screen will determine which scope is active by default when spawning into an activity.

**The Colony**



The previous changes to the Colony did some interesting things but it still ends up losing out to other grenade launchers due to its base gameplay and proximity detonation behavior. We’ve made a change to push this closer to other GLs in damage.



* Increased detonation damage by 40% -. This puts its damage per shot a little above Legendary Drum Grenade Launchers
* Increased number of bots spawned by 1one for all enemy tiers except players:

   * Player: 1
   * Minor: 1->2
   * Elite/Major: 2->3
   * Champion/Miniboss/Boss: 5->6

**Quicksilver Storm**



The previous changes to this weapon were a little too much, so we have rolled those back some.



* Reduced shots required to trigger a rocket by 17%.

**The Legend of Acrius**



Acrius has long been a viable but particularly niche pick. With the Shotgun changes doing well in the last release we wanted to give this a bit of love in that same theme.



* Reduced spread angle by 33%.
* Increased maximum projectile range from 12 to 18 meters.

**The Fourth Horseman**



Fourth Horseman has also been a particularly niche weapon. We’ve made some changes to help it excel at its mag dump weapon fantasy.



* Reduced the rate of fire slightly to give more control over wasting shots.
* Loads ammo from reserves to the magazine per kill.

**Lord of Wolves**



Lord of Wolves has had a storied history of terrorizing multiple parts of the game and has caught a number of nerfs because of it over the years. With the release and success of Choir of One, we have taken a similar approach to redesigning this iconic weapon.



* Increased range, reduced base damage.
* Removed accuracy penalties from standard fire mode.
* Release the Wolves now triggers on hip fire instead of special reload.

   * Fires full auto.
   * Greatly increased damage and rate of fire.
   * Reduced accuracy and range.
* Catalyst

   * Reload Speed and Stability boosts are now built in.
   * When Release the Wolves is active, dealing damage to targets scorches them.
   * When ADS, defeating targets spreads scorch to nearby combatants.

**Cloudstrike**



Since Bolt Charge is about creating a devastating lightning bolt, it seemed appropriate to interweave that with Cloudstrike’s gameplay loop.



For Bolt Charge, abilities are the only way discharge max stacks, unless you’re behind a Striker’s Storm’s Keep Barricade. These changes allow Cloudstrike to quickly build stacks, which can help bring back your melee abilities faster thanks to Bolt Charge, or cash in quickly with an extra Bolt Charge lightning attack when paired with Storm’s Keep.



* Added behavior to Stormbringer perk:

   * Rapid precision hits create a lightning storm at the point of impact and grants a stack of Bolt Charge.
* Added behavior to Mortal Polarity perk:

   * Precision final blows generate a lightning bolt at the target's location and grants a moderate amount of Bolt Charge.

**Thunderlord**



Since Cloudstrike was updated with Bolt Charge, it was only natural to turn our sights on the original lightning-creation menace. For Thunderlord, our goal was also to tie into what Thunderlord is already doing and reinforce its gameplay mechanic, which is generating lightning through sustained fire.



Similar to Cloudstrike, this means Thunderlord will be great at building stacks and melee ability energy but will also get an extra kick with a Bolt Charge lightning attack when paired with Storm’s Keep.



* Added behavior to Reign Havoc perk:

   * Final blows with this weapon generate lighting strikes from above. Lightning strikes grant a stack of Bolt Charge. Strong against Overload Champions.
####Weapon Perks


**Destabilizing Rounds**



Destabilizing Rounds has been a bit behind its elemental brethren since its initial release. We’ve given it a bit of love to narrow that gap and add some more value to each trigger.



* Now grants volatile rounds for 2s if any targets are hit by the volatile burst from the initial final blow.
* Reduced internal cooldown from 4s to 1.5s.

**Full Court**



With the release and popularity of Area Denial Grenade Launchers, we’ve gone back and added support for them on this perk.



* Now scales the detonation and burn damage of Area Denial Grenade Launchers.

**Ambitious Assassin**



Removed time requirements on the perk to make it more comparable to Envious Assassin, as this perk requires you to use ammo for the weapons this perk is on.



* Removed both multikill and reload timers.

**Flash Counter**



Flash counter had both a restrictive input timing and narrow activation condition that made it very difficult to consistently benefit from. Additionally, flash counter muddied our elemental rules by applying a weaken and slow off the Void element and Sstasis element.



We’ve opened the activation condition to trigger a blast in front of you while guarding against *any* damage, increased the damage of the blast, and made it disorient combatants.



* Reworked to read: ""Taking damage after guarding emits a disorienting blast.""

   * No longer requires a timed input or melee to trigger.
   * Deals moderate damage in a large cone in front of you, disorienting combatants.
##Draw, O Coward!

"Arsenals, Armories, and Add-Ons",createthisworld,1i86xqo,2025-01-23 11:13:28,5,0.86,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/createthisworld/comments/1i86xqo/arsenals_armories_and_addons/,OceansCarraway,[INTERNAL EVENT],"Standing on the basic success of industrialization, the KPR has turned it's investment focus from peace to defense-for about five minutes. The KPRA, known to everyone simply as the Army, and the KPRN-which should just be called the navy-needed weapons, and their weapons needed maintenance and replacement as they aged out. Already, the existing patchwork system of workshops and factories simply wasn't enough to handle an entire Army's worth of equipment, even with merciful staging and proper mechanization. A much more permanent solution had to be implemented, and it had to be implemented now. 

An army shoots guns, but it needs a lot more than guns to do it's job. That's why the first thing it requested was a series of factories devoted to producing nonlethal consumables-everything from food and uniforms to locomotives and bedframes. About 24 of these factories were quickly assembled, using fairly simple approaches to produce the butter that went along with the guns. Many of these places are using fibers in some form or another, necessitating loom operations, and of these fibers, many are hemp. While they drew their peacetime consumables directly from the internal pool of raw materials, in wartime the military will open multiple resource extraction efforts, ranging from plantations and mines to manacumulators and small refineries. The factories have bottlenecks in places where hand tooling and assembly are required, and the only limit is needing workers. Priority has gone to expanding the use of machinery and automation for pre-processing to take workers out of the field and into the factory; simpler but larger workshop buildings are still being assembled but should be done by the end of the year--and magical lighting needs to be installed after the second year of operations. 

An additional bottleneck exists in the use of civilian rail, but energy needs are being accounted for by the maturation of coal stockpiles and an opening of a third wave of more efficient coking plants. These facilities have options, but they also have limits. The financial model for these facilities is non-optimal, but in wartime cash is less a problem than victory. This is backed up by a robust and reliable procurement system that has been slowly replacing an ad-hoc system of intendants, purchasing officers, and other such divided agencies. The only place where independent purchasing remains a primacy is in ship operations, where the captain has purchasing power when abroad. Financial worries will exist for accountants and anti-corruption watchdogs, but at least the logs are in good shape.

With the butter sorted, one has to look at the gun. This involves not only cranking out lots of guns, but managing the guns that one already has. A core part of this is setting up armories. The existing weapons of the Army run the risk of deteriorating in the cold and rain, so maintenance must be intense-even up to the level of relying on factory equipment. By using the output of several machine building plants for about half a year, the Army has obtained the machinery it needs to do this independent of the factories. Each armory is usually situated a base, although they can be deployed forward. Armories can repair nearly anything that breaks, and they have limited part production capacity, consuming smaller amounts of steel to make parts-the supply chain here has been integrated, for better and for worse. And if soldiers are bored, then they are can always go to one of the portable reloading benches and contribute.

Finally, there are strange phantasms from the past: the arsenals. The pre-revolutionary regime had set up a series of arsenals to make it's weaponry, some of which dated back centuries to single workshops or castle towers. The KPR has had enough reason to keep them around, although they have needed extensive cleanup and renovation. Most of these facilities needed to be rebuilt in their entirety, their old tools and forges replaced, and entirely new systems of management dropped in-never mind the staffing. While existing pollution concerns are definite annoyances, the sheer productivity gained by powering up these facilities with new steam engines and installing louder equipment speaks for itself. These arsenals are capable not only of production of significant volumes of firearms and the maintenance of even larger amounts of guns, they are able to maintain artillery and produce small amounts of these cannons for field use. Recently, they have completed a series of rifling operations. Arsenals also have supported military research and development; they have redeveloped the ability to cast 6 inch and 8 inch naval guns, and are working on developing a rocket platform for saturation strikes. A naval arsenal is also under expansion, and there is significant work being done to start spinning off explosives production...however, these facilities are fundamentally limited by their heritage.

A coda is necessary, and this is the statement this is not only the most that Korscha is capable of diverting to military production at the moment, but the most it is willing to. Despite taking up a good bit of the slack, the KPR has only achieved a good start-it has a long way to go, and more must be done to actually have a military industry. However for now, something is much, much better than nothing."

Fortnite Is Actually Better Now Than Ever Before (Hear Me Out!),FortNiteBR,1i7sfk2,2025-01-22 20:54:49,0,0.4,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1i7sfk2/fortnite_is_actually_better_now_than_ever_before/,Unlucky-Assistant-13,:br1::br2::br3::br4: DISCUSSION,"Hey, Fortnite fam! 👋

I know the title might ruffle some feathers, but hear me out before you hit that downvote button. Fortnite has been around for a while now, and we’ve seen it go through its ups and downs—new seasons, wild updates, polarizing changes, and even a black hole. I’ve been playing since OG Chapter 1, so trust me when I say I get the nostalgia goggles. But if we’re being honest, Fortnite is actually better now than it’s ever been, and here’s why.

# 1. The Content Is on Another Level

Back in Chapter 1, Fortnite was amazing because it was simple and fresh. We all have fond memories of the double-pump, tilted towers, and the *first time* we saw a rocket launch live. But let’s not pretend we had the variety we have now. Fortnite in 2025 is a playground of possibilities. Want to sweat in build mode? Go for it. Prefer the no-build option? That’s there too, and honestly, it’s been a game-changer for so many players. Creative mode? You can literally build your own games, practice mechanics, or mess around with friends. And don’t even get me started on the collaborations—we’ve got **Star Wars**, **Dragon Ball**, **Marvel**, and more. Fortnite isn’t just a game anymore; it’s an entire universe.

# 2. Epic Listens (More Than We Give Them Credit For)

I know people love to say, “Epic doesn’t care about the community,” but let’s take a step back and actually look at what they’ve done. They brought back OG maps with Chapter 4 Season 5! That’s something we’ve been begging for forever, and they made it happen. They’re constantly tweaking mechanics and balance based on feedback, even if it doesn’t always hit the mark. And when they don’t nail something, they pivot (looking at you, mechs). Fortnite is one of the few games that evolves constantly—and yeah, it might not always be perfect, but at least they’re trying new things instead of letting the game stagnate.

# 3. The Skill Gap Is More Balanced Now

Remember when sweats absolutely dominated every lobby, and casual players couldn’t even survive off the battle bus? Yeah, that wasn’t exactly “the good old days” for everyone. Skill-based matchmaking and no-build mode have made Fortnite more accessible while still leaving room for competitive play. Sure, you’ll still run into the occasional cracked player who builds a five-star hotel in two seconds, but now you have options to avoid that if it’s not your vibe.

# 4. The Community Keeps It Alive

Let’s be real: Fortnite isn’t just about the game itself—it’s about the community. Whether it’s memes, creative maps, or people debating whether OG Chapter 1 was better, the game thrives because of us. And that’s pretty special. Fortnite has become a shared experience that brings people together, whether you’re an old-school player or just joined in Chapter 4.

# 5. Nostalgia Is a Trap

I get it. I miss the OG days too. But nostalgia has this funny way of making us forget the rough edges. Remember the bugs? The lack of mobility? The barren loot pool? Fortnite today has way more variety, and honestly, if the OG map dropped with all the limitations it had back then, people would complain in a week. Epic has improved so much while still keeping the spirit of the game alive.

At the end of the day, Fortnite is better now because it’s more inclusive, more creative, and more fun than ever. You can log in and play it your way, and there’s truly something for everyone. So yeah, you might miss the old days, but give current Fortnite the credit it deserves—it’s evolved, and that’s what’s kept it alive while so many other games have come and gone.

What do you all think? Agree? Disagree? Let me know in the comments—I’m ready for the hot takes!"

"AMPX - That's right!  I bought more!  A deeper dive into their relationship with KULR and the bullish momentum in the space sector.  With Trump and his czar of space, Elon, whispering in his ear, Amprius is positioned to benefit from the warm tailwinds of rocket ships as they blast off to the moon!",Shortsqueeze,1i7db4p,2025-01-22 10:13:50,97,0.99,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/comments/1i7db4p/ampx_thats_right_i_bought_more_a_deeper_dive_into/,GiosepeFavolino,DD🧑‍💼,"[https://amprius.com/](https://amprius.com/)

I bought more!

Big respect to this community.  If you're reading this, thank you, drop a comment, get others thinking.  If we pool our combined knowledge, critical thinking, and ideas we can make money.  Now let's make some money!!!!

For those of you who have read my previous posts on Amprius, I focused mainly on the fundamental financial prospective announced in their Q3 earnings call (if you have not listened to their Q3 earnings call and are thinking of buying this stock, you need to listen to that earnings call):

""AMPX Q3 earnings call""...type that into google and hit video it will pop right up.  

In this earnings call the CEO confirms $20M more revenue from just two new clients realized by May, 2025, shipped, invoiced, and happy clients hopefully placing a second order each.  The CFO confirms $3.2M less CAPEX in Q4 and $4.2M less CAPEX min in Q1 2025 due to their build out of their Fremont, California factory (now finished) and the completed design of their Brighton, Colorado factory.

In this post I will largely ignore these financial fundamental drivers that I think will largely contributed to a massive spike in stock price and do a deeper dive into their relationship with KULR, the contracts we can infer that Amprius has also won by proxy of their relationship with KULR and how this positions Amprius to benefit from rocket ships...as in, quite literally, rocket ships.

An interesting thing note is that Amprius has largely not publicized their contracts.  The CEO has confirmed that they have: 2 new clients worth $20M revenue in the short term, 2 new LOI's with Fortune 500 companies, and interestingly a partnership with KULR (whose stock price saw a massive 1800% squeeze in common shares across two months - November to December to end 2024).

I see the announcements of these these contracts as being short term catalysts between now and their Q4 earnings.

In April, 2024 KULR first released a PR announcing their partnership to create advanced batteries specifically for ""KULR ONE SPACE"":

[https://www.kulrtechnology.com/kulr-technology-group-and-amprius-technologies-form-strategic-partnership-for-advanced-battery-packs/](https://www.kulrtechnology.com/kulr-technology-group-and-amprius-technologies-form-strategic-partnership-for-advanced-battery-packs/)

https://preview.redd.it/wqsryy8y7kee1.png?width=1612&format=png&auto=webp&s=8dfce02ca73c6c5b32616c49ee780cfce3eb60bf



This was a partnership to develop safer batteries for NASA and military applications that KULR has labelled ""KULR One Space.""  Pay close attention to this KULR One Space partnership as this is very important later.

Who actually possesses the lithium-ion battery technology and actually manufactures these batteries?  That's right: Amprius.

  
Then in August of this year we get another PR announcement from KULR further expanding upon this partnership, explicitly naming KULR ONE and Amprius's Silicone Anode battery tech:

[https://www.kulrtechnology.com/kulr-partners-with-amprius-technologies-to-develop-reference-design-to-enhance-battery-safety-and-performance-in-advanced-air-mobility/](https://www.kulrtechnology.com/kulr-partners-with-amprius-technologies-to-develop-reference-design-to-enhance-battery-safety-and-performance-in-advanced-air-mobility/)

Ok now fast forward to December 3rd and we get an announcement from KULR (that does not even mention the involvement of Amprius) that they have successfully developed NASA approved battery cells:

[https://www.kulrtechnology.com/kulr-announces-immediate-availability-of-nasa-certified-m35a-battery-cells-for-jsc-20793-packs/](https://www.kulrtechnology.com/kulr-announces-immediate-availability-of-nasa-certified-m35a-battery-cells-for-jsc-20793-packs/)

https://preview.redd.it/iaex64tk8kee1.png?width=1591&format=png&auto=webp&s=a38289c4efccb2ce2b25a9cef821868ca17df882

Who do you think made these batteries?  

Fast forward two weeks to December 17th and we get another announcement about an actual signed service agreement with SpaceX and NASA about the actual launch of the ""KULR ONE SPACE"" Batteries.  

[https://www.kulrtechnology.com/kulr-signs-service-agreement-to-launch-kulr-one-space-battery/](https://www.kulrtechnology.com/kulr-signs-service-agreement-to-launch-kulr-one-space-battery/)

They've made the name even cooler now and shortened it to ""K1S.""

They say that this will validate the flight capabilities of the ""first commercially-off-the-shelf lithium ion batteries...""

https://preview.redd.it/b5ekiwkw8kee1.png?width=1646&format=png&auto=webp&s=820ce57f71b7e27cd42236b916d61f29dc55c2f9

  
Wait!  Commercial off the shelf Lithium Ion batteries!!!  This is all Amprius tech!  

Where is Amprius in all of this?  Literally no mention of Amprius at all.  But this is 100% the silicone lithium ion technology that Amprius provides.  Think back to their first PR announcing the partnership for K1S.

These exact words are something the CEO of Amprius parrots.  Two years ago they shipped the ""first commercially available lithium ion batteries...""

[https://amprius.com/amprius-technologies-ships-first-commercially-available-450-wh-kg-1150-wh-l-batteries/](https://amprius.com/amprius-technologies-ships-first-commercially-available-450-wh-kg-1150-wh-l-batteries/)  


https://preview.redd.it/zu2lw8279kee1.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e133ada614dc460c64658ca28d33700ac8578e4

All of this space talk from KULR with the ""K1S"" and Amprius is not mentioned anywhere in it.

  
Ok so now you've got to watch this video they released on Sept 15th, 2024 outlining this product...:

[https://www.kulrtechnology.com/kulr-one-space-k1s-product-overview-2024/](https://www.kulrtechnology.com/kulr-one-space-k1s-product-overview-2024/)

  
Look at this first page from their Product Overview Summary:

https://preview.redd.it/h50lvk6i9kee1.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=41da15ddda8cfa1957b2542c57096212331bc7e2

The space economy is growing to $1T by 2030.  They mention major players like SpaceX and Blue Origin and their introduction to a new comer in Intuitive Machines...wait...LUNR?  

Another one of my biggest positions and a big winner for me in 2024.  This is another stock that I first found on r/shortsqueeze that I researched and purchased before they were awarded the NSNS contract.  Thank you short squeeze!!!!!

I bought specifically because of that NSNS contract.  I have already taken profit and double my initial investment off the table and plan to hold this position until at least their IM2 launch end of February.  See positions here:



https://preview.redd.it/6qiqtra25kee1.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab863985192d144ca220dceaaf42f006f0831eb7

https://preview.redd.it/wow9iqgs4kee1.png?width=1157&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d5f59f7bc06399ac55d4286801cc79f4c562d94

KULR explicitly mentions in this video and product overview:  

""if the battery fails, so does the mission.""

Now I'm really interested.  Could there be some sort of partnership on the horizon for Amprius and these Space companies?  This is unclear at this point but certainly seems plausible given the performance and safety standards of their batteries with their partnership with K1S and, by proxy, their partnership with NASA.

In any case, all of these NASA and military contracts that KULR has won, many of which have fueled the KULR run up, are by proxy also Amprius contracts.

Add colour to this by starting to ponder the effect that Trump taking office will have on the space industry. 

Elon is FOR SURE telling Trump that space is the future because that is what Elon truly believes.  Watch any interview with Elon where he is talking about his goals and the primary goal, more than changing the world with Tesla, is changing the world by inhabiting, exploring, and monetizing space.

This Trump administration without a doubt will look favourably on the space economy and industry.

Who is developing batteries that make space exploration easier, longer, lighter, more advanced:

**AMPRIUS IS!**

Positions:

$35,000 USD common shares

$16,000 USD warrants

With a baby call to see how a leap performs against a warrant.  So far the warrant is kicking the call's ass, despite being bought at the identical time with another 1.75 years of runway on it.

I bought these two new positions yesterday:

https://preview.redd.it/yl4zlurx5kee1.png?width=1464&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ac325a286b375c308d587988bfdadcaa6936d7e

That's right: heavier on warrants.  $4500 USD new warrants. $3300 USD new commons.

For a greater discussion on warrants see my post last night.  Intelligent Play, I hope you are reading this.  Hello, if you are and respect!

With such a long expiry I see massive value in these AMPX warrants as the common share price approaches the strike of $11.50.  Gains will be exponential.

  
For anyone who thinks they are too late on this play: I bought these new positions yesterday and I am down slightly on them and I am still buying more.  DCA-ing into this and growing a huge position (although I wish I had just jammed all in about a month ago)!  

We are early!!!!!  We are the start of this huge run!!!!!

This stock has not run huge yet.  It will soon, though, as contracts are announced and earnings are released.

To the short squeeze community: thank you!  Have an amazing day.  I look forward to the next JSmith release on MATE.

I'm heading out on a 2 week vacation tomorrow to the sun from the frigid cold here in Canada.  I won't be posting but I'll be lurking.

Critical thinkers, unite!  Let's make some money!!!!"

How Can You Identify the Best Creative for Your Amazon Ads?,u_amzonestepusa,1i7ba4b,2025-01-22 08:38:09,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_amzonestepusa/comments/1i7ba4b/how_can_you_identify_the_best_creative_for_your/,amzonestepusa,,"The biggest challenge about running Amazon ads is identifying the right creative for your ad – which might feel like looking for a needle in a haystack. But what if you could open the door to how you can actually successfully differentiate yourself from the competition?

 The right ad creative doesn’t just get attention; it wins clicks, increases conversions, and sky-rocket sales! If you are having a hard time getting your audience’s attention or just desire to leave your competitors behind, then learning about effective creatives is your secret to success. 

Are you prepared to know the best strategies for your **Amazon FBA** business? It is now time to look at approaches that will help elevate your ads from the ordinary.

*Explore More:* [*Why Amazon Video Product Ads Convert Better: The Power of Visual Storytelling*](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/why-amazon-video-product-ads-convert-better-the-power-of-visual-storytelling/)

# Discover Buyer keywords

The language derived from buyer intent keywords is valuable because it targets potential consumers who are willing to purchase.

 These keywords depict what the customers are seeking, in a sense; they want something and are likely to buy. 

* For example, words such as ‘best’, ‘buy’, ‘affordable’, ‘cheap’, and ‘top-rated’ are the terms that provoke the feeling of urgency and interest.

# How to Use Them

 Start with these intent-based phrases using that is provided by **Amazon FBA** or use SEMrush and Ahrefs. Determine what customers are interested in, in terms of your product niche. Then you must integrate these keywords into the ad headlines, descriptions as well as the image text.

# Example

 If you are selling wireless earbuds, ensure the headlines include “Over-Ear Sealing Wireless Noise Canceling Earphones for Business and Tourism.” Your ad description could further elaborate: “This brand of cheap yet high-quality earpiece is perfect for jogging, exercising or travelling.”

# Why It Works

 Many buyer intent keywords are selected to address active consumers or potential buyers. Just appeal to their current wants or needs, and you’ll be able to get clicks and a conversion rate to boot. Those typing in these terms are further along in the customer journey and therefore, your ads will work better to sell.

# Pro Tip

First of all, inspect CTR and CR systematically to determine which keywords, associated with the buyer’s intent, help you achieve the highest ratings among users.

# Align Keywords with Product Benefits

Keywords are not only used for finding your product; it can also be used to emphasize the PROs of your product SAMPLING. As a result, customers are interested in ‘what is in it for them’, and therefore targeting associated keywords to the value proposition feature of the product.

# How to Use Them

 Sample this: Reflect on your product’s key benefits and how they solve the customer’s problems. It is also important to use the keywords which are pointing to these benefits in the ad creatives’ text.

# Example

 In the case of a neck massager, the following headline can be used: “Travel Neck Massager – Say No to Neck Pain” or “Neck Massager – Freedom from Neck Pain whilst on the Move.” Your ad copy could then expand on it saying that it is lightweight, easy to use, and perfect for travelers.

# Why It Works

Customers are attracted to solutions to their problems. It is much more engaging and persuasive because by presenting benefits associated with keywords your ad addresses them directly.

# Pro Tip

Take direct from consumer reviews/feedback and ladder map questions to define frequently cited benefits and challenges to inject into [Ads creatives.](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-improve-amazon-fba-ads-creatives/)

# Leverage Long-Tail Keywords

Long-tail keywords are keywords that are phrases containing three or more words, and because they are relatively long phrases, Semantic Analysis says that they are highly specific. 

Although they may not attract as many visitors, people that type in those terms are more likely to make a purchase because they are looking for a specific product.

# How to Use Them

Opt for carrying out [keyword research](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-keywords-research-tool-wordspy/) to feature specific long tail phrases regarding your product. List the above keywords in your ads titles, descriptions and even in images if you are using paid ads. Specific keywords are particularly effective for [Sponsored Products](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/mistakes-to-avoid-with-amazon-sponsored-products/) ad format and especially for Sponsored Brands.

# Example

Aim for something specific; instead of using a keyword like ‘yoga mat,’ use a keyword phrase as ‘organic, non-slip yoga mat for starting learners.’ Your ad headline could be “Get into the Right Yoga Trend with Our Environmentally Friendly Mat.”

# Why It Works

 Long-tail keywords have low competition and conversion potential is much higher compared to normal keywords. Marketing managers using these terms benefit from consumers who are already in the ‘purchase consideration’ stage.

# Pro Tip

Another way is to type the desired keyword in Amazon or Google Keyword Tool to find second-level keywords that competitors rarely target.

# Mark Your Headlines with the Keywords

In a strategic position the headline may be the first thing a shopper has to notice in a given shop. Subsequently, using keywords in headlines makes the document relevant as it is appealing.

# How to Use Them

Choose your focus keyword and create an attention-grabbing headline using the keyword plus a call to action or a killer proposition. It is short and unambiguous to enable the reader to act as soon as possible.

# Example

 If you are selling a product with the main keyword as non-stick cookware set’ then the dynamic headline should be something like this: “Revamp Your Kitchen with our Non-Stick Ceramic Cookware Set.”

# Why It Works

Specific words in the headline make Shoppers aware that your product is what they are looking for when they enter a search query. A strong headline also increases click through rates so your ad does not get lost in a crowded marketplace.

# Pro Tip

Always experiment with the headline different formats which include [A/B tests](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-a-b-testing-your-amazon-listings/) to see which one will best fit your audience.

# Using Highlight Keywords For Product Images

[Product images](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-product-photography) are one of the most vibrant components in the advert since they convey the desired focus. Adding often used keywords which may be inserted discreet text can help deepen an image’s impact.

# How to Use Them

This helps to add keyword driven phrases using simple readable fonts on the images of your product. Such could draw probably the factors of difference, added values or unique selling propositions. It is not to make the text look overcrowded or detracts from the product within the image.

# Example

 For our fitness tracker, it may be possible to place text over the picture such as “Best Waterproof Fitness Tracker of the active lifers”.

# Why It Works

 Using multimedia with keywords is powerful; people get more than just a message – they get a series of mental prompts reminding them of your message.

# Pro Tip

Make sure the inscriptions in your images are in the same spirit and design as the rest of your ad campaign.

# Optimize Ad Copy with High-Volume Keywords

A large number of keywords is crucial because it aids in bringing up the ads on Amazon’s platform. These keywords are very useful in generating traffic as they are relevant on search engines and thus very useful for reaching out for a larger market.

# How to Use Them

 Volumes of these keywords can be found on resources such as SEMrush, Ahrefs, or the [Keyword Tool](http://www.inc.com/larry-kim/every-marketing-tool-you-need-to-know-about.html) of Amazon. incorporating these keywords naturally into your ad text will look unnatural and unnatural. It is our aim to remain fluent in our language and address our readers as members of the target group.

# Example

 If you sell pet food the advertisement might go as follows: ‘Feed your pet with this grain-free dog food for sensitive stomachs.’ An excellent diet on its own, nutritionally dense, it can make your dog a happy camper. 

# Why It’s Useful

 Broad keywords guarantee the ad is displayed at high traffic places with more clicks to reach more prospects impressions. If properly utilized, these keywords will make your listing to attract more traffic thus more clicks and more sales.

# Pro Tip

 Despite the importance of volume, a keyword list should not be overloaded with words that are not in some way related to the topic of the site. While a keyword can find substantial traffic, the same keyword if irrelevant to the product on offer will lead to wasted money on ads with low conversion rates.

# Design Seasonal Advertises with Current Feathers

Seasonal keywords enable you to associate your advertisements with a point within the year, occasions, or celebrations. This makes your campaigns always up to date.

# How to Use Them

 Search on Google Trends or the search trends of online retailers like Amazon to get the ideal keywords depending on the season. 

Sometimes, to continue having your ad appear frequently to Facebook users, it is advisable to change the creatives of your ads to suit the theme of the particular season or event, these trending keywords.

# Example

 For instance, an ad for blanketing during winter can come up with the headline: “Experience Warmth; Get the Best Heated Blankets for Winter. Likewise for holidays you could make ad messages such as; ‘Best Selling Christmas Gifts For Under $50.’

# Why It’s Useful

Another type of keyword is called the seasonal keyword because [customers are likely to engage](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/a-premium-engage-customers-with-dynamic-visual-content/) with it when shopping for a particular season. By targeting trends, you orient your product as an obvious choice to consumers during that season or event which increases the conversion rate.

# Pro Tip

 Start doing season campaigns early enough so that you are able to sell to early birds within that season.

# Make Use Of Keywords To Influence Ad Descriptions

Although straightforward, ad descriptions are vital in ensuring that customers are convinced enough to click and make a purchase. Using keywords in writing the descriptions leads to the preparation of fascinating yet informative descriptions about the product.

# How to Use Them

Determine the first and second order keywords to include in product descriptions. Concentrate the value proposition on benefits and specifications when making the argument informal.

# Example

 As for the water bottle, here’s what the description could go like: “Keeping you and our planet hydrated on the go is our BPA-free, leak-proof, water bottle.” As crafted for outdoor use, it is highly portable, extremely robust, and manufactured using environmentally friendly materials. In this case, often used words such as ‘BPA-free water bottle’ and ‘leak-proof water bottle’ are incorporated quickly.

# Why It’s Useful

 Keyword-rich descriptions are not only good for SEO on a given ad but also offer shoppers information which can be of use to them. This combination makes your product more attractive to consumer’s search and eye.

# Pro Tip

 Avoid keyword stuffing. The emphasis should be on coming up with descriptions that are useful, stimulating and that don’t force the keywords in.

#  Use Negative Keywords

Negative keywords allow you to eliminate some search terms so that you can fine tune your ads. This is good when you’re publishing your ad publicity, and you don’t want your advertisement to be set for those search keywords that will not lead to any sale.

# How to Use Them

 Review your campaign data and determine which keywords are setting up unnecessary visits to your site. Include those into [negative keywords](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-master-negative-keywords-in-amazon-ppc/) since they are of no use in the search query.

# Example

 If your products are pricey like luxury watches do not use prohibited words such as cheap watches, discount watches and so on. It is therefore advisable to use keyword phrases such as; ‘High-end watches’ or ‘Luxury Timepieces’.

# Why It’s Useful

 Exclusion of negative keywords allows the targeting of shoppers that drive the most conversions to the campaign’s benefit. Not only do you get rid of useless clicks, but also all your key ad metrics improve as a result.

# Pro Tip

 Anyway you should review your search term reports often in order to find more negative keywords and adjust your targeting.

# Tips for Designing Eye-Catching Amazon Ad Images

[Amazon ads](https://arfield22.medium.com/amazon-ads-my-experience-key-takeaways-efe535f00df9) rely heavily on visuals to grab attention and drive clicks. A well-designed ad image can make all the difference in converting a casual browser into a buyer. Here are some actionable tips for [designing compelling Amazon ad images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/design-matters-a-b-test-uncovers-the-winning-main-image-formula-for-amazon-sales-and-conversions/):

# Prioritize High-Quality Images

[Images are the foundation of how Amazons](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-turn-shoppers-into-buyers-with-killer-amazon-images/) appear to viewers – and the higher the quality, the better the ads. The technical specifications do not read, consumers need visuals to gauge the perceived quality of an item, and so images have to be bright, clear, and expert. 

Pixelated or worsened image quality can significantly diminish trust and lead to further ignorance of the potential buyer on your listing. The aim is to make sure that your [product images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/is-your-amazon-listing-missing-the-power-of-3d-product-images/) reflect your brand in the best way possible and give the customer that assurance to click through to the page.

 To get the best results, it is advisable to have your own camera or [hire a product photographer.](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-product-photography) Correct positioning, orientation, and a general enhancement of details eye-catching about the product on offer. 

Postmodifying images with professional quality is not only relevant to improve credibility and overall quality of the course, but also meets both Amazon’s resolution and clarity demands for images.

# When Useful for Amazon Sellers

It works well for marketplaces where sellers do not merely want to blend in and become a small fish in a large pool and where click through rates are influenced by perceived [product image](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/what-are-the-key-elements-of-a-winning-premium-product-image/).

 It is far easier for customers to purchase an item when they are sure of what they are purchasing, hence the need to use high-quality images.

# Show the Product in Use

[Lifestyle images](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-product-photography) are useful in filling this gap because they illustrate a product alongside its possible applications. They enable the customers to see how the product will complement their daily living. 

* For instance, an image to be attached to an advert for a fitness tracker could depict somebody jogging or exercising with the tracker on. The sort of imagery used herein helps make an emotional appeal because it reveals how a product can be useful. 

This is well suited to those products that need context, for instance furniture, fashion, wearable technology or home appliances.

# When Useful for Amazon Sellers

This kind of strategy has to be used by the sellers who present goods which demonstrate their effectiveness in real life – for instance, clothes, sport equipment, or kitchen utensils. It improves the degree of customer awareness and assures them by demonstrating utility.

# Use Clean and Simple Backgrounds 

**Amazon FBA** has rules regarding the background, and the allowed color is white or neutral color at most for the main product image. These backgrounds help in avoiding any distractions past the product while at the same time making the product information highly visible. 

Clean backgrounds also provide the look of professionalism, and your ad will too. Moreover, there is the option of using so-called lifestyle/contextual images for post-header images with lower visibility for the secondary or Sponsored Display ads. 

No distractions are as effective as a plain background to give the shoppers detailed analysis of the product in question.

# When Useful for Amazon Sellers

It also has an advantage of helping all the sellers since it conforms to the **Amazon FBA** rules but at the same time makes the product appear more attractive. Clean backgrounds seem important for the Sponsored Products ad since simple images encourage clicks.

# Highlight Key Features with Text Overlays

Text overlays are useful in that you can make important product details readily visible within your ad images. For example, if you are a blender producer you can focus on “800W Motor” or “BPA-Free Material”. 

It is recommended to use simple and clear messages written in large typed and contrasting colors of fonts. Do not cramp the image with too much information as clear depiction is highly valued.

 Text overlays are a good way of marketing something and also ensuring that important information is passed to clients as they browse through other products.

# When Useful for Amazon Sellers

This is beneficial for the sellers in competitive markets where setting your product apart by features can create clicks. It is best performed in [Sponsored Brands](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-sponsored-brands-ads-a-quick-tutorial/) or Display ads considering that images form the core of the campaign.

#  Incorporate Branding Elements

The branding features should also be integrated into the ad images because branding is instrumental in ensuring customers trust your brand. When your logo is in the corner or the colors match the background, at least you are remembered and the main point is, the product is not overshadowed. 

Effective branding in your visuals helps make sure that your customers will always relate your product with reliability and quality. Do not over [brand the product](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/sell-branded-products-on-amazon/), while branding should be evident it should not obscure the main product being sold in the market.

# When Useful for Amazon Sellers

Of all the advantages of branding, branding is most effective to the sellers who are developing the long-term sales market or sellers who are penetrating into new fields by introducing new products. 

Branding used consistently throughout the marketing communication supports this identity and makes consumers recognize and trust it. This is especially vital especially if the main aim is to make several sales for the same customer since repeated branding retains the customer.

# Use Contrast to Stand Out

Utilizing contrast properly in your ad images makes your product standout in a perfectly competitive world. Indeed, a product contrasted from its background, positive or simple one, such as a bright red object placed against a [white background,](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/product-photography-on-a-white-background/) will definitely generate more attention. 

The bold colors may help draw the client’s attention to important attributes, however the model cannot be overwhelmed with other details that do not concern the product.

 Inadvertently, an equal split between brand communication and product communication, makes the prospect aware of the product which leads to improved click through rates and hence the ads.

# When Useful for Amazon Sellers

This strategy is especially important for sellers thus simplifying the process of competitive product differentiation. This is important because in such crowded places they need an image that will attract their target market. High contrast images make sure your product grabs client attention and increases the chances of appeal.

# Highlight Promotions

Using promotional offers in your ad images is also a significant method of getting attention and calls for action. Using tags that reflect on deals such as 20% off or; limited time offer on your images adds the emphasis of discounts/ offers.

* For bundled products, bright stickers with words like “Best Value” or “Special Bundle” next to the offer, can further attract customers. Clear promotional visuals are those that communicate utility to the consumer as well as compel him or her to act right away. 

Marketers’ point out that customers like to bargain and this is why the offers of discounts you can make by displaying them visually in your ads will increase the value of your sale.

# When Useful for Amazon Sellers

Promotions are most fit for sales campaigns or during festive seasons or launches of new products. During such periods, consumers are shopping around for appealing offers.

 If you use discounts and offers sections then they can help to get more attention towards your store and hence people will click on your listing more often. This strategy is also useful especially when a brand is introducing a new product, or when they want to deal with previous inventory.

# Incorporate Scale References

When sizing is a problem, customers return your products or leave bad feedback; therefore, using some references to explain to the customers the size of the product you are selling is important. 

This is especially so where users might place a lot of emphasis on dimensions, such as when ordering furniture, appliances or any other item. 

Using measures in relation to a figure, for instance photographing a product in-situ or alongside another familiar object ensures that customers are well informed about the size of the product. 

* For instance, the representation of a travel mug with a hand holding it will enable the clients to consider the capacity of the mug in a much better way than a mug alone.

# When Useful for Amazon Sellers

This strategy is particularly appropriate to those sellers who [provide products](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/7-ways-to-provide-product-reviews-on-amazon/) whose size or dimensions may be very important. 

Everyone can understand that it’s useful to give scale references, for such items as furniture, kitchen appliances, or home decoration items. Gives direction and dispels misunderstanding in help avoid a discontented customer and returns, which is better for them and for the business.

# Test Multiple Variations

By conducting A/B testing through variations on images you understand which of the visuals that the target market will respond to. When using different angles, layouts or context of the ad image, the perfect ones can be developed through continually tweaking the images with better results. 

This makes testing more useful because you get to see what images make people engage with the ad more, thus adoption of better solutions as far as advertisements are concerned. 

That is why A/B has been traditionally very effective whether one conducts an experiment on the contrast of flat-lay and lifestyle product images or the difference in background colors.

# When Useful for Amazon Sellers

It is particularly handy for sellers who want to get the most out of the advertising they offer to their customers since it enables them to research several versions at once.

 Thus, it’s possible to produce customer preferences shift, whereas constant evaluating helps to keep the advertisements as interesting and engaging as possible.

 This is useful for any type of seller that is out there as it can help them to make small but decisive changes to their visual approach when selling a product, regardless of type and niche.

# The Role of Call-to-Action (CTA) in Amazon Ad Creatives

The Call-to-Action (CTA) is an essential part of the ad [creatives run on Amazon](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/7-creative-amazon-product-photography-ideas-to-stand-out/) since it leads customers toward the intended action to take. 

As a tool for advertising persuasion FTAs can have a considerable impact on your ads ‘performance whether you are leading a client to a product purchase or product page or simply presenting a promotional ad. 

In Amazon advertising where attention is scarce and competition rife, an effective CTA reminds the customer what he/she needs to do next which is to buy your product.

#  Directs Customer Behavior

In general, the role of a CTA within ad creatives on **Amazon FBA** is to steer the customer’s actions. Simple, specific calls to action that state messages such as ‘Buy Now,’ ‘Shop Now,’ or ‘Learn More’ are effective in getting users to act without pricking their conscience.

 Even the best quality product pictures or product descriptions may not arouse the next step in the buying process if there isn’t a CTA.

# Why It’s Important

A CTA also explains to the viewer what he/she should do next, which gives direction to a viewer and hence—</html> This is particularly the case when in a single session, a user is going through many different products on **Amazon FBA** and needs to have an extra nudge to buy something.

# Creates Urgency and FOMO

Typically, CTAs effectively should include elements that compel the user into action immediately. Essentials like “Sale,” “Ending Soon,” or “Closing Soon” puts pressure on buyers and creates a fear of missing out (FOMO).

 This is especially true with those consumers who use the Amazon site, keen on prices and time-constrained, they may decide not to purchase a product now in the hope of finding a better price in the near future.

# Why It’s Important

This can increase conversion rate and is really effective in highly competitive categories where the client may not devote a lot of time. Hence, what you get with an urgent CTA is inviting the shopper to make some move now and not later before they lose interest.

#  Improves Conversion Rates

Being the last push that the customer receives before making the decision to buy, CTA is an important component of a marketing mix. Advertisements that have a high call to action are often more effective because they tell viewers of the advertisement what they need to do in the next immediate step. 

This is particularly important on **Amazon FBA** since a customer might be browsing several sites at once and needs a reminder to finish buying.

# Why It’s Important

Thus, proper guidance of users to the next stage of decision-making will lead to improved [conversion rates](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/7-tips-to-increase-amazon-conversion-rate-2022/) since it eliminates unnecessary decision steps. If the CTA is closely aligned to the customer’s desires – to buy, to find out more, or look at other choices – they are more likely to act on it.

# Enhances Brand Communication

CTAs are also useful when presenting the proposition that defines your brand to your target audiences. Others used a call to action such as ‘Discover quality’ or ‘browse our list,’ which are useful in explaining what makes your brand unique. 

* For instance, when selling a new product or a product’s features, the CTA can lead the shoppers to learn more regarding the product or understand how the product will be useful to them.

# Why It’s Important

Such a CTA not only directs instant conversion but also sets the groundwork for brand familiarity in the long haul. By pointing consumers to more [content about your brand](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-add-amazon-enhanced-brand-content/) or products, you rebuild the relationship and possibly gain loyal customers.

# Optimizes the Ad Experience

The properly placed CTA enables consumers to receive the best ad experience based on the ad journey. Regardless of whether the user is invited to read more information about the offered product, to look through other goods or make a purchase, the CTA provides clear focus to the ad and guarantees that the specified information will not remain unnoticed. 

* For instance, a click-through-action in the Sponsored Products ad is “Add to Cart,” while for the Sponsored Brand ad, the action might be “Shop the Full Range.”

# Why It’s Important

The goal of integrating CTA is to achieve the desired needs of the target market at every step of the funnel, thus the proper alignment of the CTA with the ad message. This not only enhances usability, but, in addition, boosts the ad’s results as well..

# Directs People to Particular Products

A CTA can be pointing to a certain product or a certain Amazon [landing page](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/affiliate-landing-page/) so the buyer knows exactly what they are looking for with ease.

* For instance, “Shop Now” or “See More” will take the user, immediately, to a product page helping them navigate seamlessly to know more about the product and make the purchase.

# Why It’s Important

When a seller offers numerous similar products or different colours, sizes, etc of the same product, a specific CTA aids the buyer to arrive directly at what they are looking for without wandering around the store. On the same note, this style reduces the much-needed hurdles to the purchase.

# Ways of Creating the Most Effectual CTAs in the Amazon Ads

# Keep It Clear and Simple

This is why the CTAs should be immediate and straightforward. Prompts like “Buy Now”, “Shop Today”- these are commands that tell the user what to do.

# Use Action-Oriented Verbs

You should use action verbs such as Discover, Explore, Save or Order as these stimulate an action.

# Match the CTA to the Ad Format

It’s also important to make sure that your CTA is consistent with the type of adverts you have in places. A Sponsored Product ad might use a “Buy Now” button while a Sponsored Brand ad might use a call to action of “Shop the Full Collection.”

# Make It Stand Out

Make your CTA stand out using different or brighter colors or make font size big as compared to other words. You should be able to identify it quickly within your ad creative.

# Using Product Benefits to Enhance Amazon Ad Content

# Highlight Pain Points and Solutions

When it comes to [effective Amazon advertising strategy](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/effective-strategies-for-amazon-product-ranking/) one of the most engaging techniques for consumers is to focus on the key problems that people meet in everyday life. 

Shoppers are always in search of a solution when they are engaging in personal shopping, that is when they are [shopping online](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/analytic-review-online-shopping-gear-shift-amid-corona-virus/). By following everyone’s problem and positioning your product as the solution, you establish a first-degree emotional appeal on the customer.

* For instance, if your business is in the sales of cleaning products, your ad might focus on how hard it is to clean with normal cleaners. Consumers may get annoyed by this issue and most are probably seeking a quicker way to resolve it. In this way, since one’s time is limited and they always desire to remove a burden or save effort, by demonstrating how the product works, you touch on these aspects.

# Example

“Tired of scrubbing? Our powerful cleaner takes minutes to wipe stains from your surfaces, leaving them clean.

This statement not only emphasizes the product but also there is an issue/persona – the agony of washing stains through scrubbing. When consumers understand how your product was designed to solve a particular problem or how it performs that task well, they develop the urge to buy it.

# Why It’s Effective

That is why when you offer a solution to a particular problem, you bring relevance to the customer. They are likely to act on the message as compared to the country men because the product satisfies their needs. 

This technique is good for products on the categories of needs where shoppers are in search of solutions to particular issues for instance cleaning, health, or home repairs amongst others are looking for a better solution to what they used earlier.

# Emphasize Time-Saving Benefits

Everyone knows that time is money and especially for the [shoppers of Amazon](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/uncovering-the-psychology-of-amazon-shoppers/), Hence, any product which can avail this bulk amount of time has a cutting edge over others. 

Whether the simplification of a process, the reduction of a task into a concise procedure, or the speeding up of an outcome, anything that is presented to the customer as time saving or efficient can be a reason for the purchase of a product.

When creating the copy for the Amazon advertisement remember to depict the importance of your product in the lives of these customers, especially the aspects of convenience: time-saving. This is quite relevant to such items as some specific cooking appliances, smart home assistants, or any other gadgets that are to save customer’s time to some extent. 

The issue is to show how much time will be spared by using your product, and how the time that will be spared will bring value to the customer.

# Example

‘Cut your time in the kitchen, with our instant pressure cooker ready to cook meals in minutes!’

# Why It’s Effective

The general trend which is clearly evident among many consumers is the desire to use products as a way to save time. When it concerns essentials such as time, clients are more likely to make a purchase since products that save time make them happy.

 Including this benefit erects an appeal to emotion because of the association of convenience and the product in the context of the customer.

# Showcase Versatility

Today, the customer is interested in obtaining a product that will serve him in several different ways and at the same time will not be expensive. This of course is especially the case with items that can be utilized in multiple incidents or have multifaceted application features. 

By making your product specific and unique selling proposition to highlight how it can serve multiple functions, it convinces the target market on **Amazon FBA** to buy because they gain convenience.

Utility products address a number of issues, which makes them highly appealing to consumers who need to either minimize the number of objects in a household, or maximize the use of the objects owned. 

Hence, if you have a tool, an appliance, or a technological product, showcasing its versatility will help to make it more attractive.

# Example

“With wheels for easy portability in its folding design, this portable speaker will also serve as a torch light when the party moves outdoors.”

What makes this [product unique](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-supercharge-amazon-ctr-for-your-unique-product-listings/) is that it is a speaker but comes with an extra use and function as a flashlight. Nonetheless, the flexibility evident in the ad reduces the pure informative message by thrilling the customers and making them think about the type of situations they could apply it in.

# Why It’s Effective

Consumers are in search of products that would solve many problems and therefore when you bring out the usability of a given product, their value is enjoyed. Rational decision making appeals to those who desire to eliminate complexity or attempt to optimize the usage of a specific amount of money. 

These versatile products can also be appealing to a wider market, thus commensurately raising the chances of making a sale.

# Classical Rhetorical Appeal by Calling for Action

Of course, product attributes work; however, the rational or emotional appeal often seems to be the [main selling point in Amazon](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/is-it-time-to-up-your-amazmain-image-strategyon/) advertising. 

People do not purchase commodities because of capability, they purchase them due to the emotions that they will experience, the life they will be experiencing once they acquire the product. Emotional appeal makes use of the feelings that product use can offer the individual, such as success, achievement, and the like.

The physical format is particularly useful where the consumer is looking to improve their quality of life by making a purchase that relates to health & fitness, clothing or the home. 

While attention must be paid to the product features, explain how the product positively affects customers’ mood or makes them feel improved.

# Example

“Let’s Get fit with our highly elastic, long-lasting resistance bands and experience strength in every rep.”

# Why It’s Effective

When you concentrate on the benefits of lifestyle you appeal to feelings and hence appeal to the customers’ heart making your ad more persuasive. 

If customers have an emotional attachment to the product, they are willing to put their money into it, provided the product in question meets their needs in some way be it personal or emotional.

# Download Sustainable or ECO-Friendly or Green Benefits

As awareness of the environment is extended, marketing of the environmentally friendly properties of your product will go a long way in its marketing.

 That is, your product might be made from eco-friendly materials or it minimizes wastage or it is environmentally friendly, these qualities are going to be very vital to many customers.

Today’s customer wants and needs go beyond the mere utilitarian – they care not only how efficiently a product performs but also its footprint on the environment and the world.

 Often customers who are concerned with the environment are in search of such messages, and adding an eco sustenance-related message will help you capture those people who are ultimately looking for just this kind of product on Amazon.

# Example

“This notebook is made of 100% recycled material and helps you minimize waste while remaining organized.”

This message is in fact particularly well-suited to targeting the green consumer by the presentation of the sustainability advantages of the product. It locates the product in terms of functionality and sustainability, which can be very effective early on when people are shopping in a category where there is a lot of competition.

# Why It’s Effective

As more customers become aware of their Sustainable impact, the promotion of environmental benefits is likely to increase the level of customer commitment. 

Such a message may affect the purchase decisions especially those of the young people who are now more conscious of the impacts of their purchase on the environment.

[Chapter 15 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i1xrka/what_it_cost_the_humans_xv/)

Over the following three weeks, the number of incidents like the one we had lived on Holy Terra multiplied exponentially but, unfortunately, we weren’t able to be everywhere. This was a time of sorrow for a lot of people. 

We did our part and kept the peace as best we could. But this was not what we had been made for. The seven of us waited for our turn to return to the fray. We were all getting increasingly frustrated by the people of Holy Terra, by Command, by the wait. 

What made matters even worse was the Command couldn’t get their act together. Apparently, not only had the bugs whacked us but we were now chewing off our own faces as we couldn’t decide who was to govern. Was it the remnants of the Federal Government of Holy Terra in Exile? Was it LunaGov? Some of the outer colonies were voicing their dissatisfaction at how things were being handled. Not that I can blame them. Command, in all its wisdom, had recalled the Fleets. Local fleets had refused the call to defend Holy Terra, arguing that it would leave the outer colonies defenceless. They weren’t wrong. Tactically, the move sucked. 

The Lagrange Orbital Defence Stations were now saturated with incoming ships. So much so, that the effectiveness of the interdiction zone was pretty much compromised. If the bugs wanted to take another shot at us, there was squat we could do to stop them. 

It took us another month to get a semblance of order back. During that time, everything sucked. AC had become a bug world. Those UoS bitches had officially accepted that AC was now in the bug empire. We lost territory in the Hephaestus System. All the engagements we knew about were holding strategies and not all of those were successful. Command had lost contact with the Silent Watchers. Our next deployment was supposed to be by their side. Now that wasn’t going to happen. 

On the homefront, things were a little better. Apparently, our recruiting campaign was successful. Billions of people started joining up, not only to the Armed Forces but many volunteered for Augmentation. Command was pretty tight lipped about it, even to us, but word got out that augmentation was a viable option. On the newsfeeds, we saw vids of the process. I guess that meant that we were no longer a covert operation. Those going through augmentation were lauded as the First Sons of Holy Terra, “Super soldiers”, the Hammer of Justice, the next phase of human evolution. 

Command showed vids of our engagement with the Bugs. At first, I was a little surprised until I realised that most of the footage they showed was bogus. The vids were AI generated. Sure, they were cut with some real raw footage of our deployments but mostly those were just us living on ship, training between deployments. There was one where I was lifting and one where we were loading in the launching tube but the rest was total BS. I guess the Federation didn’t want to scare off any potential candidates.

Another consequence of being whacked by the bugs was probably scarier than all the federal ads. It was the devotion the people seemed to have for us. Devotion didn’t seem like the right word. Fervour maybe? 

Wherever we went, people called out to us as if we were their Saviours. We had clearly become more than just soldiers, or even poster boys for the war. People knew of us as the Sword of Holy Terra, the Saviours of Holy Terra, Terra’s Angels. The names people gave us were endless. 

I think it really hit me when we were on Luna base. We were in the area restricted, so, limited to military personnel with a high enough clearance. The soldiers looked at us with awe. We had experienced something similar on Sanctuary but not this of scale. It was as if we had become royalty or something. People bowed to us, got out of our way wherever we went, some knelt in front of us but most begged, begged for our help, begged for us to take the fight to the bugs. And these people were part of the armed forces. They knew about the rigours of training during basic. They at least knew of some of what we had been put through but even they seemed to be needing guidance. 

It felt as if we had collectively lost our shit. We had become lost. I didn’t have a better word for it. Once Terra was hit, we, as a species, lost it. The posters and holovids promoting services were everywhere. Ads for augmentation became common place. The slogan they used was found in old Terran archives, “Be all you can be.” Somehow, those words took a whole different dimension now. On the Feeds, it had become common place to belittle other species, animosity towards the Bugs was pretty normal but all forms of Xeno were now the enemies of Terra. Those in the armed forces were said to be on a Holy Crusade and we were their vanguard. Newsfeeds closed with thoughts for the soldiers and prayers of victory.

The other thing is that before Terra being whacked, we still had to go through chain of command to get anything done. Now, well, now, it was as if all stops had been removed. We wanted anything, literally anything, we just asked. Heck, we didn’t even need to ask. N’Guyen had said something along the lines of ‘wouldn’t it be nice to have something other than canned chow’ and the next thing we knew we were being served the best cloned cow Luna could offer. 

It was the same for military operations. All we needed to do was ask and an army of oderlies would bend in half to find us what we asked for. It really hit us when Jenkins was speaking with some soldier posted outside the restricted area. He was saying that we would need to take stock of what assets we had, update our equipment to be able to take the fight to the Bugs. Jenkins nodded and made a half-assed compliment about the soldier’s sniperscope. Next thing we knew, Jenkins had a new scope. The guy literally knelt in front of Jenkins and offered him his scope. Sweet. That probably meant that we could all score some pretty sweet equipment.

When we watched the feeds, other than news updates from the front, there were messages of increasing fervour that saturated the nets. One of the ones that really stuck with me was some older guy, some priest figure, who was saying and here I quote, “ As the scriptures say, ‘I, the Lord, come not to bring peace, but a sword’. You, the people of Holy Terra and her Sisters among the stars, are that sword. You are the very defenders of civilization itself. The forces of good against the forces of evil. For this war is indeed a crusade! A holy war to ensure the survival and dominance of Humanity. In truth I tell you: the Bugs are not like us, neither do they think like us, for they are not, like us, children of God. Are those who exterminate entire worlds populated only by civilians the children of God? I do so tell you that they are not. They are the spawn of Evil. And it is your holy duty to avenge the death of Holy Terra and to protect her Sisters among the stars. So I do call upon you, my brothers and sisters, you must go forth, into the stars, and, with God as your sword, you will strike the Utkan down, you will cleanse the stars of their filth. With God's help, you must kill every single Utkan wherever they will hide, among the stars or in their dens, young or old. Kill every single one of them so that the Children of Holy Terra may never fear the monsters in the dark again. The Lord be with you.""

As I listened, I couldn’t help but think that he was right. The Bugs were an existential threat to us. We’d been at war with them for decades at this point. We had never really considered them a threat but, now, they had destroyed our cradle. They had slaughtered civies, women, children. They had no rules of war, no sense of morality. They had no sense of right and wrong. They were animals, nothing more. They would do whatever it took to eradicate us. Like an infectious disease, they spread through out the stars and defiled everything they touched. They altered their environment to suit their needs, they altered their DNA to adapt to their environment. They stood for nothing, just an endless thirst to drink every world in their reach dry.

Vermine, parasites. There were no better words to describe them. They weren’t even a civilisation. They were a scourge upon the stars and it was our holy duty to cleanse them.

Over the next few months, we engaged in holding operations on the fringe worlds. We had been told it was to give the civie diplomats time to work out a diplomatic solution with the other xenos, to isolate the Bugs and weaken them. In truth, it was because we were running out of manpower. We had been throwing walls of men and women at the bugs but it only slowed them down. And the seven of us could not change the tide of war on our own. We needed more time. And that time was bought with the blood of servicemen and women who held the line but we knew it would not be enough. We now needed the bulk of our people. We needed to call upon the strength of our people.

We had filled their minds with fear, their hearts with rage, the souls with righteousness. We would be the beacon in the dark. People had started calling us the Angels of Vengeance, the Saviours of Holy Terra. Now was the time to live up to that name. 

What really set people off was when the Popess Chrystal XI, Rabbi Mark Levy and Imam Ibrahim Nurhayati, the heads of the three biggest religions on Holy Terra, now relocated on Luna, came on the feeds and declared in one voice, “There is no sin in raising your sword against Evil, for it is charity to risk your life to protect your brothers and sisters in battle. We fight not for land or honor but we fight for the lives of those who wish to live free. That freedom that the Utkan know nothing of, those soulless monsters who defile the work of God. O what a disgrace if such a despised and base race, a race of monsters and demons, should conquer a people which has the faith of omnipotent God and is made glorious with the name of our Saviour! Let those who have been accustomed to wage private warfare unjustly against the faithful now turn their weapons against Evil and end with victory this war which has been going on for far too long. Let those who, for a long time, have been too cowardly to stand in the defence of Holy Terra, now become her knights. Let those who have been fighting brother against brother now turn their blades against those monsters and avenge the death of our Mother. 

For your brethren who live among the stars are in urgent need of your help, and you must hasten to give them the aid which has often been promised them. For, as the most of you have heard, the Utkan have attacked them and we lose territory even as we speak. They have defiled the first of Mother Terra’s sisters among the stars. They have killed billions and they will kill billions more. If you permit them to continue thus with impunity, the Innocent will once again fall under their power. We must now hold the line against the Night. We must wield the sword of Vengeance and smite down the Wicked. Whether you are young or old, rich or poor, we call upon you to join us in this Holy Crusade. Let those who for a long time, have been weak, now become strong. Let those who have tried to take the high road and find reason within the Utkan now open their eyes. Let those who have been serving in our Armed Forced be filled with righteous fury. Let any who stand against us be felled like wheat before the scythe!! For *we* stand on the side of righteousness!! In memory of our Mother. For Holy Terra!!”

It had the desired effect. People now lived with a fervour that bordered on fanaticism. The mere mention of the Bugs seemed to send crowds into a frenzy. People had started acting with deference towards us before the attack but now it took on a whole new dimension. We were the Angels of Terra. And people treated us like Angels, as if we had really become holy figures.

The strangest thing was when we went to Camp Selena on Luna. We were going to be presented to the new recruits so that they could see what augmentation meant. 

We got to Camp Selena. It was a strange place, an underground facility where thousands were now drilling manoeuvres, weapon handling, procedures and regs. As we walked through the corridors, we saw people who were sitting, being lectured on xenobiology, star maps, engineering and a thousand other subjects. When people saw us, they stopped doing whatever they were doing and knelt as we walked past. 

It still felt strange to see people who were soldiers behave so subserviently. 

As we walked in silence, there came a commotion from one of the study halls. We all looked through the huge plexiglass windows and saw a bunch of kids, they couldn’t have been older than twelve. As we focussed on them, we realised there was a thing inside the room with them. Two boys were standing on its back as the rest started ripping the wings off the thing, some sort of huge flying insect. I gave it a quick glance but it didn’t look like an Utkan, well it wasn’t any type that I recognised. I quickly looked over to Kitten who looked just as stoic as the others and he just shrugged his shoulders. Nothing to see here. I wondered what it was but the teacher seemed to have things in hands so all was good. 

As we continued, the prostrating adults muttered things like, “Angel, please bestow your blessing upon my son,” “My Lord, avenge my wife. Exterminate those Bugs,” “Take the war to the stars. In memory of the Fallen of Terra.”

I think I can speak for the others when I say that î could feel the weight of their words. We were effectively the only soldiers who could have an actual impact on the war. We were the Angels of Terra, her first Sons, moulded to be her blade, to take war to the stars and bathe in the blood of her enemies. 

Kitten stopped at the side of a woman, kneeling in front of us, and said, “We intend to, Ma’am.”

For some reason, the woman burst into tears as she started blabbering incoherently. 

When we got to Command, we were greeted by a man Sarge seemed to know. He bellowed, “Saito. How are you? How are you bigger, you big bastard?”

Sarge cracked a smile and said, “Sergei, good to see you got off Terra.”

This Sergei, who, by his insignia, seemed to be a Sergeant too, spoke with a strong Russian accent and replied, “I was on the Def-Sat 7 on the Lagrange point when Holy Terra was hit.”

I looked at his face and saw it change but I was unable to recognise the emotion, he went on, “The rest of my unit didn’t get off world. I regrouped with whatever was left of Terran Command on Luna but yeah, the bugs got us good.”

Sarge asked, “How? How did this happen, Sergei? How did the Bugs get past the defence satellites?”

Sergei shook his head and muttered, “I don’t know. There’s an investigation on-going.”

The two Sergeants spoke in soft tones as we waited on in silence. The two Sergeants went on for a while discussing how things were. According to this Sergei, we were holding our own. The bugs seemed to be on the back foot for the moment. There had been reports from ‘friendly’ Xenos which seemed to indicate that the death of the Sarlok had sent the bug-Sarlok relationship into chaos. The bugs had apparently begged and pleaded saying that it wasn’t them but the Sarlok had refused to listen. 

When we left CIC, we were led to a room where fifty soldiers were being drilled in the use of flamers and rocket launchers, standard grunt equipment. 

When we showed up, the entire room stopped and, for a second, stared at us in awe, then as one, they knelt before us and exclaimed, “Angels!!”

We stood before them with our specialised equipment, powered armour and one of a kind weapons, augmentations and enhancements, the paragon of what a soldier could be.

Over the course of the following weeks, the diplomatic corps really went to town. At first, we thought that they were a waste of time. But as the conflict grew, the grunts and I realised the reason why these guys existed. Wherever they could, they put pressure on the bugs, a little word here, an under-handed insult there and the bugs were losing support through out the UoS. There were even some reports that the weakened bug position was allowing some of the more aggressive species to step in. This meant that the bugs couldn’t keep their momentum going. Our species were still at war and the bugs had whacked us good when they hit Holy Terra but they weren’t making as much progress when it came to holding territory.

Every inch of space was bought with the blood of our brothers and sisters who joined the fight. But still we were losing the war. We needed the manpower to keep the darkness at bay. 

In the meantime, we were stuck on Luna. It was becoming increasingly difficult to bear. We were weapons forged for war and now we were made to become beacons of hope for the people. We were brought out and made to do vids and feeds for the masses where we were shown killing bugs. That was strange. Command had made us go to a studio where they made us roll around fake-shooting non-existent bugs. We had to showcase a mission where we protected a group of civies against the bugs. It was the most surreal thing I ever did. I didn’t join up to roll around in an empty room faking shooting digital bugs. The Major in charge of media relations had said it would boost morale. He also said that every time the boys and I made an appearance among the civies it resulted in a boost in recruitment. So for the moment, we were stuck doing PR, rolling around in a studio. 

It all felt very silly but there was no denying the results. After a couple of days, a fat, balding, sweaty man showed us the rough draft. We watched impassively a vid of us doing impossible shit, wading through bugs as if they were nothing more than a paddling pool. I know it annoyed me a little to watch us destroying the bugs without getting hit. The bugs’ plasma seemed to avoid us wherever we were, they magically clumped together and stood around as we lobbed grenades. Our armour was always pristine, never a scratch, scuff, mark or even the slightest sign of dirt. Our weapons were shown in great detail, that annoyed me more than it should I guess. Hell, they even made us shoot the damn vid with our helmets off. “To allow the people to connect with us” is what the producer had said. 

The vid we were shown was so unrealistic that it became comical. I watched the others as the seven of us sat stoically. Well, Kitten had a small smirk on his face but I don’t think anyone other the boys noticed but it was definitely there. The room wasn’t full or anything but all the chairs were filled. There were twenty-six people there, from Command to press to official representatives. I noticed there were also a few priest-looking guys. The lights went off and we watched the vid we had been made to make. We watched as a 3D model of a battle appeared in front of us. I watched as our unit, “the Saintly Knights of Holy Terra” apparently, took on a veritable wall of bugs. There was no way any of us would have got out of that situation alive, far less unharmed. Through out the ten-minute clip, a male over-voice created a tale which presented us as invincible gods of war. “They hold the line against the dark, our Saintly Knights of Holy Terra. The Sons of Terra have taken up weapons against their Mother’s attackers. They are Angels who will lead the Armies of Mankind against those who would bring death to the Innocent, the children of Terra among the Stars.”

The video ended with a shot of the seven of us, with golden hallows around our heads, standing between a group of civies who were kneeling and a horde of Utkan who had managed to get hold off a baby.

After the ten-minute clip ended, the entire room stood and clapped for a solid ten minutes. There were shouts and yells, calls for vengeance and for the extermination of the Bugs.

After that, we were officially rebranded “the Saintly Order of Holy Terra” and each of us got a promotion to “Holy Knight of Terra.” Our word was now law. Common soldiers had to obey us. In fact, it created a real headache for Command as we were removed from chain of command. We could officially commandeer any unit, any equipment, anything we wanted was ours. At one point, there was a lengthy discussion about whether we should be split up and imbedded into different units on the front. The Civie Officials argued that our presence would bolster morale. We could be a uniting and motivating force for the normies. The Brass argued that splitting us up would lessen our efficiency. It went on for hours. 

The seven of us stood in silence and waited for them to decide our fate. I stole a few looks at the boys and could see the frustration that I felt. What was the point in arguing? What did it change if we were “unit TF-SF-EAF-135/A” or the “Holy Knights of Terra”? The Bugs didn’t care. It didn’t make us fight any better. So what was the point? I couldn’t see one. Apparently, the Brass and Civies did. They spent hours arguing on anything and everything. Was “Holy Knights of Terra” better than “First Sons of Holy Terra”? Would referring to a feudal system allow the people to unit ? Or would they rebel against the perceived loss of freedoms? Was mixing religious idolatry and military regulations a good idea?

I tuned out for a second. When I started listening again, the Officials were arguing over whether we should call the conflict “the First Interstellar Species War,” “The War of the Stars.” Someone had suggested “The Tenth Holy Crusade.” I guess the religious side had won out. 

This war had now turned into a holy crusade to purge the stars of the Utkan.

"StarCraft's Playable Characters, Units, and Buildings that didn't make it into the Miniset - Part 2: Zerg",hearthstone,1i79czu,2025-01-22 06:50:21,41,0.89,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1i79czu/starcrafts_playable_characters_units_and/,-PVL93-,Fluff,"Hi folks,

and welcome back! This is the second part for my brief overview of elements from the three main StarCraft races that had the unfortunate fate of being left out from the ever increasing Hearthstone card library, and today we'll be covering the natural predators of the universe - the Zerg Swarm. If you missed the first part which went over the Terrans - you can find it [right here](https://old.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1i45yd6/starcrafts_playable_characters_units_and/).

This post is going to be a little weird because in the Zerg don't really have as many named ""hero"" units that are also actual characters in the overarching story, and whenever they did appear - it was purely in the mission briefings/cutscenes, so the lore section will be somewhat disappointingly brief. Thankfully where Zerg may lack in notable people, they more than make up for it in the available arsenal across both StarCraft 1 and 2.

Also, please keep in mind that the Character section only takes into consideration named heroes that have playable units in the Campaign mode. Yes, there are more available via Co-op missions in SC2, but since the Miniset seem to draw inspiration primarily from canonical material, this post is only covering main storylines featured in 9 campaign episodes (6 in SC1, 3 in SC2), meaning intermission NPCs that you can interact with before setting out for combat are also omitted.

But anyway, on with the show

----------------------------------------------------------------

#Characters

- [**Samir Duran**](https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Samir_Duran) - An extremely opportunistic Terran, essentially playing for whatever side he currently sees as best exploitable to further his own secret, sometimes very malicious, goals. Wait, Terran? In a Zerg-centric thread? Yeaaaa, there's a LOT to unpack surrounding this guy, so let's briefly run down the events that led us to this specific point in the timeline
    - Player is sent to meet with the local Marshal Jim Raynor on a remote Terran Confederacy planet Mar Sara. Raynor discovers strange alien lifeform which turns out to be Zerg. Zerg start spreading around the planet, forcing Raynor's hand to act, including destroying an already infested Terran outpost. Because he acted out of order, Jim and the Player are punished and arrested by General Duke, effectively dooming them and the planetary colonies to be eventually overrun. Raynor puts up defenses against the growing Zerg forces, and when things seem most dire - a spliter Terran group named Sons of Korhal comes to aid and offers assistance. This is where Arcturus Mengsk is first introduced. Knowing there are no options left, Jim agrees and joins up SOK.
    - Throughout the rest of campaign, SOK slowly but surely grows in size and power, introduces the player to Sarah Kerrigan, and even convinces Gen. Duke to switch sides as he's assisted and rescued from an otherwise inevitable scenario after his spaceship crashlands right in the middle of Zerg colonies. Unknowingly to Raynor, Mengsk learned about a powerful decide called Psi Emitter which was designed to affect the minds of and even control the Zerg, which Arcturus used to his own advantage, slowly diminishing and destabilizing the Confederacy by framing them as incapable of protecting the human colonies under its control, culminating in the fall of its capital planet Tarsonis, serving as the finale of StarCraft's first story episode. This is also where Kerrigan is left behind all alone as thousands of Zerg slaughter and overrun the place (as it turns out, the emitter works on same wavelengths as that of Ghosts and their psychic abilities, thus making Sarah the perfect bait), while Jim swears vengeance on Mengsk and splits off Sons of Korhal permanently, eventually forming the Raiders which we also play as in StarCraft II's first campaign
    - So, with Confederacy left effectively in shambles, Mengsk sends a powerful message to the rest of humanity, and, using what just happened with the confederates, forms what becomes known as the Terrain Dominion, of which Arcturus becomes the self-appointed First Emperor, becoming not only a major antagonist to Jim Raynor but also one of the key villains in StarCraft universe. Did I mention this Mengsk guy is not a very good person? Cuz he's not. At All. Anyway, the central government of Terrans, called United Earth Directorate (or UED for short) doesn't like the idea of Dominion's formation much, and the two factions engage in war, where UED seemingly has the advantage militarily. The UED sends a fleet to a planet Braxis, and you, the Player, start the final story episode of StarCraft here, meeting a group called Confederate Resistance Forces (CRF), which Samir Duran is a commander of. Alright, back to Duran himself
- Duran is actually a VERY important character for the franchise as a whole, as his role doesn't simply stop with assissting the UED at first before betraying them, but he's also revealed to be a double agent for the Zerg, specifically serving under the new rule of.... *dundundun*.... Sarah Kerrigan, the Swarm's very own Queen of Blades herself. Not only that, but he's secretly been **conducting experiments to create a hybrid race of Zerg and Protoss** (yes you read that right, no I am not kidding), which eventually plays into one of the many plotlines featured in StarCraft II's campaigns. Suffice to say Samir is quite a character. And yes, it's very likely his last name is a direct reference to Duran Duran. In gameplay, he's represented by a Terran Ghost, equipped with standard Lockdown and Cloaking abilities, but after the plotwist he also gets Zerg-like capabilities of self-regeneration as well as consumption of other units to replenish his own energy. Unfortunately however he isn't playable in SC2 despite having a significant story presence. Trust me, there is a ton more lore to describe and talk about, but I'm already condensing stuff as much as I can and this post isn't meant to be a dive deep on the character.
- [**Alexei Stukov**](https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Alexei_Stukov) - the vice-admiral of a large expeditionary fleet of aforementioned UED, serving directly under the command of Admiral Gerard DuGalle, being not only his military advisor but also a close friend. Faithful and loyal to the cause of striking down Terran Dominion, though a bit of a fatalist and not without humor, also considered honorable by Raynor even though the two were nowhere near allies (maybe aside from sharing the common goal of going up against Mengsk). Gets assassinated by Duran later in the SC1 Episode 6's campaign after he and DuGalle were both manipulated and pitted against one another, with Stukov being framed as a traitor and DuGalle being framed as psychotic after the destruction of a device called Psi Disruptor, a facility designed to subdue and break the mental communication of the Zerg with its brood leaders - the Cerebrates and the Overmind, a giant ancient monstrosity that which controls ALL of the Zerg. By the way I highly advise to look up Stukov's message to DuGalle as he is dying, it's a surprisingly emotional moment, and is seemingly the conclusion to Alexei's story..... until Heart of the Swarm rolls around and he's not only resurrected but becomes infested and is made to serve under Kerrigan. Yeah, Zerg can revive people, so what? Also this means that Stukov is playable in both SC1 and SC2, with the former representing him as a simple Ghost unit while the latter gives him a unique model and two unique abilities - spawning a squad of infested Terrans or firing off a single target acidic projectile
- [**Niadra**](https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Niadra) - a Zerg Queen (not to be confused with Kerrigan's position within the race), created by Kerrigan herself. Much like many other characters one encounters throughout the Zerg campaigns, she's 100% loyal to her leader, and grows to have a strong conviction to carry out whatever mission the Queen of Blades assigns, in Niadra's case that being wiping out every last one of the Protoss. Starts out as a simple vulnerable Larva, so the gameplay presents her as a organism that must quickly consume to survive and become dangerous enough to stand on her own. Upon evolving, however, she gains an ability to immediately spawn brand new Zerg which serve as backup, and retains the ability to consume other creatures to evolve two more times, each form gaining higher stats and offensive/defensive capabilities. By herself however she's otherwise still somewhat vulnerable and likely to die if surrounded
- [**Dehaka**](https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Dehaka) - a powerful Pack Leader, though one of the last of its kind, originating from the home of Primal Zerg. Primals are an older species that kinda lived on its own, separately from the rest of the Swarm that engaged in various conflicts throughout the events of StarCraft 1, and went into an original evolutionary path thanks to which these Zerg can often look quite different to what we've seen prior to SC2's HOTS campaign. This happened because Zerg by their nature, despite being primitive, are still mostly independent lifeform, which is why an even *more* ancient race of Xel'Naga, who intended to utilize the Zerg for their own purposes, had to also spawn ""central command"", which is how the Overmind (and later its Cerebrates as well as Brood Queens) came to be. Dehaka wasn't expecting the Swarm to reach his homeworld and thus at first only watched Kerrigan's actions from a distance, but once he recognized her strength, decided to join up to ensure the survival of the Primals, and this mentality pretty much summarises his character, strongly believing in stregth and strength alone. In the gameplay, he's also given a completely unique model and appears quite massive, which also translates to his ingame abilities of vertical map traversal, instantly pulling enemy or friendly grounded units to himself, as well as temporarily create smaller versions of himself, and provide healing support
- [**Zagara**](https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Zagara) - the very first Broodmother of the Zerg. Broodmothers are something of a next evolutionary step to Queens (the SC2 ones, not the SC1 ones, also not to be confused with Swarm Queens) and functionally speaking serve the same role as Cerebrates, who were now all destroyed. The Cebebrates used to be agents of the Overmind, a creature that I mentioned earlier, but as the Overmind itself ceased to be as a result of events that unfolded in SC1 campaigns, so did the need for Cerebrates, however since despite taking leadership role of the Swarm Kerrigan still couldn't quite keep an eye on and control countless zerg that spread all across the universe, the Queen of Blades brought forth the idea of creating Broodmothers, and Zagara had the honor of eventually becoming Kerrigan's right hand...uh...woman? Anyway, she's pretty much stayed by Sarah's side and at the end of StarCraft II's story is put into the position of an Overqueen - basically a self-proclaimed title though still granted by her superior - meaning Zagara went on quite a ""career"" from just a normal Queen to the grand leader of Zerg Swarm. Gameplay-wise she only gets a unique unit portrait and quotes, but is otherwise just a standard Swarm Queen model with same exact capabilities and slightly boosted stats, much like many other Hero class units

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Ground Units

- [**Drone**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft/Drone) - one of the key units in the Zerg arsenal. Not only are these critters responsible for gathering Minerals and Vespene Gas (the two main resource types in StarCraft), but they also represent the unique way this race creates and expands its bases - rather than having a worker unit (SCV for Terran, Probe for Protoss) create each building separately, Drones mutate (or rather Evolve) into them, which creates the gameplay loop of make Hatchery (main hub structure) -> wait for Larvae (lowest evolutionary step) to spawn -> create Drones -> make Buildings -> rinse and repeat
- [**Swarm Queen**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/Swarm_Queen_(Heart_of_the_Swarm_Campaign) - not to be confused with the Queen, a flying unit, or Queen of Blades, Kerrigan's title. The first of Campaign-exclusive units seen in StarCraft II's Heart of the Swarm (or HOTS for short) campaign. Unlike the hero Niadra, normal playable Swarm Queens cannot create brand new Zerg units or evolve through multiple forms, but they can help you expand the bases by spawning Creep Tumors (Creep is basically the infested ground that Zerg build stuff on) - which by the way is represented in HS via the (formerly) called Brood Queen card - plus they're versatile in offense due to being able to attack both ground and targets, and defense since they passively heal other units and even buildings, in addition to the race's native capability of HP regeneration over time
- [**Ravager**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/Ravager) - a brand new addition to the Zerg that arrived with the release of SC2's third campaign, Legacy of the Void (or LOTV for short), and can be evolved into from any Roach nce you build an associated structure. Post-morph, loses its armored defense and a bit of movevement speed but in exchange grows much larger in size, expands its attack range, and becomes a death sentence to any enemy unit or structure equipped with shields thanks to its unique Corrosive Bile ability, meaning it is quite strong against most of the Protoss army. Extremely useful in breaking through defensive walls made of Photon Cannons
- [**Aberration**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/Aberration_(Heart_of_the_Swarm_Campaign) - another Campaign-exclusive, becoming playable in the HOTS campaign. Horrifying four-legged monstrocities designed to soak enemy fire thanks to big health pool and higher than usual armor, though some of it must be sacrificed to get into close range. Also can traverse the battlefield easier since it's taller than most obstacles and units, or sometimes even buildings. Unfortunately might become useful closer to story finale as there are no significant upgrades or mutation paths to speak of
- [**Impaler**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/Impaler_(Heart_of_the_Swarm_Campaign) - last of the Campaign-exclusives for this race, first introduced in SC2. This is one of the two possible evolutions for Hydralisks, the other being Lurker (both Hydra and Lurker are represented in the Miniset), and requires the player to make a permanent choice for the rest of the playthrough. Unlike Lurkers, Impalers only attack one enemy target at a time, but each hit becomes much more powerful and is especially effective against armored units, making Impalers a potential chokepoint and an ambush point for enemy assault forces consisting of units such as Terran Siege Tanks and Thors, provided they're not backed up by Detectors as Lurkers and Impalers can only attack when they're Burrowed underground - an ability shared by majority of grounded Zerg units, which hides them from enemy view and fire, as well as accelerates the passive HP regen
- [**Defiler**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft/Defiler) - a utility unit that was unfortunately left behind in SC1. Cannot attack by itself, and instead exists to provide support to the rest of the forces via two main abilities: one is the Dark Swarm, a semi-transparent cloud that prevents damage from any and all ranged units, forcing the enemy to reposition and move in with the melee units, if any are available, which also means this is an impeccable tool against Terrans and most of Protoss arsenals. The second ability is Plague, a wide-range AOE burst that leaves every unit with a DOT which keeps going until the unit is either cured (eg Terran Medic's Restoration ability) or it's left with just 1HP left, forcing the enemy to retreat or endure higher losses
- [**Swarm Host**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/Swarm_Host_(Legacy_of_the_Void) - another unit making its debut in SC2. A decently fast grounded carrier designed to send out smaller Locusts, meant to harass enemy's builder units. Because of the range that the locusts can cover and their life duration, Swarm Hosts can remain at a relatively safe distance beyond the vision range of opposing armies or even go for a hit-n-run tactic if you already have access to the Nydus Worm network, even if deployment of additional locusts takes just under a minute. Alas, much like most of the other units in Zerg's SC2 arsenal, these guys don't have any notable upgrades to speak of aside from the universal ones which can be obtained either during the campaign or in the Evolution Chamber during standard multiplayer matches
- [**Infested Terran**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft/Infested_Terran) - so remember how earlier in the post I mentioned Raynor and his boys got put under arrest for wrecking a completely infested Terran base? Yeah, that's because the Zerg have an in-gameplay ability to infest enemy Command Centers in SC1 when left at low enough remaining HP. This process mutates the CC and put it under your control, giving you the function of producing infantry units that look like slightly corrupted Terran Firebats, except instead of spewing fire from their flamethrowers - they run towards their targets and explode alongside, dealing a ton of direct and splash damage. Because of the vastly boosted movement speed (imagine Marines/Firebats but with permanent Stimpack buff), the Infested Terrans can become quite an annoyance to deal with, especially in certain single-player missions and definitely custom multiplayer maps. In SC2 however they got completely overhauled both visually and functionally, and are instead spawned by Infestors - another brand new unit (also represented in the Miniset!) - while also gaining the ability for ranged attacks via the standard Terran Marine Gauss rifles or small corrosive rockets, though now they're slightly more vulnerable if your Infestors are caught by the enemy and the eggs which spawn the Infesteds remain unprotected (or receive damage just before the evolution is complete)

#Air Units

- [**Overlord**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft/Overlord) - A multipurpose Zerg flyer originating from SC1, arguably just as important as Drones or even early game Zerglings. Continuing with the uniqueness of this race, Overlords  not only can carry ground units similar to Terran dropships (or Protoss Shuttles but we'll get there in Part 3), but they also serve as mobile burrowed/invisible unit detectors *and* increase your max army supply limit, which sometimes may put you into a situation of having to choose between quickly moving grounded forces around the map (until you get access to the Nydus anyway) and preserving the building capability as you can only get new Overlods from the Larva, which are already preoccupied with mutations into other units, builders or attackers. Worth noting that although in lore these creatures are used by Zerg for interplanetary travel, in the gameplay it's actually an optional researchable upgrade in SC1 while in SC2 they just have this by default. Also they can vastly increase their movement speed via another upgrade, and SC2 gives Overlords an ability to spread Creep, creating new space for base building. And on the topic of SC2...
- [**Overseer**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/Overseer_(Legacy_of_the_Void) - a brand new Zerg unit which Overlords can evolve/morph/mutate into, first introduced in WOL. This evolution completely changes the Overlord's functionality, and gains an ability to Detect burrowed/invisible units (which was standard in SC1) as well as spawn Changelings - small short-lived insectoids that can mimic enemy's basic ground unit - at the cost of losing the ability to transport other grounded units inside. Another cool ability Overseers have access to is effectively disabling enemy buildings for ~20 seconds by Contaminating them, so after evolving, these flyers start moving across the map much more than they would otherwise since they still contribute to your army's supply limit. Very cool risk/reward element
- [**Queen**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft/Queen) - again, not to be confused with the Swarm Queen or Queen of Blades. A fast flying Zerg originating from SC1, and in a way they are like an air version of Defilers. Queens cannot attack, but they do provide some utility to potentially create a minor nuiscance for the opponent: they can learn Ensnare whoch significantly slows down any unit hit by the AoE's range, they can plant a Parasite into an enemy unit which creates a mobile map scanner, potentially revealing their base, they can kill a selected grounded unit to spawn tiny Broodlings to attack and harass enemy infantry or workers, and lastly, as I mentioned before, they can infect Terran Command centers at low enough HP which lets you capture that building and start producing Infested Terrans. That's just the SC1 version however. For SC2, the unit got completely revamped, and while retaining the name - SC2 Queens are now grounded rather than flying, they gain attacking capability against both other ground and air targets, *and* on top of all that create additional Larvae, create more Creep, or heal nearby allied units and buildings. Also this is the version depicted in a Hearthstone Miniset card. Quite a drastic change between the two games though!
- [**Guardian**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft/Guardian) - Zerg flyer exclusive to SC1. This unit is accessed by mutating existing Mutalisks (a creature that does have a Miniset representation), and as a result changes the unit's purpose. Whereas Mutas rapidly move across the map and annoy the hell out of the enemy, Guardians traverse much slower and can only attack ground units, but in exchange nearly triple the attack range, which is deadly to unprotected structures, sometimes even antiair ones, or units that can't go invisible/burrow/receive support from other units. Make just a few of these and watch as opponent bases get decimated if not reacted to swiftly
- [**Devourer**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft/Devourer) - also an SC1 exclusive, and a second possible mutation for Mutalisks. Just like Guardians, Devourers trade an ability to attack a unit type - in this case grounded ones - to become slightly more potent against the other. These guys still actually more rather fast, and their gimmick is planting Spores into enemy units with each attack dealt - the main purpose of this mechanic is adding a passive bonus to all other Zerg attacks (+1 per Spore up to +9 max), and prevention of enemy flyers, such as Terran Wraiths, from going invisible even after engaging Cloak. Unfortunately this isn't seen as very strong in the esports environment, and there's not a ton of examples of Devourers being brought to battle, so at best you'll utilize these guys in the campaign or casual PVP matches or custom maps, provided they're even accessible in the first place
- [**Brood Lord**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/Brood_Lord_(Legacy_of_the_Void) - the last brand new Zerg arsenal addition we'll talk about today. In essence, these guys replaced Guardians, though accessing them still requires mutating existing units - in SC2's case it's the Corruptors, a creature that now has become playable via the Miniset - so you probably can guess, Brood Lords are designed as anti-ground force. One could argue they're among the most interestingly designed Zerg units around, as although they do attack, they do so by launching Broodlings (who make their SC2 comeback after previously being only attached to Queens in SC1) at the enemy units or structures, which are generated at the speed equal to that of Brood Lords themselves, meaning that to utilize this unit to its max potential, you need to first invest into both air upgrades and ground upgrades, as the former improve the Brood Lord stats and survivability while the later make Broodlings more deadly
- [**Scourge**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft/Scourge) - aka the Zerg Kamikaze Drones. These little bastards fly fast, are much smaller in size than even Protoss Interceptors making them harder to target, and no matter how good your micro is they WILL kill off at least one of your flyers. Extremely straight to the point usage-wise, nightmare to deal with if you're on the receiving end. Thankfully they've never returned for SC2 and remain exclusive to SC1, but you best make sure whenever even a single Scourge pops up, it's not to be a pleasant encounter, no matter if we're talking single- or multiplayer
- [**Leviathan**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/Leviathan) - technically speaking, this is a Hero-class unit and should thus be mentioned higher above in the Characters section, plus you can't even *produce* the thing, but just because of how insane Levi is - probably a good idea to still list it. So, the Leviathan is a MASSIVE, and I truly mean **MASSIVE** Zerg flyer, you could sorta think of it as StarCraft's version of an Imperial Star Destroyer, for all you Star Wars fans out there. These things are used by the Zerg when mass interstellar travel is required, such as when the Swarm decides upon consuming and terrorising a planet, in addition to Overlords, which by the way are vastly vastly smaller in size despite serving a similar role. And worst of all, the unaware denizens could be facing *several* of Levi's when the doomsday comes, so you can imagine the terror the Protoss felt when the Zerg conducted a full on invasion of Aiur, their homeworld, and the hordes that were unleashed upon the planet's surface. Also according to Terran databases, a single Leviathan is even bigger than a Protoss Mothership, and that thing is already colossal in scale in its own right, so yeah, not a pleasant encounter if you happen to come across even just one. For the gameplay purposes, similarily to the Terran Battlecruisers and the Protoss Motherships, the Leviathan is significantly reduced in size so it can be put into campaign missions, but make no mistake - it's still just as dangerous, and whether summoned or seen as an NPC boss, this creature can defend itself by attacking both grounded and air targets, plus it packs a ton of HP (1000 for playable, 2000 for non-playable), *and* the boss version is capable of detecting invisible/burrowed units, spawn reinforcements of Mutalisks and Brood Lords, as well as launch the Scourges (yes the very same ones) at you, so bringing one down, especially on higher difficulties, is not an easy task at all

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Buildings

- [**Hatchery**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft/Hatchery) - the starting bullding for Zerg. Unlike Terrans and Protoss, who require dedicated buildings for producing certain units, this race instead uses Hatcheries that spawn Larvae who then mutate into other units, be it workers (Drones) or attackers (Lings, Hydras, etc), meaning that even if the rest of your base remains intact - as soon as you lose the Hatchery with no backup Drones or at least an active Larva, your entire economy grinds to a hault, so it is of utmost importance to protect the ""hub"" at all costs. Besides generating Larvae for unit production, the Hatcheries can also be further upgraded into a Lair and then a Hive, increasing total HP by 500 with each evolution, as well as research several vital upgrades: Burrowing for all grounded units as well carrying and faster movement for Overlords, on top of unlocking more of the Tech Tree. The SC2 iteration of this doesn't really change things much except for the Overlord upgrades now becoming on a per-unit basis, but due to unit group size increase from 12 in SC1 to unlimited in SC2, the Larvae production has also been increased from 3 per Hatchery to 20
- [**Creep Colony**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft/Creep_Colony) - one of the most basic structures available to Zerg in SC1. By themselves, these colonies don't really do much except slightly expand the available Creep (which as mentioned before is the infested ground required for Drones to mutate into other structures), however you have the option of morph into either a Sunken Colony or Spore Colony - which serve the defensive line role by automatically attacking grounded (Sunken) or flying (Spore) targets, plus the latter also acts as a static Detector, so ideally you'd want to have a more or less equal spead of both. Also fun fact: one of the more popular SC1 custom tower defence maps is based around creating unique lines with Sunken colonies by funneling repeatedly spawning enemy waves and surviving the longest together with other players
- [**Spore Crawler**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/Spore_Crawler_(Legacy_of_the_Void) - an evolution of the Spine Colony concept introduced with SC2. Although functionally speaking the structure remained the same, it's important to point out that now you don't need to first build a basic colony and morph it into something else. Also unlike before, both the Spore and the Spine versions can Uproot themselves, giving your defensive lines some more mobility and flexibility, provided the new location has Creep to deploy onto, but that's easier to accomplish in SC2 than SC1. Also, the anti-ground version of the Crawler actually is represented in the Miniset but not the anti-air one, funnily enough
- [**Extractor**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft/Extractor) - just a standard facility for mining Vespene Gas from. Just like I mentioned in the Terran thread, the only difference between the T/Z/P versions of this is purely visual. Otherwise nothing really special to talk about except for generating some additional Creep around, which is a function that all Zerg buildings carry
- [**Roach Warren**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/Roach_Warren_(Legacy_of_the_Void) - a primarily function-based structure required to unlock and produce Roaches, a brand new SC2 Zerg unit represented in the Miniset. Also brings forth the ability to upgrade Roaches with slightly faster movement speed, as well as a unique capability of remaining mobile while burrowed underground, and best part is you don't need to have Creep around them to access this feature. Roaches of course aren't Lurkers or Impalers and thus cannot attack while underground, but it is nonetheless useful to fool the enemy if a stationary group of your units is discovered, by the time a task force group is moved in to clean it up - the Roaches are already gone. Do keep in mind that they can still be discovered via mobile Detectors such as other Overseers in a ZvZ matchup
- [**Baneling Nest**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/Baneling_Nest_(Legacy_of_the_Void) - a minor building that lets the player produce (or rather mutate into) Banelings, another fresh Zerg arsenal addition in SC2. While the Banelings themselves can be accessed by creating tokens from the Baneling Barrage card in the Miniset, their place of oririn cannot, albeit not surprising since the only upgrade that can be researched here is a slight boost to the movement speed, nothing else of interest to speak of
- [**Hydralisk Den**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft/Hydralisk_Den) - a very important structure unlocking arguably one of the most iconic StarCraft units in existence - the Hydralisks, another grounded Zerg creature represented in the miniset. This building is available in both SC1 and SC2, and while both versions carry the standard upgrades for higher attack range and faster movement speed, there is one major difference between each iteration: in SC1, this is where you also unlock the ability to evolve your Hydras into Lurkers, but in SC2 that functionality was instead moved over to the Lurker Den, which I'll describe below, and replacing that upgrade is an unlock for Hydralisks to Lunge forward, giving them a temporary movement speed boost on top of the standard permanent researchable upgrade, which is extremely important due to the versatility Hydras provide thanks to being able to attack both ground and air targets
- [**Lurker Den**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/Lurker_Den_(Legacy_of_the_Void) - initially this was a brand new standalone Zerg structure back in vanilla version of SC2, but for whatever reason Blizzard ultimately decided to instead have players evolve the Hydra Dens, effectively creating one additional step to unlock Lurkers in the tech tree. For the release of SC2's third and final expansion, LOTV, the developers have actually reversed this decision and made Lurker Dens back into a separate building, carrying with itself two dedicated upgrades: faster burrow/unborrow, cutting the required time in half, and slightly boosting the range from which Lurkers can engage enemy ground targets
- [**Infestation Pit**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/Infestation_Pit_(Legacy_of_the_Void) - also a brand new Zerg structure intoduced with SC2. This is an important step on the tech tree as it unlocks the Hive upgrade for all your Lairs, production of Swarm Hosts, which I described earlier in the ground unit section, and the production of Infestors - another Zerg arsenal addition that's playable in Hearthstone via the Miniset. Beyond that, the Pit unlocks an ability upgrade for Infestors that lets them temporarily take control of any selected enemy unit, provided both stay close enough to each other, and, until a more recent patch, Infestors had a secondary ability upgrade with the Microbial Shroud - effectively a new iteration of Defiler's Dark Swarm, except this time the Shroud only reduces the received damage rather than preventing it entirely. Nowadays however Infestors have it from the get go with no upgrades necessary 
- [**Spire**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft/Spire) - a building that actually appears in both SC1 and SC2. Besides unlocking the flyer-related units and stat upgrades, which of course is important in its own right, there's not much else to discuss here, although the Spire is one of the only few examples of a structure that can further evolve into an advanced state called Greater Spire. The SC1 iteration of this grants access to producing Mutalisks, Guardians and Devourers, while the SC2 iteration allows production of Mutalisks, Corruptors, and the Brood Lords
- [**Queen's Nest**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft/Queen%27s_Nest) - last of the middle tier Structures before you move onto the last Advanced step, and an SC1 exclusive. As the name would suggest, this building allows you to start producing Zerg Queens (not to be confused with the Swarm Queens!), but you still want to have one on your base even if there's no intent to make a single Queen just so you gain access to the Hive upgrade for your Lairs and approach the finale of tech tree with units like the Ultralisk and Defiler. Also this is where Queens get their two vital upgrades: Ensnare to slow enemy units down, and Spawn to create broodlings out of ground targets. Note that the Queens already come with the ability to infect Terran Command Centers or plant Parasites by default
- [**Defiler Mound**](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft/Defiler_Mound) - last of the SC1 exclusive structures. Though as the name suggests it lets you access Defilers, you're really not required or obligated to build this as it doesn't unlock any other units, structures, or non-Defller related upgrades, so if for whatever the reason you decide against having Defliers in your Zerg Armies - you may as well pretend the Ultralisk Cavern is the last step of the tech tree (rest assured this will not happen in competitive matches however). Two Defiler abilities are researched here - Consume, which as mentioned before lets to straight up absorb other Zerg units to restore energy, and Plague, an AOE DOT debuff for anything caught in the blast range, including buildings

----------------------------------------------------------------

Phew. 

Alright, that should cover everything Zerg-related and we're done with Part 2.

There's just one more thread left where I'll be covering the last of the playable StarCraft races, the mighty ancient and highly technologically advanced society of Protoss, so look forward to that in a few days. 

As for now, I hope you're already enjoying playing with a fresh new set of cards dropped yesterday, and see y'all next time in Part 3!"

Mobile Ryzen APU - Performance issues during gaming,AMDHelp,1i73n8l,2025-01-22 00:06:02,3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1i73n8l/mobile_ryzen_apu_performance_issues_during_gaming/,Iregretmychoicesss,Help (General) ,"Hello, I recently bought a Acer Aspire A315-44P with following specs:

Ryzen 5 5500U
RAM: Kingston 16 GB DDR4 (single channel, probably soldered) at 3200mhz
480 GB M.2 SSD 
Vega 7 iGPU: 7835 MB Shared memory and 512mb vram

The Laptop is fast, but while doing some gaming I noticed some of the games didn't run as I expected them to.

I tested these games and got these results:

The Long Dark

1080p all settings set to lowest: 18-21 fps average 720p all settings set to lowest: 60-92 fps average

CS2
1080p Lowest settings, Fidelity FX super resolution off: 30-45 fps (unplayable stuttering)

Rocket League

1080p lowest, render quallity - High quality 
27-34 fps (similar results to everything set to max)

Nier:Automata
1080p lowest settings - 22-27 fps average
720p lowest settings - 30-35 fps average 

Dragon Ball Figher Z 
1080p Ultra - 45 fps
1080p High -60fps

Subnautica 
1080p low preset - 21 to 24 fps above water, 31 - 36 fps underwater 

Minecraft 
1.20.4 optimized with optifine on 12 render distance 1080p 60-80 fps

Most games automatically recommended medium or high settings while not being able to achieve stable 30 fps, in most games gpu usage was maxing out or almost maxing out, while the cpu was anywhere from 10-20% usage. I figured it's bottlenecked by the igpu but I didn't think it would be this much.

I tried using AATU with the preset for my APU with No changes to the fps or tdp, I tried changing the power plan but it only gives me ""balanced"" and I tried putting the slider on the battery to max performance or balanced and yet nothing changed. Tdp usually always sits around 18w except in Minecraft where it occasionally spiked to 30w. Temps were around 70°, and it wasn't really overheating.

Now I am confused if I even can upgrade the Ram or if that's even the issue, or if maybe I set up unrealistic standards because of all the benchmark videos I have seen where people basically played the same games but at a quite bit more playable fps (30-40, some even 60)

Btw I also tried changing tdp and vram size in bios but it doesn't seem to let me... i figured it's fine because as far as I know it shouldn't affect fps that much, since the igpu can take ram from the ""shared"" pool when needed.

Any ideas to what should I do? I don't plan on returning it since I got it cheap (300 eur) and I need it for my studies and general use. Until this happened  I thought I knew something about tech but now I seem like a lost puppy rn xD

https://preview.redd.it/lnkfuruhrgee1.png?width=1658&format=png&auto=webp&s=3da08b270499768c52c45ecac3afd9a7ed4d398d

**DISCLAIMER:** *This article represents my personal understanding and interpretation of the podcast and is in no way an official announcement or information approved by SSV Labs.*

In 2020, when the Ethereum Beacon Chain first launched, validators had a straightforward task: secure the network by staking ETH. But almost immediately, new opportunities began to emerge such as MEV (Maximal Extractable Value), which introduced an auction-like process for ordering transactions. Fast-forward a couple of years, and additional concepts like restaking appeared, along with validator commitments, pre-confirmations, and base sequencing. All of these represent fresh ways validators can earn rewards beyond securing Ethereum.

# Validators as a New Asset Class

This trendline suggests that validators are doing more and more, thus generating more and more rewards. Alon Muroch, CEO and co-founder of SSV Labs, notes that validators themselves are becoming a new type of asset class, offering both valuable services and the potential for sizable returns. Recognizing this, SSV Labs has been thinking about how to leverage its unique network of validators, particularly since most other platforms focus on the capital behind the validators rather than treating the validators themselves as a network.

# Moving Beyond Simple Staking

Observing the growing set of services validators can offer, SSV Labs is now looking to evolve from a pure staking service into something it calls “**base** applications/protocols.” This idea builds on concepts like **base** sequencing and **base** pre-confirmation. In simple terms, a base application is any protocol or service that uses Ethereum’s validator set as the operational backbone.

* **Example:** MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) is a clear-cut illustration of a base application because it depends on validators at the L1 layer to function. However, the same principle could apply to oracles, bridges or any service needing secure, distributed and reputable nodes.

**Ethereum validators are uniquely suited to provide these services because:**

1. They’re part of Ethereum’s broader validator set, which distributes risk and reduces the likelihood of any significant portion being malicious.
2. They have on-chain reputations, meaning anyone can check how a validator has performed since the Beacon Chain’s genesis.
3. They inherit Ethereum’s security assumptions, making them ideal for high-stakes tasks like bridging assets between chains or verifying external data through oracles.

# SSV Labs’ Approach and the Future of Restaking

SSV Labs aims to become that “base application/protocol” layer, enabling anyone to bootstrap new services on Ethereum’s validator set. This approach intersects with the concept of restaking but also offers a potentially cheaper, more reliable and more scalable alternative.

* **Distributed Validator Technology (DVT):** Initially, SSV Labs focused on using DVT to make staking infrastructure more robust, decentralized and fault-tolerant. Over time, though, the economics of staking have become just as crucial. As more ETH is staked on Ethereum, the APR naturally decreases, prompting innovators to explore new ways for validators to generate additional revenue.
* **Combining Technology and Economics:** SSV Labs now seeks to pair DVT with an economic layer, a marketplace that rewards validators for participating in these emerging base applications. By making it financially attractive, the hope is to draw in more solo stakers and small operators, which in turn strengthens the network’s decentralization.

# Boosting Rewards for Solo and Small-Scale Validators

One of SSV Labs’ primary goals is to create economic incentives that encourage smaller operators to stay active. While earning a 3% APR might be acceptable to some, it isn’t always enough motivation to become or remain a validator, especially for solo stakers.

* **Marketplace of Incentives:** If validators can opt into multiple base applications on top of staking, they could potentially increase their returns from 3% to something closer to 30%. This significant difference transforms validator participation from a small hobby or a goodwill gesture into a meaningful revenue source.
* **Collaborating with Platforms Like Lido, Rocket Pool and Ether.Fi:** These platforms already allow stakers to bond a fraction of the total ETH needed and run validators. **Imagine having 2 ETH bonded with Lido, running an ETH validator and with that using SSV’s network to tap into additional base services for extra rewards. In this scenario, a staker who previously earned around 3% now sees potentially tenfold returns.**

This jump in profitability creates a pathway for passionate operators who might have 10, 20 or 100 ETH to launch multiple validators, essentially turning a modest stake into a small business. In addition to the personal financial benefits, having more solo and small-time operators further decentralizes Ethereum.

# The Road Ahead

While SSV Labs’ core mission remains the same, bolstering Ethereum’s security and decentralization via DVT, the market has evolved. Today, technology alone is not enough, economic incentives must also be in place to draw a diverse validator community. By introducing a marketplace layer and enabling base applications, SSV Labs hopes to encourage more people to stake, run validators and ultimately secure Ethereum.

As Muroch explained, it’s no longer just about building better protocols. It’s about offering compelling economic opportunities that tie directly into Ethereum’s validator network. By bringing both the infrastructure and the financial incentives together under one roof, SSV Labs is aiming to reshape how validators operate, now and in the future."

# Netflix is raising prices after reporting its biggest-ever subscriber jump

Netflix wrapped up 2024 in blockbuster fashion, adding a record 19 million subscribers in Q4. That’s double what Wall Street expected and brings its global tally to over 300 million—an all-time high.

**Why the Surge?**

Two words: *Squid Game*. The second season of Netflix’s mega-hit drove viewership through the roof. But the real game-changer? Live sports. A Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson boxing match scored 108 million global viewers, while Christmas Day NFL games (yes, with a Beyoncé halftime show) reeled in 30 million more. Turns out, live events aren’t just for cable anymore.

Netflix’s pivot to live programming isn’t just about engagement—it’s also a power play to boost its fledgling ad business. With over 55% of new sign-ups opting for the ad-supported tier last quarter, the company seems to be warming up its advertisers for a big 2025.

**Brace for Price Hikes**

To keep the momentum going, Netflix is bumping prices. The standard plan now costs $17.99/month (up $2.50), while the ad-supported plan climbs to $7.99. Sure, it’s a hit to wallets, but Netflix says it’ll reinvest the extra cash into more of what you love—think *Stranger Things*, *Wednesday*, and big-budget films like *Knives Out 3*.

Revenue for Q4 hit $10.25 billion, up 16% year-over-year, while profits soared 52% to $1.87 billion. Shares jumped 13% after hours as investors celebrated the strong finish. Oh, and this was Netflix’s final quarterly subscriber report—it’ll now update us on viewer engagement twice a year.

**What’s Next?**

With a 2025 lineup packed with heavy hitters and more live events in the works, Netflix is doubling down on what works. Add in its expanding ad business and price hikes, and the streaming giant looks ready to flex its dominance for another year.

# Trump to Announce New AI Investment Push With OpenAI, Softbank, Oracle

President Trump is wasting no time making waves in his second term. Teaming up with OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle, Trump announced a colossal joint venture—Stargate—aimed at building the U.S.’s AI infrastructure. The initial $100 billion commitment could balloon to $500 billion over the next four years.

**Stargate’s Ambitious Blueprint**

The first project? A massive data center in Texas, already breaking ground. Oracle is doubling its data center investments this fiscal year, while SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son and OpenAI’s Sam Altman are betting big on America’s AI dominance. Altman, who has long advocated for AI infrastructure as a national priority, called this venture “a golden opportunity.”

With China making rapid AI advancements, this is about more than innovation—it’s about maintaining global leadership. Trump has emphasized energy independence to power these data centers, linking AI to his broader pro-growth agenda. For Oracle and SoftBank, the move also signals a strategic pivot to capitalize on the exploding demand for AI resources.

**A History of High Hopes**

This isn’t the first mega-deal Trump has backed. Past ventures like SoftBank’s 2016 investment pledge and Foxconn’s Wisconsin facility had mixed results. Critics warn Stargate could follow suit, but industry insiders remain optimistic given the players involved and the rising urgency for AI infrastructure.

**The Bottom Line:** Trump’s AI push is a bold gambit at a pivotal time for tech. With Oracle, SoftBank, and OpenAI pooling resources, the U.S. is betting big on its future as a global AI leader. For now, Texas is ground zero for what could be the start of an AI revolution—or another case of overpromised returns.

# Netflix is raising prices after reporting its biggest-ever subscriber jump

Netflix wrapped up 2024 in blockbuster fashion, adding a record 19 million subscribers in Q4. That’s double what Wall Street expected and brings its global tally to over 300 million—an all-time high.

**Why the Surge?**

Two words: *Squid Game*. The second season of Netflix’s mega-hit drove viewership through the roof. But the real game-changer? Live sports. A Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson boxing match scored 108 million global viewers, while Christmas Day NFL games (yes, with a Beyoncé halftime show) reeled in 30 million more. Turns out, live events aren’t just for cable anymore.

Netflix’s pivot to live programming isn’t just about engagement—it’s also a power play to boost its fledgling ad business. With over 55% of new sign-ups opting for the ad-supported tier last quarter, the company seems to be warming up its advertisers for a big 2025.

**Brace for Price Hikes**

To keep the momentum going, Netflix is bumping prices. The standard plan now costs $17.99/month (up $2.50), while the ad-supported plan climbs to $7.99. Sure, it’s a hit to wallets, but Netflix says it’ll reinvest the extra cash into more of what you love—think *Stranger Things*, *Wednesday*, and big-budget films like *Knives Out 3*.

Revenue for Q4 hit $10.25 billion, up 16% year-over-year, while profits soared 52% to $1.87 billion. Shares jumped 13% after hours as investors celebrated the strong finish. Oh, and this was Netflix’s final quarterly subscriber report—it’ll now update us on viewer engagement twice a year.

**What’s Next?**

With a 2025 lineup packed with heavy hitters and more live events in the works, Netflix is doubling down on what works. Add in its expanding ad business and price hikes, and the streaming giant looks ready to flex its dominance for another year.

We strive to foster civil discussion about the game. We are first and foremost a network of real people, and this network is being built by volunteers! If you simply want to complain or bring something to Niantic's attention, your post would be better suited elsewhere.

**Research**

The community culture here also attracts the more analytically-minded element of Pokemon GO. Consequently, the Silph Research group was formed to align this brainpower and leverage the massive Silph datasets that the community can gather. We post our findings in infographics, videos, and walls of text on Reddit. Check out the top bar for [links to the current pools](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/13fwpg8/current_raid_quest_rocket_egg_pools/).

**Final words**

Finally, welcome once more! We're glad to have you join us on the Road :)

Marvel Rivals: Top Heroes & Rank Insights,marvelrivals,1i653st,2025-01-20 18:56:57,10,0.92,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1i653st/marvel_rivals_top_heroes_rank_insights/,Beneficial-Courage75,Discussion,"Hey Rivals!

Ever wondered how you stack up against the rest of the player base? Or which heroes are absolute powerhouses across all ranks? Well, buckle up motha-flarkas, because I've been crunching the numbers and the data is wild! I've compiled a bunch of data on the ranks and hero statistics from Season 1 and it has a ton of interesting information, so let's get into it.

**The Ranking Breakdown: Where Do You Fit?**

First off, let's talk about those sweet, sweet ranks. Here’s a quick look at the player distribution:

* **Bronze (Bottom 43.62%):** Yep, nearly half the player base starts here! Don't feel bad though, we all gotta start somewhere. If you're climbing out of Bronze, you're beating almost half the community!
* **Silver (Top 56.38% - 30.58%):** This is where the grind truly begins. This and Gold account for 46% of all players combined. Prepare for some close matches!
* **Gold (Top 30.58% - 9.88%):** You're in the top 30% now! You've reached the elite section of the community! It's still early in the first season though!
* **Platinum (Top 9.88% - 1.08%):** You're in the Top 10% globally! You're officially an elite player, pat yourself on the back! It's wild that Platinum are the start to the top players in the game.
* **Diamond (Top 1.08% - 0.20%):** Less than 1% make it here. You're a legend if you're in Diamond.
* **Grandmaster (Top 0.20% - 0.01%):** Fewer than 2,000 players have reached this level. You are truly an amazing player.
* **Celestial/Eternity (Top 0.01%):** Only 95 or fewer players worldwide! You're basically a god of Marvel Rivals.

**Hero Stats: Who's Ruling the Meta?**

Now for the fun part - the heroes! I've got the data from every rank, and things get, well, interesting. Here are some of the meta picks for each of the ranks.

* **Overall Meta:** Across all ranks, **Cloak & Dagger** and **Doctor Strange** are extremely popular with consistently high pick rates, showing they are a great general pick. **Storm** also has a very high win rate overall at 56.36%, but her ban rate and pick rates fluctuate a lot. On the other end of the spectrum, **Black Widow** is consistently underperforming, having very low win rates and low pick rates in almost every rank ( she sucks lol ).
* **Bronze Meta:** In Bronze, characters like **Storm**, **Rocket Raccoon**, and **Mantis** tend to have higher win rates and are seen more often. Other characters, like **Jeff the Land Shark** and **Black Widow**, have very low pick and win rates.
* **Silver Meta:** Players in Silver seem to have a good understanding of the game, with heroes like **Storm**, **Rocket Raccoon**, and **Doctor Strange** being very strong, and the pick rates tend to be less extreme across the board.
* **Gold Meta:** The Gold tier is the first place where we begin to see a divergence in the player base, with characters like **Storm** and **Rocket Raccoon** still being popular, but also showing high pick rates in **Doctor Strange** and also **Cloak & Dagger**.
* **Platinum Meta:** Players in the Platinum tier seem to know the meta at this point, with **Doctor Strange** and **Cloak & Dagger** being extremely popular while other characters such as **Luna Snow** start to become targeted.
* **Diamond Meta:** The meta in the Diamond tier shifts, with heroes such as **Hulk** and **Storm** having high ban rates. Characters such as **Doctor Strange** and **Cloak and Dagger** are still extremely popular, but characters like **Wolverine** begin to shine.
* **Grandmaster Meta:** Characters like **Wolverine, Doctor Strange** and **Magneto** begin to show their strengths, becoming S tier characters and showing how powerful they can be in the right hands. Other characters such as **Cloak and Dagger** continue to be extremely popular.
* **Celestial Meta:** Due to the very small player pool, the meta in Celestial is far more difficult to track. Characters such as **Peni Parker**, **Iron Fist**, and **Black Widow** have a 66% or higher win rate, showing there is still room for some outliers. **Luna Snow** and **Doctor Strange** also have extremely high pick rates.

**Rank-Specific Takeaways**

* **Bronze:** This is the most diverse rank where we see a clear distinction between high-performing and low-performing heroes. New players are still figuring out the game, which I think explains why some heroes are being picked regardless of their strength.
* **Silver:** Everyone has a better grasp of the game and are experimenting with different picks while also finding which heroes are effective. There is a clear top list of heroes and a clear bottom list of heroes.
* **Gold:** This is the rank where the ""meta"" truly starts to take form. Some characters continue to be played and work well, and we see players beginning to focus more on the strengths and weaknesses of each character.
* **Platinum:** This is where we begin to see a greater understanding team compositions and characters based off the tier list. It seems like most players start knowing which heroes they are likely to face and being able to play around it.
* **Diamond:** The game becomes a lot more strategic, with certain characters being target banned due to their ability to dominate in the meta. This is also the first tier where certain characters really begin to show their potential, like **Wolverine**.
* **Grandmaster:** This is the place where the highest level of players tend to be, and with that comes a complete meta change and the rise of new powerful characters, while also showing which heroes can still hold their own.
* **Celestial:** This is a very exclusive group of players and their meta is not as consistent due to the small number of players. Wasn't really able to conclude anything due to the size pool being so small this early in the season.

**Best All-Around Heroes**

Based on the data, some heroes consistently perform well across all ranks, making them reliable picks for players of all skill levels. These heroes tend to have a good balance of win rate, pick rate, and effectiveness:

* **Doctor Strange:** This hero consistently boasts high pick rates and a decent win rate across all ranks, showing his value as a strong ""jack-of-all-trades"" character.
* **Rocket Raccoon**: Rocket Raccoon has a strong win-rate and pick rate across almost all ranks, making him an excellent pick no matter what your rank.
* **Cloak & Dagger:** Despite not always having the highest win rates, their incredibly high pick rates show that they are a great pick no matter what level the player is.
* **Storm:** Despite having a very high ban rate in higher tiers, Storm has a very high win rate and is a great pick no matter what the rank.

These heroes are a great starting point for players who are not sure which heroes to pick, or if they want to learn a hero that will be useful at every level.

**Final Thoughts**

Marvel Rivals is a fantastic game and has been a blast for me with an awesome roster of heroes. It's really fascinating to see how different heroes perform across all the different skill levels, so I spent some time doing some math to sort-of figure out what was what across the different ranks and decided to share it with you all.



Here is where I derived all these findings and did my math: [https://rivalstracker.com/](https://rivalstracker.com/)"
Rocket Pool Being Adopted By Public Companies 🚀🚀🚀,rocketpool,1i63png,2025-01-20 17:54:57,36,0.91,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/rocketpool/comments/1i63png/rocket_pool_being_adopted_by_public_companies/,TheSource777,General,"[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/01/15/3010006/0/en/BTCS-Utilizes-Rocket-Pool-to-Drive-Revenue-Growth-and-Enhance-Margins.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/01/15/3010006/0/en/BTCS-Utilizes-Rocket-Pool-to-Drive-Revenue-Growth-and-Enhance-Margins.html) 

2025 is going to be the year for mainstream adoption of Ethereum by public companies. It's already happening. Platforms like Rocket Pool make the bar to get into Ethereum infrastructure operations so low (compared to Bitcoin and mining operations). Also legitimized Rocket Pool greatly. 

Keep an eye out for pure play Ethereum companies like $BTCS and partial Ethereum play companies like $BTBT. With ETH/BTC dominance at an all time low now, it's the perfect setup."

"$DROP: The Next Big XRP Meme Coin, Set to Explode Under Trump’s Leadership",BSCMoonShots,1i616gl,2025-01-20 16:10:00,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BSCMoonShots/comments/1i616gl/drop_the_next_big_xrp_meme_coin_set_to_explode/,CemYigit987,,"

Hey there! I’m Drop! Did you know there are 1,000,000 drops in just 1 XRP? That’s why $DROP is so unique—our total supply is only 1 million tokens. It’s rare, it’s valuable, and it’s ready to rocket 🚀.

Tomorrow Changes Everything
With Trump’s inauguration and the launch of the New World Liberation DeFi Project, the crypto world is about to enter a golden age. 

Trump’s pro-crypto stance signals massive growth for decentralized finance, and XRP memecoins like $DROP are perfectly positioned to lead the charge.

This new era is about freedom, decentralization, and innovation—values that align perfectly with crypto. The Trump Effect has already sparked excitement across the market, and $DROP is emerging as the meme coin of the moment, primed for explosive growth.

Why $DROP is Set to Soar
XRP’s DNA: $DROP isn’t just another meme coin—it’s deeply tied to XRP’s foundation. 

Like “satoshi” for Bitcoin, “drop” is the smallest unit of XRP, with 1 XRP equal to 1,000,000 drops. With a total supply of just 1 million tokens, $DROP is 21x scarcer than Bitcoin. Scarcity meets utility, making $DROP a gem in the XRPL ecosystem.

Perfect Timing: As XRP prepares for its next big move, $DROP’s chart is already heating up 🔥. 

Trump’s policies are set to bring crypto into the mainstream, and $DROP is riding that wave with momentum.

Key Partnerships: $DROP has partnered with The Martini Guy, a globally respected financial influencer, and Zerp Zoo Alpha, boosting its visibility and network.

$DROP’s Bullish Roadmap

Major CEX Listings in 2025: Huge centralized exchange announcements are coming, which will bring $DROP to a global audience, drive liquidity, and attract institutional investors.

Venture Capital Backing: 

Big money is recognizing $DROP’s potential, with venture capitalists ready to fund marketing, partnerships, and liquidity growth.
Community & Marketing Momentum.

$DROP’s community is thriving:

11K followers on X (Twitter)
3.3K+ Telegram members
Nearly 8K holders
Marketing efforts are paying off, with $DROP featured on CoinMarketCap, Medium, Binance Square, and Reddit, amassing over 6 million impressions on X since launch. 

Transparency is key, with regular X Spaces keeping everyone in the loop and 24/7 support available on Telegram and X.

Trump + DeFi = Bull Run 🚀

Trump’s pro-crypto policies signal a bull run like no other. His focus on decentralized finance and financial freedom will unleash new opportunities for projects like $DROP. With the crypto narrative shifting to innovation and liberation, memecoins tied to strong ecosystems like XRP are primed for gigacharged growth.

NFT & Operational Wins

The Lucky $DROP NFT event was a massive success, with 3,333 NFTs selling out in 12 hours and significantly boosting the liquidity pool. With past operational issues resolved, the team is laser-focused on scaling and growth.

How to Get $DROP

Set up an XRP wallet at FirstLedge.Net (@ First_Ledger).
Transfer XRP to your wallet.
Visit the $DROP token page and click BUY!

The Bottom Line

Tomorrow marks a historic moment for crypto, and $DROP is leading the charge. As Trump’s policies reshape the financial system and XRP gains momentum, $DROP is perfectly positioned to be the next big memecoin. 

Don’t miss out—$DROP is rare, innovative, and ready to skyrocket! 🚀

Guide to Roles and Team Composition,marvelrivals,1i5xjhc,2025-01-20 13:44:48,6,0.8,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1i5xjhc/guide_to_roles_and_team_composition/,Ethelbrit,Game Guide,"Choosing the right character to master or play can be a tough decision for many, and while there’s no one-size-fits-all answer, I’d like to share my perspective on how a well-rounded team composition should look and how to approach mastering various roles. Additionally, I’ll cover when to play certain characters and why they’re valuable in different situations.

# Team Composition Beyond Basic Roles

Beyond the obvious roles—Vanguards, Strategists, and Duelists—each character falls into additional, less obvious categories that help define their playstyle. For example, Vanguards can be split into *Aggressive* and *Defensive* types. These distinctions are key in determining how they should be played and how they interact with their team. While it’s possible to be aggressive with a “Defensive” Vanguard, it can be challenging, and you may want to switch to something better suited for that playstyle. From my experience, teams that cover these specific roles tend to have the most success.

# Vanguards

Vanguards can be classified as either Aggressive or Defensive, each with a distinct role on the battlefield:

**Aggressive Vanguards**: These are mobile divers who thrive in melee combat. They’re often quick to engage enemy Strategists or ranged Duelists, using their mobility to get in and out of dangerous situations. Their ultimate abilities typically clear an area, either by pushing enemies away or forcing them to flee. However, they tend to have lower health pools, so surviving requires smart flanking and quick retreats to heal. You shouldn’t rely too much on healers, as they might not always be able to support you. Your main job is to harass and disrupt the enemy backline, but always be ready to escape when overwhelmed. Your “play area” is generally just in front of your team, not necessarily at the front, but positioned to strike when needed. 

**Aggressive Vanguard:** Thor, Hulk, Venom, Captain America.



**Defensive Vanguards**: These characters lack mobility but excel at locking down areas and isolating enemies. Their attacks are often ranged, and their ultimate abilities tend to deny space to enemies. These Vanguards often have ways to sustain themselves, whether through health boosts or regenerating shields. Defensive Vanguards are typically slower and must focus on protecting the team, especially from aggressive divers, while locking down objectives. This role offers a more traditional ""tank"" experience.

**Defensive Vanguard**: Peni Parker, Magneto, Doctor Strange, Groot.

# Duelists

Duelists are arguably the most complex role to master, as their success depends heavily on how well they adapt to the enemy team and the current match conditions. While I categorize Duelists into three groups—Melee, Mid-Range, and Snipers—each character may defy these generalizations despite their abilities (For example Scarlet Witch, while she has mid-range abilities she gets more benefits when playing as a Melee Duelist).

**Melee Duelists**: Similar to Aggressive Vanguards, Melee Duelists thrive on flanking and picking off Strategists or long-range Duelists, rather than diving directly into the enemy’s backline. The key is avoiding being overwhelmed by the enemy team and not rushing into the fray. Melee Duelists often have abilities that grant sustain or mobility, making them resilient in close-quarters combat.

**Melee Duelist**: Magik, Iron Fist, Psylocke, Black Panther, Spider-Man, Wolverine, Scarlet Witch.

**Mid-Range Duelists**: Positioned between Vanguards and Strategists, these Duelists excel at positioning themselves on higher ground to shoot down enemies. They often have mobility tools (like Punisher's zipline or Moon Knight's grappling hook), but they remain squishy and must be careful not to overextend. While they should prioritize taking out enemy Vanguards or other threats to the backline, staying alive and avoiding too much exposure is crucial.

**Mid-Range Duelist**: Namor, Storm, Star-Lord, Squirrel Girl, Winter Soldier, Punisher, Moon Knight, Iron Man, Mr. Fantastic.

**Sniper Duelists**: Snipers are all about taking out enemies from a distance, whether it’s squishies or tanks. They hit hard, often dealing massive damage in one shot. Positioning is critical, as they can be vulnerable to divers who quickly close the gap. Your primary focus should be on taking down mobile characters and mid-range Duelists.

**Sniper Duelist**: Black Widow, Hawkeye.

To adapt to the enemy, here’s what I recommend:

* If the enemy has a troublesome diver, switch to a mid-range duelist.
* If the enemy has a troublesome sniper, switch to a melee duelist.
* If the enemy has a troublesome mid-ranger, switch to a sniper duelist.

# Strategists

Strategists can be divided into two categories: burst healers and gradual healers.

**Burst Healers**: These characters provide significant healing in a short amount of time but often have drawbacks, such as limited healing range or high cooldowns. These healers usually deal decent damage, so alternating between supporting and damaging is common. They should be positioned like mid-range Duelists, balancing their healing duties with offensive capabilities.

**Burst Healer**: Loki, Adam Warlock, Invisible Woman, Jeff the Landshark.

**Gradual Healers**: These healers excel at keeping the team alive over time, though their healing is slower and doesn’t provide immediate recovery. Their positioning usually involves staying in an area where they can heal multiple teammates at once with minimal aiming. Gradual healers are essential for sustained team survival.

**Gradual Healer**: Cloak & Dagger, Mantis, Luna Snow, Rocket Raccoon.

# Conclusion

A strong team adapts to the situation and keeps the objective in mind. Ideally, you should master at least one character in each role to understand your team’s strengths and weaknesses and exploit the enemy’s vulnerabilities. I know it’s tough when a character doesn’t click with you, but that’s when communication and team coordination come in. Flexibility is crucial—switching characters to fill the gaps can make all the difference. The real problem arises when players lock in a character and refuse to adapt, even when the team is struggling. Always assess the situation, make adjustments, and keep pushing toward victory."

# Position-by-Position Breakdown

* **QB:** Notre Dame – Joe Montana is one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history, leading his teams to four Super Bowl victories and earning three MVP awards.
* **RB:** Notre Dame – Jerome Bettis, a Hall of Famer and one of the NFL's top rushers, edges out Ohio State's Eddie George and Ezekiel Elliott.
* **WR:** Ohio State – With three Hall of Fame-caliber receivers in Cris Carter, Paul Warfield, and Terry McLaurin, Ohio State has a clear advantage at wide receiver.
* **TE:** Notre Dame – Dave Casper is an NFL legend, making him a standout at tight end over Ohio State’s Keith Byars.
* **OL:** Ohio State – Players like Orlando Pace and Jim Parker give Ohio State the upper hand in the trenches.
* **DL:** Notre Dame – Alan Page and Bryant Young are Hall of Fame defensive linemen who help Notre Dame win this position battle.
* **LB:** Ohio State – Randy Gradishar and Chris Spielman lead a linebacker group that excels in coverage and pass rush.
* **DB:** Ohio State – With players like Dick LeBeau and Antoine Winfield, Ohio State has a stronger secondary.
* **Special Teams:** Notre Dame – Tim Brown, a legend in the return game, plus solid performances from Brandon Aubrey and Craig Hentrich, give Notre Dame an edge in special teams.

# Final Verdict:

While both teams boast incredible talent, Ohio State holds a slight edge in several key areas, particularly at wide receiver and defensive back. Notre Dame shines with its quarterback play and running back depth. Ultimately, the rosters are nearly evenly matched, but Ohio State’s depth and defensive strength give it a slight advantage overall.

A rocket launcher that assembles a can-like weapon full of beans. Shoots a massive bean like a rocket without a drop off. It will have 6th perk which is **""eliminating a husk will spawn a green cloud of toxic gas for 6 seconds""**. Do not show this weapon to Ray!

#Melee weapons

* **Monsieur Croûte** (Sword)

A baguette as a large sword. **Eliminations with this weapon will spawn bread crust, eating bread crusts will increase attack speed by 30% and impact by 150%**. You'll show the husks the meaning of the French language like that. But maybe not for Ray.

* **Summer Slugger** (Club)

An Ice Cream on stick melee weapon. Except you eliminate the husks using it. **Critical hits with this club will freeze the husks for 10 seconds in a 1.2 tile radius. (cooldown 3 seconds)**. Make them feel cold in a hot summer!

* **Sweet Hit** (hardware)

A cake shaped hammer with the sole purpose of eliminating husks. **Hitting husks with this weapon has a chance to summon cake slices. Cake Slices will cause the weapon to do area of effect damage on critical hits and will increase crit rating by 20 for 10 seconds**. Lets celebrate the husk's birthday, and it will be their last party. 

#Traps

* **Watermelon Payload trap** (Ceiling)

Drops a giant, genetically engineered, and strong watermelon on the husks. It will explode in a 3x3 tile radius. The damage will be decided by the trap placement: 50% on 1 tile high, 75% on 2 tiles high, 120% damage on 3 tiles high. The explosion of the water melon will also knock back the husks by 2 tiles depending on the impact zone. So if a husk got hit in the back, they'll get knocked forward.

* **Fugu Toxin trap** (Floor)

A pool of the Fugu's toxins extracted from homebase's fugu fishing expeditions. A trap that will begin with 10% slow on the husks, then it will increase by 5% every second for 8 seconds until the slowing is now 50% due to the paralyzing effect of the toxin. If the husks has been hit from a different fugu toxin trap, it will cause them to take damage after 4 seconds of the first trap hit them. 

*Small fact, Fugu is cooked in a specific and professional way in order to make it edible, you need at least 1 year of training for that type of work*

* **Waffle Slam trap** (Wall)

This unique trap will take 20% of the husk's health and add it as damage. Thats it, just a waffle that has been turned into a wall trap."

Hey there! I’m Drop! Did you know there are 1,000,000 drops in just 1 XRP? That’s why $DROP is so unique—our total supply is only 1 million tokens. It’s rare, it’s valuable, and it’s ready to rocket 🚀.

Tomorrow Changes Everything
With Trump’s inauguration and the launch of the New World Liberation DeFi Project, the crypto world is about to enter a golden age. 

Trump’s pro-crypto stance signals massive growth for decentralized finance, and XRP memecoins like $DROP are perfectly positioned to lead the charge.

This new era is about freedom, decentralization, and innovation—values that align perfectly with crypto. The Trump Effect has already sparked excitement across the market, and $DROP is emerging as the meme coin of the moment, primed for explosive growth.

Why $DROP is Set to Soar
XRP’s DNA: $DROP isn’t just another meme coin—it’s deeply tied to XRP’s foundation. 

Like “satoshi” for Bitcoin, “drop” is the smallest unit of XRP, with 1 XRP equal to 1,000,000 drops. With a total supply of just 1 million tokens, $DROP is 21x scarcer than Bitcoin. Scarcity meets utility, making $DROP a gem in the XRPL ecosystem.

Perfect Timing: As XRP prepares for its next big move, $DROP’s chart is already heating up 🔥. 

Trump’s policies are set to bring crypto into the mainstream, and $DROP is riding that wave with momentum.

Key Partnerships: $DROP has partnered with The Martini Guy, a globally respected financial influencer, and Zerp Zoo Alpha, boosting its visibility and network.

$DROP’s Bullish Roadmap

Major CEX Listings in 2025: Huge centralized exchange announcements are coming, which will bring $DROP to a global audience, drive liquidity, and attract institutional investors.

Venture Capital Backing: 

Big money is recognizing $DROP’s potential, with venture capitalists ready to fund marketing, partnerships, and liquidity growth.
Community & Marketing Momentum.

$DROP’s community is thriving:

11K followers on X (Twitter)
3.3K+ Telegram members
Nearly 8K holders
Marketing efforts are paying off, with $DROP featured on CoinMarketCap, Medium, Binance Square, and Reddit, amassing over 6 million impressions on X since launch. 

Transparency is key, with regular X Spaces keeping everyone in the loop and 24/7 support available on Telegram and X.

Trump + DeFi = Bull Run 🚀

Trump’s pro-crypto policies signal a bull run like no other. His focus on decentralized finance and financial freedom will unleash new opportunities for projects like $DROP. With the crypto narrative shifting to innovation and liberation, memecoins tied to strong ecosystems like XRP are primed for gigacharged growth.

NFT & Operational Wins

The Lucky $DROP NFT event was a massive success, with 3,333 NFTs selling out in 12 hours and significantly boosting the liquidity pool. With past operational issues resolved, the team is laser-focused on scaling and growth.

How to Get $DROP

Set up an XRP wallet at FirstLedge.Net (@First_Ledger).
Transfer XRP to your wallet.
Visit the $DROP token page and click BUY!

The Bottom Line

Tomorrow marks a historic moment for crypto, and $DROP is leading the charge. As Trump’s policies reshape the financial system and XRP gains momentum, $DROP is perfectly positioned to be the next big memecoin. 

Don’t miss out—$DROP is rare, innovative, and ready to skyrocket! 🚀

Ultron Abilites Idea,marvelrivals,1i5ubhf,2025-01-20 11:35:31,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1i5ubhf/ultron_abilites_idea/,AsianRetard1234,Discussion,"I watched Avengers 2 again and now i want ultron as a playable character :(

Heres what i came up with cos im bored on my day off

I AM NOT A GAME DEV THIS IS PURELY A THOUGHT PROCESS THAT I WANTED TO SHARE, NO I DO NOT CARE IF ITS BALANCED

Passive: Energy Siphon
When near allies or enemies ultron gains passive shield regen, damage, and Damage reduction. Each ally/enemy grants one stack of each buff, maximising output at 6 stacks
(Imo makes sense cos in the movies he kinda plays around the idea of having a giant army so a team-focused passive that benefits him would be cool)
(Cosmetic idea: 3 skin variations for every 2 stacks) 
Inspiration: Adam Warlocks’s soul bond but made it selfish and a passive instead of an ability with cooldown

Oh yes ive designed ultron to be a tank

Primary Fire: Burst Cannon
Ammo: infinite
Range: infinite (collides with terrain)
Travel time: hit-scan
Ultron punches at the direction of the cursor with both arms, each generating 2 seperate beams of explosive energy in quick succession that collides with terrain/enemies and explodes on impact dealing AOE damage
(Inspiration: Adamantite Particle Accelerator from Terraria Calamity)

Right Click: Mechanic Blitz
Ultron dashes to the aimed direction via cursor at a quick speed. Collision with enemies knocks them back and stops ultron’s dash regardless of reaching max distance or not. Collisions also give ultron shields.
Inspiration: doomfist punch + genji swift strike

Offensive Ability: Sweeping Laser
 Ultron charges and releases a sweeping originating from his body. Enemies hit gain a “disruption” debuff that scrambles UI and highlights their position for a short duration. Each enemy hit refreshes a portion of time of the defensive ability. 
Inspiration: Junker Queen Axe swing Overwatch, Mohg Explosive flame attack or whatever)

Defensive Ability: Fortuitous Aggression
Ultron gains a defensive shield for a brief period of time, providing high damage reduction for a brief period, reduced movement speed and increased hitbox (maybe just make it like sigmas absorption black hole idk). Damage absorbed gives increased damage for attacks for 5 seconds and refreshes a portion of Ultrons offensive ability with the latter scaling with damage absorbed (maybe completely refreshing the laser at 500 damage absorbed)
Inspiration: overwatch sigma black hole, doomfist guard. Rhino iron skin warframe)

(The synergy is kinda like damage charges defence and defence charges damage, kind of like a cyclical casting character)

Utility Ability: Combative Sentry
Ultron summons a robot to his side (health pool and damage of an average strategist idk)
The robot scans the battlefield for optimal strategies, providing heals for allies when needed or assisting in assault when prompted. Robot health and damage scales with Ultron Energy Siphon stacks. Ultron can choose to mark an ally as main support target for his robot if needed, making it stay by their side unless told otherwise or destroyed by enemies. Robot counts toward ally count, contributing to Ultron’s buff when needed.

Inspiration: idk its not original but i dont recall what im inspired by


Ultimate: orbital dissolution 
Ultron summons an orbital laser that originates from ultron and moves towards the aimed direction quickly, dealing significant damage to enemies hit. Enemies hit by the laser generate secondary bursts of energy, generating AOE damage fields that debuff their allies as well. (E.g laser hits 4 enemies, they have a delayed energy explosion with range of 5 metres that deal damage to all allies within)
Inspiration: Overwatch Juno Laser ult but damage and much much quicker, combined with illari’s ult where u explode when u get damaged but no damage needed for the explosion

Alt ultimate: Entrophic Nexus

Ultron fires an energy field with 8 metres range that sucks all enemies into the centre, rendering all enemies hit immobile and unable to use ultimates, defensive and movement abilities. Deals damage over time scaling with buff stacks. Duration lasts for 5 seconds.

Inspiration: Zarya ult and ultron being able to affect gravity in the movie

Alt Ultimate 2: Systemic Upgrade
Ultron provides all allies with his buff stacks for the duration of the ultimate (cancels upon death). Range is irrelevant. Ultron additionally gains free flight, increased damage reduction on top of existing buffs, and increased fire rate.

Team up: Adaptive Leadership
As an adaptive force of robotic destruction, all allies are given a random teamup effect from their pool with diminished strength (e.g spiderman gets a weaker symbiote link, ironman gets a weaker gamma boost, moon knights invis is shorter in duration)

(Fun idea is to add a colour difference for each team up so maybe the gamma upgrade is red, the symbiote tentacles are energy projections, and rocket can spawn a controllable robot mech thats just an ultron robot to ride on while still getting the damage reduction)

Alt Team up Idea: Omniversal Matrix
Ultron’s team up affects all allies with a weaker Energy Siphon passive that grants only half the amount of stacks situational to Ultron’s buff stacks. Ultron with 2 stack = allies have 1 stack, ultron 4 stack = allies 2 stack, ultron 6 stack = allies 1 stack
This is the only team up that applies to every single character

I have more ideas but im afraid of spamming

Movement ability:
Upon pressing space after jumping, ultron gains a short burst of flight for 2 seconds. Cooldown 10 seconds.
Inspiration: Star lord but slower, shorter duration and longer cooldown

Sorry for the long text, lemme know what u think"
"Overwatch has always toed the line between casual and competitive. But now that another game has claimed one of those, it's time to commit",Competitiveoverwatch,1i5t4pe,2025-01-20 10:46:55,0,0.31,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1i5t4pe/overwatch_has_always_toed_the_line_between_casual/,Miennai,General :flair-general:,"Almost everyone who comments on the topic will admit that Marvel Rivals is by-and-large a sillier game in the PVP arena. Most of the hero kits are extremely forgiving with a focus on impact and fun, tanks are generally less defensive than in other games, leaving the floor open for the DPS player pool to shine, not to mention Ult charge carry-over between rounds and hero swaps, no role limits, etc.

MR has cemented itself as THE silly-fun hero shooter which means OW should stop agonizing over its identity. It has danced between those two worlds for nearly a decade, but now that the market for silly hero shooters is much thinner, it's time to stick to one thing.

Earlier, people were posting Overwatch 2025 wishlists, so with all this in mind, here's what I would like to see in 2025 and onward:

## Leaving behind beginner heroes
If Overwatch does lean into being a more serious and competitive hero shooter, doing away with free-value noob heroes is a must. Moira, Mauga, Torb, even Ram to an extent, etc, I'd like to see them all reworked into something that maintains their identity but leaves more room for creativity and skill expression in their gameplay loop.

## Chill with the new game modes
This is slightly less on-topic, but I don't think much can be gained from adding any more modes. I've warmed up to Push and Flashpoint, and Clash is SUPER rough but it has it's moments. I would agree with some that Clash was one-too-many, and another mode would just be exhausting. I say pump the brakes on modes, maybe even put Clash back into the oven for a bit (May I suggest, make it asymmetrical and have teams swap sides after someone finishes?), and focus on maps and heroes.

## And ACTUAL Stats page

I was so hyped when they announced expanded stats coming to OW2 but oh my god, what we got is borderline useless (Also, not even complete within its tiny scope. Where is my lifetime healing negated as Ana?) here are a couple things I would want to see in a stats page from a game that takes itself seriously:

- Win/loss records on specific maps

- success rate or capturing or defending certain map points

- a filter to show your stats against another hero on your team or the enemy team (e.g. I really want to know how much less healing I do when I have a Queen on my team, because I feel like it's much much lower.) 

- An indicator of how a single stat compares to others within your division. (e.g. If I'm Gold 2 trying to rank up on Soldier, it would really help to know if I'm landing 12% fewer Helix Rockets compared to other players in Gold 2)

- Stats to show death efficiency (how often do you die first, do you tend to die with your abilities available, how many enemies on average have to contribute to killing you, etc)

- Personal gripe, but I want an ""abilities negated"" stats for tanks. Partly because it would highlight a glaring blindspot in the design of most OW2 tanks

## Expanded hero info pages
Speaking of stats, let's have an advanced info page that gives the FULL breakout of everything in a hero's kit. Literally everything, damage numbers in all it's parts, cooldowns, hell even animation timings (If you're new, it would be nice to know that Ana's Nano isn't technically instant)

## Make map spot callouts official
This is smaller request that I can live without, but I love how Valorant gave call-out names to specific parts of the map which are visible on the minimap. I get that this is a basic necessity for a tac shooter, but since the more serious parts of the OW community ended up doing this anyway, it may be wise to just make it official, and perhaps even make a training section for it. Marvel Rivals has a feature where if you press B, the map will go grey, and destructible parts of the environment are highlighted in Yellow. OW could do the same thing, but highlight certain areas and show their call-out name. Players could then roam custom lobbies to learn them, and even quickly reference them mid-game or during death cams.

____

I'll leave it there for now. I really do think that Overwatch is it's best when it takes itself seriously. I've been around the block with this genre of game time and time again, and even after the release of MR (which I've put over 200 hours in so far), I still believe this is the best role-based Hero Shooter for competitive play, but it could be so much better if it **focused** on that.

Edit: Deleted tank section because that one might be too subjective."

Will we ever see cash cups for Rocket Racing? 🏎️💰,RocketRacing,1i5ojqd,2025-01-20 06:55:22,0,0.38,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketRacing/comments/1i5ojqd/will_we_ever_see_cash_cups_for_rocket_racing/,Weird-Isopod-1745,:thumbsup:USEFUL,"I've been a big fan of Rocket Racing since it launched, and while it’s clear the game hasn’t been the massive success many of us hoped for, I still think it has a lot of potential, also, it is one of the very few games I like I dont s-ck at competitive level (Elite 28% atm).

That got me wondering: do you think we’ll ever see *cash cups* or tournaments with prize pools for Rocket Racing? Whether they’re official events from Epic Games (which seems unlikely now that meaningful updates have stopped) or community-organized competitions, it feels like a missed opportunity not to foster some kind of competitive scene.

I know it’s a niche title, but there are still plenty of players grinding ranked and trying to improve. A cash cup, even a small one, could really bring some life to the game and attract more attention to its competitive side.

What do you think? Are cash cups a pipe dream, or is there still hope for something like this—official or otherwise?"

Please Don't Flame People For Incompatible Playstyles,marvelrivals,1i5mh51,2025-01-20 04:28:54,15,0.74,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1i5mh51/please_dont_flame_people_for_incompatible/,No_Spirit5633,Discussion,"I play mostly Loki. Loki is a healer that works best on the point/behind big groups since he does splash heals/damage, cannot headshot, has massive aoe heals, and has massive damage/heals falloff at range. If you are a competent Loki player, you will know that you should not chase down flankers and dive tanks, because your kit just isn't built for it. Please understand this next part, because it's important: NONE OF THIS MEANS THAT ANY OF THOSE PLAYSTYLES ARE WRONG.

A good flanker is a godsend. A strong dive tank can win games. At the same time, Loki's heal pools can cancel a shitload of DPS ults, which can be just as game changing. Just because I can't follow you into every asscrack of the map or chase you all the way to the enemy spawn does not make me a bad healer, it just means that we need to work with each other's kits more effectively. If you are a really good dive tank, and you think it would absolutely benefit the team to have a more consistent healer who can pocket you as you push, ASK NICELY. LOTS OF PEOPLE WILL SWITCH IF YOU'RE NOT AN ASS 

You need to understand that if you run off to the enemy spawn, I can't be there to save you when you get in trouble. If I'm looking for a poke DPS to follow onto the point, I probably shouldn't choose a Spidey. Not because Spidey is a throw pick or anything goofy like that, it's just not what his kit is for. This isn't some strategist victim complex thing either; if you're a Luna/CnD/Rocket/Adam who is constantly yelling at flankers to peel to protect you, that's not their job either. Please just understand that none of us are the main character, we are on a TEAM, and other players are not there to help you boost your stats."

"🚀 $DROP: The Next Big XRP Meme Coin, Set to Explode Under Trump’s Leadership",CryptoMars,1i5b439,2025-01-19 17:32:23,114,0.95,0,https://i.redd.it/7xiuf03021ee1.jpeg,ophanim0,MEMECOIN,"Hey there! I’m Drop! Did you know there are 1,000,000 drops in just 1 XRP? That’s why $DROP is so unique—our total supply is only 1 million tokens. It’s rare, it’s valuable, and it’s ready to rocket 🚀.

Tomorrow Changes Everything
With Trump’s inauguration and the launch of the New World Liberation DeFi Project, the crypto world is about to enter a golden age. 

Trump’s pro-crypto stance signals massive growth for decentralized finance, and XRP memecoins like $DROP are perfectly positioned to lead the charge.

This new era is about freedom, decentralization, and innovation—values that align perfectly with crypto. The Trump Effect has already sparked excitement across the market, and $DROP is emerging as the meme coin of the moment, primed for explosive growth.

Why $DROP is Set to Soar
XRP’s DNA: $DROP isn’t just another meme coin—it’s deeply tied to XRP’s foundation. 

Like “satoshi” for Bitcoin, “drop” is the smallest unit of XRP, with 1 XRP equal to 1,000,000 drops. With a total supply of just 1 million tokens, $DROP is 21x scarcer than Bitcoin. Scarcity meets utility, making $DROP a gem in the XRPL ecosystem.

Perfect Timing: As XRP prepares for its next big move, $DROP’s chart is already heating up 🔥. 

Trump’s policies are set to bring crypto into the mainstream, and $DROP is riding that wave with momentum.

Key Partnerships: $DROP has partnered with The Martini Guy, a globally respected financial influencer, and Zerp Zoo Alpha, boosting its visibility and network.

$DROP’s Bullish Roadmap

Major CEX Listings in 2025: Huge centralized exchange announcements are coming, which will bring $DROP to a global audience, drive liquidity, and attract institutional investors.

Venture Capital Backing: 

Big money is recognizing $DROP’s potential, with venture capitalists ready to fund marketing, partnerships, and liquidity growth.
Community & Marketing Momentum.

$DROP’s community is thriving:

11K followers on X (Twitter)
3.3K+ Telegram members
Nearly 8K holders
Marketing efforts are paying off, with $DROP featured on CoinMarketCap, Medium, Binance Square, and Reddit, amassing over 6 million impressions on X since launch. 

Transparency is key, with regular X Spaces keeping everyone in the loop and 24/7 support available on Telegram and X.

Trump + DeFi = Bull Run 🚀

Trump’s pro-crypto policies signal a bull run like no other. His focus on decentralized finance and financial freedom will unleash new opportunities for projects like $DROP. With the crypto narrative shifting to innovation and liberation, memecoins tied to strong ecosystems like XRP are primed for gigacharged growth.

NFT & Operational Wins

The Lucky $DROP NFT event was a massive success, with 3,333 NFTs selling out in 12 hours and significantly boosting the liquidity pool. With past operational issues resolved, the team is laser-focused on scaling and growth.

How to Get $DROP

Set up an XRP wallet at FirstLedge.Net (@First_Ledger).
Transfer XRP to your wallet.
Visit the $DROP token page and click BUY!

The Bottom Line

Tomorrow marks a historic moment for crypto, and $DROP is leading the charge. As Trump’s policies reshape the financial system and XRP gains momentum, $DROP is perfectly positioned to be the next big memecoin. 

Don’t miss out—$DROP is rare, innovative, and ready to skyrocket! 🚀
