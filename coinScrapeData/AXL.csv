Navigating the Future: A Deep Dive into Axelar (AXL)'s Role in Blockchain Interoperability  
  
Abstract  
  
This analysis explores the pivotal role of Axelar (AXL) in the evolving landscape of blockchain interoperability. We delve into Axelar's recent market performance, noting significant price movements and increased trading volumes, particularly on platforms like Coinbase. The paper examines Axelar's strategic partnerships with major institutions such as Deutsche Bank and Microsoft, which have catalyzed its adoption within both traditional finance and blockchain ecosystems. We also assess the technological advancements, including the launch of the Interchain Token Service (ITS) and the Axelar Virtual Machine (AVM), which promise to expand Axelar's functionality across multiple blockchain networks. The analysis covers staking dynamics, governance involvement by AXL holders, and the growing developer and community engagement. Challenges such as security concerns, regulatory impacts, and competitive pressures are critically evaluated. Lastly, we offer short-term market predictions and a long-term vision for Axelar, positioning it as a key player in shaping the future of blockchain interconnectivity.

Osmosis Alloyed Assets: Improving Liquidity Fragmentation & DeFi UX,cryptocrewvalidators,1h190dq,2024-11-27 11:58:21,6,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocrewvalidators/comments/1h190dq/osmosis_alloyed_assets_improving_liquidity/,crypto-crew,,"https://preview.redd.it/ds5vj45f5h3e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c4394551f05631e154908a88a0ed3de56149ace

The contributors to¬†[Osmosis](https://osmosis.zone/)¬†have a long history of pushing the limits of what is possible on a decentralized exchange. Since their launch in 2021, they have continuously improved user experience and added functionalities that allow them to compete with their centralized counterparts. Their latest innovation is¬†**alloyed assets**¬†and with a relatively soft launch, many people may have missed how important this new feature is, both for user experience and for safety. In this article, after setting a little bit of context, I‚Äôm going to

* Introduce alloyed assets
* Show you how they work
* Explain why they are necessary

Let‚Äôs dive in.

# Context: Idiosyncratic Risks

When a person purchases stock of a single company, they take on two types of risk.¬†**Systematic risk**¬†is the set of all things that could wrong and affect every business, while¬†**idiosyncratic risk**¬†is the set of things that could go wrong with that particular company. Idiosyncratic risks include

* Poor resource management
* Regulatory changes
* Product or service failures

And all sorts of other issues, large and small. The problem is that average retailer investors (and also many above-average institutional investors‚Ä¶) are not good at measuring these idiosyncratic risks. This leads to the construction of investment theses which are missing critical information, costing people time, energy, and capital.

This is why¬†**index funds**¬†are so important. An index is essentially a basket containing many different stocks across many different industries, and their respective funds allow people to invest in the entire basket, hedging against idiosyncratic risks. After all, a disaster for one company might be an opportunity for several others. If you own them all, your portfolio is much safer. While not the first of its kind,¬†[Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/corporate-portal)¬†launched an investment revolution with its first public index fund in 1976.

Ok, so what does this have to do with Osmosis?

# Bridges

The Cosmos was designed with blockchain interoperability at its center, facilitated by the¬†**inter-blockchain communication protocol**¬†([IBC](https://www.ibcprotocol.dev/)). This has far reaching consequences for its design space, but for normal users it means that assets can flow back and forth between blockchains seamlessly, safely, and permissionlessly. This has not been replicated in other ecosystems (yet‚Ä¶), so in order to service many important blockchain assets (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc), Osmosis relies on¬†**bridges**.

A bridge is a piece of software that lets you move an asset from an origin chain to a destination chain. If I want to use some of my Bitcoin in an Ethereum smart contract for example, I need some way of representing my Bitcoin on the Ethereum chain, since it does not exist there natively. We won‚Äôt worry about too many details for now but there is one critical concept we will need.

# Bridges are Hard

Using cryptocurrencies has always been a bit risky, but ever since their popularity began to rise in 2021, bridges have become a prime target for hackers. A few bridge incidents of note:

* [Poly network bridge was hacked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly_Network_exploit)¬†for $600 million (August 2021)
* [The Wormhole bridge was hacked](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/3/22916111/wormhole-hack-github-error-325-million-theft-ethereum-solana)¬†for $325 million (February 2022)
* [The Ronin bridge was hacked](https://www.wired.com/story/blockchain-network-bridge-hacks/)¬†for $540 million (April 2022 )
* [The Nomad bridge was hacked](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/02/nomad-bridge-drained-of-nearly-200-million-in-exploit/)¬†for $190 million (August 2022)

The Nomad hack is of particular interest because just months prior, they had been nominated to be the canonical bridge from Ethereum to Osmosis alongside Gravity Bridge, Wormhole (hacked earlier that year) and¬†[Axelar](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/206)¬†which actually won the title.

Much like stocks, bridges also have idiosyncratic risks that are challenging for even sophisticated blockchain users to gauge. Despite that, these hacks also highlight that the demand for cross-chain interactions is only growing.

If only there was some way to hedge against these risks‚Ä¶

# Alloyed Assets

Osmosis‚Äô solution to the potential perils of non-IBC bridges is¬†[alloyed assets](https://forum.osmosis.zone/t/alloyed-assets-on-osmosis-unifying-ux-and-solving-liquidity-fragmentation/2624)¬†‚Äì a way of indexing across multiple bridges for like-kind assets. To illustrate how they work, I‚Äôll use an example scenario: A user wants to sell their BTC, which is currently on the Bitcoin blockchain, on Osmosis. In order to do so, they must bridge the BTC tokens over.

# Deposit

Because of the structure of blockchains, like-assets that arrive from different bridges are not¬†**fungible**¬†‚Äì that is, they are not recognized by the protocols as being the same token. In the past, a user would need to contend with complicated naming schemes:

* WBTC is Cosmos-native Wrapped Bitcoin from¬†[Bitgo](https://www.bitgo.com/)
* WBTC.eth.axl is the Ethereum-native version, bridged via Axelar
* nBTC is bridged using¬†[Nomic](https://www.nomic.io/)
* Etc etc etc

Each one of these representations is a separate token with separate liquidity pools, but all fundamentally represent the same asset. The nomenclature makes for a confusing experience for users and the fracturing of liquidity makes for a much worse experience for traders. More importantly, each one of these assets is tied directly to the idiosyncratic risks of its particular bridge.

Let‚Äôs return to our user wishing to move their BTC to Osmosis. There are two possibilities for such a user: (1) They have no idea what bridges exist or which one to use or (2) They have a bridge in mind they want to use.

If we search BTC on the Portfolio page, we can see that Osmosis has made some very deliberate choices:

https://preview.redd.it/9n5jvoxk5h3e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78f48f9b65f779114feeb3379bfcdc8859882042

First, we can see all the ugly BTC versions that are bridge dependent, but the simplest version appears at the top. This is a perfect choice for users who neither know nor care about how their tokens arrive. When they click deposit, they are presented with a screen like so:

https://preview.redd.it/ega2t7vq5h3e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c6617fedcc6294562b1a29bb203867845e7f54d

Users who wish to receive a particular version of BTC can simply select one they want from the dropdown, but most users will probably review this screen and continue to sign the transaction which will forward their BTC through an automatically selected bridge to Osmosis. Once the transaction has been confirmed on the source blockchain and in the bridge, their BTC will be visible in their Osmosis account. Easy.

But wait‚Ä¶ what even IS this BTC token?

This is alloyed Bitcoin. It is a tokenized mixture of several BTC variants that exist on Osmosis. You can think of it like a basket of different bridged versions of BTC, much like an index fund is a basket of stocks.

To understand how this token comes to be, we need to look at¬†**liquidity pools**.

# How to Make an Alloyed Asset

Alloyed assets are actually just liquidity provider (LP) tokens for special¬†**transmuter**¬†liquidity pools. Let‚Äôs break that down a bit.

First, I mentioned that each alloyed asset is like a basket, so somewhere we have pull together all of the different tokens that will contribute to it. This occurs in a special smart contract called a liquidity pool. A typical pool has two assets and will aim to store 50/50 dollar value of each. For example, if a BTC/USDC pool had $10k work of USDC, it would also need to hold $10k worth of BTC. These pools are how an¬†**automated market maker**¬†(AMM) like Osmosis automates its trading ‚Äì users are not buying from or selling to one another directly, but from the liquidity pool.

Users can contribute funds to a liquidity pool to receive LP tokens. These tokens are like a proof-of-contribution and they can always be redeemed for some fraction of the pool‚Äôs contents. Typically, holders of LP tokens are entitled to some pro-rata share of the fees that the pool generates as traders exchange between its two assets.

https://preview.redd.it/hw1mdgnt5h3e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8cd680bdba788199ed09e6acee0ac239deef4180

The transmuter liquidity pools that power alloyed assets are not typical, but do behave in a similar way. For starters, these pools can have more than two assets in them, and the ratios of these assets are more flexible. All of them, however, need to be ‚Äòlike-kind‚Äô ‚Äì each is a different representation of the same original asset.

Just like a typical pool, users can deposit funds in the form of any one of the accepted representations, and in return they will receive LP tokens. But unlike in normal pools, this LP token is¬†**scaled**¬†such that for every one of the like-kind asset you deposit, you receive back one LP token. These LP tokens ARE the alloyed asset, representing a scaled share of the pool‚Äôs contents.

It is worth remembering that although this article is focussing on alloyed Bitcoin and its constituent representations, it is only an example. It is possible to create alloyed versions of Ethereum, stablecoins like USDT, and any other tokens in the same manner.

# Conclusion

In this article, we managed to cover the basics of what alloyed assets are and why they are important. Hopefully you now you understand that

* Bridges come with idiosyncratic risks that are hard to measure
* Alloyed assets allow users to hedge against these risks
* They do this by being composed of many bridged representations
* This cleans up the user experience and increases safety

Having started our own journey validating the Osmosis chain, we at CryptoCrew are thrilled at the incredible progress that the contributors have made continuously improving their product. They have cemented themselves as a pillar of the interchain, and are one of several shining examples of the appchain thesis in action. We look forward to many future developments which keep their users‚Äô interests at heart, and will continue to contribute to their bold and exciting experiment.

Thanks for reading!

**About Axelar (AXL)**¬†

Axelar is a cross-chain communication network operating within the Web3 sphere, providing secure operations for decentralized application (dApp) developers. Its distinct feature set includes a decentralized network, protocols, tools, APIs, and gateway smart contracts for smoother cross-chain interactions. Axelar‚Äôs backbone, the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, ensures network security and fosters seamless bridging of disparate blockchain systems.¬†

Devised in 2020 by Georgios Vlachos and Sergey Gorbunov, part of the original Algorand team, Axelar incorporates their experience in blockchain technology. Key investors of Axelar include Binance and Coinbase Ventures. The technology that bolsters Axelar incorporates a dynamic validator network, a far-reaching set of developer-friendly protocols and APIs, and smart contracts that initiate cross-chain transactions. This structure not only smoothens the transfer of several cryptocurrencies through their ERC-20 counterparts but also gives space for varied applications, including dApp development and decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions.¬†

As per the project, its supposed core proposition lies in its ability to secure cross-chain communication through a PoS-based dynamic validator network, unlike projects reliant on conventional federated or optimistic security models. Combined with developer-focused tools, Axelar enables app creators to work on their preferred chains and gives users simple access to the decentralized web. Axelar aim to enhance interoperability and remove chain barriers in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology.¬†As Axelar aims to cement its role in facilitating effortless cross-chain functionality, it is set to widen its ecosystem through ongoing technological improvements and strategic partnerships.

This OTC portal is for affected users holding $axlUSDC (or pools containing the asset) after the IBC exploit on [@terra\_money](https://x.com/terra_money) chain.  
  
These assets are currently not backed (thus unable to be bridged), and this interim solution provides a path to swap out of these positions.

Note - More batches will be continuously added to meet user demand.

Other impacted Axelar assets, such as $axlWBTC and $axlUSDT, will be added when available.

Exploring QuickSwap: A Comprehensive Review of the Leading Polygon-Based DEX. What Are Your Experiences and Thoughts on QuickSwap's User Interface and Features?,ethtrader,1dr4g4y,2024-06-29 02:00:59,11,0.87,112,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1dr4g4y/exploring_quickswap_a_comprehensive_review_of_the/,kirtash93,Discussion,"# User Inferface and Navigation

QuickSwap‚Äôs user interface is simple, easy to use, and not confusing at all. Compared to other DEXs, it follows the same standard with the main box in the middle. Additionally, there are extra boxes with price and liquidity pool data on the left (which can be collapsed) and a news feed and email subscription box on the right (which can also be collapsed).

https://preview.redd.it/dl34ygu8ag9d1.png?width=1897&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f3ffc21ac3b575cdc01a3d3cd90860daf14fb9c

They allow for Market, Limit, and TWAP swaps, as well as Cross Chain swaps with a very customizable approach. Every step of making a transaction is straightforward and similar to other DEXs' UIs. They also allow buying crypto with a credit card.

# Supported Tokens and Chains

They mainly focus on the Polygon chain and refer to themselves as the leading DEX on Polygon PoS, Polygon zkEVM, and Dogechain that‚Äôs fully decentralized and community-driven. They also allow trading any combination of ERC-20 tokens.

https://preview.redd.it/n6ifztviag9d1.png?width=719&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6c993919579c02bd9fd848751fea31597667903

# Liquidity

QuickSwap offers the possibility to provide liquidity and earn a 0.25% fee on trades proportional to your share of the pool. You can also earn dQUICK by depositing LP tokens to earn extra rewards.

# Staking

They allow staking through their single staking pool for the QUICK token called Dragon's Lair. You can earn dQUICK and receive your share of 0.04% of all trading fees.

# GamingHub

They also have a GamingHub section where you can find a wide variety of games developed on Polygon chain that are FreeToPlay. I have never played any of those games but I think it worth looking into them. Maybe you find yourj favorite game there. As they say in the page, polygon games have low transaction fees, an strong ecosystem with Polygon studios support, liquidity support, etc.

# Personal Experience

Some time ago, I used QuickSwap to buy CONE with a credit card, and the process was easy and fast. The fees were obviously higher than using crypto directly, as is typical when using a credit card in other apps, but it wasn't unreasonable. Recently, I made a small trade from MATIC to WETH, and everything was smooth and fast. The fees in this case were approximately ‚Ç¨0.01, so very cheap.

In general, I think QuickSwap is a really interesting Polygon-based DEX that allows you to move coins in and out of the Polygon chain with ease.

I hope you enjoyed this review!

Looking at an in-depth analysis of Axelar price charts, we see that the Axelar price crosses above all three moving averages (red, green, and blue lines) of the Williams Alligator, indicating a positive momentum shift. Traders might look for these averages to hold as support in a pullback.

On the other hand, the RSI is trending upwards and is near the 60 level, suggesting growing bullish momentum without being overbought. As of press time, the Axelar price stood at $1.19, representing an 11.48% jump from its previous 24-hour price.

**For links to resources within the article please read this on our** [**blog**](https://blocksunited.com/stake-cosmos-atom-using-keplr/)**.**

If Ethereum‚Äôs high fees and slow transaction times have brought you to Cosmos, good for you!¬†

Cosmos is a network of interconnected app chains. At the center of it all is the Cosmos Hub and the ATOM token.

ATOM offers one of the most attractive staking yields, has become the preferred collateral in the ecosystem, and ATOM stakers receive airdrops!

>

Claiming airdrops requires a Cosmos-native wallet and¬†Keplr¬†is one of the best.¬†

Sorry Trust, Exodus and Atomic wallet users. You will need to¬†import your seed phrase¬†or Cosmos private key into Keplr to claim airdrops and stake those tokens.

Fortunately, we have a¬†tutorial¬†for that too on our blog.

# Staking Cosmos (ATOM) from a noncustodial wallet

You have taken the plunge into¬†self-custody¬†and withdrawn your tokens from the exchange. Good for you! Remember, tokens are not held in your wallet. They live on the blockchain and your wallet holds the keys that unlock your address so that you can move them.

Wallets would be more appropriately called ‚ÄúKeychains‚Äù or ‚ÄúKeyrings.‚Äù

Centralized exchanges run their own validators and are terrible for networks.

Be sure to read our articles:¬†Why You Should Stake With Smaller Validators¬†and¬†Why You Should Not Stake With Coinbase on our blog.

It‚Äôs important to note that self-custody does have its own set of risks that you must consider. Some of the risk can be eliminated by using a hardware wallet, like a¬†Ledger Nano. We always recommend using a hardware wallet.

Hardware wallets, like Ledger can be connected to Keplr. That will add a layer of security by storing your wallet keys offline. Now, let‚Äôs get down to business.

Here‚Äôs our detailed¬†**step-by-step guide to staking Cosmos ATOM tokens using Keplr browser extension and Keplr mobile wallets.**

Let‚Äôs Fu%kin Go! (LFG)

# How to stake ATOM using Keplr extension wallet

Staking tokens using the Keplr browser extension is simple. It‚Äôs a great wallet.

We will assume you already have Keplr installed and ATOM tokens at your address.

**1.**¬†Click the Keplr extension icon in your browser toolbar.

I used metamask on the official bridge (app.shadeprotocol.io/bridge) that uses Axelar to send ETH into the protocol; I can see on the Axelar explorer that the funds were deposited as WETH to the correct secret address that was generated for me when I first connected metamask to shade. So far so good.

However, I cannot interact with my funds in any way; when I go to portfolio and click on ""Show Balance"", nothing happens. I can't see any WETH balances on the swap page, I don't see a WETH.axl balance on the bridge page, and as noted above, when I click on show balances on the portfolio page (or any other page for that matter), I don't get anything.

I can see that the funds were deposited by Axelar into the correct Secret Network account, and that's as far as I can go using Metamask. If I had known this was going to be such a hassle, I would have used the metamask -> keplr bridge instead, but Shade Protocol put out a post that metamask was now fully supported and that I would receive a faucet drip to help me get started on the protocol if I used the official bridge.

Any insight or help would be greatly appreciated. It seems like a great platform, but the metamask experience has been incredbily frustrating. If I can just get access to that WETH with metamask, I can transfer everything to my keplr wallet and move on with this issue.

thanks!"

This decision, made in April 2023, is intended to ensure that we accurately represent and uphold the interests of our community. We reserve the right to use our NO or NO\_WITH\_VETO option in specific cases. These cases include, but are not limited to, situations where the proposal is considered spam (i.e., irrelevant to the respective chain/community), disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently established by the respective chain/community. By maintaining this stance, we aim to protect the integrity of the community and its governance processes, promote transparency, and safeguard against actions that may compromise the well-being of our members or the broader ecosystem. However, we recognize that our delegators may have differing opinions on these matters. To ensure that their voices are heard and respected, our delegators have the option to override our decision by participating in the voting process themselves. This enables a more inclusive and democratic approach to community decision-making, empowering our delegators to actively shape the direction and values of the community in alignment with their own perspectives and priorities.|

Bridging DOT to Polkadot,cosmosnetwork,18svpqh,2023-12-28 09:53:34,1,0.57,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork/comments/18svpqh/bridging_dot_to_polkadot/,zeb737,,"Greetings everyone.

I would like to bridge my DOT that is now on Osmosis to Polkadot, but I am unsure what is the optimal way to do so. I have very little experience with bridging assets between ecosystems.  

I don't know what bridge is used to wrap the DOT that I have. I suppose it is not axelar since there is also an axl-wrapped version of DOT on Osmosis. If I try to withdraw via Osmosis I get redirected to a blocked page.

Would it be easiest to swap to DOT.axl, withdraw to axelar and somehow bridge to Polkadot? If it would be easier to send a different asset to Polkadot instead then let me know as well üòÖ However I do intend to stake DOT over there. 

Thanks in advance"

|$ATOM|848|abstain|ATOM Halving: Set the max. Inflation Rate to 10%|CryptoCrew has decided to vote abstain. Our reasoning behind this decision is based on the following points: Recent research has shown that A) the Cosmoshub is in fact overpaying for security ([https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-set-max-inflation-at-10/11841/93](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-set-max-inflation-at-10/11841/93)) - but also B) that the staking incentivization mechanism has worked historically ([https://twitter.com/EffortCapital/status/1724486648711237867](https://twitter.com/EffortCapital/status/1724486648711237867)). Providing economic security is, and always has been, the most important core property of the hub. In considering any adjustments to ATOM inflation, we advocate for a comprehensive approach that forms part of a broader ATOM tokenomics overhaul plan. This plan should meticulously evaluate the potential impacts of every possible parameter change on all ecosystem participants. We acknowledge that the discussions around these changes are ongoing and subject to evolution, as new data and interpretations emerge regularly. While our inclination has been towards a 'no' vote because we think that the discussion isn't evolved enough, we have chosen to abstain, reflecting our openness to align with the broader community consensus. In the event that the proposed change is accepted but leads to adverse consequences, we are committed to actively monitoring its impact and are prepared to rapidly propose and implement further modifications. As a community we should remain adaptable and responsive, ensuring that our actions are guided by a thorough analysis of outcomes and feedback. In regards to increasing ICS overhead for validators, the solution to ‚Äúincrease commission if needed‚Äù doesn‚Äôt seem sustainable to us, as it will inevitably lead to stake concentration on bigger validators who are able to keep commission rates lower.|

&#x200B;

1Ô∏è‚É£ $wstETH (bridged through the canonical Lido bridge) on the Red Bank‚Äôs Neutron Outpost?

2Ô∏è‚É£ $axlWETH on the Red Bank‚Äôs Neutron Outpost?

 

Tldr üßµüëá

&#x200B;

\[MRC-49\] aims to list $wstETH (bridged through the canonical Lido bridg) on the Red Bank‚Äôs Neutron Outpost.

&#x200B;

Mars contributors believe this is an ideal collateral asset and could generate considerable organic demand for the Red Bank on Neutron. 

&#x200B;

The main reason for that is $wstETH is a liquid staking derivative, which allows users to effectively use a representation of $ETH across DeFi without sacrificing staking rewards. 

&#x200B;

As such, this removes the current cost of opportunity of using $ETH across DeFi and could catalyze more organic usage for the Red Bank.

&#x200B;

\[MRC-50\] aims to list $axlWETH on the Red Bank‚Äôs Neutron Outpost.

&#x200B;

The main motivation for listing $axlWETH is to allow users to perform delta neutral leveraged staking with $wstETH, which contributors are also proposing to list on the Red Bank. 

&#x200B;

Leveraged $ETH staking has been a significant growth driver for protocols on Ethereum, as evidenced by the fact that 51% of Aave V3‚Äôs TVL today is $wstETH. Mars contributors believe listing $axlWETH (along with $wstETH) has the potential to catalyze activity within the Red Bank.

&#x200B;

$axlWETH is currently the second-most bridged Axelar asset from Ethereum to Cosmos and has consistently been one of the most liquid assets in the Cosmos ecosystem. This strengthens contributor conviction in the popularity of this asset and its ability to generate valuable organic usage of the Red Bank.

For this, we have launched a total of 6 farms on Arbitrum, Optimism & Polygon PoS on KyberSwap Elastic: wstETH-axl.wstETH static farms and wstETH-ETH dynamic farms.

You can now turn some of your wstETH into axl.wstETH and pool wstETH-axl.wstETH for more yield, more farming rewards, and get this‚Ä¶ no impermanent loss!

There is also less need for position maintenance, since static farm ranges don't change. LPs can also choose to pool wstETH-ETH.

Hot Sectors Ahead Of The Next Bull Run,CryptoCurrency,15ggggq,2023-08-02 14:19:51,3,0.57,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/15ggggq/hot_sectors_ahead_of_the_next_bull_run/,Johnny-Joseph,SPECULATION,"**Disclaimer**: *All that is said is this post is for entertainment and knowledge enrichment.All the projects I will present here are for the purpose of examples only, what is written here should not be seen as advice or a recommendation for action. It is important to do your own research.*

*Shall we begin?*

**Here is a summary of the sectors**

* *digital identity*
* *interoperability*
* *Layer 2*
* *Blockchain games*
* *Decentralized finance*

&#x200B;

# Digital ID

*Many believe that a digital identity is essential to take crypto a level further.A digital identity is necessary to take advantage of the full potential of areas such as: centralized crypto loans, new governance mechanism, and more.*

*But for it to succeed and really work, the digital identity must be decentralized.This way it will be possible to use this identity even to use DeFi, after the regulation is clear around crypto of course.*

*After all, who really wants a digital identity that is issued by governments and allows them to have complete control over us? Just look at what is happening in China today.*

*Make no mistake, the plan of governments around the world is to create a digital identity for all their citizens by 2025, and some have already succeeded in doing so.*

*Let's hope that the identity will truly be decentralized.*

**Projects worth to watch:**

* *Kilt Protocol (KILT)*
* *Polygon (MATIC)*
* *Civic (CVC)*

\-----

# Interoperability

*The current Web3 landscape is becoming increasingly multi-chain and multi-layered. There are already more than 100 layer-1 blockchains (i.e. base-layers) and an increasing number of layer-2 and eventually layer-3 networks that exist on top of base-layer blockchains. Layer-2 and layer-3 networks are essentially separate blockchains that anchor part of their security to a base layer.*

*given the wide variety of blockchain ecosystems, it‚Äôs critical that all these distinct on-chain environments are able to interoperate. This is particularly important for developers wanting to build cross-chain/modularized applications that maintain a single global state and unified liquidity across numerous on-chain environments.*

*For crypto to truly become accessible to all, interoperability is imperative.*

**Projects worth to watch:**

* *Cosmos (ATOM)*
* *Axelar (AXL)*
* *Flux (FLUX)*

*------*

# Layer-2

*If in the previous bull market we saw quite a few Layer-1 projects that wanted to take a share of the Ethereum network (they weren't called Ethereum killers for nothing), it seems that in the next bull market these will actually be Layer-2 projects.*

*after all, Layer-2 projects are exactly what Ethereum's competitors have been trying to achieve - fast transactions and low fees.*

*for this reason, you will not be surprised to find that the total value locked (TVL) in Layer-2 projects continue to grow at a rapid pace and at one point even exceeded the total number of transactions in the Ethereum network itself.*

**Projects worth to watch:**

* *Arbitrum (ARB)*
* *Starknet (no token yet)*
* *Metis (METIS)*

*------*

# Blockchain Gaming

*For many industry commentators, gaming represents the most likely route to widespread blockchain adoption. Axie Infinity was a great example of this in 2021.*

*a report showed that blockchain games attracted 1.22 million unique active wallets in March 2022.*¬†

*also, according to a recent research report by Cryptodotcom (CDC), Naavik, and BITKRAFT Ventures, it is estimated that the blockchain gaming market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 100%, from $1.5B in 2021 to $50B in 2025. This is 20 times the forecasted \~10% CAGR for the traditional gaming industry.*

**Projects worth to watch:**

* *Gala Games (GALA)*
* *The SandBox (SAND)*
* *Magic (MAGIC)*

*------*

# Decentralized finance - DeFi

*With the ambition to replace traditional financial systems such as banks, the decentralized finance sector cannot be ignored.*

*Decentralized finance generates more fees than Bitcoin, with only Ethereum generating more.And it can affect the price of native coins of certain projects.*

*But alongside the good things there are also some obstacles.The main one of course is the regulation (or maybe the lack of regulation) around decentralized finance.Plus, because its ambition is to replace banks around the world and even asset managers, it makes sense that we'd see them fight and put it off as much as possible.*

*The many hacks that happen in the field are also not that helpful for mass adoption and it will also be necessary to improve this in the future.*

**Projects worth to watch:**

* *Uniswap (UNI)*
* *THORChain (RUNE)*
* *LIDO DAO (LDO)*

&#x200B;

*That's all for today guys.*

*Do you think there is another sector worth paying attention to for the next bull market? Tell me in the comments*

*Which sector do you believe in the most?*"

[https://blog.marsprotocol.io/blog/outpost-established-mars-deploys-red-bank-on-neutron](https://blog.marsprotocol.io/blog/outpost-established-mars-deploys-red-bank-on-neutron)

&#x200B;

Six months ago, Mars established its first outpost on u/osmosiszone. Today, the protocol truly goes multichain with the launch of its second outpost on Neutron.

&#x200B;

It‚Äôs a great leap forward in the evolution of Mars and Neutron.

&#x200B;

With permissionless interchain queries and accounts, Neutron‚Äôs architecture makes it easy for devs to deploy dapps on Cosmos without needing to launch their own appchains.

&#x200B;

Now, the Red Bank establishes a vital credit primitive and key DeFi building block on the new chain.

&#x200B;

 Neutron‚Äôs also well-positioned to become a hub for liquid staking derivative (LSD) activity in the Cosmos.

&#x200B;

Pending approval by the Martian Council, the Red Bank could add support for key LSDs and radically improve capital efficiency for LSD holders.

&#x200B;

Starting now, 3 tokens are available for borrowing and lending on Neutron:

&#x200B;

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Cosmos Hub $ATOM

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Neutron $NTRN

 A few months ago I was trying to stake my AXLs. i had it on the ethereum blockchain so i had to do a satellite swap to be able to have them on the AXELAR network. before that day I had always used metamask as wallet but since it doesn't support the AXELAR network I had to download Keplr, which means two different wallets with two different seed phrases.  I didn't like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhaving to remember two seed phrases.  then thanks to a friend I discovered XDEFI Wallet, it supports AXELAR and  almost all major blockchains such as Bitcoin, Cosmos, Ethereum, Binance, Solana etc ... this wallet has simplified my life, now I have a single wallet for all my crypto and NFT. all in one place. I no longer need to have 4 or 3 Wallets for each Blockchain that interests me. Let me know if you've ever tried it and what you think. thank you all!! "
