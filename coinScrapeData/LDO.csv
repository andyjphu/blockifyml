"Whales Buy LDO & AAVE, This DAO Token Could Be the Next 10X Crypto",Blockviews,1i7j0eb,2025-01-22 14:05:59,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockviews/comments/1i7j0eb/whales_buy_ldo_aave_this_dao_token_could_be_the/,MammothBattle33,,"üö® Crypto News: Whales shift focus to DAO tokens as retail buzz surrounds AI and meme coins

While the crowd chases trends, whales are making calculated moves on DAO tokens like Lido DAO ($LDO) and Aave ($AAVE). Yesterday, a whale acquired 2.72M $LDO, raising their total holdings to a staggering 5.565M tokens. At $1.90 per token, that‚Äôs a cool $10.5M in $LDO holdings. The market responded with an 8% spike to $1.96 before settling back at $1.90. Despite the volatility, this whale walked away with a neat 4% profit, as the entry price was $1.82.

$AAVE is another DAO token catching whale attention. A recent $750K transfer to cold storage indicates one investor‚Äôs long-term commitment to the platform. Meanwhile, another $AAVE player cashed out $11.3M in profits over two days but still holds 28K $AAVE with unrealized gains exceeding $7M. Even World Liberty Financial has placed $4.7M worth of $AAVE in its portfolio, ranking it among the company‚Äôs top six crypto assets.

The DAO token niche now holds a $40B market cap, with $UNI leading the pack at $7.9B. However, $AAVE is making strides with a $5.4B market cap. For whales, DAO investments don‚Äôt just deliver returns; they offer governance power, allowing them to influence the trajectories of these projects. With decentralization and transparency at their core, DAOs represent the forward march of Web3.

As whales pile into DAO tokens, retail investors have a new opportunity to join the movement. One stand-out in the space is Flockerz ($FLOCK), a fusion of a meme coin and DAO principles. With innovative Vote-to-Earn mechanics, high staking APY, and an engaged community, $FLOCK offers unique incentives for holders. The project has already raised $12.5M during its presale phase, but it‚Äôs coming to an end in just two hours. The flock is about to take flight, but you still have a chance to catch the tailwind.

The rise of DAO tokens highlights the decentralized finance revolution, putting power in the hands of communities. If whales are betting on this next evolution, perhaps it‚Äôs time to consider adding DAOs to your watchlist. Remember, even projects with solid fundamentals require thorough research.

5 Must-Have DeFi Tokens for 2025,CoinsForge,1i51xs3,2025-01-19 11:11:48,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinsForge/comments/1i51xs3/5_musthave_defi_tokens_for_2025/,Dunnoman7,,"In recent years, decentralized finance (DeFi) has taken the cryptocurrency world by storm. As the crypto space evolves, identifying promising tokens becomes critical for investors. This guide provides an in-depth look at some of the most promising DeFi tokens, answering key questions like ""What are the top 5 DeFi tokens?"" and ""Which crypto to buy for 2025?"" Let's explore these tokens and their potential in detail.

# What Are the Top 5 DeFi Tokens?

The DeFi space is characterized by innovation and growth, making it challenging to select the best tokens. However, these five stand out for their robust ecosystems, utility, and potential for future growth:

# 1.¬†$STETH (Lido Staked Ether)

$STETH represents Ethereum staked through Lido Finance, a leading liquid staking platform. With Ethereum‚Äôs transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), staking has become a lucrative option. $STETH allows users to stake ETH while maintaining liquidity, enabling them to use their staked assets across DeFi protocols.

# Why Invest in $STETH?

* Exposure to Ethereum‚Äôs growth.
* Dual earnings from staking rewards and DeFi yields.
* A cornerstone asset for Ethereum-based DeFi strategies.

# 2.¬†$LINK (Chainlink)

$LINK powers the Chainlink network, a decentralized oracle solution that connects smart contracts to real-world data. Chainlink‚Äôs oracles are integral to DeFi, powering platforms like Aave, Synthetix, and Compound.

**Key Features:**

* High demand due to integration with major protocols.
* Use cases beyond DeFi, including gaming and insurance.
* Staking incentives expected to grow as Chainlink evolves.

# 3.¬†$UNI (Uniswap)

$UNI is the governance token of Uniswap, the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) on Ethereum. As a leader in the DEX space, Uniswap has revolutionized token trading through automated market makers (AMMs).

**Why $UNI Matters:**

* Significant market share in the DEX space.
* Governance power in shaping Uniswap‚Äôs future.
* Potential for fee-sharing mechanisms in upcoming updates.

# 4.¬†$AAVE

$AAVE is the native token of the Aave protocol, a decentralized lending platform. Users can lend, borrow, and earn interest without intermediaries. Aave is at the forefront of DeFi‚Äôs lending and borrowing ecosystem.

**Notable Advantages:**

* Innovative features like flash loans.
* Cross-chain compatibility (e.g., Polygon and Avalanche).
* Growing adoption among institutional investors.

# 5.¬†$DAI (MakerDAO‚Äôs Stablecoin)

$DAI is a decentralized, algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. Unlike centralized stablecoins, $DAI is backed by over-collateralized crypto assets, ensuring stability and transparency.

**Why $DAI?**

* Essential for DeFi liquidity pools.
* Preferred stablecoin for decentralized trading.
* Strong backing by MakerDAO‚Äôs governance system.

Analyzing where the majority of ETH is deployed/used.,ethtrader,1huyxb4,2025-01-06 08:25:38,13,0.88,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1huyxb4/analyzing_where_the_majority_of_eth_is/,MasterpieceLoud4931,Analysis,"The more I do research on Ethereum the more I understand its ecosystem is very vast. There are billions of dollars worth of ETH deployed across many different protocols. These protocols point up the diversity of Ethereum's use cases, like staking, lending, bridging, collateralized debt positions. I will break down the top 10 protocols where ETH is most used right now.

I previously wrote a post about the first 5, focusing on the TVL only, so go take a look if you're interested. Let's get into it.

Number 1. Lido (Liquid Staking). $35.227B

As expected Lido dominates the ecosystem, it's the biggest liquid staking protocol and a big contributor to ETH's liquidity.

Number 2. EigenLayer (Restaking). $16.08B

Restaking is getting a lot of traction, and EigenLayer is leading that category. EigenLayer lets people reuse their staked ETH to secure the network.

Number 3. AAVE V3 (Lending). $12.586B

AAVE is one of the biggest players in DeFi, its V3 has a lot of ETH usage. Users supply ETH as collateral to earn yield or borrow assets. AAVE brings attention to Ethereum's strength in decentralized markets.

Number 4. ether.fi Stake (Liquid Restaking). $8.083B

What makes ether.fi different is that it combines liquid staking and restaking.

Number 5. Binance Staked ETH (Liquid Staking). $7.013B

Binance's liquid staking solution attracts both institutional investors and retail, so it's great for adoption. CEXs still play a big role in ETH adoption.

Number 6. MakerDAO (Collateralized Debt Position). $4.915B

If you didn't know this MakerDAO is the pioneer of decentralized stablecoins. MakerDAO helps maintain the stability of DAI while offering a use case for ETH as a store of value. So in my opinion this is one of the most important protocols.

Number 7. Arbitrum Bridge (Chain). $4.326B

L2s thrive on scalability and the Arbitrum Bridge allows ETH to be transferred between the main net and Arbitrum.

Number 8. Base Bridge (Chain). $4.287B

Base Bridge is similar to Arbitrum in terms of ETH usage. Base is gaining a lot of traction at a fast pace.

Number 9. Spark (Lending). $3.642B

Before this research, I confess I didn't know about Spark. Like AAVE, Spark offers lending services with a focus on ETH and related assets.

Number 10. Rocket Pool (Liquid Staking). $2.714B

Even though Rocket Pool has a more decentralized approach to liquid staking, it's nowhere near Lido's dominance.

Summing up, more than half of the ETH in this list is used in staking protocols, which means investors want to earn yield from their ETH while securing the network. Ethereum is becoming more versatile and more innovative, because its protocols are giving people different ways to maximize their ETH holdings.

LDO Price Faces Critical Moment While Lido TVL Nears $40 Billion All-Time High,Blockmandev,1hdk3ti,2024-12-13 14:26:38,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockmandev/comments/1hdk3ti/ldo_price_faces_critical_moment_while_lido_tvl/,MammothBattle33,,"üö® Crypto News: Ethereum-based staking giant Lido is flexing its muscles as its Total Value Locked (TVL) surges 25% in the past 30 days, now sitting at a massive $38.57 billion. With confidence flowing back into the protocol, the TVL is inching closer to its all-time high of $40 billion, a peak last seen in March.

This renewed trust in Lido aligns with a 10% price bump for its native token, $LDO, in the last 24 hours. The buzz might be coming from the Grayscale Lido DAO Trust, opening doors for institutional exposure. But it‚Äôs not all smooth sailing ‚Äî as resistance looms at $2.32, according to on-chain metrics, $LDO‚Äôs price could face turbulence before making any significant leaps.

Indicators like the Awesome Oscillator and MACD are flashing caution signals, hinting at a potential dip to $1.65 unless buying pressure ramps up. However, if optimism continues and Lido hits its all-time TVL high, $LDO could break past the resistance and aim for the $3 mark.

Crypto Investment Weekly (Issue #1): Is Altszn here???,MakeWalletFatAgain,1h6bt5z,2024-12-04 03:59:16,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeWalletFatAgain/comments/1h6bt5z/crypto_investment_weekly_issue_1_is_altszn_here/,AdministrationHot443,,"Hello, everyone! I‚Äôm FatBro ‚Äì a seasoned investor dedicated to ‚Äúmaking wallets fat.‚Äù

Over the years, my investment journey has seen its fair share of ups and downs, yielding a commendable track record. These real experiences have reinforced my belief that ‚ÄúMake Your Wallet Fat‚Äù is not just an empty slogan but a goal everyone can achieve with the right methods.

As someone who has experienced at least three bull and bear cycles, I understand that investing is both a science and an art. In this column, I will candidly share my years of accumulated investment insights and practical experiences from a down-to-earth perspective.

Here, you won‚Äôt find flashy theories but genuine market insights and practical techniques. Let‚Äôs walk steadily on the path of investment and achieve sustained wealth growth together.

**My Investment Philosophy**  
In the cryptocurrency market, many investors fall into the trap of buying high and selling low. They often invest in assets without a comprehensive plan, holding a random assortment of coins and suffering significant losses. This column aims to help investors develop a scientific investment philosophy and master stable investment strategies.

My core investment principles are as follows:

1.¬†**Automated Investing**: Use robotic tools to avoid emotional interference and increase daily passive income.  
2.¬†**Lowering Holding Costs**: Continuously reduce holding costs through strategies like dollar-cost averaging, grid trading, and swing trading, aiming to achieve near-zero costs for some holdings.  
3.¬†**Prioritizing Decentralization**: Avoid the risks of long-term asset storage on centralized platforms by using self-custody and trustless services.  
4.¬†**Compound Growth**: Reinvest stable returns to achieve exponential growth, using the profits to invest in high-risk assets and strategies.  
5.¬†**Avoiding Pure Leverage Speculation**: Use leverage tools only for specific hedging and arbitrage strategies.

**Market Summary for Last Week**  
This past week, BTC reached new highs, approaching the $100,000 mark. Traditional funds, led by ETFs, are increasingly entering the crypto market. SOL also hit a new high mid-week. Meanwhile, ETH continued to fluctuate, reaching a short-term low of 0.0318 against BTC before rebounding more strongly compared to previous weeks. XRP and XLM saw a sharp rise following Trump‚Äôs election and Gensler‚Äôs resignation, which alleviated previous negative sentiment. DOGE remained popular, and by Friday and Saturday, previously stagnant second-tier chains like ADA, ATOM, DOT, AVAX, NEAR, AR, and ICP also performed well, signaling the slow onset of a bullish market.

In a bull market, sudden spikes are common. Be cautious and manage risk‚Äîavoid chasing highs or using excessive leverage. Engage in swing trading with overbought tokens to boost returns and boldly improve your lifestyle, releasing the pent-up consumption desires from the bear market. üòä

After BTC‚Äôs breakthrough, many altcoins will likely see a wave of follow-up gains. Focus on tokens with strong fundamentals and modest rebound momentum for potential participation.

**Personal Grid Trading Review Last Week**

**#LDO Grid**  
‚Ä¢ Ran for 10 days and 19 hours in the range of $1.05‚Äì$1.404. Grid APY reached 254%, yielding $250‚Äì$350 daily, with total profits of $2,600.  
‚Ä¢ Strategy: Bought 20,000 LDO at $1.10. LDO‚Äôs stable fluctuations made it a solid grid trading candidate.

https://preview.redd.it/cphy2lrdqs4e1.png?width=1870&format=png&auto=webp&s=01a4fc9c11846827b97d0f9df587f0a049aae74a

**#PENDLE Grid**  
‚Ä¢ Grid targeting ‚Äúsell high‚Äù Pendle.  
‚Ä¢ Since I purchased these Pendle tokens at a low price, and the price had nearly reached my sell target, I established a grid in the¬†range: $4.85‚Äì$6.30, when Pendle was around¬†**$4.5**. This means no sales occur below $4.85.  
‚Ä¢ Grid APY: \~140%, earning $100‚Äì$200 daily. Over 33 days, generated $4,000 from an initial $30,000 investment, achieving over 10% monthly returns.

https://preview.redd.it/50dthhahqs4e1.jpg?width=1272&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=821d4ae3b7beca148dd67948939b5497283cf7ab

**#NEAR Grid**  
‚Ä¢ I am a long-term NEAR holder, with a significant portion of my holdings staked natively on NEAR. Over the years, my staking and grid trading activities have effectively reduced my NEAR asset cost to nearly zero. I periodically withdraw a portion of NEAR to execute¬†**Sell High**¬†grid operations to boost returns, which has also helped me develop a habit of regular cash-outs rather than letting an asset remain idle indefinitely.  
‚Ä¢ Current grid: $4.75‚Äì$6.5. APY: 131%. Yielded $2,900 from 4,000 NEAR without additional USDC investment‚Äîthis was purely aimed at selling.¬†

During this price rally, the strategy not only allowed me to hold onto my tokens without selling too early but also earned me an additional¬†**$2,900**¬†in profit. Stay tuned for the performance of this strategy in the upcoming week!

https://preview.redd.it/ongyuugkqs4e1.png?width=1846&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4549b3908365fa025aa3ca38690bc98a37e7ae7

**#APE Grid**  
‚Ä¢ I am an¬†**APE staking miner**, using a combination of¬†**BAYC**¬†and¬†**MAYC**¬†for staking, which provides an annualized return of¬†**50% in APE tokens**. This translates to several thousand APE tokens as monthly rewards. My strategy is to claim the APE rewards monthly and use them for¬†**bullish grid trading**.  
‚Ä¢ I set up a grid with a range of¬†**$0.97‚Äì$1.25**¬†for 3 days, with the initial price at around¬†**$1.1**. The grid was approaching the upper boundary because I intended to sell anyway. If it exceeds the upper range, I plan to close the grid, meaning my income will include both the¬†**price difference profit**¬†and¬†**grid profit**.

Currently, the¬†**APY**¬†stands at¬†**270%**, and the grid has already generated¬†**$100**¬†in income within 3 days.

https://preview.redd.it/4i5uhd3oqs4e1.png?width=1850&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad1c3bcafc5fc1708efd1d469a1d231be34c341

**#EIGEN Grid**  
‚Ä¢ Airdrop-based asset. I have long-term confidence in and prefer to hold rather than sell. After receiving the airdrop, I set up a¬†**$3.95‚Äì$8 grid**¬†to capitalize on the volatility from the new token issuance and generate high-range fluctuation profits. However, this approach did not yield great results initially.

‚Ä¢ As EIGEN entered a¬†**$3‚Äì$4 sweet spot of price fluctuation**, I established multiple grids, which generated decent returns. Since EIGEN is an airdropped asset, early stages often face selling pressure, leading to potential price declines. To address this, setting up¬†**low-level protection orders**¬†to safeguard against outliers and further reduce the average holding cost is essential.

Throughout this process, I established several protection orders and performed effective swing trades and grid operations to consistently lower the average cost of holding EIGEN. This strategic approach has been critical in managing risk while maximizing profits.

https://preview.redd.it/6f2lg0lsqs4e1.png?width=2432&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ae93ea18e2c8a61420c319e6004c46f2ce6eadc

Here‚Äôs a specific example:

After EIGEN dropped below¬†**$2.5**, I triggered a¬†**protection order**¬†and acquired¬†**1,000 EIGEN**¬†at¬†**$2.2**. I then immediately set up a new grid with a range of¬†**$2.1‚Äì$2.5**. Although EIGEN quickly rebounded, and the grid only lasted for¬†**9 hours**, the presence of the protection order allowed me to earn¬†**$180**¬†during this swing.

This significantly contributed to lowering my overall grid holding cost. At this point, my¬†**$2.5‚Äì$3 grid**¬†re-entered the ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù and began generating returns again. This approach of alternating between protection orders and targeted grids has been highly effective in maximizing profits while minimizing risk.

**Recommendations for the Upcoming Week**

‚Ä¢¬†**Market Volatility Anticipation**: This week, significant market fluctuations are expected. Assets that haven‚Äôt experienced recent gains may see compensatory increases. Particularly, Ethereum (ETH) warrants attention in the coming week.

‚Ä¢¬†**Profit Realization and Neutral Grid Strategy**: For those with substantial profits, consider selling a portion of your assets at current highs to convert them into USD. Implement a neutral grid strategy with a ¬±20% range to capitalize on market volatility. If the market undergoes a significant correction, this approach allows you to repurchase previously sold tokens, effectively combining grid and swing trading profits. In the event of continued upward fluctuations, this strategy enhances overall profit-taking.

‚Ä¢¬†**Portfolio Rebalancing Towards Undervalued Assets**: This is an opportune time to rebalance your portfolio by shifting profits from overperforming assets to those that haven‚Äôt yet appreciated. This tactic can effectively manage potential drawdowns and increase overall returns. For instance, if you hold Bitcoin (BTC), consider reallocating a portion to Ethereum (ETH).

**Other Opportunities**

I recently attended Ethereum‚Äôs Devcon, where the community‚Äôs entrepreneurial spirit and technological innovation were truly impressive. The thriving Ethereum ecosystem continues to drive significant advancements in blockchain technology.

For a comprehensive overview of Ethereum‚Äôs latest roadmap, you can refer to the official Ethereum website:

In my search for undervalued opportunities within the Ethereum ecosystem, I‚Äôve identified two projects that, while currently under the radar, have the potential for significant future growth.

**1. Puffer Finance (PUFFER):**

The Ethereum community has long grappled with liquidity fragmentation issues stemming from its rollup strategy. While solutions like shared sequencers and intents have been proposed, I believe that combining Based Rollup with preconfirmation offers a more elegant, on-chain resolution that enhances Ethereum‚Äôs economic model. However, progress in this area faces certain challenges.

Puffer Finance is among the few projects exploring this avenue. With a valuation below $300 million and a market cap under $30 million, it can be considered a leveraged asset on Ethereum. Should Based Rollup technology achieve a breakthrough, Puffer‚Äôs market cap could see substantial growth.

**Investment Strategy:**

‚Ä¢¬†**Entry Point:**¬†Consider purchasing 50% of your intended position at the current price of approximately $0.28.

‚Ä¢¬†**Risk Management:**¬†Anticipate a potential downside of up to 30%.

‚Ä¢¬†**Scaling In:**¬†Implement a strategy to add 25% more to your position with every 15% price decline.

**2. Lido (LDO):**

Lido‚Äôs valuation appears misaligned with its strong fundamentals, likely due to the SEC‚Äôs lawsuit against ConsenSys, which has impacted sentiment. As a key liquidity provider in the Ethereum ecosystem, Lido plays a crucial role. With the SEC undergoing leadership changes and the recent election of President Trump, there‚Äôs a possibility that these legal challenges may be resolved in the upcoming cycle, allowing Lido‚Äôs valuation to return to its true potential.

Additionally, staked ETFs are poised to attract mainstream capital into Ethereum over the medium term. As a provider of staked ETH liquidity, Lido stands to benefit from this influx.

**Investment Strategy:**

‚Ä¢¬†**Entry Point:**¬†Purchase LDO at the current price.

‚Ä¢¬†**Grid Trading:**¬†Establish a grid ranging from the current price minus 15% to plus 30%.

‚Ä¢¬†**Reinvestment:**¬†Reinvest the profits from this strategy back into LDO to compound returns.

**Weekly Tip: How to Select Assets for Grid Trading**

‚Ä¢¬†**Choose High-Quality Assets**: Select assets that you are willing to hold long-term, even if the price drops beyond the grid range.

‚Ä¢¬†**Pick Volatile Assets**: Look for assets with good price volatility, ideally with significant divergence between long and short positions.

Due to space limitations, I will later create a comprehensive video series covering asset selection, timing strategies, grid configurations, and the broader role of grids in investment strategies. Stay tuned!

**FAQ: Is Grid Trading Less Profitable Than Holding?**

‚Ä¢¬†**Grid Trading vs. Holding**:

Grid trading capitalizes on volatility for returns, while holding assets relies on trend prediction to generate profits. Neither approach is inherently better; it depends on the market environment and trading habits.

Markets are often in a state of fluctuation. You might have experienced buying a coin hoping for a rise, only to see it stagnate for an extended period. Grid strategies can yield steady returns in such conditions, making the wait more rewarding. For example, a grid strategy with an annualized return of 200% (as many of mine achieve) can theoretically recover the full cost of assets within 180 days (without compounding). With compounding, the time required is even shorter.

‚Ä¢¬†**Timing Challenges**:

It‚Äôs normal to struggle with timing the perfect sell point. Grid trading enforces disciplined investment planning, preventing greed from missing sell points in bull markets and fear from missing buy points in bear markets. This eliminates the randomness of impulsive trading.

By asking yourself,¬†*Why am I buying this coin? When should I sell? What‚Äôs my target?*¬†Grid trading replaces aimless investing‚Äîwhich often feels like an addiction‚Äîwith structured habits. Over time, you‚Äôll avoid the frustration of holding numerous assets without feeling you‚Äôve made meaningful gains.

**Tool Recommendation**

I use the decentralized exchange¬†**DeGate**¬†for grid trading:¬†[https://degate.com/](https://degate.com/?utm_source=fatbro_1_EN)

DeGate is a zero-knowledge proof-based order book DEX, providing a trading experience close to centralized exchanges while maintaining self-custody. Its¬†**zero maker fees**¬†are especially beneficial for grid traders.

LDO‚Äôs 8% Surge Can‚Äôt Halt $53 Million Exit from Futures Market,Blockmandev,1h08oaa,2024-11-26 05:20:04,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockmandev/comments/1h08oaa/ldos_8_surge_cant_halt_53_million_exit_from/,MammothBattle33,,"üö® Crypto News: LDO, the native token of Ethereum staking giant Lido DAO, is making waves after an 8% price surge in just 24 hours. This rally hasn‚Äôt gone unnoticed; trading volume skyrocketed by 58%, hitting an all-time high at $670M. Looks like the bulls are charging!

Interestingly though, open interest in LDO futures has plunged by 50%, now standing at $52M. Futures traders seem to be cashing in on those juicy gains, signaling profit-taking in full swing. Remember, when open interest drops during a price hike, it suggests traders are closing out positions, even as demand pushes prices higher.

On the charts, LDO just broke out of a descending channel it‚Äôs been stuck in since January. With bullish momentum picking up, there‚Äôs chatter about the token potentially climbing to the $2.09 mark‚Äîits highest level since August. But keep an eye on the $1.56 support level, because if the bears take over, we could see it tumble back to $1.08.

Are we watching LDO gear up for a multi-month high or just another short-lived rally? Time will tell, but the network activity and trading volumes are painting an exciting picture.
