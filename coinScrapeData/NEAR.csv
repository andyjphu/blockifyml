"15 ping? I was playing ""90 Ping"" FC Seasons and the gameplay felt more responsive with less delayed smh UFL early versions played better minus exploits.",UFLTheGame,1i9xigm,2025-01-25 16:26:57,1,1.0,0,https://v.redd.it/k0m6o89rj7fe1,flukeykent,,"The copium/fanboying in this community is part of the problem. It's like gamers nowadays just have low standards. Why would devs listen to gamers who are impressed by mediocrity. This game feels like it's still in beta! This why can't have nice things üòÇ I want this game to be better than anything EA make that's the annoying thing. But I don't know how competent these devs or their testers are.

I don't want to hear how EA has been doing this for years blah blah. *You don't need a bunch of years to fix this game.* You can fix it within a few weeks by reversing things to an early version. Then tuning the fundamentals like passing, shooting, defending. You get them in the sweet spot aka Fun which the game was already in at a few points. Then they can spend their time fixing bugs, polishing these weird animations and dealing with content. What you don't do is do big changes that ruin things that were fine/fun to begin with. I don't know. They need to get rid of the yes men game testers or YouTubers or whoever they're listening to over everyone. 

The earlier versions of this game played better. They just needed to nerf the exploits. Not nerf the whole game into the ground. They went off track with the last update and then credit to them they got back on track. But they just went back and did what they should have done expect the made the game slightly worse because it's less fun now. But it's better than the old update so people think there's this big improvement. They're Jedi mind F'ing these fanboys. Well they nearly got me too until I realised what they did üòÇ"
"A Heavy Past: Struggles with Guilt, Love, and Seeking a Fresh Start",offmychest,1i9xigb,2025-01-25 16:26:57,1,0.99,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i9xigb/a_heavy_past_struggles_with_guilt_love_and/,Valuable_Turtle_8,,"In 2020/21, I decided to step away from my friend group, which was entirely focused on drug use. Instead, I reconnected with my old school friend, Tom, from primary school‚Äîwho used to sell us weed. We hit it off well, and since he was making money dealing drugs, I found it intriguing and wanted to get involved too.

Tom slowly introduced me to the trade, teaching me the basics‚Äîprices, types of drugs, and more. Naturally, I experimented with various substances, gaining plenty of experience because we were doing something every single day. When your best friend is a drug dealer, you inevitably become one too.

Over 2.5 years, I built up a larger sales network and made good money. It was an exhilarating time; we thought nothing could stop us. I‚Äôd go to work during the day, deal drugs after work, make lots of money, and live a luxurious life every day. Weekends were spent driving fancy cars to the casino, where money was no object.

Of course, all my drugs came from Tom, and we became best friends in the process. He had his customers, I had mine, and everyone knew each other. There were ups and downs in terms of drug consumption, and I never really thought about the impact this lifestyle might have on my parents in the near future‚Äîbut more on that later.

In the summer of 2023, I met my girlfriend, Lizzy. I had never felt such a strong connection to another person as I did with her. We were the perfect team. She showed me what true love is, made me laugh, and confided in me about her difficult past. We supported each other immensely.

Naturally, Lizzy noticed the drugs and money and often told me to stop before we ended up getting arrested. Tom and I brushed off her concerns, thinking we were untouchable. Lizzy, however, just wanted a normal future with me.

Over the following weeks and months, I spent more time with Lizzy and less with Tom. We only met up for deals so I could sell to my customers and pay him back. Though Tom and I still hung out occasionally, our partying together reduced significantly because I preferred relaxing evenings with Lizzy and enjoying a normal life funded by the money from drug sales.

At the end of 2023, Tom was arrested by the police during a drug pickup with one of our associates. That day hit me hard‚ÄîI missed Tom and the other guy a lot. We had built such a strong bond through all our experiences together.

Lizzy found out about the arrest and knew by then that I was making money from drugs too. She immediately urged me to stop, saying neither she nor my parents could bear it if I ended up in prison for years.

Although I felt uneasy, I couldn‚Äôt resist the temptation to keep earning money and continued dealing drugs secretly, sourcing them from new suppliers. I maintained close contact with Tom through official letters and unofficial phone messages from prison. I even visited him, and we naively thought the police didn‚Äôt have much evidence and openly discussed things.

However, every conversation at the prison was recorded and reviewed. The police wanted me to maintain my contacts and continue dealing to gather more evidence.

I hid all of this from Lizzy, letting her believe I had stopped dealing.

In early 2024, I was arrested by the police and placed in custody because there was sufficient evidence against me and others. The associate who was arrested with Tom had testified against me, naming my clients, addresses, and providing incriminating information about me. He was released for cooperating, while I was taken into custody.

It hurt deeply to know that someone I considered a friend had turned on me. However, the worst part was the pain I caused Lizzy and my family. I wouldn‚Äôt wish that kind of suffering on anyone.

The day of my arrest, I was in shock. My job, family, girlfriend, and entire life were on the line.

The police wanted me to cooperate, but after I refused, I was sent to prison. Lizzy and my parents wrote me letters. Lizzy wasn‚Äôt allowed to visit me, but my parents could.

This mentally taxing time will stay with me forever, as I faced two options:

	1.	Spend several years in prison, leaving my parents and girlfriend behind but protecting my friends by not testifying.

	2.	Testify against my entire drug network, including my best friends and clients, many of whom I had strong social connections with.

My parents wanted the latter to protect me, but I struggled internally because either choice would hurt people.

In the end, I chose to make a clean break from my criminal past by fully exposing all drug dealings and everyone involved. I implicated myself and many others in the process. The interrogations lasted over 20 hours in total, and it was incredibly difficult to testify, but I reminded myself who and what future I was doing it for.

When I was released and reunited with Lizzy and my family, the relief was overwhelming. But I was haunted by the guilt of testifying against my best friend and others, not to mention the enemies I made along the way.

My time with Lizzy was amazing, but I started focusing on clearing my mind and doing a lot of exercise, as the weight of my decisions burdened me daily. Despite believing I did the right thing, I struggled with the aftermath.

In early 2025, I broke up with Lizzy. It was probably a stupid decision, even though we had been arguing over small things and she sometimes brought up my past. I still love her, but we have different visions for life and are very different people.

The highs and lows brought us so close, making it even harder to part ways. She was my other half, and now I feel like loneliness is consuming me.

On top of that, I‚Äôm receiving threatening messages from former clients I testified against. Encounters with people from my past or just thinking about what they might do to me trigger panic attacks and make me feel like I‚Äôm slipping into depression.

I don‚Äôt know where I stand or what my future holds‚Äîwhether everything I did was a mistake or what I should have done differently.

Still, there are moments when I breathe deeply and remind myself that my past made me who I am today.

I definitely need a new place to start a fresh life. There are too many memories in the air here.

There‚Äôs so much more to this story and so many people I haven‚Äôt mentioned. I just wanted to lay it all out and get it off my chest‚Ä¶"

So you're wondering what the difference between a note and a card is: Here's an (actual) ELI5!,Anki,1i9xhbx,2025-01-25 16:25:27,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/1i9xhbx/so_youre_wondering_what_the_difference_between_a/,38ren,Fluff,"You can think of ""note"" as a closet full of clothes. A ""card"" is just one outfit you put together using those clothes. 

Just like your closet holds a bunch of individual clothing items, your Anki notes hold a bunch of individual fields. Just like you might put together a t shirt, jeans, and socks as one outfit to wear, an Anki card puts together certain fields from your note. 

Put another way: Your closet stores all your clothes, and an outfit is some of those clothes arranged the way you like, right? An Anki note stores all your fields, and your card is those fields arranged a certain way too. **This is why a single note can make so many cards.** 

This post isn't meant to sound patronizing, I've been using Anki for nearly 3 years and the difference between a note and a card was never intuitive to me. I read the Anki Manual, watched YouTube videos and scrolled through this sub and it just wasn't clicking for some reason. So here is the explanation I came up with that is perhaps overly simplified (ELI5 fr) but hopefully helpful for some at least. "

I know I'm damn good at what I do but I've never sold anything nearly quite this expensive. Being fairly new to being a husband and a father, I am of course interested in the prospect of making more money.

But money isn't the most important thing to me. My mental health, my work-life balance, and financial/job stability is of the utmost importance.

I'm reaching out because I have a good job right now but I'm not happy there and the schedule isn't very family-friendly, but it is stable work. But by all accounts, after talking to experienced car salesmen, I can make a significant amount of more money selling cars, still do what I love, and have a more family-friendly schedule.

I've already been told that I have the job if I want it and there won't even be an interview. The business is owned by a local and well-known family and I have a great relationship with the GM. I've avoided the opportunity for a while because of the stigma around car salesmen. I am extremely ethical, honest, and transparent when it comes to sales and I have to believe in the product.

With that being said, what is the stuff that a GM or experienced car salesman won't tell me heading in? Because it sounds too good to be true.

Youngest sibling,venting,1i9xgr3,2025-01-25 16:24:44,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1i9xgr3/youngest_sibling/,SameEntrepreneur2827,,"Before I start this I‚Äôd like to make a disclaimer I‚Äôm very fortunate to be in the position I‚Äôm in and I also understand middle and older siblings have struggles as well; I‚Äôm not denying that.

So basically I just feel lonely as the youngest child. I‚Äôm the youngest out of my whole entire extended family which makes things slightly worse. I often find people don‚Äôt treat me like my age. Honestly I don‚Äôt even think my extended family even know my age despite knowing me for years. I have proof of this as one family member thought I was 13-14 when I‚Äôm in fact 16 turning 17 this year.
I love my dad but to be completely honest I hate how he treats me like I‚Äôm twelve years old half the time yet he treats my sister (18 f) like an 18 year old. I do partly think it‚Äôs because my sister and I are very different and she‚Äôs more of the stereotypical 18 year old whereas I‚Äôm no interested in things like alcohol or going out to parties (I mean not like I get invited to big house parties anyway) but we‚Äôre just very different in how we present.
I also hate how life events feel less special because your sibling has gone through it first so it‚Äôs not a big deal anymore. For example it was a big thing when my sister first got a car for her 17th birthday and she doesn‚Äôt like driving so I‚Äôll most likely have her car instead. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm grateful for that but I know I‚Äôm not getting the big surprise of a car when I‚Äôm actually quite educated on cars. It used to be a hyper-fixation of mine and I know a lot about them (which a lot of people may not know about me).
What also hurts is that most adult in my life who I haven‚Äôt seen in a while or don‚Äôt have close contact to only ever ask about my sister. A key example of this is that my mum is semi-friends with a lady who owns a pottery painting place and she only ever asks about my sister (despite the fact I‚Äôm right there and quote obviously my mothers daughter). She never asked about me.
Another example of this is that my aunt and uncle use to be closer to us however over the years we‚Äôve become more distant and it seems they‚Äôre grieving the person my sister used to be rather than me. Maybe that‚Äôs why they treat me like a child? I don‚Äôt know. 
Also the loneliness of being the youngest child actually sucks sometimes. Every single friend my parents have only have children who are older than me and are a similar age to my sister. They grew up together while I‚Äôm still going through what they‚Äôve been through. It makes it near impossible to relate to them. They also probably prefer my sister because of it but I can‚Äôt really blame them. "

The crowd went wild when Coldplay started at exactly around 8 pm. Yellow was amazing as usual, sky full of stars was my favourite of the set. I loved every second of most of the songs except a few songs I genuinely didn‚Äôt know the lyrics for. It was an amazing experience and I‚Äôm sure tomorrow will be awesome!

This experience would have been up another level if they performed Yellow, Paradise or Sky full of stars once again because the crowd shouted ‚Äúonce more‚Äù really loud but they stuck to their set and that‚Äôs perfectly okay. And I believe the crowd near the stage had a better, immersive experience but they probably had to stand for a long time. Trade offs.

People wrongly compare cryptos with Gold, cause they are both speculative assets but gold :
1- is Limitated
2- has other uses than making Money.
3- Is real and you can touch It.
In my opinion cryptos are more like penny-stocks and packets of sub-prime.
I dont know of everyone Is being fooled or i am wrong, but the only way cryptos are not going t√≤ crush Is that they'll become the currency in an hypotetical metaverse or web 3.0.

Also, if we hold him upright like while sitting for example he pushes down and tries to stand on our knees. He pushes all his weight into his feet. He is way too small too stand given he can't even sit unassisted, but it's like we have to fight him everytime his feet come near a surface.

Choosing where to save money for an upcoming payment on Student Loan,fidelityinvestments,1i9xehr,2025-01-25 16:21:58,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fidelityinvestments/comments/1i9xehr/choosing_where_to_save_money_for_an_upcoming/,Organic-Psychology50,,"Hi ‚Äî I‚Äôm hoping to get a second opinion / sense check of my strategy. I graduated last Spring, so I‚Äôve been working full-time for a little over 6 months. My marginal federal tax rate is 22%.

I will be receiving my tax return in the next couple of weeks (I e-filed early). I currently have two student loan balances. Loan A is $5,500 @ 2.5% interest, while Loan B is $6,500 & 3.5% interest.

I currently only have my savings in a HYSA account that as of today pays 3.8% interest. 

When I receive my tax return, my idea is to move $6,500 of my savings in to my Fidelity cash management account and put the money in FDLXX, which currently has a 4.9% 1-year yield. Would I be correct that my post-tax return on FDLXX should be ~3.8% (4.9% * (1-.22))?

I believe this would be a potentially smart way to put some money away today to collect the spread between my ~3.8% return from FDLXX minus the interest on Loan B of 3.5% interest. Ultimately if yields dropped after the year I would pay off the loan, or if they did not I would continue saving. Would love to hear any feedback or opinions of better options.

I‚Äôm planning to ride Loan A out for much longer as I‚Äôm assuming at least in the near-term I can always beat 2.5% return in the market with HYSA/CD/Money Market Funds."

April 3rd 689

Another quiet morning during the blockading of port Lynch by Arrun. The crew Abord the Alliance Flag ship the Esmeralda prepares to continue its mission of bombarding the port into submission with the smaller Corvette class and Galley Class ships with it.

Thats when suddenly a war horn rings out in the silent morning air.

The ships lookout reports to Captain Aurthor Prat of the Esmeralda and Admiral of the Alliances Blockading fleet a force of 50 Saderan warships are closing in.

Aurthor Prat quickly orders his sailors and the fleet into battle formation as the stage is set for the first battle and Naval battle of the war. 23 Alliance ships vs 50 Saderan ships.

**Naval strategies by both sides leading up to the battle.**

Both sides wanted to maximize their advantages and minimize their weakness to successfully combat their enemies in battle.

On the Saderan side Admiral Fabian Florence sought to utilize the Saderan navies numerical superiority against what they saw as backwards barbarians and defeat them in one decisive naval battle however Admiral Grau Tiberius sought too instead have the Saderan navy perform raiding actions across the Eastern Alliance coastline and engage in smaller battles to slowly wear out the Eastern Alliances navy.

On the Eastern Alliance side General Juan Septimus sought to dive the alliance navy. One side would engage the Saderans in a series of naval battles to score one crushing blow after another utilizing superior ships while a smaller portion began blockading the Saderan cost to cut off Naval communications. 

[Admiral Juan Septimus of the Eastern Alliance.](https://preview.redd.it/vmboreo6n6fe1.png?width=754&format=png&auto=webp&s=24b7b6047430c5a3ab003f0e9e456a5aa3257f66)

Another strategy Juan advocated was a fighting retreat tactic against Sadera in naval battles to preserve as many ships as possible. The loss of a Man of war class ship would be a devasting blow to the Alliance and the loss of such an expensive class of ship was to be avoided at all costs.



**Early Naval Campaign, the battle of port Lynch, and the battle of Cape Wannoa**

The Naval campaign of the war began that March as on March 6th the Alliance navy took off. The Navy was divided in 3 squadrons. The Leviathan Sea Squadron made up of 60 ships was tasked with Blockading Saderan Northeastern ports. The South Ocean Squadron made up of 27 ships and under the personal command of Juan Septimus was to attempt to snake up pass the Vassal state peninsula and blockade the ports of the Elbe and Mudwan as well as launch raids. The Final Squadron the Avion Sea Squadron made up of 23 ships and led by Vice Admiral Aurthor Prat a seasoned naval commander was ordered to blockade the Port city of Lynch which was the only port in the Saderan province of Avion. 

  
Aurthor Prats squadron was the first to go into action as it arrived at port Lynch on March the 15th with a speed so surprising the local Sadera naval force of 10 Galley's in the nearby area weren't able to get to the port in time to prevent the enviable. Instead of attempting to make battle with a numerical superior opponent the Saderan naval squadron alerted the Saderan naval command.

Saderan naval command was sluggish to respond to the rapid naval advance of an enemy they viewed as lowly barbarians so they kicked the can down the road for around 2 weeks trying to process what was happening. The only person in Saderan admiralty to respond properly was Admiral Grau who cobbled up a fleet of 50 Warships among them 3 Tribute Class and 7 Emperor Class and took off for Port Lynch on March 27th.

  
Meanwhile Admiral Juan Septimus changed the course of his South Ocean Squadron and headed directly for the major Saderan port of Deahis and Propter in an attempt to gain control of the blue sea, blockade the 2 ports and to threaten the Empires capital of Sadera from the sea. 

However, as the South Ocean Fleet made its way towards the 2 largest ports of Sadera the fleet of Admiral Grau or now renamed Fleet Molt headed forward to engage the fleet of Aurthor Prat at Port Lynch.

April 3rd 689

Another quiet morning during the blockading of port Lynch by Arrun. The crew Abord the Alliance Flag ship the Esmeralda prepares to continue its mission of bombarding the port into submission with the smaller Corvette class and Galley Class ships with it.

Thats when suddenly a war horn rings out in the silent morning air.

The ships lookout reports to Captain Aurthor Prat of the Esmeralda and Admiral of the Alliances Blockading fleet a force of 50 Saderan warships are closing in.

Aurthor Prat quickly orders his sailors and the fleet into battle formation. At an instant the sailors of the Esmerald head to their positions as well as the sailors in the rest of the ships.

Meanwhile on the Flagship of the Admiral Grau the Conquest, the order was given for the battle standard to be raised on the sails which is was causing all the other ships in his fleet to follow in suit.

As his fleet got into attack formation to punch into the Alliance fleet, he made a speech to encourage them for the upcoming battle. The speech was projected across the fleet using a listeners stone.

""Sailors and soldiers of Fleet molt, the time has come to punish the enemies of Sadera once more. The empire shall be counting on you to deliver us the heads of the enemies to be lain on the feet of the emperor as a testament to our great victory. Victory means sharing glory that will go down in history as the finest naval victory in our empire's history. Let this day become a great tale that shall go down in our history. Long live the empire! Long live the emperor!""-Admiral Grau Tiberius. 

  
At that very moment the population of port Lynch awakened to the sound of their savior's war horns as the Saderan fleet had arrived to put an end to the blockade.

The Garrasion and the people of the port crowded around the walls to watch the naval engagement about to take place. 

On his part Admiral Prat knowing that combat was inevitable organized the fleet into a tightly packed formation to provide support and also like Admiral Grau gave a speak to encourage the sailors under his command.

""Gentlemen battle and death is inevitable, but I expect valor and courage from you. Never has our flag fallen to the Saderans and it won't fall today. I assure you that as long as I live our battle standard shall never fall into the hands of the enemy. If I die my officers shall know how to fulfill their duties to the end. Long live the Alliance!""- Admiral Aurthor Prat.

It was 4:30 in the afternoon and as both fleets began to close in the fire shots were fired as a Saderan ballista with a fire arrows splashed into the water nearly hitting the Alliance corvette the Tempest. Author Prat at this moment ordered 2 Corvettes led by the Tempest to escort the 5 transport ships in the fleet away from combat to prevent any valuable supplies from being sunk.

  
The Esmerald the flag ship of the Avion sea fleet and a man of war class was the first alliance ship to open fire unleashing a full broadside of cannon fire at the Saderan Galley's. Having never encountered gun powdered weaponry before the Saderan Galley's were caught off guard. The Saderan Galley the August was sunk immediately as the cannon balls of the 6 guns on the right side of the Esmerald punched into the hull. The Galley went down and took with it its entire crew of 300 or so sailors and enslaved rowers.

Following their flag ships example the Alliance Galley classes also opened fired at full broadside sinking a further 1 Galley and damaging 3. Lacking the range of the Man of war class the Galley class ships in the Alliance fleet missed most of their targets. 

At 5 pm the Saderan fleet spilt in two at orders of Admiral Grau to cut off and corner the outnumbered Alliance vessels and get into ramming range. Several of the Saderan vessels were also responding to the broadsides of ballista and cannon projectiles of then Avion Sea fleet with their own Trebuchets and enchanted ballista projectiles.

Seeing that the Saderan fleet was intending to encircle his Aurthor Prat relayed orders for his fleet to sail Easter wards to avoid themselves from being cut off. While the withdrawal was in place Author Prat made his ship take the brunt of the Saderan attack personally covering the retreat while also damaging a further 2 Saderan Galleys.

However, things begin to go for the worst when a well-placed Saderan trebuchet projectile slammed into the deck of the Esmerald Damaging the ship.

Meanwhile Admiral Grau ordered his second in command Admiral Garvus to pursue the Corvettes and Transport ships fleeing the battle with his Galley's and Emperor Class ship the Glory while bulk of the Saderan fleet would confront of the Esmerald as it covered its fellow ships retreat.

Like that the bulk of the Saderan fleet began to cut the distance between them and the Esmerald as the Esmerald unleashed broadside after broadside of Cannon fire forcing several ships to retreat to avoid being damaged while also sinking another galley.

By 6 pm the Saderans fleets attempts to get into ramming distance of the Esmerald had failed as the lone Man of War Class ship and the Saderan fleet engaged in a ranged duel. Aurthor Prat had by this point succeeded in buying time for the rest of his fleets escape so he piloted his ship the Esmerald to begin to break off from the long-range duel and to join the rest of the retreating fleet. However, as the Esmerald retreated it was hit again this time by an enchanted ballista projectile which destroyed the mast of the ship and killed several sailors slowing down the ships retreat as the main Saderan fleet moved in for the kill.

Deciding that combat had gone on for too long Admiral Grau moved his Emperor class flag ship directly towards the Esmerald to ram it. Grau's ship the conquest launched itself at the Esmerald at full speed. Admiral Prat seeing the Conquest heading straight for it order his gunners to target the ship and tried to steer his ship out of the wall of the incoming conquest however the conquest got their first ramming its prow directly into the Esmerald's hull before firing its Ballistaes at point blank range slaughtering several of the Esmerald's gunners and crew. 

Seeing the situation unravel but determined to fight to the end Captain Aurthor Prat gave the order to bord the Conquest as he led 60 sailors over the deck and onto the Galley beginning a melee on board the deck of the conquest.

The outnumbered Alliance soldiers and their Admiral hacked their way through the Galley leaving behind 54 dead Saderans before being stopped before they could overtake the command deck and in a sharp Melee Aurthor Prat was killed and beheaded and the rest of the borders killed.

After the failed boarding attempt the Conquest pulled out of its ramming of the Esmerald and shot fire arrows into the Man of War class ship lighting it on fire and incinerating any remaining crew as the ship went down with all hands still firing its cannons even as it burned.

 

[The Esmerald going down in the distance.](https://preview.redd.it/lx3py9t7d7fe1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=919a296b209176c041eec77ac00394a61389bcca)

The battle of Port Lynch was over and ended in a Decisive Saderan victory. However, while the battle of Port Lynch was raging at the same time the second Naval battle of the war began.

The 16 Ships under Admiral Grau's second in command had caught up to the 3 corvettes and the 5 Transport ships fleeing the battle starting the battle of Cape Wonnoa. 

While outclassed and outnumbered the Alliance corvettes had 2 advantages over the Saderan ships. They were fasted and they could go in shallow water.

Captain Carlos Camell of the Tempest led his small fleet as close to the cost as possible while covering the transport vessels by unleashing salvos of Ballista bolts from the corvettes.

Grau's second in command attempted and failed to sink the tempest as every time it got into ramming distant the smaller ship was easily outmaneuvered it. This game of cat an mouse continued until the tides turned as the overconfident Sadera fleet fell right into Carlos's plan.

By the time the Sadera's realizes it, it was to late. 8 of the 16 Sadera ships including the Glory Crashed into the underwater costal rocks shattering the bottom of their hulls leading to extensive damage. 

With half the Saderan fleet stuck in the submerged rocks and sinking the tempest and the 2 other corvettes turned around and opened fired a full broad side at the Stuck and sinking Saderan ships. The Saderan ships that were still in safe waters could do nothing but watch from a distance as the Corvettes slowly picked off their comrades one by one unable to intervene out of fear of meeting the same fate. 

Seeing the emerging slaughter in an unexpected act Vice Admiral Garvus hosted a white flag surrendering his Emperor Class ship the Glory to Captain Carlos Camell of the tempest.

The Tempest and the other 2 corvettes stopped their attacks on the other stuck ships and accepted the surrender taking the entire crew of the glory prisoner before leaving with the Transports ending the battle in a humiliating Saderan defeat.

  
As night fell the two battles of Port Lynch and Cape Wannoa ended. The Saderans had won a strategic victory at Port Lynch while the Alliance a tactical victory at cape Wannoa. 

At the battle of port Lynch 456 Alliance sailors were killed and 1 ship sunk and 3 Damaged. Most of the dead coming from the Esmerald while the Saderans lost 578 sailors killed, 5 ships sunk, and 6 ships Damaged.

At Cape Wannoa the Saderans lost 389 sailors killed and 4 ships sunk and 5 damaged while the alliance only had 1 ship damaged and 23 Sailors killed. 

The actions on April the 3rd ended overall in a Strategic Saderan victory as the victory at Cape Wannoa didn't have a major effect on Saderan naval plans and any plans for extending the Alliance blockade past port lynch were destroyed. The Alliance however won a tactical victory on the actions of April the 3rd sinking more ships than Sadera at the cost of 1 Man of war Class ship the Esmerald sunk and 1 Admiral killed. Aurthor Prat would be the highest-Ranking Alliance personnel to be killed over the course of the war.

The battle of port lynch would launch Admiral Grau into stardom as he would begin his journey to become Sadera's best naval commander in history. The battle of Cape Wannoa's on the other part while it didn't undermine Saderan naval efforts in any way proved to be a public humiliation as 16 Galley's were defeated by just 3 small Corvettes. Vice Admiral Garvus would have been executed if he hadn't been captured during the battle for his failure. Meanwhile Captain Carlos Camell of the Tempest would arrive to a hero's welcome back in Alliance territory and would be promoted to Admiral due to his successful victory against Sadera and would replace the now dead Aurthor Prat as commander of the Avion sea fleet. Admiral Grau on his part would state the fault of the defeat at cape Wannoa was not on Garvus fault but rather the inexperience of the Saderan sailors and slave labor who had never seen any real naval combat. 

The Sacrifice of Aurthor Prat and the Esmerald at the battle of port Lynch would become forever engraved in the history of Falmart and the alliance as Aurthor Prat would become a national hero for his selfless efforts to save his fleet and fight to the end against a numerically superior enemy.

Still not my strong suit. I appreciate all the feedback last time and it helped me so much. Thanks for taking time out of your days to help. Hopefully I made it better not worse.

Dear \[Agent\],

I am seeking representation for my debut novel, THE SUNSETS WITH YOU, a contemporary romance complete at 86,000 words. It will appeal to readers who loved the Hollywood dynamic of When In Rome by Sarah Adams and lake town vibes of Meet Me At the Lake By Carley Fortune.

When it comes to taking risks, you‚Äôll find Lena Oakley safely tucked away in her picturesque small town in Maine with her two best friends. Lena has spent years creating a perfect bubble free of tumultuous relationships, and anything anxiety inducing. But with a job she hates, no love life to speak of, and abandonment issues thanks to her mom, she is struggling to find her footing in adult life ‚Äì unwilling to change a thing, until she finds a for sale sign at her beloved childhood lake house and an acceptance into NYU PR program.¬†

Lena is faced with staying in her familiar territory Greenwater where the coffee shop knows her order, friends are family, and where the sound of crashing waves is the background music. She has to decide if her status quo is actually fulfilling, simply familiar, or if leaving to chase her dreams of working behind the scenes on Broadway is worth the anxiety that comes with change. Sitting in a dark corner of her favorite bar, Lena catches her celebrity crush‚Äôs gaze. Stunned, she starts making a plan about how to approach him, until he abruptly walks out, rudely calling her out for staring.

Callum Hayes, is popping up everywhere, even at work-where she is now forced to work with him on his ad campaign. He turns his attention to her, apologizing for being brash. He slowly worms his way into her life, befriending her favorite people in town, and showering her in attention she's been craving‚Äìeven if she‚Äôs not ready to admit it out loud. She is determined to keep him at arms length, fearful he‚Äôll use her heart until he leaves like her mom did. After quitting her job on a whim and feeling reckless, she decides to say yes to a date with Callum. Cruising the lake, sharing their biggest fears, and him revealing his plans to stay in Maine making her feel a connection she‚Äôs never felt, making her question whether NYC is still a dream worth chasing.

I‚Äôm a debut author living in west Michigan, originally from a small town near the great lakes in Michigan. I spend my days homeschooling my three boys. THE SUNSETS WITH YOU was inspired by my experiences in childhood and growing up on a lake."
First experience w/ Jumpspeak (not great!),languagelearning,1i9xe27,2025-01-25 16:21:24,1,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1i9xe27/first_experience_w_jumpspeak_not_great/,shriramk,Discussion,"I recently learned about Jumpstart. I've used Duolingo, Mango, Pimsleur, etc. quite a bit in the past and I'm also using Duolingo now. I've been making my own LLM prompts to create lessons, and figured I was happy to outsource the job.

In my first half hour I'm already very disappointed by *many* things.

1. It seems very difficult to get a price up front from their Web site. That's always a bad sign.

2. When you click on buttons like ""Try 100 days"", you go through an extremely long, irritating, frustrating, sequence of questions and interactions, none of which seem to have any real value *at all*. For instance, after I did what seemed like a ""what is your level"" quiz (and did very well on), there was absolutely no feedback, nor was there any customization when I actually started using the app. It became clear that this is whole process is a bunch of crappy behavioral psychology tricks, not anything tied to learning.

3. After I initiated the payment process, I kept getting several ""upsell"" pages. After two of these I got really annoyed and bailed out of completing the signup process entirely. I even got an email from Jumpspeak: subject ""Can I help?"" and text:

> It looks like you were right in the middle of signing up for our special.
>
> But it appears you didn‚Äôt get a chance to finish the checkout process.

etc., with a link to ""fill out the order form and finish your order"" (which I had no intent of doing). But here's the kicker: even before I got this email, I got email from Jumpspeak *thanking me for my order*.

4. When you go to their [Customer Service Portal](https://jumpspeakapp.samcart.com/customer_hub/dashboard), you can *view* your subscription and you can update your card‚Ä¶you can't cancel it. To cancel you have to search in help, [find the relevant page](https://help.jumpspeak.com/article/5-how-to-cancel), then [go to another page](https://www.jumpspeak.com/billing), enter your email to get a magic link, and only then do you get to the billing site. It's safe to say they seem to be trying very hard to make it difficult to cancel. (This is also how I confirmed that I *am* set up to be billed, so I mashed that cancellation button so hard.) Anyway, for those who care, the current rate is ""$69.00 every 91 days"".

5. My ""100 day"" free trial begins on Jan 25 and ends on Apr 25, which‚Ä¶ is‚Ä¶ not 100 days?!?

Okay, these are the shenanigans *outside* the app! But since I was already registered (against my will!), I downloaded and started to run the app. This is for Italian.

- As noted above, there is nothing customized about it. It didn't seem to do anything with my quiz results to find the right level for me.

- All I go was a very scripted, pre-set set of lessons. Each lesson has has a Listen, Write, Speak, and Conversation mode, with a few prompts in each. It's no less scripted than Duolingo, but isn't even as diverse. The user interface is nowhere near as polished as that of Duolingo. Also, on the Write problems, early on, it gives you no ""distractors"" (wrong choices); I assume that changes after a while.

- There are some silly bugs in the software, like a place where it said something about ""continue to learn English"".

- On the audio (which I suspect is the part that is hardest to get right and most compute-intensive), the system would accept my answers *suspiciously* quickly. I then started to purposely make mistakes. The big ones it caught, small ones (like adding on extra words at the end) it didn't. Not sure how reliable that is.

I then noticed that there is a separate ""AI chat"" mode. Aha, finally, here we go! So I engaged that. There are some scenarios. I picked Travel Planning.

By default, it shows you a question *and* the desired answer. (You can configure a lot of things, presumably including this.) That doesn't seem too useful, but at the same time the question is too complicated to answer otherwise. So I'm not sure how to use this.

Anyway, I noticed it was‚Ä¶rather scripted here, too. So I started to say slightly incorrect things. It just seemed to get stuck asking the same question over and over. I then started to say nonsenical things. It still seemed sort of stuck on a script. Eventually it did show some signs of ""understanding"". But I think the experience here was worse than I'd have if I were typing into a chatbot directly.

BUT: to give it credit: when I ended the lesson, it gave me a score, and then gave feedback on each thing I'd said. The feedback was **pretty good**. *It is also the same as the feedback I've been able to get directly from chatbots* (unsurprisingly). What it didn't seem to be able to do was give any *contextual* feedback: e.g., ""what you said was grammatically correct, it just has nothing at all to do with *travel planning*, and was actually kinda' nonsensical and had nothing to do with my question!"".

I went back to try it again to see whether it would give me a rather different conversation. But from what I can tell, that exact button is ‚Ä¶ no longer there? This is weird: the whole point of using GenAI is that you can have the same conversation many times, somewhat different each time: e.g., before a trip, it can be useful to practice a dozen *different* food-ordering conversations. Is Jumpspeak removing the buttons after you've tried them once?

So overall, it's a very mixed bag. The signup experience is bad and feels very scammy. (Dear Jumpspeak lawyers: I'm not saying you *are* a scam, you're just‚Ä¶well.) The app is so-so if you take away the ""AI"". The AI part is‚Ä¶mixed so far.

My usual sentiment is to say ""hey, it's a new system, they're trying something interesting, let's see how this evolves"". But the signup process left a poor taste in my mouth, *especially* my not even completing the sign-up ‚Äî not just in my imagination, but even getting email from them about it! ‚Äî¬†and then them going ahead and billing me anyway? This is no way to build trust."

I decided to make another drawing of my bounty hunter Alisyn (A715n). I don't care if it has too much in common with another character, my head hurts and it's hard making a unique OC when the fandom you're basing it off of already made every possible hair-eye-style-gender combination under the sun.

I was expecting something like Argo, but this was its own animal. Not as flashy and ""hollywood"" as Argo, but it was a fantastic telling of this story. They seamlessly inserted the actual broadcast footage, so it had real depth and stakes. I don't feel like they cut any corners, and the tension and drama made for an amazing experience. I definitely want to watch it again.

While I do recommend this to anyone-you don't have to know the back story, they'll explain everything you need to know as it happens. BUT if you're into photography, journalism, sports, history (and world events) you'll especially be engaged.

The Q&A after the credits wasn't really worth it. Save that for the Blu-ray.

It wasn't a huge spectacle that needs to be seen on the big screen like Dune or Furiosa, but movies like this need the numbers. It can't slip into obscurity. I loved the effort and determination of the news crew, and its a stark difference for want passes as journalism today. The more people that see the valor in good, thorough journalism, the better.

It took awhile to find a theater/showing. Two issues lead to that. There are two versions of this movie. One has a 12 minute pre-recorded Q&A with the cast after the credits, and it's tagged as a separate movie. So when I used fandango to find ""September 5"" near me, nothing came up. When I searched individual theaters, it showed up, but with the Q&A. (Where as the IMAX and 3D versions of movies usually pop up regardless of what I search so this is an anomolie, or goof) ALSO it was supposed to open wide last Friday, but due to the Oscar nominations list being set back a week, they pushed back the opening to this weekend.  
Tell people to see this movie! Take friends!"

Just casually strolling and being in the same place in the same park, especially near alone men (sit near them) but do not even start a conversation. 

I haven't been successful until today. But today I successfully attracted two people... in the evening and at night.

First one, he was staring at me and then casually started a conversation, but he tried to be certain and just did implications, but I couldn't reveal. And he couldn't be direct. Me either so failed. 

But the second one, I also did implications too. A cat slept on my lap, and he was near to me. He also occasionally stared at me, and he started a conversation about the cat. So I emphasized the lap and the touch a lot. Later, he offered to go somewhere alone because it was crowded, and it bothered him. After we went there, after some small talk, he directly opened his penis and wanted me to touch/stroke it. I couldn't dare to do it because it was open space, and someone could have recorded us unknowingly and shared it, so I couldn't risk it, and I did not accept it. Since he did not have an empty house, he insisted, but I walked off after telling him I couldn't risk that. 

But it was a nice experience and gave me a lot of confidence about my look, especially! And I understood that everything was possible!"

WIBTAH for kicking out my child‚Äôs father,AITAH,1i9xd8v,2025-01-25 16:20:25,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i9xd8v/wibtah_for_kicking_out_my_childs_father/,ceruleanandsilver,,"I was preparing to end the relationship when I found out I was pregnant. Our child is now 2 and it‚Äôs gotten unimaginably worse in that time. Manipulation, gaslighting, verbal attacks, lying, you name it. I felt I couldn‚Äôt leave because I was hundreds of miles away from any support system and I can‚Äôt really afford to live on my own. 


Fast forward to a few months ago, and I made the plunge to move from NorCal to SoCal to be near my family. I felt like I had to let him come with me to avoid an ugly custody battle- there was no way I was going to be stuck alone up there til my kid is 18.  


Everything has been worse since moving here. It‚Äôs been 4 months and he still is not making any money but gone 12+ hours of the day trying to get clients. Continues to also go back up north to work almost every other week and is still coming up short on his portion of rent and expenses. 


To give an example of the things that he does: 2 weeks ago I refused to let him drive while drunk (with our son in the car) and he berated me for over an hour, I eventually had to lock my son and myself in the bedroom. This was after my birthday dinner that I invited him to because I‚Äôm trying to be amicable. He threatened to kick the door down, leave and never come back, etc. but then is super remorseful the next day and says he‚Äôll change. Things like this have happened hundreds of times. (With or without him drinking). 


It‚Äôs over, I just don‚Äôt know how to navigate the next part. If I kick him out I know he‚Äôll have nowhere to go. And will probably go back up north. It‚Äôs hard to accept that if I don‚Äôt help him be in our child‚Äôs life, he probably won‚Äôt do it himself. I feel obligated. I feel stressed at the thought of doing it all alone, even though I am pretty much doing it all alone anyway. But I can‚Äôt be around him anymore. For my sanity and for my child‚Äôs sake. 


So, would I be an asshole if I kicked him out? Do I really just let him figure it out for himself? I‚Äôm going back to school in a couple months and hoped that I can rely on him to help with childcare but if I kick him out I am pretty positive he won‚Äôt stay in SoCal. Im so conflicted. "

I wish there weren‚Äôt people (mostly men) walking around with shit caked asses but sadly this isn‚Äôt true. There are many MANY stories you can find online of mainly women posting about going on dates with men and catching a wiff of their butt either on the date or when doing the hanky panky and having their stomach turn. There are also many posts of people seeing the other persons ass crack full of shit dingle-berries mixed in their butt hair and then praying they had never swiped right in the first place. 

It‚Äôs a whole thing online idk how it started but I‚Äôm pretty sure it was because someone asked about peoples wiping techniques and when some (mainly men) started sharing others got grossed out and pointed out how they were not doing nearly enough. Some of the defenses was that ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt smell so it‚Äôs fine‚Äù (it smells), ‚Äúit‚Äôs gay to touch your butthole, ew‚Äù (idiot), ‚Äúit comes off in the shower‚Äù (gross). 

There‚Äôs also when wiping some people will put toilet paper over a finger and put just the very tip of the finger in the make sure everything‚Äôs clean. Some people also do this with baby wipes. Many were also disgusted and horrified to find this out even when people explained this is a common hygiene practice done in the shower as well and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it unless your using soaps/products inside your body. This again got many of the same responses and worse.

So while I wish there weren‚Äôt people with sh*t smear booty cheeks walking around out there, they are among us üíÄ

**also want to preface I and several other women I know have experienced men like this.**

**also this is not meant to be an attack on men, there are women who do this as well and it‚Äôs equally icky, there are just predominantly reports of it being men who do this. And I know they do not represent all men.**"

a few months ago, in October- on the 10th, i nearly got kidnapped. i was walking, it was at 8:30 in the morning when it happened. i told my boyfriend (who was still asleep, we're long distance and he's an hour ahead of me) that it happened, and when he woke up and read the texts i had sent him, he said absolutely nothing about it. i didn't question this, as it's not uncommon for him to completely ignore stuff i say while he's asleep.

in either November or December, i was talking about it again (talking about how my grandparents/guardians are racist and how that affects how they drive) and he again said nothing. that time, i was mildly annoyed, but i let it go.

well, 8 or 9 days ago, in January, we broke up. i won't get into why we broke up (ill just say it related to my appearance and what i may or may not need, medically) but we broke up. we argued back and forth for a few days about it, because he wanted to get back together, but he eventually agreed. we're still talking though, for other reasons that i won't get into. just know that it'll hurt a lot of people if we stop talking.

and, i just told my friend that i was almost kidnapped and told him how my ex said nothing about it. my friend was surprised and worried, and it made me question why my ex didn't say anything about it. so, i asked him.

and he said, ""i don't know.""

that's all he said.

im kind of pissed now. i feel like he didn't care about me at all. we were together for 2 years and he's my longest lasting relationship ever. im 18, turning 19 this year and he's 20, turning 21 this year.

so, am i overreacting? i can't tell if i am or not."

I have this scent idea, but I don't know what body spray/perfume would go well with it.

I LOVE Olive Branch (even though it's rather watery and doesn't last very long, I still love her) and have really gotten into the patchouli scent of Karma Kream. I really want a body spray or perfume that would complement the two scents together, but I don't live near a Lush store, so I can't go in and smell for myself!

I know the simple answer is to just buy Pansy or Karma, but is there something else that could work with those two scents? I am non-binary and would prefer something more gender neutral, so I'm a bit worried that Pansy would be just a bit *too* feminine for my personal taste. But maybe if I layer it with something else, it would be fine?

I feel like it‚Äôs obvious this game is going to get years of DLC, because every single dragon Ball game since xeno 2 has gotten about four or five years of DLC at the least. 


Xv2 = 9 years 

Fighterz = 4 years

Kakarot = 5 years 

Breakers = 3 years of support somehow 

And also  I heavily doubt Bandai would drop a whole survey asking what the community wants for the game just to not do anything with it. I also feel like it‚Äôs fair to say their focusing on DLC and free updates since they quite literally just added a whole new game mode for a limited time and they want to do more of these game modes as well. So clearly support for the game is going to happen and we‚Äôre not getting a sequel for at least three or four years.

- Quiet and conducive to rest; 
- With beautiful nature and preferably near great swimming holes or on the coast.
- With good grocery stores/fresh fruit and veggie markets nearby/in town
- With a Spanish language school nearby/in town (I plan to take classes)
- welcoming towards tourists (Costa Ricans were very friendly to me when I travelled before but in case there are less friendly areas I'm not aware of)
- Rent is about $1000 per month with solid WiFi. 

Any such places come to mind?

Not Revealing in the Final,TheTraitors,1i9xb4h,2025-01-25 16:17:51,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheTraitors/comments/1i9xb4h/not_revealing_in_the_final/,Squabbey,Game Rules,"It is fundamentally bad game design for the purpose of episode count. This game originally called Mafia, with spin offs such as Werewolf was designed by students to prove that an informed minority will typically win over an uninformed majority.

Throughout the seasons the producers (I assume) make it increasingly difficult, thanit already is, to find out who the Traitors are and the finale with not revealing further causes suspicion and gives great advantage to the traitors and increasing danger to a faithful.

Its also further compounded by there ""not being allowed to be one traitor,"" making it impossible to finish the game early and the production company can garuantee a lm episode count because there will always be two people per day leaving until they reach the final count.

Ultimately, because the BBC and production studio will need a minimum amount of episodes to show ad time on they will artificially elongate the game to the point the game is tortured into a railroaded scenario. I doubt I'll watch future seasons because it's difficult to watch a ""game"" have nearly all effective agency removed. The game can't finish early (by finding all tractors), you can't be a good faithful because you can never eliminate there being a traitor in the final. Objectively the game could skip to the second last episode after one traitor is found.

TLDR: artificially weighting an already weighted game for the purpose of ad money. If you enjoy it more power to you but I won't be watching anymore."

Seems to be a door to door solar company which the recruiter was up front about. I was basically told that we would be going out to some state probably on the east coast to sell solar all summer, had a sign near the table that said ""pay for college in one summer"". My whole job would be to just set the appointment for a ""closer"" to go in and actually sell it and then its a 50/50 commission split for each sale. The recruiter even said the company will cover flights out to wherever we go and cover housing for the whole summer. My only concern is that it sounds too good to be true and I've heard about MLM scams before. I was told basically no experience is necessary, you just have to work hard and they would train me and all that stuff if I end up getting hired after the round of interviews. Would appreciate some feedback or insights into this or any resources where I can do a little more research as well. "
Can the DGPU be disabled in the bios?,ProArt_PX13,1i9xao8,2025-01-25 16:17:17,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProArt_PX13/comments/1i9xao8/can_the_dgpu_be_disabled_in_the_bios/,JohnnyStrides,Troubleshooting,"I'm on the hunt for a new laptop and this looks perfect aside from the lackluster battery life and 60hz screen (why not 90 Asus?).

I currently have a laptop with a 6800HS/680m and 3050. My battery life nearly doubled when I disabled the 3050 in the bios, and pretty much never enable it except for if I'm doing some heavier lifting in Resolve when I'm plugged in (Windows sleep mode also seems to work way better with the DGPU disabled in bios).

Would there be an option to disable the 4050 completely in the bios like my Lenovo? This would be my preference so it's not slowly sipping away battery when on standby and I can actually render entire 50 minute long 4K videos on half a charge with the AMD rendering engine vs. Nvidia where I pretty much have to plug in. 

FYI I'm looking at the 365 CPU with 24GB of ram, the 370/32GB/4060 option is an extra $600 Canadian and I'm sure the lower base model will meet my needs performance wise. Being able to completely disable the discreet graphics would be a huge plus as you can't really do this in Windows and I suspect that's why the battery life is not great for this model."

I‚Äôve done a lot of reading and have gone through the beginners guide on here, but I was just wondering some other tips/care advice you would recommend to a beginner. I‚Äôve had cats, dogs, fish, and a hermit crab, but never a gecko. My cousin has a heat pad, UVB light, and heat lamp for her with lots of hiding spots and a basking rock. The tank looks much larger than 20 gallons - if I had to guess it‚Äôs AT LEAST 30 gallons if not 40. She‚Äôll be sending me exact tank measurements soon. My house is usually around 68 degrees. I have lots of houseplants with grow lights that are on adjustable timers (usually on 12 hrs/day) I was wondering if I could have her tank near the plants? The grow lights wouldn‚Äôt be directly on the gecko but there would be indirect lighting from them going around her tank. 

My main questions:
-Have you ever had trouble maintaining temps inside your gecko tank?
-Which plants or which source would you recommend for non-toxic plants for geckos?
-What would you say is the most challenging part of owning a leopard gecko?
-Do you think the grow lights being around her tank would be okay for her?
-How often do you change your gecko‚Äôs substrate? 
-What is your gecko‚Äôs favorite substrate and how deep do you typically make the substrate?

The answer is energy,anhedonia,1i9xa03,2025-01-25 16:16:26,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/anhedonia/comments/1i9xa03/the_answer_is_energy/,BohemianGrovePizza,Encouragment üí™üèæüí™üèæ,"I can expand on this if anyone wants me to. I was anhedonic heavily, for maybe a year and a half. Then kind of partially for another year. I mean I guess I still am, like 20% but not nearly like 80% which is what it once was. 

The answer is energy. 

Physical matter, your body, manifests from energy. Everything is vibration. If you recorrect your vibration to the state of what it should be. Everything else will align.

Study the chakras. Specifically sacral. This chakra dictates your connection to the outer world and your emotions. 

If your sacral chakra is severely out of alignment, you won't really feel like you're living. Anhedonia is a result of this. This can be caused thru stress, relationships, drugs, depression, the list goes on. 

There are many ways to exercise this chakra, to the point where it's healthy enough that it regains stability. Some things that worked for me were breath work. Like a ton of it. Attend breath work classes (class pass is great if you're in a major city) those are far more impactful than ones on YouTube, although it's still better than not doing it. Experimenting with mushrooms and weed WHILE doing breath work/energetic sacral cleansing. They don't just work on their own, at least for me. Being around other people. This is key. I forced myself to have conversations with people even when it sucked. Start driving for Lyft or uber and just connect with strangers even when it's forced until it's not. Music. Try and play or write music. 

There are a ton of other ways and I can go into them if anyone wants. 

Western medicine does not want to incorporate any of this into its doctrine because it makes no money. But energy and vibration is the root of all physical matter, so by default if you correct it everything else is corrected. 

Also, if you don't believe any of this stuff will work, it will work SIGNIFICANTLY less even if you do it. You have to ignite your subconscious into making changes. That begins with belief. "

She said she liked me, I said the same. She then immediately changed her mind and said she already lost feelings because she didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like her.

We stayed friends but I wanted more so I cut it off politely. Then after half a year she reached out with everything I ever wanted to hear. How she said I‚Äôm perfect, she was only scared because she never felt this way for a guy before, wants to give it another chance. I said yes. 

Literally within 4 days she said that it doesn‚Äôt feel right and that it‚Äôs a platonic feeling. So I cut it off and blocked her (not ghosting, I mentioned I will block her to avoid going back and forth). 

After nearly a year, she reached out again last month through someone else (since she couldn‚Äôt reach on her own as she‚Äôs blocked, as I never reached out even once at any time). She wanted to meet up to clear up things, I agreed.

She said she still likes me and only rejected me before because she didn‚Äôt know why I would like her, she wanted to hurt me to not like her anymore. She cried while saying this. I said it‚Äôs fine, apology accepted. She wanted to give it another chance and I said okay.

Everything was fine the first couple days, she seemed to text very pleasantly. But then she started to keep saying she is busy and stuff. I asked her to meet up and she said she was busy yet again, didn‚Äôt even reschedule. The conversation ended and because I always initiated the conversations, I waited this time for her.

But she didn‚Äôt reinitiate. So after a week of silence I hit her up, asked about her day then asked her to meetup again. She then told me how she is still feeling like this is wrong, despite her feelings. That I‚Äôm the perfect guy who‚Äôs meant for someone else. I replied back and she didn‚Äôt respond.

Guess I should‚Äôve listened to my friends (and people in a previous thread) who already told me it would end this way. "

Second arrow struck, and he fled.  I chased that darn bear halfway around the frozen shores and back again, and meanwhile he scared two wolves towards me.  The first I headshotted with an arrow.  The second, before he noticed me, a marvelous buck strode between us, and I caused the wolf to take the deer down, and while he feasted, pop! Another headshot.  I saw the bear way on the horizon still running in terror (after I‚Äôd put at least 3 more arrows into him), so I went ahead and quartered all three animals while waiting for the bear to bleed out.  Finally I located the bear, back where I first spotted him, and travoised all of the harvest to Jack Rabbit Island and processed as much meat as I could throughout the night.  It took 2 nearly full travois loads, and about 20% condition loss.

My single mother had to work double time to give my younger brother and I a good life, and a good life she gave us. I was always aware of the financial difficulties that she faced, even though she never really showed that to me. She never refused me or my brother anything. She‚Äôs the best.

Fast-forward a bit, I traveled to study abroad for uni. I hated the idea of leaving my only family, but I thought in the back of my mind that I was doing it to be successful and hopefully give her the life she never had.

Fast-forward again, I have a regular job, earning a solid wage, living a life that many people could only dream of, but I feel like a fraud. Everything I have, was given to me, I haven‚Äôt earned a single thing, for the past 4 years, I‚Äôve been doing these side projects trying to turn a side-hustle into something more, to finally give back to my mother, to finally earn what I have. Unfortunately, all of my projects have fallen on their face.

In the past 4 years, I‚Äôve gradually stopped going out with my uni friends, first only attending big gatherings, then only birthdays, and then nothing. I‚Äôve blocked everyone I know, apart from my direct family and the people I have a professional relationship with. I have isolated myself completely, arguing that I don‚Äôt deserve any pleasure until I‚Äôve earned it, until I give my mother the life she deserves.

I‚Äôm afraid, I try to be productive almost every waking hour, I work full-time, I‚Äôm learning a language, I‚Äôm taking programming courses and also recently deployed a website which I‚Äôm constantly working on, but I feel like all this is not enough. I‚Äôll never earn what I have, I‚Äôll never earn my blessings, I‚Äôll never give my mother the life she deserves. She‚Äôs getting older day by day, and I‚Äôm no where near success. I‚Äôm not intelligent enough to have my own business, not intelligent enough to be like my father, and rise through the ranks at work very quickly, I‚Äôm not good enough, I‚Äôm not.

I need help, but I‚Äôve pushed everyone away, and now I‚Äôm all alone, with this impossible dream that‚Äôs making my life a nightmare. I can‚Äôt bring myself to reach out to anyone, I‚Äôm embarrassed and ashamed of myself.

I don‚Äôt deserve your advice, I don‚Äôt deserve anyone‚Äôs help, yet, I‚Äôm here, asking for it. A part of me wants to be happy, just like everyone I see around me, but that part of me is slowly being suffocated by the part that thinks I‚Äôm undeserving. I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll grow old, be completely alone, having not achieved what I set out to, maybe that‚Äôs the punishment I deserve.

This was very long-winded, apologies for that, I‚Äôve never made a post like this, and probably never will again, so I tried to put it all out there, thanks for reading if you‚Äôve reached this far.

Tldr: I feel guilty for not giving my mother a great life, and its slowly eating away at my life."

First impressions as near beginner- Horizon Hobby's Apprentice STOL S 700mm - RTF,RCPlanes,1i9x8vv,2025-01-25 16:15:02,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/RCPlanes/comments/1i9x8vv/first_impressions_as_near_beginner_horizon_hobbys/,Whitebaron1993,,"Hi All, 

Was recently in the market for a small RTF plane to get me back into the hobby and thought I would share in case anyone else is in a similar position.

I was initially looking at the HH Sports Cub s2 RTF as I liked the looks, Flight modes, Panic button and handy size. The reviews suggest it is an excellent aircraft but in my research the Apprentice STOL S 700mm-RTF popped up and caught my attention and ultimately was purchased. 

Why did I buy the Apprentice:

1. Size-Slightly larger but with removable wing so maintains similar portability with a bigger aircraft (bigger is better after all)
2. Propulsion-Brushless motor, directly driving the prop. The Sports cub uses a small brushed motor with a gear to turn the prop and a 1 cell battery. Personally I prefer the idea of a brushless and in videos I have seen I feel the Apprentice is quieter which I think has a lot to do with the propulsion system.
3. Battery-Battery security. The cubs battery is velcroed into a slot in the bottom of the plane and I don't like the idea that a bit of Velcro is all that's holding it in. The apprentice has a magnetic latched canopy and velcro installed inside to secure the battery.
4. Transmitter- The Apprentice comes with a full size transmitter compared to the ""game controller"" style included with the Sports Cub. It is worth noting that the transmitter included with the apprentice is basic and not as powerful as a ""proper"" transmitter but it is the same form factor and has a usb C that allows you to connect it to a pc/laptop and use the included software key to fly in Horizon Hobby's RC flight sim, but more on that later.

Unboxing:

Well packaged and arrived in perfect condition, the box is well designed to be usable for transporting the plane as it feels secure after unboxing as a storage and transport solution. There are lists of what is included in the box online so won't repeat here but everything you will need is included.

First Flight:

In a spur of the moment decision before a big storm blew through I managed to get a short flight in. 

* I did not secure the battery in my haste or check the centre of gravity(CG) and can report the plane remained very docile even without correct CG being checked.
* The plane has plenty power and can nearly climb vertically.
* In beginner mode it is a joy to fly and is a 2 channel experience.
   * the onboard stability system does some mixing of channels 
      * throttle and elevator work together such that to clime or descend you need only adjust the throttle.
      * Ailerons and rudder work together to make nice smooth, coordinated turns.
   * Overall, fun easy flying without breaking a sweat can just enjoy a nice looking plane flying peacefully with zero dramas.
* Intermediate mode mostly just ensures that the plane cannot go inverted but allows more freedom.
* Expert mode total freedom to find out what the plane is and is not capable off
* PANIC!!! the panic button is very a excellent investment protection device as it means that as you venture away from the safe harbour of beginner mode, you have the safety of knowing that if you loose orientation of the plane and don't want to lawn dart your plane into the ground, you can temporarily hand the controls back to the stability system and get your bearing back.

Overall, very pleased with my choice and would thoroughly recommend if anyone is in the market for something similar.

Please let me know if there are any questions I would be happy to help where I can.

Nestled within it a canopy, a spindle-branch scab upon smooth flesh. Any light that dares to pass through, punished. Consumed by an insatiable rolling fog reeking of pus and rot. Tucked within the stench tar-black trunks stand tall, lifeless against vengeful cutting winds, hair-like splinters swoop across the forest floor, roots pile and twist, a mass of nerve and vein strangling any that is not itself. 

The forest groans, the valley, the decaying wound lurches forward. 

Frantic, the roots retreat‚Äìcurling, tossing, turning, coiling, knotting, fusing. The forest floor stills. Tree trunks quiver with anticipation as the winds withdraw into their boughs. The fog now powerless rises skittering back into the retreating sky as the canopy cracks open. 

The sun‚Äì bright, hot and white‚Äì cleaves through. 

A brilliant blinding flash.

 The forest does not exist. There are only walls, ceiling, floor, a hallway at the far end. There is nothing there. 

Like a raised tumour upon the floor, an altar sits centre to all. A large cubical bulge of non-flesh. Fastened to it, a will watches on. The air vacuum-cold grows colder still. An intensity festers between hallway and alter, an infinite space collapses, in its place a singularity blooms. A being of primordial stature beckons its call magnetic its existence repulsive. 

Fear slithers up rising from spine to throat sinking its jaws in pulsating flesh. Venom blossoms‚Äì from vein to nerve to tissue‚Äì till fear consumes will. Sanity abandons thought. Fear is will and will is fear. The world‚Äìwalls, ceiling, floor, hallway‚Äì falls away. Instinct takes the helm, struggling against the receding mind clawing at its narrowing walls as they inch towards a final crush. 

Upon the altar, fear resides and upon fear rests singularity. A burden so great life itself escapes it. And here within death, a voice from a place long forsaken speaks, *listen it whispers, listen, allow truth to be known.* 

The singularity roars under the burden of its paradox. 

The expanding quiet drags on and on. 

The being draws near, near and nearer still. 

There is something there. 

Awake. 

The mind shakes. A dream follows and stays.

 The mind grasps it with twitching fingers, turns it, examines it, puts it on and takes it off and warily almost worriedly the mind hands it over. 

Curiosity bubbles forth. Eyes alight with childish wonder, it watches this novelty, first from afar, not enough, it comes closer leaning in, then tenderly, naively, it takes hold of the dream and holds it close. As night falls it asks a question, 

Will I ever see you again?

Housework, groceries, (rarely) cat caretaking, everything. He didn't have to move a muscle. At night, she would go into his bed, hugging him from behind 

Sherman was always a kind boy (and deep down, a simp.), and didn't appreciate that Tulip would do all the work for him. From time to time, when he was sure he could do something, he asks her to stop, and she would obey him without a second thought. ...to which Sherman would call her for assistance. She would chuckle, or giggle, but the result was still her helping him out. Sometimes he could do something on his own, and she would compliment him on his accomplishment.

...such kind and sincere words... ...like what a true parent would have said to their child...

On their first day at work at Lobotomy Corp, he quickly learned that this was gonna be one of THOSE places. With nightmarish abominations... And so far, there were only a floating skull with heavy Christian implications and a Bird with a second mouth for a head. He only liked the skull, because he was also Cristian, and he thought that it was Jesus Christ. So he usually went to him to confess his sins when he killed someone/something.

Tulip would have also forgave him, saying that ""It's probably just what happens everyday! You'll get used to it!"". ...Thing is: YES. It's what happens everyday. BUT: **it'll get worse from here...**

20 days after first entering the corporation, they both befriended an Abnormality with the ID of O-01-04. Upon seeing her for the first time, they thought that the corporation was inhumane, for trapping the girl inside like a sort of animal. Like a monster. They tried to free her, but it backfired, and the girl turned into a giant snake and attacked the whole facility. They promised themselves to not do that again, and they are more careful with her from then on. But still remained friends!  
...39 days have passed since I and Sherm. entered L Corp, and it's been 5 days since I, Poppie Tulipania Ghanpaudr, died, after confessing my sins to O-03-03... (Mf really died to One Sin)

I came back, at night, to see him again, on the same spot, to give him consolation and reassuring him everything will be alright. I didn't see him tonight. I went to the containment cell of O-01-12, because that's where he usually goes now, other than O-03-03, and she started to speak, as if she knew I was there.

**¬´Dearie, dearie... Would you like to hear a story?¬ª**

**""No, I just wanna know where Sherm is-""** the Old Lady interrupted me, and continued her story...

**¬´Once upon a time, near a woodpile... Near a woodpile... Where his mother met his father... There was a 18 year out boy, named Sherman... His parents asked him to come to see where they met each other...¬ª**

**""I just wanna SEE WHERE SHERMAN IS NOW!!!""**

**¬´...¬ª** She continued anyway. **¬´He killed them both, by tearing their head off, and drank their blood...¬ª**

**""...""**

**¬´He killed them on Friday, and buried them on Sunday. After having buried them, he asked a friend of his to pick them up and bring them home. He said to the friend that there was a murder who killed his parents in cold blood and that they seriously injured him too. The friend, who cared for him a lot, went to help him as soon as possible. While on the other part of the Woods, he went and made a grave injure onto himself. It took a lot of courage from him to do that...¬ª** 

**""...""**

**¬´But it took nothing from him to kill his parents, who he deemed dead weight.¬ª**

**""...""** I exit the containment cell, sitting down. If he did all that, I fear what he could do to an Abnormality. Or rather, to T-03-46...

...I'll let him do his thing and and kill the embryo (the Embryo is T-03-46 he isnt going to kill a random fetus). If he calls me, I'll go and look, and do what I always did when I was alive at L Corp.

I'll say that I'll be proud of him. He did say he would avenge me...

But then a hand reached out for his shoulder grabbing him with a strong grip. Sherman was stopped by Ayin (L Corp Manager) saying that he will doom all the facility if he lets his emotion control over him. And in the end he didnt do it. Always Smiling knowing that Tulip was still watching over him. (At the end of these events he became a fixer) 

And that wraps it up. im 90% even this lore sucks.

"UPDATE: after nearly 2 years: we are engaged!!...original post: I F30 in relationship with M26. His parents not agreeing to marriage, how to proceed and what to expect. Relationships",RelationshipIndia,1i9x7mz,2025-01-25 16:13:33,4,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/1i9x7mz/update_after_nearly_2_years_we_are/,cknowsit,Relationships,"UPDATE AFTER NEARLY 2 YEARS: We got engaged üíç 

Original post can be found on my profile. 

Not sure of anyone still cares,  but i have seen the same question pop up again and again in the subreddits about parents not agreeing to love marriage due to culture and caste issues and whether to keep fighting or give up.

In response to those i would like to share an update. I had posted the original post ~2 years ago or so where my bf's parents were not agreeing to our marriage (the details of my oroginal post can be found on my profile). 

To all those who question whether or not it is worth it to stuggle with family and go through fights to marry your love- it is 100% worth it and even more. After going through fights, emotional talks, threats and the century long question of log kya kahenge, hume samaaj se nikaal denge etc.  our parents finally agreed and when our families met each other at first they were a bit nervous but just in a couple of days eveyone just gelled well with each other. 

Me and my boyfriend got engaged 2 days ago with full blast in front of all the family members, extended family and other knowns and it was uptil now the happiest day of both of our lives. My bf/fiance had a smile from one ear to the other and he was soaking every moment of seeing his family spoil me with so much love. 

Our journey was so difficult, we spent night crying into each other's arms. Doubted if our families ever will agree but for both of us, one thing was certain that we wanted to do this life with each other. Good or bad. 

Since his family agreed i also ensure that i take steps to learn their laguage, respect their culture and customs and learn to cook a bit in their style. I call my in laws nearly every other day and just talk to them to build our bond. 

If you are in this situation, this is your sign. It is difficult. It probably the most difficult thing ever. But once it works out, the pain of all of that hardwork of getting your families to agree just vanishes. Do not give up on your love, we did not and we are happy ‚ù§Ô∏è

Tl;dr: me and bf are nor engaged after struggling for 2 years to get our families to agree. 

Mods i am not asking any question in this post, but it is one of hope and love winning at the end. I wish others who are in this situation to find some courage through this msg, so i request please not to delete. "

I am upgrading from a GTX 1080 build, and I honestly haven't kept up with the space since then so I'm a bit lost on which gpu I should be going for. I'm concerned about a 5090 in a sff build, and I think it might be overkill for what I need, so I'm open to suggestions.

* New build or upgrade?

New build

* Existing parts/monitors to reuse? (List with models/links)

None

* PC purpose? (Gaming, editing, etc. List apps/games)

New Triple A Gaming (+ heavy Skyrim modding), UE5 Game Development, Video Editing

* Purchase country? Near Micro Center?

USA, Could drive to a micro center within 3 hours but would generally prefer online options.

* Monitors needed? (Number, size, resolution, refresh rate)

Depends on GPU, but nothing too big or ultrawide. Only one needed for now, would like to buy a second in the future if my space situation changes.

* Budget range? (Include tax considerations)

< $3500, but less is always better.

* WiFi or wired connection?

Ideally both

* Size/noise constraints?

As small as I can get it

* Color/lighting preferences?

Mostly black/silver and subtle lighting

* Any other specific needs?

None

Please let me know if any other information would be helpful, thanks!"
Getting closure with an ex?,relationships,1i9x6i5,2025-01-25 16:12:09,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1i9x6i5/getting_closure_with_an_ex/,frenchtoastwrld,,"I, (23F) have been dating my boyfriend (23M) for nearly 4 years now and I‚Äôm in the happiest relationship I‚Äôve ever been in. I know that I am very much in love with him and could see myself spending the rest of my life with him. Before I started dating my now boyfriend, I was in a situationship with someone else during my time at college. He wasn‚Äôt a bad guy but we were toxic for each other and it never progressed to us actually dating because he always had an excuse as to why he wasn‚Äôt ready, for the sake of the story let‚Äôs call him E. I was 19 at the time and didn‚Äôt know better, and it ultimately ended away. I‚Äôve had a few boyfriends before but for some reason, 5 years later I can‚Äôt get E out of my head. I don‚Äôt romanticize him in my head, but I always catch myself checking to see if he viewed my posts on social media, things like that. Since this was half a decade ago, I truly thought I was over him which is why I let him follow me, and the thing is I am over him in some way but not entirely. I know that I never want to be with him, but I think because I never got the closure I always wanted it I kept the door cracked open a bit. About a month ago, he randomly messaged me and asked if he can take me out for a drink to catch up. I haven‚Äôt answered, but a part of me feels guilty for wanting to, and even more guilty for wanting to go. I don‚Äôt want to disrespect my current relationship, but if my current boyfriend is someone I want to be with in the long run, I feel like a part of me needs to be sure this chapter of my life is over and I‚Äôm just not sure how to do it. If anyone has been in a similar situation or can just speak from experience on how to move forward with the situation, I‚Äôd really appreciate any responses. Please be kind :)

TL;DR: I want to get closure from an old fling that has been in the back of my mind for a while now but feel guilty because I am in a relationship with someone I genuinely am in love with, but want to be sure this chapter of my life is closed before moving into the next part of my life with my current partner "

Enjoy Music Anytime: Benefits of Converting YouTube Videos to MP3,u_erepresent,1i9x63y,2025-01-25 16:11:37,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1i9x63y/enjoy_music_anytime_benefits_of_converting/,erepresent,,"Music is an essential part of our lives. Whether you're commuting, working out, or relaxing at home, having access to your favorite songs can make every moment more enjoyable. YouTube, with its extensive collection of music and audio content, is a popular source for discovering and enjoying tunes. However, streaming is not always convenient, which is why converting YouTube videos to MP3 is an excellent solution. Let‚Äôs explore the many benefits of converting YouTube videos to MP3 format.

# 1. Offline Access to Your Favorite Music

One of the biggest advantages of converting YouTube videos to MP3 is offline access. Whether you're on a plane, in a remote area, or facing internet issues, having your favorite tracks stored as MP3 files ensures uninterrupted listening. This makes it perfect for travel or situations where connectivity is unreliable.

# 2. Save Device Storage

Video files take up significantly more storage space than audio files. By converting YouTube videos to MP3, you can store far more songs, podcasts, or audiobooks on your device. This is especially useful if you have a device with limited storage or need to organize a large music library.

# 3. Convenient On-the-Go Listening

MP3 files allow you to listen to music without being tethered to a screen. You don‚Äôt have to keep YouTube open or worry about battery drain caused by video playback. Instead, you can listen while walking, jogging, or driving, making MP3s ideal for multitasking.

# 4. Improved Data Usage

Streaming YouTube videos repeatedly can consume a lot of mobile data. Converting videos to MP3 helps you save data since you no longer need to stream the video every time you want to listen. This is a cost-effective option for those with limited data plans or in areas with slow internet speeds.

# 5. Create Personalized Playlists

YouTube has a vast library of music, including niche tracks, live performances, and remixes that might not be available on other platforms. By converting these videos to MP3, you can curate personalized playlists tailored to your mood or occasion, ensuring your favorite tracks are always just a tap away.

# 6. High-Quality Audio Experience

A good YouTube to MP3 conversion tool preserves the audio quality of the original video, ensuring you enjoy a rich and clear listening experience. Whether you‚Äôre listening to music through headphones, speakers, or in your car, high-quality MP3 files enhance your enjoyment.

# 7. Versatility Across Devices

MP3 is one of the most universally accepted audio formats, compatible with nearly all devices. Whether you‚Äôre using a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or MP3 player, your converted files can be easily accessed and played, making them a highly versatile choice for audio enthusiasts.

# 8. Perfect for Educational Content

Beyond music, YouTube is also a hub for podcasts, lectures, and tutorials. Converting these videos to MP3 makes it easier to absorb information on the go. You can listen to a lecture during your commute or revisit an insightful podcast while exercising.

# 9. Enhanced Focus

Listening to MP3 files instead of watching videos can help reduce distractions. Without the visual component, you can focus purely on the audio content, whether it‚Äôs music, a motivational speech, or an audiobook.

# 10. Long-Term Convenience

Having your favorite YouTube content as MP3 files means you don‚Äôt have to worry about videos being removed or unavailable due to copyright issues. Your downloaded audio stays with you, ensuring long-term access to your favorite tracks.

# Conclusion

Converting YouTube videos to MP3 offers unparalleled convenience, versatility, and accessibility for music lovers and audio enthusiasts. It allows you to enjoy your favorite tracks anytime, anywhere, without the limitations of streaming or connectivity. Whether it‚Äôs creating custom playlists, saving storage, or enjoying offline access, converting YouTube videos to MP3 ensures that your music is always within reach. Take control of your listening experience and enjoy music on your terms!"

 it‚Äôs feathers pushing out my ear.
It‚Äôs beak carving words into any bone that‚Äôs near.

But some days it‚Äôs small,
A little tweedy bird.
Who‚Äôs chirps,
turn into murmurs in the waves of my thoughts.

And some days it‚Äôs sings,
so loud and proud.
It‚Äôs songs
become 
my thoughts
Then 
         it

Written by me, coded by NightmareNinjaZero.

A long name, I know. While not exactly 100% necessary, I wanted to go over Chapter 1 of Forlorn Heart once again after reviewing some feedback and after kind of painting myself into a corner during the making of¬† Chapter 2. So while this mod will have the same general story, what you do get are things like additional dialogues with characters like Amy and most importantly, learning more about Akane.

There will also be some new sprite edits and a few new coding tricks here and there. As such, since the mod has been extended and has more going on, it has earned the title of being a Director's Cut. Otherwise, it's nearly identical to the original. The only thing I will say is this will be replacing the original, since this will be the one we use going forward for future stories (like Chapters 2 and 3 of Forlorn Heart) and what I would say is the definitive version of this installment.

As a refresher, this will be a series split across a few parts, centering around a different MC and his love interest, Akane. Other mods in the Perfect World Anthology take place in their own universe with a different MC and a different set of the girls (Sayori, Yuri, Natsuki, and Monika) each time. This one will be one of the first to have a direct sequel.

This will be Akane's second solo outing and her first time as a major character in the Perfect World Anthology. Also, no, what goes on >!in the mod is not a curse. In Shattered Time: Rewind, that was a curse. Not here. It's a little more complicated than that.!<

In this universe, MC struggles with trying to confess his love to Akane, a girl who transferred to his school at the start of the year. For some reason, though, he seems to be struggling more than he usually is, as he experiences time looping on itself as the same day repeats over and over. And with it, a different reason for why he is unable to confess to Akane or just her flat out rejecting him.¬†

Along the way, MC discovers a mysterious notebook and many questions about what's truly going on with the day repeating itself. Can MC figure out what's going on or will he be stuck in an endless loop of torment?"
I did something really dumb today,LongCovid,1i9x5bb,2025-01-25 16:10:38,8,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongCovid/comments/1i9x5bb/i_did_something_really_dumb_today/,Known_Noise,,"I‚Äôm in relatively bad shape in general- LC with the ME/CFS version. I track my symptoms and hrv with the Visible app and use the tracking/pacing band any time I‚Äôm planning to be out of bed. (I‚Äôm home bound in bed or on the sofa 98% of the time.)

Today my local yarn store is having a customer appreciation day. I love this store. I have a credit to spend and I wanted to see the employees bc I enjoy chatting with them and other customers. 

My daughter usually drives me there and helps me reach things since using my wheelchair makes me short. She was busy with her own plans and I decided to go by myself. 

Did I mention there is also about 4‚Äù of snow on the ground and it‚Äôs still snowing? It‚Äôll be fine‚Ä¶ 

It wasn‚Äôt fine. My wheelchair couldn‚Äôt make it thru the snow in the parking lot to get thru the alley to the store. So I decided to move the car to the main street- tried again. This time got stuck in the snow on the sidewalk. 

I managed to eventually get thru to the shop door but my tires slipped at the doorway, making it almost impossible to push open the door. But I got inside and started looking at yarn for a future project. I found this really nice lace weight yarn in a great color. 

But at this point, my watch alert is buzzing because my heart rate is too high. I‚Äôm trying to decide what to do about it- ignore? 

I head toward the back of the store to check out the trunk show items. Watch is still alerting me to stop what I‚Äôm doing. So I look and my heart rate (seated doing nearly nothing) is 115. 

I‚Äôm embarrassed but I know I need to lay down right now. So I get out of my chair and lay on the floor hoping I‚Äôve found a good place where I won‚Äôt inconvenience others. Alarm stops. Check heart rate- -89. I wait a while longer- 88. I try sitting up - 112. I lay back down. Repeat a few times. 

In the meantime I have a nice chat with a customer about his hat and a current project, the yarn at the trunk show, etc. another customer walks by and asks, POTS? Yes. She nods knowingly. 

Eventually I give up and call my daughter to come get me. I‚Äôm home back in bed now. LC is just so stupid. 

TL/DR: tried to leave the house. Didn‚Äôt go well. F this sh*t

This is a list of a couple of guys I like that are playing at the Shrine Bowl the next couple days. These aren't the only guys I like there, but I tried to spotlight players I haven't written up in other posts (for example: I am hearing WRs Ricky White (UNLV) & Efton Chism (Eastern Washington) are having a good day 1 but I wrote them up in [my post on Sub-P4 guys](https://www.reddit.com/r/DynastyFF/comments/1i0mnh8/11_subp4_players_to_watch_for_the_2025_nfl_draft/) to keep an eye on). I should have a similar post for Senior Bowl guys coming soon as they get underway early next week.

# QB Kyle McCord, Syracuse

2024 stats: 4779/34/12/66%

Kyle McCord looked like a more confident player this year, whether it was having a starting season under his belt, rapport with the team and coaching staff at Syracuse, or just natural human development, his evolution was evident from day 1. As a result, he went out and set the ACC single-season passing yards record and led the Orange to a 10-win season, en route to a top 10 Heisman finish.

# RB Tahj Brooks, Texas Tech

2024 stats: 1505/17 rushing | 28/199/1 receiving

A 230lb bowling ball with back-to-back 1500 yard seasons, Brooks is one of the angriest runners in the class. He has mentioned Marshawn Lynch as the player he most models his game after and you can see that in his tenacity and eagerness to bury defenders with the stiff arm. Situationally, he averages his highest yards per carry on 3rd down and in the 4th quarter, so when the game is on the line, Tahj can be your go-to-guy and he had 8 games with over 25 carries this year, including multiple 30 carry games, so he has shown he can carry the bellcow workload.

# RB Jaydon Blue, Texas*

2024 stats: 730/8 rushing | 42/368/6 receiving

Blue is the opposite of Brooks in that he is a spark plug player, known for his speed and elusiveness rather than being an every down player. He had some ball security issues this season but if he can clean that up (many players do) he could translate his traits into meaningful production even in a time-share role. His 42 receptions this season put him near the top of the class as a pass-catcher.

*(According to Dane Brugler, Blue dropped out of the Shrine Bowl at the last minute, but I am keeping him here anyway because I already wrote this and he is in the linked video)*

# WR Ja'Corey Brooks, Louisville

2024 stats: 61/1013/9

Ja'Corey Brooks was one of the leading receivers at Alabama in 2022 before an injury-plagued year at Alabama in 2023. He transferred to Louisville and put up a 1,000 yard season in the ACC with 5 100-yard games. Brooks is a deep ball specialist who is also dangerous in the open field on crossing routes and in-breakers. More of a smooth mover than a twitchy guy, he makes things look easy.

# WR LaJohntay Wester, Colorado

2024 stats: 74/931/10

Wester was one of my favorite players in 2023 while playing as the #1 playmaker at Florida Atlantic. The transfer up to Colorado showed that he could still produce against stiffer competition and adapt his game from being an outside WR to playing mostly in the slot. The experience and quickness help him get open and combine to balance the slight frame (5'11 165). He averaged 19.9 per return as a punt returner at FAU in 2023 so he may be able to make his mark on special teams as well.

# TE Carter Runyan, Towson

2024 Stats: 45/502/5

Runyan was a very productive TE in the FCS at Towson and Albany. He has great size at 6'6 235 with an every down skill set: strong blocking ability, pass catching and good route creativity. He does play in-line some, but is more likely to be a slot/H-back type at the next level. If he holds up against higher level competition this week, he could be a real riser through the pre-draft process."

Black car with Iron ornaments and skulls + extreme tint,Austin,1i9x4p2,2025-01-25 16:09:54,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1i9x4p2/black_car_with_iron_ornaments_and_skulls_extreme/,bbbearxo,,"hey yall. Near domain and coworkers notice an all painted black car like an old cop car or taxi cab, with iron decorations like horses on the hood as well as small longhorn type skulls on the front grill. 
they were sitting for hours before a cop came through the lot, immediately leaving. 
before this a coworker noticed through the dark tint that both men in the car were wearing clown masks. 
I ain‚Äôt trynna manhunt anyone, just curious if anyone else has seen this car around or if we know anything about it. I‚Äôd prefer my work place not be somewhere that‚Äôs getting scoped out for who knows what. 
or it‚Äôd be cool to know there‚Äôs some chill juggalo or clown dudes living life instead of what could be. we‚Äôve had lots of incidents at our workplace with people, given the location, so better safe than sorry. "
Passport Replacement CRBA,Passports,1i9x4o5,2025-01-25 16:09:52,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Passports/comments/1i9x4o5/passport_replacement_crba/,SolidChemistry72,Application Question / Discussion,"My current passport is slightly damaged. I have been told by customs/airlines I should get it replaced and I could be rejected, but in other countries/airlines I have gotten through. I now no longer want to risk the damaged aspect of my passport, though it doesn't expire until 2027.   
The information page is fine, wear and tear to the front and back pages, but partial tear on back page near barcode. 

I currently have the passport in possession, but only have a photocopy of my CRBA (2 US citizen parents), Social, Drivers License and state gov issued ID. 

Will I be okay for my agency replacement appt with a photocopy CRBA or am I needed to get a new certified copy ? "
Persian Immortals with dark skin and Afros?,AskAnthropology,1i9x4nc,2025-01-25 16:09:50,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/1i9x4nc/persian_immortals_with_dark_skin_and_afros/,Cute-Function3043,,"I was researching ancient Indian, Persian and Iraqi civilizations and came across a picture of Persian Immortals depicted with dark skin and Afros. This struck me as odd because, like most of us, I wouldn‚Äôt typically view Persians as having dark skin or Afros. The source of the picture claims that the Persian Immortals were elite royal guards from Susa (near Iraq and Kuwait). Is it possible these people, from Susa, actually had dark skin and Afros?

I just bought a ps5slim,PS5HelpSupport,1i9x4mz,2025-01-25 16:09:49,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5HelpSupport/comments/1i9x4mz/i_just_bought_a_ps5slim/,Inevitable-Ad3251,,"Hey guys, so I purchased a PS5 Slim from BestBuy. The outside box looks clean and doesn‚Äôt seem to be damaged with no visible scratches, bent marks or rips. Unboxing looked pretty normal and had everything where it supposed to be but opening it further I noticed a couple scratch marks on the AC cord and also the charging cable. The console itself looks great no visible scratch marks or damages on the console or any near the plugins, but there is dust in the vents when you flash a light on. The employee did tell me it was brand new and kept assuring me to look at its round sticker seal, but ngl it was positioned so far to the left. So yeah maybe I‚Äôm just stupid or I‚Äôm just nitpicking at things caused by my OCD but yeah any input would be great. Console works great no coil whines, a bit laggy sometimes in the home menu, maybe caused by the new update but other than all that it works great and smooth. So the scratch marks on the wires and the dust is what‚Äôs making me think otherwise. Is this manufactured like this or is there a possibility I was given a used/open box mistakenly sold as new Idk I just want something to be new if I paid my money yanno, my gut could be tellin lies but if anything I‚Äôll just return it for a peace of mind. Let me kno y‚Äôall am I stupid or am I dumb üòÇ call me out and clown me for my stupidity "
An interest in Orthodoxy,OrthodoxChristianity,1i9x43v,2025-01-25 16:09:07,2,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1i9x43v/an_interest_in_orthodoxy/,PogoTheStrange,,"I was raised non-denominational Christian, and have been consistent in my beliefs my entire life, aligning mostly with the Baptist church. However Recently I felt called to look into other churches and denominations, and even though I knew nothing about orthodoxy before this, it's catching my attention most among other denominations. The art and music are beautiful, and the traditions are incredibly interesting. There are some things I disagree with that make me hesitate attending a service at the church near me. That could just be because of the church I was raised in. My question is, should I try going to a church, and talk to a priest about Orthodoxy, or should I read more about it before going?"
