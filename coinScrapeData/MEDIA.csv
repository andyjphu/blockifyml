scouting pre-22: Big Matches Hidden Attribute + media handling,footballmanagergames,1i9xhfa,2025-01-25 16:25:35,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/footballmanagergames/comments/1i9xhfa/scouting_pre22_big_matches_hidden_attribute_media/,drinkwaterbreatheair,Discussion,"I used to think that the Big Matches hidden attribute was completely unscoutable until the player turns 22, but it seems like media handling can actually give a bit of insight to it.

Having an Unflappable or Evasive media handling seem to be able to just about guarantee that the player won't have a negative Big Matches hidden attribute (orange or worse). 

It's not going to guarantee anything green, but I'm just happy enough when it's not bad. 

I've found myself really concentrating on those media handling types when scouting prospects because there's really not much worse than magikarping a prospect and finally getting him the club home grown tag - just to find out when he's 22 that he's got blood red Big Matches."

Someone keeps buying me fake followers,InstagramMarketing,1i9xh95,2025-01-25 16:25:22,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/InstagramMarketing/comments/1i9xh95/someone_keeps_buying_me_fake_followers/,applejuicelover124,,Hi so for about 3 years someone has been buying me fake followers and likes on my Instagram and tiktok. I had to privatise everything to stop them from doing it and had to delete like 7000 bots. They don’t do it for ages and then if I post something on tiktok they will just randomly buy me fake likes again. It’s been happening for so long and I have no idea who it is and there’s nothing on the social media’s in order to prevent this. I want to go public again but I’m just scared it’s going to happen again. Can I have any help?

Why do people constantly talk about CIA propaganda and then ignore how Russia has literally funded state independence movements in the US or how China has funded groups in Okinawa?,AmericaBad,1i9xgwp,2025-01-25 16:24:56,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9xgwp,GoldenStitch2,OP Opinion,"Also before someone comes at me for the Okinawa statement, I do think sexual assault is a big problem in the military and needs to be taken more seriously. There are a lot of bases over there and if the citizens want them removed then I believe they should be. But most of these cases do have the perpetrator taken into custody by Japanese law and while this isn’t an excuse, the Americans usually commit at lower rates than the locals. It’s also interesting how China does this out of “concern” but stays silent at the accusations towards Russia in African countries 🤔"

A moderator locked a a thread I had started because someone reported hostility. The mod admitted they weren’t going to read what I wrote because it was too long and locked it anyway. Is that how it works?

I responded, complaining that it was ridiculous for them not to read what I actually wrote and just assume the person accusing me of being hostile was correct.

If you’re not going to moderate, then why even be a mod? I don’t understand.

I spent a lot of time having good conversations with these folks, and now I can’t talk with them anymore—because a moderator didn’t want to read something they were supposed to moderate.

Clearly, now this is turned into just another social media outlet that is an echo chamber for people to censor one another without any evidence and silence people that they don’t agree with. And the thing is it’s like I didn’t even say a cuss word threatened any kind of violence or do anything like that I only mentioned that the person did not have a grasp of the English language that they thought they may have had. That’s it.  Then that’s offensive and hostile enough to get a thread locked and then subsequently banned? Unreal it’s like everybody in this country of fascist."

He treats me very well, and he has introduced me to all his friends and his twin brother who he is very close with. He explained to me that he doesn't date because a lot of women get insecure regarding his occupation, but I told him I'm not insecure & I don't care about the ""flaws"" of his occupation and he told me ""time will tell"". Anyway, we had a conversation before about dating/ relationships & he said that ""dating"" is when you're in a relationship. 


I disagreed because I feel like dating is when you go on dates & get to know someone which leads to a relationship. He disagreed with me and stood firm on his ideals. I am starting to question everything right now because this man has been kissing me, we've been intimate, and he started sharing his location with me. At the same time, when talking to other people he refers to me as a ""friend"". 


Ever since I met him we have never spent any 1 on 1 time together in public & he has never asked me on a date before. The only time it's just us is when he's in my bed and we're watching movies or playing video games. I love that it feels like we're best friends, but as a woman I want to be courted and asked on dates and just be treated like a lady. Last night his friends , I and him went to this bar and he showed me a post on social media that he agreed with saying we are single until we’re married and that was my last straw and what really triggered emotions in me. I feel like im constantly being emotionally played with. I just want someone to be intentional with me. I plan to have open honest communication with him about how I'm feeling, but I just needed to express this situation to somebody because it's making me so upset. This has been happening to me since I was 18 and I'm just so exhausted & upset.
TL:DR TL;DR: I (22F) & (26M) doesn’t take me on 1 on 1 dates, introduced me to all his friends, wants to be intimate with me, believes that dating = relationship, kisses me , & I’m tired of the BS. What do I do? How do I approach the situation? "
I’m a teacher and my mat was stolen from the studio after 2 weeks.

Only teachers keep their mats at this studio and there’s about 20-25 of us. 

The studio owner says it’s a “public space” so I am responsible, though she offered to covered 50% of the cost for a new mat. My mat was 7 years old, sentimental, and in a color scheme I can’t get now. The owner said they don’t have cameras so there’s no way to find out what happened. She did post about it on social media in case someone accidentally grabbed it, and she said this has never happened before. 

Here’s the thing that’s extra weird and possibly irrelevant: there’s another teacher at the studio and I’m friends with her ex, and we’ve been chatting a bit more since they broke up. I didn’t even realize she was his ex when I took the job with the studio and nor would that matter to me, she seems totally nice and normal. She came to my second class, the last class when I had my mat before it went missing. She is also close friends with the studio owner. On one hand, I can’t imagine another teacher stealing a mat. Just seems so counter to the whole practice. On the other hand, I had this same mat stored at studios over the last 7 years and nothing like this has ever happened. I live in a small city with little crime. 

Have you had your mat stolen from a studio? Should the owner be responsible since it’s a closed space? What should I do in this situation?? I am unsure if I want to keep teaching there.

Get Class-redictionism Out of Your Politics Now,socialism,1i9xatl,2025-01-25 16:17:28,1,0.6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1i9xatl/get_classredictionism_out_of_your_politics_now/,RocketSocket765,Discussion,"This week has been hell, especially for many in marginalized groups. Socialists, we need to talk.

Socialism is the antidote to fascism. We know this. However, we've seen clear and damaging psy-ops in recent years of U.S. civil unrest and pandemic isolation to try to convince particularly white, male leftists that we don't need to fight for ""the culture stuff."" Not just old, more obvious tricks, like Larouchites and Nazbols (or their new forms, like Patriotic Socialists, MAGA Communists, etc.) I'm talking about class reductionist ideology that more easily blends into leftist circles of the red-brownism in the ""post-left,"" suspected Thiel-funded ops, Jimmy Dore, and adjacent orgs that let members espouse similar ideas, I'll not name to not stir sectarianism.

The right wing has long tried to pervert the socialist phrase or sentiment of ""No war, but class war"" to mean we don't need to fight against discrimination used to divide the working-class class. If that's your view, ask: how is that working out this week? Do you think oligarchs are spending all that money on influencers, podcasters, and psy-ops telling people ""culture shit is not smart and isn't material, bro,"" for *the benefit of socialists*? No, they are because once they convince white men (or others at the top of social hierarchies) that they don't have to fight discrimination, then fascists will flood the zone where the fight been given up. White male socialists in particular are told to believe that the answer is as easy as, ""Just fight for class stuff, not culture stuff. So if I just talk about minimum wage increases and universal healthcare, socialism will grow."" Meanwhile, fascists this week are firing ""DEI"" workers, criminalizing immigrant workers and their families, erasing trans people, making women into birthing brood domestic servants they'd rather didn't work, and so on. You know, the ""culture stuff."" Yes, they have pounced on the fact that neoliberals have sold-out the fight for material needs of the working-class (wages, housing, education, healthcare, unions, etc.) But they are also pouncing on the idea they've been sowing to convince the working-class that we don't need to fight for each other against discrimination in those material spheres.

That, point blank, is not socialism.

The idea that issues are purely ""class"" or ""culture"" is a trap meant to divide us. I don't know where the line is, and I know the CIA, FBI, oligarchs, etc. have pushed people at different ends of cultural beliefs to sow division. I welcome resources on how we fight the socio-economic fight that is Marxism and reject class-redictionism. If you don't support class reductionism, good! But some do. We need this reality-check pronto against very wealthy interests trying to convince the working-class otherwise.To dismiss it as ""a few online"" is foolish. How many times do we need to see fascists artificially inflate, take over, and flood social media before we treat this as the threat it is? The fascist horrorshow this week shows they know how material ""culture and identity stuff"" is too. So, when pushing socialism as the way forward, we must say, ""No war, but class war"" means we fight discrimination oligarchs use to divide the working-class as well. Not easy, but if we don't hold that principle and work to enact it, fascists win. "

However, this student seems to be completely obsessed with Dragon Ball Z. He wears Dragon Ball Z t-shirts and brings his own Dragon Ball Z mangas from home, so I assume his parents are fine with him being exposed to THAT.

I had a reoccurring dream of this best friend i had in middle school and i have no idea why, but i always used to think what ever happened to her ? and how much  i miss her. That was my best friend back then and we related to each other a lot. We lost contact because i lost her number , she doesn’t even have social media either so it was hard trying to find her. I live in a big city I hardly ever seen someone I’ve met/ know again. But today i had to run a quick errand  literally in my neighborhood and I went to the cashier and she was there just working. and i was mind blown. I said “omg brianna?” she’s like “yes you made my day seeing you” we caught up and exchanged numbers and honestly i feel so happy to have seen her again. She was such a big part of my life 


I did not tell her i was dreaming about her because that would be weird LOL. but i’d like to share on here because that really surprised me. Has this ever happened to anyone? "

Getting closure with an ex?,relationships,1i9x6i5,2025-01-25 16:12:09,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1i9x6i5/getting_closure_with_an_ex/,frenchtoastwrld,,"I, (23F) have been dating my boyfriend (23M) for nearly 4 years now and I’m in the happiest relationship I’ve ever been in. I know that I am very much in love with him and could see myself spending the rest of my life with him. Before I started dating my now boyfriend, I was in a situationship with someone else during my time at college. He wasn’t a bad guy but we were toxic for each other and it never progressed to us actually dating because he always had an excuse as to why he wasn’t ready, for the sake of the story let’s call him E. I was 19 at the time and didn’t know better, and it ultimately ended away. I’ve had a few boyfriends before but for some reason, 5 years later I can’t get E out of my head. I don’t romanticize him in my head, but I always catch myself checking to see if he viewed my posts on social media, things like that. Since this was half a decade ago, I truly thought I was over him which is why I let him follow me, and the thing is I am over him in some way but not entirely. I know that I never want to be with him, but I think because I never got the closure I always wanted it I kept the door cracked open a bit. About a month ago, he randomly messaged me and asked if he can take me out for a drink to catch up. I haven’t answered, but a part of me feels guilty for wanting to, and even more guilty for wanting to go. I don’t want to disrespect my current relationship, but if my current boyfriend is someone I want to be with in the long run, I feel like a part of me needs to be sure this chapter of my life is over and I’m just not sure how to do it. If anyone has been in a similar situation or can just speak from experience on how to move forward with the situation, I’d really appreciate any responses. Please be kind :)

TL;DR: I want to get closure from an old fling that has been in the back of my mind for a while now but feel guilty because I am in a relationship with someone I genuinely am in love with, but want to be sure this chapter of my life is closed before moving into the next part of my life with my current partner "

How do I give up the desire for romantic companionship?,MuslimCorner,1i9x60v,2025-01-25 16:11:32,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimCorner/comments/1i9x60v/how_do_i_give_up_the_desire_for_romantic/,IAmTryingToBeHopeful,SUPPORT,"A little disclaimer... I'm well aware regarding the number of men that will try and use this to forward their ill agenda. I'm looking for genuine advice regarding my situation. 

I yearn for companionship and love. Constantly. It's taking over my life. I want to be loved and cared for. Before anyone tells me to get married, I can't. I have personal issues that have to be taken care of. It'll be a while before I am in a position to look for marriage. I don't want to go into detail but believe me, I cannot get married anytime soon. I'm in my mid twenties and it'll be a very long time before I begin the search. 

Everyday I dream of being loved and loving someone. I've tried everything to fill this emotional void. I've thrown myself into work, gym, eating healthy, limiting social media, being regular with my prayers. If someone tells me to have more meaningful conversations with my friends, I have and I do. But no matter what I do, nothing fills that yearning. It's always there. There is this deep sense of lonliness that is always there. 

I'll take breaks from work or I'd be simply eating and I'll get this overwhelming urge to just cry and break down in tears because of how hopeless everything is. 

I know marriage is a big responsibility. I know for a fact that one can even be lonely in a marriage. I also know that love is not guaranteed in a marriage. But despite knowing this, despite trying everything, why am I constantly feeling an urge to be romantically cared for? I'm not fooled by social media before anyone says anything. I'm well aware that what is displayed and what is reality are two different things. 

I guess what I'm asking is... how do I stop this feeling of wanting love? Every second of every day, I constantly daydream about loving a man and him understanding and caring for me. 

They say you will be tested with what your heart desires most and it seems this is my biggest test of all. I've tried everything. I don't know what else I can do or limit. The yearning is always there. 

Also, before anyone says to try therapy, I've also been down that route. I'm well aware of my childhood trauma and the emotional neglect I've faced. I know my parents and family cared for me but they could never emotionally fulfill me. 

Any help or advice would honestly be appreciated. I just want this feeling to stop. A part of me feels like I will spend my whole life yearning after what may not even be destined for me. There is this heavy grief that is constantly inside me. No matter what I do. It is there. It is like I am constantly mourning the permanent loss of love in my life. Like I will never experience it. I don't know what the future holds. But why am I constantly mourning or why do I constantly feel an ache or grief over something I haven't experienced? I want to be loved but it seems like it'll never happen.

What to wear to the Short n Sweet Tour?,SabrinaCarpenterFans,1i9x5cq,2025-01-25 16:10:41,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SabrinaCarpenterFans/comments/1i9x5cq/what_to_wear_to_the_short_n_sweet_tour/,beth_rwan,:tour2: TOURING :tour1:,"Hi all! I'm going to see Sabrina for the first time in March with the Europe leg of the tour and I was hoping you could help me decide an outfit? Basically, I'm between 2 outfits.

1. I love vintage (50's/60's) clothing (full disclosure, vintage style **not values**!) so I happen to have a lot of vintage lingerie/sleepwear, for example I own a couple bodysuits (image shows straps, but it can be made strapless) and babydolls similar to what Sabrina wears in the first act of the show. However I'm not sure how I feel about wearing ACTUAL LINGERIE IN PUBLIC. Let alone go on social media (I'm always terrified no matter how private I make it it will get screen-shotted and reposted and somehow a potential employer/boyfriend/my family will see it). I know I could just not post to social media, but being realistic I know I'm going to want to. Also, while I know Sabrina has worn black on stage, I'm not sure it fits the colour palette of this tour? 

1. Back up idea: I do have some pink silk and lace PJs, which is probably a safer bet/less risqué and I thought matched the vintage 'girls night in' sleepover vibe? 

Anyway I'll attach the images below (full description of each item in the captions) and please let me know your thoughts? Or if they're all bad ideas and I should just wear normal clothes like a normal person, either way thank you in advance and wishing you all the best!

AITA for Not Letting My Friend Borrow Money Again After She Never Paid Me Back?,AITAH,1i9x3u3,2025-01-25 16:08:47,4,1.0,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i9x3u3/aita_for_not_letting_my_friend_borrow_money_again/,HiddenWondersX,Advice Needed,"I (26F) have a friend, “Amber” (26F), who I’ve known for years. A few months ago, she asked if she could borrow $300 to cover some unexpected expenses. She promised to pay me back within two weeks, and since I’ve always trusted her, I agreed.

Well, two weeks came and went, and I didn’t hear anything. I waited a little longer before gently asking about it, and she said she was still “sorting things out” and would pay me back soon. Another month passed, and still nothing.

I asked again, and this time, she got defensive, saying she was stressed and I needed to be patient. Meanwhile, I noticed she was posting pictures on social media of shopping trips, nights out, and even a weekend getaway.

Last week, she asked if she could borrow another $200 because she was “short on rent.” I told her no and brought up the fact that she still hadn’t paid me back the first $300. She got upset, saying I was being unfair and should know she’d pay me back eventually.

Now she’s giving me the cold shoulder and telling our mutual friends I’m “stingy” and “not a real friend.” Some of them think I should’ve just lent her the money to avoid the drama, but I feel like I’m being taken advantage of.

AITA for refusing to lend her more money?"
$TRUMP Analysis from  former bank regulator and long-time crypto follower.,OfficialTrumpCoin,1i9x3ox,2025-01-25 16:08:36,6,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OfficialTrumpCoin/comments/1i9x3ox/trump_analysis_from_former_bank_regulator_and/,TrumpDynastyCoin,General,"I want to share my perspective on $TRUMP with you all. I was a risk management bank examiner at the FDIC from 2008 to 2020. I came in after college. 

When Bitcoin started making headlines, I would ask senior examiners what they thought of it and the ambition of the Bitcoin community to ""replace the banking system"" as the community was promising.

Consensus was, since this is not a government backed financial instrument, it is instead a very risky commodity because the government can shut it down (see China for details of a country doing just that).  If there was any threat to the Federal Reserve system or the US's ability to manage inflation, the government would end the currency unless they decided to adopt their own.

Their assessment has been correct thus far. Modern banking is a system of institutions taking deposits and lending them to creditworthy borrowers. None of the crypto coins even touch this function. The only lending going on that I'm aware of in crypto (without fiat conversion) is trustless margin loans.  This means that no one is going to lend to you for your house or your car or your business because they would have to perform trust analysis (credit analysis) that you are good for paying them back.  To this day, crypto is a trustless system. Actual banking is a trustful system, where the repayment capacity of a borrower and the repayment history develops that trust.

Instead, crypto is a highly price-volatile money transfer system. That's it. None of the utility functions or communities create any value (distributable profit) that meaningfully justifies these coins beyond hype pumping. As a result, the crypto that isn't used as a transfer system, are instead casino games where the exchanges are the casinos.

All this being said, I believe that $TRUMP has the power of media in the U.S. and the power of MAGA to force it into government adoption.  I also think that Trump will wisely try to regulatory capture a coin or two, meaning that he will dismiss all other coins and continue to call crypto a fraud, besides the selected coins that he names as legitimate. He has a multi-billion dollar incentive to make his coin one of the regulatory captured cryptocurrencies. Dumping $TRUMP or sitting on the sidelines is a bet that he won't do this.

So far, the senior examiners I worked with have been 100% correct about Bitcoin and crypto. They will still be correct about it if the U.S. government adopts crypto, because that is what they said is lacking to legitimize it as a real currency. For now we are dealing with the equivalent of buying and selling digitized pokemon cards. Trump has the power to change that and he will if it means he and his people stand to make billions (hint, at 80% ownership, it stands to make the Trump dynasty trillions). MMW

So, why do these examiners opinions matter? They have 40+ years evaluating the financial viability of financial institutions. Most people in these subs don't even know that a deposit to a bank is a liability on a bank's balance sheet (a loan from the borrower to the bank). 99% of the crypto community are gamblers but they don't even know what game they are playing. Are you one of them?

Trump can initially bring $TRUMP into the ""digital asset reserves"" and then his family can try to use his crypto-king wealth and MAGA following to copy Elon and appoint future presidents. A line of future presidents can eventually adopt $TRUMP as the U.S. currency. He could also use levers over inflation (such as his tariffs) to destabilize trust in the USD to advance the likelihood of adoption.

The last paragraph is my speculation. It's not a long con. It's Trump saying, ok... congrats Bitcoin, you have proven that crypto is a viable currency. I will take it from here, the first US crypto will have my name and face on it. It is the legitimization of crypto that we have all been anticipating. Place your bets wisely, because all crypto outside of the regulatory captures coins will be devastated."

Everything on social media and YouTube is always “omgggggg this is AMAZING!!!!!!” But I want to know average people’s thoughts before I go buy a product, so I thought hey, I’ll go first and tell you about this random product I used. 

Pros : left my skin feeling soft, reasonably priced, has a pretty matte finish 

Cons: odd texture, difficult to spread, takes a long time to sink in


Overall, I thought this was very effective BUT I just didn’t enjoy using it. The texture is different from any other moisturizer I’ve tried. It’s kind of gluey, like a really thick paste with a little tackiness to it and it’s VERY hard to spread on your face. It has a light blue color to it so you can see where you are putting it on, and you have to really rub it in. 

That being said, I liked the finish of it. This is pretty matte, and I personally HATE the shiny finish that’s so popular these days. It also left my skin feeling really soft the next morning. I also liked that it’s pretty affordable. 

Would I repurchase it? Eh. I didn’t NOT like it, but also there are soooooo many moisturizers on the market that I don’t see the point in paying for one that isn’t enjoyable to use. "

So no secret for us more nerdy people that a lot of media is lib stuff and its fine for us to consume as long as we aware

but that said how about judging peoples politics for their consumption and all?  TBH I see this on twitter where people seem to believe that because they realize manga has lib tendencies they are radical revolutionaries

For example for us Naruto fans someone called me a lib leaning conservative for just explaining the circumstances of why Itachi massacred his clan

and I find this really juvenile or what a 14 year old might say

So anyway whats a balanced approached to this?"

My worst date - Amazon woman takes nerd bowfishing,sweetnsourpod,1i9x0io,2025-01-25 16:04:35,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/sweetnsourpod/comments/1i9x0io/my_worst_date_amazon_woman_takes_nerd_bowfishing/,MisterMrErik,Podcast suggestions,"So, this was years ago when I was fresh out of college. I would go on 2-3 dates per week as I was new to the area and I was in my ""yes to everything"" era. I met a girl on Tinder, we went to dinner. Dinner went well, and it was \~9pm when the dinner was wrapping up that she asked me ""Do you want to come bowfishing with me?"".

I said ""sure, what time?"" and she responded ""right now"".

We went back to my apartment to get some boots and change into jeans, because I figured we would be walking through mud and dirt. **I was not prepared enough.**

The date quickly progressed through 3 levels of **bad**:

# Level 1: Maybe she's not for me

She offered to drive. It was late at night, and she told me there was a great shortcut to get to the stream. She was blasting country music and speeding 70mph in a 45mph area until we reached a parking lot near a graveyard. Walking through the graveyard was the shortcut. At this point she was my ride back home, so I couldn't exactly protest and leave. She grabbed some equipment from her trunk, and we walked through the graveyard (on the designated walking path, not on graves) to a stream.

# Level 2: This woman is Tarzan. I am NOT Jane.

We go to a bridge and she hands me a flashlight. She says ""point the flastlight at the fish you see in the stream and I'll shoot them"". I don't know if I'm dumb, blind, or both, but I couldn't see fish anywhere. *I felt like a child holding a flashlight for my dad when he was fixing stuff in the crawlspace under the house.* She repeated: ""Hold the flashlight steady! Aim it over there! Do you know what you're doing????"" but eventually I figured it out.

**Then she Urgot ults some fish.** Straight up shoots the arrow directly into a fish, the arrow has a fishing line on it, so she reels it in, and then stomps on it in front of me. ""These carp are very invasive, so we just fish them out and kill them.""

I'm a city boy who struggles to kills spiders. At this point I'm mentally holding on for dear life.

# Level 3: Emsculation is an understatement

Remember how I said I was not prepared enough? Well, I'm wearing hiking boots and jeans. She's in short shorts and rubber thigh-high boots. She says ""Hey let's go over there."" and points across the stream to a small island as she starts to wade into a shallow part of the stream. It was only 2-3 feet deep. I say ""I'm not dressed for this"" and she looks at me and without skipping a beat says ""Oh that's true... Hop on my back!""

So I did.... I **hopped on her back** and she carried me across the stream. Now this woman is my ride back across the stream AND my ride home. She urgot ulted a few more fish and I think she noticed I was not having much fun, so she called it a day and took me home.



Needless to say, we did not have a second date. I actually started dating my now fiancee shortly after her but I set her up with my fiancee's friend who actually loves bowfishing. His reaction: ""She's way too country for me."" This was years ago, but I think I still have a video or 2 from her social media that shows her bowfishing that I can share privately (don't want to dox her)."

Is this a good build for first-time home server?,HomeServer,1i9wzkj,2025-01-25 16:03:25,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeServer/comments/1i9wzkj/is_this_a_good_build_for_firsttime_home_server/,handelspariah,,"Hey all, looking to get a buddy check on my home server build, which I intend to use as a NAS/media server (Jellyfin) as well as run some services. Also, potentially store security camera footage at some point down the line, though I might forego doing that DIY and just buy an NVR--not sure if home security is something I want to tinker with that much.

I've recently got a Aoostar WTR Pro with the Ryzen 7 5825u, but no RAM or storage. I already had 4x4TB Seagate IronWolf ST4000VN008 5900RPM HDDs which I plan on using in a RaidZ1 config. 

The WTR Pro also has space for 2 PCIe Gen 3x4 M.2 slots, as well as a spot that I can use an adapter card to fit an additional m.2-2230 drive, at PCIe Gen 3x1.

My current plan is to get the following SSDs and RAM:

2x TEAMGROUP MP33 1 TB [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XHMBQK3?tag=pcpapi-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XHMBQK3?tag=pcpapi-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1)

1x Kioxia BG4 512GB m.2-2230 for that extra slot, to use as a boot drive. [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B9NTRGGF/ref=ewc\_pr\_img\_1?smid=A1WU50RJKPK4WC&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B9NTRGGF/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=A1WU50RJKPK4WC&psc=1)

My current plan, which I'm looking to see if I'm doing anything extraordinarily stupid or if my hardware is a bad pick for any of this, is to install Proxmox as my operating system with ZFS pools for the HDDs and use the 2 1TB SSDs as a mirrored cache pool. I could also install TrueNAS on a VM in Proxmox, though my understanding is that this isn't actually necessary to use Proxmox to run a NAS.

My biggest concerns are that there's something I'm fundamentally missing, or that this plan doesn't actually make sense for a reason that I'm not yet educated enough on home servers to anticipate.

  
Thank you all in advance for any advice you can offer a newcomer looking to dive into the deep end!"

R806FA fronts, R50c center, and R40M surrounds.  Added the R120SWi. And powered it with a Denon S760H. Other than poor atmos performance I love the sound, my wife on the other hand does not, it’s too loud. So now I want to finish the basement and turn it into a media room.  I plan on leaving the current system where it’s at and getting new for the basement. 
On my wishlist I have RP8000 II for the fronts, a 504C II center, 4 RP600M II for the surrounds and 4 CDT5800CII for Atmos, and 2 RP1400SW, powered by an Onkyo RZ70.
My questions are

1. Are the RP600M II overkill for surrounds?  Would RP500M be just as good for half the price?

2. As far as Atmos goes are the CDT5800CII overkill?  The price isn’t much, 120 for all 4 speakers over the CDT5650CII. Or would R1650C be enough for the minimal sound that’s comes out of the Atmos?"

In-Depth Analysis of the Stella &amp; Dot 2025 MLM Business Model
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Stella &amp; Dot 2025 MLM business model offers an intriguing opportunity for individuals looking to break into the world of direct sales and multi-level marketing. This innovative model combines fashion with an engaging social experience, attracting those who are passionate about jewelry and accessories. To truly understand this business model, it's essential to analyze its structure, benefits, challenges, and overall effectiveness in 2025.

### Understanding the MLM Structure

In a multi-level marketing (MLM) framework, individuals do not only earn money from selling products, but also from recruiting others into the business. Here’s how the structure generally works:

- **Direct Sales:** Representatives, known as Stylists, sell Stella &amp; Dot's jewelry and accessories directly to customers through parties, social media, and personal networks.
- **Recruitment:** Stylists can recruit other Stylists. When these recruits make sales, the original Stylist earns a percentage of that commission.
- **Commission Structure:** Each Stylist receives a predetermined commission based on their sales volume, with potential for additional bonuses based on their team’s performance.

### Benefits of Joining Stella &amp; Dot

Choosing to become a Stylist with Stella &amp; Dot comes with several appealing benefits:

- **Flexibility:** Stylists enjoy the freedom to set their schedules and work at their own pace, making it ideal for those balancing other commitments.
- **Low Startup Costs:** The initial investment is relatively low compared to other business ventures, which decreases barriers to entry.
- **Access to Quality Products:** Stella &amp; Dot is known for stylish and high-quality jewelry and accessories, which are attractive to a wide customer base.
- **Training and Support:** New Stylists receive comprehensive training and resources to help them succeed, enhancing their chances of achieving their financial goals.

### Challenges to Consider

Like any other business model, Stella &amp; Dot's MLM structure presents its unique set of challenges:

- **Market Saturation:** As more Stylists join, the competition can become fierce, making it harder to secure sales and recruit new members.
- **Income Variability:** Income can highly fluctuate based on sales and recruitment success. Not all Stylists earn substantial profits, which can lead to disappointment.
- **Time Investment:** Building a successful business requires significant commitment and effort, and results may not be immediate.

### Evaluating the Potential Earnings

Understanding potential earnings is crucial in assessing the Stella &amp; Dot business model. Earnings can vary widely based on individual effort and market dynamics. Here are some key factors that influence income:

- **Sales Performance:** Stylists earn a percentage off their direct sales, so higher individual sales result in better earnings.
- **Team Growth:** Successfully recruiting and managing a team can amplify earnings significantly through commissions on their sales.
- **Promotions and Bonuses:** Various incentives can boost earnings, such as bonuses for hitting specific milestones.

### Customer Experience and Brand Loyalty

The Stella &amp; Dot brand emphasizes a unique shopping experience, which significantly enhances customer loyalty. The emphasis on quality, design, and the community aspect helps retain customers. Customers are encouraged to participate in events, enabling them to experience products firsthand while building relationships with Stylists.

Moreover, stylish, on-trend offerings ensure that customers feel they’re making a fashionable choice. This commitment to customer satisfaction further supports Stylists by fostering repeat business and referrals.

### Final Thoughts on Joining Stella &amp; Dot in 2025

The decision to join Stella &amp; Dot as a Stylist in 2025 can be rewarding for motivated individuals. With the right mix of enthusiasm, commitment, and strategic organization, it offers an excellent balance of product quality and social engagement. However, potential Stylists should carefully weigh the benefits against the challenges inherent in the MLM model. Conducting thorough research and evaluating personal goals is vital in making an informed decision about this vibrant business opportunity.

Success Stories from Stella &amp; Dot Consultants
-------------------------------------------------

Many people are looking for ways to earn extra income or find a community that empowers them. Stella &amp; Dot, a popular jewelry and accessories brand, has become a favored choice for those interested in direct sales. Numerous consultants have shared their unique success stories, offering insights into how they achieved their goals and transformed their lives through this opportunity.

### Flexible Work-Life Balance

One of the most appealing aspects of being a Stella &amp; Dot consultant is the flexibility it offers. Many consultants have tailored their work around family commitments or other jobs. For instance, Sarah from Texas, a mother of three, used Stella &amp; Dot as a way to support her family financially while still being present at home. She hosts trunk shows in the evenings and on weekends, allowing her to engage with clients while managing household duties.

### Built Community and Lasting Friendships

Being a consultant often leads to much more than just sales; it fosters community. Emily from California recounts how she began her journey with Stella &amp; Dot, initially as a way to earn extra cash.

Common Misconceptions About the MLM Structure of Stella &amp; Dot
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Many people are drawn to the direct selling world of Stella &amp; Dot, captivated by the opportunity it presents for entrepreneurship and financial independence. However, there are several common misconceptions about the multi-level marketing (MLM) structure that surrounds this company. Understanding these misconceptions can help you navigate the landscape more effectively and make informed decisions about engaging with Stella &amp; Dot.

### The Myth of Guaranteed Income

One prevalent misconception is that joining Stella &amp; Dot guarantees a steady income. It's essential to recognize that earnings in an MLM structure depend significantly on individual effort, sales skills, and team building. Just because you sign up doesn’t mean you’ll start earning a paycheck immediately. Many factors play a role in your financial success, such as:

- Your sales capabilities
- Your ability to recruit others
- The demand for the products in your area
- Your networking skills

Like any business venture, the level of income you can achieve is proportional to the amount of effort you invest.

### High Startup Costs

Some potential recruits hesitate to join Stella &amp; Dot because they fear high upfront costs. While it is true that there is an initial investment to become a Stylist, many find it to be reasonable compared to starting a traditional business. Your investment typically includes a starter kit with jewelry and accessories, training materials, and marketing tools. Also, the beauty of MLM is that you can sell to friends and family to recoup your cost quickly, leveraging your social circle for initial sales.

### Misunderstanding Commissions and Bonuses

Many individuals wrongly believe that earning commissions in Stella &amp; Dot is complicated. In reality, the compensation structure is straightforward once understood. You earn a percentage of your personal sales, and as your team grows, you can receive additional bonuses from their sales. This tiered reward system truly incentivizes Stylists to work both independently and collaboratively:

- Personal sales: You keep a percentage based on your total sales.
- Team commissions: You earn from your recruits’ sales.
- Performance bonuses: Extra incentives for achieving specific sales goals.

Taking time to analyze the compensation plan can empower you with the knowledge to maximize your earnings potential.

### Skepticism Toward Product Quality

A common misconception about Stella &amp; Dot is that the quality of its products might be subpar. This concern often arises when individuals compare it to traditional retail brands. However, Stella &amp; Dot prides itself on offering high-quality, trendy jewelry and accessories. The company continuously invests in design and customer feedback, ensuring that the products resonate with current fashion trends while maintaining durability.

### The Reluctance to Network

Some people fear that multi-level marketing involves pushing products onto friends and family, creating uncomfortable dynamics. This misconception can deter potential Stylists from joining. However, Stella &amp; Dot emphasizes building authentic relationships rather than just selling. The focus is on connecting with people and sharing products that you truly love. Here are some healthy networking tips:

- Create genuine connections with potential customers.
- Host fun and engaging trunk shows to showcase products.
- Leverage social media to share your passion for the products.

You can foster a positive experience without compromising your personal relationships.

### Time Commitment Misunderstandings

Many individuals assume joining Stella &amp; Dot requires a significant time commitment, limiting their ability to participate. However, one of the key benefits of MLM is the flexibility it offers. Stylists can tailor their schedules based on their lifestyles. Whether you want to make it a part-time gig or a full-time endeavor, Stella &amp; Dot allows you to determine your level of commitment. You can work at your pace and adjust as needed based on personal demands and goals.

Understanding these common misconceptions surrounding the MLM structure of Stella &amp; Dot is crucial for anyone considering joining. By dispelling myths about guaranteed income, startup costs, commissions, product quality, networking, and time commitments, you’ll be better prepared to assess your options and make sound decisions. A clear understanding of what to expect can empower you to navigate your journey successfully and thrive in the world of direct sales.

How to find inspiration from confident role models,MaximizeMe,1i9wupw,2025-01-25 15:57:40,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1i9wupw/how_to_find_inspiration_from_confident_role_models/,liveitupdeals,,"🌟 **Hey MaximizeMe Community!** 🌟

Ever feel like you're stuck in a rut and just can't seem to find that spark? Well, you're not alone! 💡 A lot of us can hit a wall when it comes to motivation and confidence. But here's the good news: there's a way out, and it's called finding inspiration from confident role models. 🚀 Let's dive into how you can leverage this to level up your life!

**Why Look Up to Role Models? 🤔**

Having a role model isn't just about idolizing someone — it's about learning from them. Confident role models show us that success and self-assuredness are possible. They pave the way with their experiences and provide a roadmap of sorts for us to follow. Plus, they can offer insights into overcoming obstacles that we're likely to face on our own journeys. 🙌

**How to Find the Right Role Models for You 🔍**

1. **Identify Your Goals:** What are you passionate about? Where do you want to see yourself in the future? Finding role models who are successful in areas you care about can provide you with practical advice and motivation.
   
2. **Diverse Possibilities:** Don’t limit yourself. Look for role models across different fields and backgrounds. Having a variety of influences can enrich your perspective.

3. **Online Communities & Forums:** Platforms like Reddit are treasure troves for discovering inspiring stories. Subreddits that focus on personal growth, career development, or even niche hobbies can be a great starting point.

**Engage and Learn! 📚**

Once you've found who inspires you, delve into their work and life. Read their books, listen to their podcasts, follow their social media, and most importantly, try to understand their mindset. What habits do they cultivate? How do they tackle setbacks? The more you learn, the more tools you'll have in your own arsenal.

**Building Your Own Confidence Through Observation 💪**

Watch how your role models handle confidence. Is it their posture? The way they speak? Their unwavering belief in their mission, perhaps? Internalizing these traits gradually can enhance your own confidence. Remember, confidence is a skill that can be developed over time with practice and exposure to positive influences.

**Stay Inspired and Keep Moving Forward 🌈**

Remember, the goal isn't to become a carbon copy of your role model but to take the best parts and integrate them into your own life. Keep tweaking and experimenting to find what resonates with you. Also, don’t forget to share your journey with our MaximizeMe community — we all learn from each other! 😊

"Drag Racing to Stream This Weekend (January 24-26, 2025)",dragracing,1i9wuha,2025-01-25 15:57:23,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragracing/comments/1i9wuha/drag_racing_to_stream_this_weekend_january_2426/,Friendly-Army-8748,,"Hi everyone, bit late with this one but I had some last-minute additions to make. This is perhaps the first big weekend for drag racing this year. Drag racing action will be streaming from the United States, Australia, Bahrain, and Qatar, so there is a lot to look forward to.

Beginning with the United States, the U.S. Street Nationals at Bradenton Motorsports Park just outside Bradenton, Florida, will be the unofficial start to the major racing season in the country. This year it serves as both the second round of the inaugural Drag Illustrated Winter Series for outlaw Pro Mod and the second round of the 2024/2025 Radial Outlaws Racing Series for several radial tire classes. The categories to be contested are Pro Mod, Pro 275, X275, Limited Drag Radial, No Time Shootout, No Time Truck Shootout, Ultra Street, Outlaw 632, Limited 235, and 5.50, 6.50, and 6.50 Index classes.

Additionally, NHRA Summit Racing Series bracket racing is getting started across the country. North of where the U.S. Street Nationals are taking place, the Scorpion E.T. Series will get underway with races 1 and 2 at Gainesville Raceway near Gainesville, Florida. On the opposite side of the country, near Phoenix, Arizona, Team Firebird races 1 and 2 will take place at Firebird Motorsports Park.

Over in Australia, the postponed but long-anticipated NDRC New Year Nitro race will take place at Willowbank Raceway in Willowbank, Queensland. Top fuel dragsters and funny cars will be the main event, while the Aeroflow Sportsman Series also competes over the weekend.

In Bahrain, the third round of the Bahrain Drag Racing Championship will take place at Bahrain International Circuit in Sakhir, Bahrain. The Bahrain1 team will be expected to perform well in the Pro Mod class there.

Finally, in Qatar, Round 3 of the Arabian Drag Racing League will be conducted at the Qatar Racing Club's dragstrip in Doha, Qatar. I'm personally interested in seeing if NHRA Top Fuel driver Shawn Langdon can continue his win streak in the 4.50 Index class there.

The event listing follows below.

How LOA saved me from a horrible week (aka Three Success Stories.),lawofassumption,1i9wu2n,2025-01-25 15:56:55,4,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1i9wu2n/how_loa_saved_me_from_a_horrible_week_aka_three/,HistoricalAd4683,,"Hey Everyone,
I actually was part of this sub and was primarily manifesting my Sp, this was my last post before I deleted my account two weeks ago: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1hywe6m/sp_success_story/
.
Old story: A day after I made this post,
1. I went into a Terrible accident

2. failed my exam and wasn't able to do submit my project and losing all semester credit points

3. My bank card got stolen.

4. For the first time in months, I was again in depression and medication. 

5. I ended up sending a long confession to sp that I still think about us reconciling and it was just something I hated doing. 

All of this happened within 48hrs.


I deleted this account out of embarrassment after my sp didn't respond to my msg but ignored it. 



What happened aka Success Stories:
1. My card got return to me as it wasn't stolen but simply lost in train, along with that I received new years money from my family, a new work from home job offer (less paying but still), two interviews.
2. Professor allowed me to send him a project report. Although I won't be able to pass the exam he has given me a reschedule slot next Month itself which would save me an entire semester.
3. One of my old friend ended up showing in my life after 2.5 years, I lost touch with him but talking to him calmed me down. He reminded me of who I was 15 years back and he said he always admired my strength and delusional confidence. Talking to someone who has seen you grow is something which reminds you of your roots and from where you came from and how unbreakable you are. I needed exactly that to set me straight. I felt he has a crush on me, don't know yet tho..?
4. My Sp replied a day later, he sent a melting face emoji and ""Okay"" to me. He said everything will be good in the end. An Okay and a very vague message isn't a yes but also not a No. So, I take it as a subtle positive sign because last year he said to me we are incompatible and he doesn't see us together at all. Apart from my confession, I noticed just how much sp knows about my life despite nc and not following on social media. He is almost like a Fan at this point lol.

(These stories although little are huge because I live alone in a foreign country, and losing your wallet, getting forced bed rest, failing in career and depression all at the same time is horrendous.)

What I did:
1. I Affirmed: Everything Is in my favour despite it all. 
2. I gave into my sadness for the first two days but then practiced Gratitude for what I have. I wrote long paragraphs to my family, friends and myself. Even to life in general.
3. I kept a strong mental diet, I absolutely didn't allow myself to waver. I cried a lot but I didn't broke and gave up.
4. I assumed in my favour. I wrote a list as Best Case Scenario and wrote it all working out in whatever way I felt. And the next day I wrote again renaming the list as 'The only scenario'.
5. I observed my dominant belief came true aka my Logical (How of Manifesting) came true. I internally knew I wouldn't pass the exam but professor could be lenient with project. I knew sp is shy and he wouldn't reciprocate today but I know he will randomly in a week or two. I knew I will never go broke and i didn't.
.

I am back because although I reached rock bottom, lessons I learned here helped me in this two weeks.
I guess it all boils down to being natural and not making Manifesting/Loa a process or a task to do but rather just the way to be. Be in your own team and be your own cheerleader or your own coach and trust your team.
I struggle with this some days but there are days like this when I succeed so I'm really grateful.
I hope I keep learning more and more and making loa and manifesting a way to live for me for the rest of the year and see myself get that Engineering Job, A healthy lifestyle with me being confident of my body and a beautiful reconciliation and relationship with my Sp.

Like time spent on reddit, instagram, youtube, etc? Sometimes I hear crazy stories of people in relationships where one of the partners is constantly on media, scrolling through reddit, watching youtube, scrolling ticktok. It seems like it’s never enough. How do you deal with a spouse that is specifically a resident or attending that is just constantly on media? 


I feel like that’s the worst part of this generation, people drown in media and there is over overconsumption of too much without paying attention to the things that truly matter. People get lost scrolling through Reddit or watching Youtube shorts or Ticktock, actual human communication is lost….

How do you not let it affect ur personal life when your partner is constantly indulging in media, even when taking a poo. The shower. Anytime, even while eating. Even when going to sleep.

I get it its a way to destress for some, but at one point, its addictive and there has to be a line.

I get it, work is hard, people want to stay updated and destress, but holy crap, some people are flat out addicted. Go enjoy your family, talk to your parents, communicate with your spouse. Something real and actually important.

"Can we compile a thread of sources that explain what is currently happening, and how it will immediately and long-term affect most regular people ?",fednews,1i9wsw7,2025-01-25 15:55:28,13,0.88,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/fednews/comments/1i9wsw7/can_we_compile_a_thread_of_sources_that_explain/,mcm199124,Misc Question,"I know it will be a drop in the bucket, but I do want to make a post so that at least my friends/family who follow me on social media, if they will take a second to look, are aware of what’s happening and how it will affect them.  So I am looking for any sources (articles, etc) that can be shared… ideally without paywall, and without an exceedingly sensationalist/sky-is-falling tone (though for many of us, it feels this way) and ideally they are succinct/easy to follow… that summarizes the direct and indirect impact these various EOs will have on everyday people that I can share.

Maybe it will only make a few people aware of the gravity of the situation. Maybe it won’t do anything for anyone (but will still make me feel better for saying something). But I would like to at least try. I don’t have the energy to write my own summary, I barely have energy to make a post - even before this, I hadn’t made a post in years, due to an underpaid/overworked full-time job + part-time pursuit of my PhD - so would be eternally grateful for any existing resources to share.

Fujifilm XS10 or XE4 or Xt30ii,PhotographyIndia,1i9ws3b,2025-01-25 15:54:32,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhotographyIndia/comments/1i9ws3b/fujifilm_xs10_or_xe4_or_xt30ii/,cheemz_da_choda,Buying Advice ,"I'm getting an XE4(7.5k shutter count) at 65k - looks good
XS10 (26k shutter count) at 50k - body has color issues
Xt30ii (4k shutter count) at 62k - body looks new. 

I'm highly confused as to which one I should get. 
I've used xt30i and liked it's design. Tried xs10 today but didn't like the feel and the deep grip, haven't tried xe4 but it lacks any grip. 

My main usage is as a hobbyist, into photography and maybe sometimes in the future 3-4 sec insta video stories.
I do want it to be compact so it encourages me to take more photos and be active more on social media. 
What do you guys think, or would you guys get???

Disabled Veteran Leaving Google Fi after Terrible Support Experience,GoogleFi,1i9ws21,2025-01-25 15:54:30,1,0.6,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleFi/comments/1i9ws21/disabled_veteran_leaving_google_fi_after_terrible/,Sure_Daikon2222,Support,"After two weeks of trying to get an answer on the Warranty status of my phone from Support, I am leaving Google Fi and bringing the family with me.

I don't post on social media, but I am so angry about this that I am making an exception.

  
If you want the timeline:

1. UBreakIFix (a Google partner) told me the phone was covered under warranty after telling me the motherboard on the phone stopped working (didn't drop it or anything, it just suddenly turned off one day and didn't turn back on)

2. Over the next two weeks, I went back and forth with support and they even dropped my ticket and started a new one (it created a new email thread with someone who didn't read any of the previous discussion). None of it was helpful and just 'we'll look into it' and messages that felt AI generated.

3. During the two weeks, I missed phone calls for refilling my prescription with the VA, couldn't access my credit union bank account (they only do cell phone text 2FA), and couldn't login to my part time work computer (requires a phone-only app to login to VPN).

4. I finally got an answer that my phone IS NOT covered under warranty from Google Fi the DAY AFTER I am billed for my next month of service.

  
I support a spouse who has a back injury and can't work, and we are on fixed income. I would not have waited so long to fix my phone situation if I had just been told the status of my Warranty.

These aren't some toys that people buy for laughs. This is critical infrastructure. I'm leaving Google Fi for good and bringing the entire family and everyone else I can with me."
