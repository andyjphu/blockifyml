Most people are new buying at .028-.04c after Scott's updates and are down quite a bit. shitty has been holding/trading the coin since March and is taking advantage of newbies who felt misinformed. shitty is spreading FUD to a fresh crowd who thinks the ship is sinking from an expected pullback. He doesn't hold the coin now and is doing this so he can buy it cheap. Watch I bet he buys in at .014-.008 and changes his tune for a couple weeks. I recommend blocking him its really nice.

Here is one of his ""legendary"" calls a month ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/XYONetwork/comments/1hf8qdl/update\_to\_the\_road\_map\_and\_the\_larger\_picture/](https://www.reddit.com/r/XYONetwork/comments/1hf8qdl/update_to_the_road_map_and_the_larger_picture/) too bad he deleted the post where he called himself the ""resident XYO baby whale""

Side note, I've also noticed that some posts on here rise to 8-14 upvotes and immediately dive to 0 in less than an hour while the comments in the post remain upvoted. This doesn't make a ton of sense. I ran a small experiment with my own posts by blocking shitty and this has more or less stopped. Its really easy to manipulate reddit, esp. on a dozen votes. I suspect he has multiple accounts or people in his discord voting in waves

The SEC report wasn't too concerning for me personally, it was a year old info during a bear market and general trends look good, not just for XYO. I would rather have a company spend cash than horde and operate on austerity. They literally just announced a source of funding from Outliers. I agree hope is dangerous but I see too many real world applications for me to let this project go."

""Going Concern

For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a net loss of $610,291. The Company was not able to cover its operational costs with the product and services sales generated and will likely need to further invest in marketing for user acquisition to increase COIN App income and advertising revenue to reach break-even for its products and services. As a result, the Company may incur further operating losses and seek to fund its operations through equity and/or debt financing or other sources, as it deems necessary.

Additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to the Company, if at all, including due to general macroeconomic conditions or unforeseen factors. If the Company fails to raise capital or generate liquidity through the sale of its products and services, it will have a negative impact on its financial condition and its ability to pursue its business strategies.

Those conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern from the filing date of this Semi-Annual Report on Form 1-SA.

The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.""

They are now using scott just like they did a few months ago to pump the price with fake deals fake partners and now they even claim trump is holding their shitcoin but thats not true because you can see WLFIs holdings. In these tweets he claims that trump is workign with him on his project and that they hold xyo. These are all lies just like his fake tesla deal yesterday and fake deal months ago. 

XYO and XYLabs are going bankrupt and the proof is in their financials. They are day tradign aginst the market with fake news on their way out. Prove me wrong. "

I think I'm getting out of crypto,CryptoMarkets,1i469qu,2025-01-18 07:11:33,102,0.69,308,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1i469qu/i_think_im_getting_out_of_crypto/,JoshWW1111,,"I've been looking at crypto for a long time, and decided to take the plunge in a few months ago. So I'm a new investor but a long time observer.

In the space of a few months, I've made a 20% profit but i don't have much money so it's not a life changing amount.

However, I think I happened to buy during a downturn, and now I'm selling at a high price. I think it'll come back down again soon so I may as well take all my profits now. 

I'm at this weird level of investing where I can't invest enough to actually make decent money, but if I invested more, I'd miss it if I lost it. Even if my coins went up 20-30%, that's asking a lot, and it's only ¬£20 per ¬£100, obviously, and with my small amounts, the rewards don't really outweigh the risks. 

Even if they go up 100%, I've doubled my money but that would be like getting 1 extra paycheck. That's nice but not exactly life changing and the odds of it going up by 100% is low. 

Even Bitcoin, it's over $100k now. For me to double my tiny amount of money, it has to go to $200k. I feel like I'd be waiting a long time just to earn a pretty small amount of money. 

XRP is at ATH. I just can't see it doing a 2x or 3x from here 

ETH just seems to be bouncing around the same sort of amount. I can't see it suddenly doubling or tripling.

Same for SOL. I've been looking at The Graph which a lot of people were talking up, and it's literally stayed within 10% of its value forever. HBAR goes up by a few pence. XYO feels like it's disappearing. AVAX goes up a bit but again, I just can't see it 2x or 3x. 

And any other gains just aren't really worth it. 

And lastly, I have a feeling things won't quite take off as big as people think. Bitcoin has been around forever and isn't mainstream. Everything I read about XRP/ETH/SOL/LINK etc is ""in the future, in the future, in the future""

I'm not sure when they mean. People said ""in the future"" 7 or 8 years ago. When? I'm not sure their future is ever coming. 

So a bunch of coins might just drop to 0. It's not really worth it for me. "

BLE Sentinel Battery,CoinWithUs,1i3mzd6,2025-01-17 13:22:46,8,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinWithUs/comments/1i3mzd6/ble_sentinel_battery/,Tmmike,,"There are a number of ways to use a Bluetooth sentinel, both mobile and stationary. This post focuses on a stationary home base mining approach.

A recent thread had questions about how useful a BLE sentinel was and that it is no longer available from XYO. Take the following information FWIW.

First, acquiring a BLE sentinel will mean going to Ebay or another reseller site. Note that the sentinel may already be linked to another account, so that account will receive 10% of the coins mined. Consider that fact when considering the purchase price.

Next, there is the battery issue. The original battery - CR3032 - is fairly expensive and has a limited life span. In many cases the battery only lasts a few months.

My solution for home base mining is to replace the original battery with a 3.7 volt lithium battery or two AA batteries in a holder with wires. I have used the configuration in the attached photo 24/7 for several years, switching the rechargeable battery every 6 month. 

If you feel you have the expertise, this is one way to extend the life of a sentinel and optimize your geomining.

Fake advertising on the XYO apps just to lure geominers about their ecosystem.,UnofficialXYO,1i2tj44,2025-01-16 11:59:32,4,1.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnofficialXYO/comments/1i2tj44/fake_advertising_on_the_xyo_apps_just_to_lure/,Smooth_Candidate_976,,"Hi Geominers.

""I have approximately $1.7 million in my account (as of today), but the exchange rate resembles a ""rug pull,"" and we have lost the value of our contributions to the project. The community needs to take action against those behind the project who have profited from these contributions.

Therefore, today I am revealing information to warn geomine users to avoid these individuals and any projects associated with them in the future, not just those directly related to XYO. I no longer feel obligated to keep this information secret.

My findings stem from in-app advertising, most of which consists of ""fake ads"" designed to create the illusion of ""development and expansion"" of the project (and the associated XYO tokens).

I clicked a link from one of these in-app ads and registered for a Stash account, but I did not receive any XYO tokens.

Without community support, this project will fail. That is all.

Many alternative cryptocurrencies offer opportunities for profit, and this project is simply wasting our time and money on unproductive ""meme"" coins/tokens.""

All the best,

* I like the idea of a simpler solution for a shorter coffee shop stint, so modularity is nice but not necessary
* I want the monitor(s) close to each other (no big gaps in between)
* I need to be able to quickly unplug my laptop to take it to a meeting space

Options I have tried

* Tri-screen monitors¬†
* Dual screen, vertical monitors
* Single, larger monitor
* Just my laptop

# Just My Laptop

This is what I use the most.

Here I use a¬†[folding monitor stand made by Moft](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B089GQKDNH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1). It is lightweight and puts the laptop at the right height for me. This means I also have to use a separate mouse and keyboard, but I am okay with that.

# Dual Screen, Vertical

**Worked well in a coffee shop. Screen quality is generally lower. Cords were annoying.**

For the tri-screen monitor, I initially ordered a¬†[15.6‚Äù, dual screen from Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0CXSSWP7W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1).¬†

This worked well in a coffee shop. I would use my laptop screen as the bottom half (basically cover the lower screen). This seems wasteful, but it let me have a second screen above. I didn‚Äôt even need to plug in the lower screen. It was a compact solution that worked well for that scenario, as I could use the laptop keyboard and trackpad.

For the office (where I am staying longer and have more space), it wasn‚Äôt as good. The screen quality is notably worse than my laptop, so I tended to look down at the lower one. Also, the top screen wasn‚Äôt quite high enough. I tried using a larger screen (18‚Äù screen from uperfect). This gave me the height I wanted but I had to plug in too many cords. The device needs its own, dedicated power to get a brightness above 60%. I also had to use a mini hdmi cord for each screen and plug my own laptop in as well. If I am going to a coffee shop, then I care less, as I only plug in 1 screen and dont stay for more than 1-2 hours. In the office, this is more annoying. Lastly, the screens seemed to flicker on and off, which was frustrating.

**Takeaway**: a large screen (16‚Äù +, higher quality (2k, 400 nits+) solution would work well here, especially if I could use only 1 cord for the visual (I am fine plugging in separately for power if needs be). Maybe the¬†[Jsaux Flipgo](https://jsaux.com/?sca_ref=6665465.WXw3AI8vmc&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAp4O8BhAkEiwAqv2UqFsHXF-FEIn96btGQ8MFeTWv45lBMKlaRG_xyoE17pxKPu8acjET5xoCcOQQAvD_BwE)?

# Tri-Screen

I haven‚Äôt actually tried this variant. The issue is that tri-screen monitors generally require a kickstand. That means I cant use the Moft laptop stand (its top isn‚Äôt big enough) and would have to put the whole thing on the table. That‚Äôs okay for a coffee shop, but doesn‚Äôt work for the office setting (for me).

What I have tried is the¬†[Duet Max Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Duex-Portable-Monitor-Extender-Compatible/dp/B09V27M95D?th=1). Its a 14‚Äù monitor that attaches to the back of your laptop and slides out. This lets me get a second screen that is attached to my laptop but still allows me to use the laptop stand. This is what I have been using lately.

It‚Äôs‚Ä¶okay. The issue is that, because it slides out from the back, the screen ends up being set back from your laptop, which is a little annoying. It‚Äôs also a bit too small.

# Single, Larger Monitor

Here I either keep my laptop closed, or I position it below the monitor, which is on the stand. Of all the solutions, this gives the most screen real estate. It‚Äôs not bad BUT:¬†

* I have to use the laptop on the bottom, otherwise it‚Äôs set too far back;¬†
* The monitor on the top ends up being leaned back a bit, rather than perpendicular to the ground. It‚Äôs a bit annoying but you get used to it.¬†
* The laptop on the bottom on the bottom isn;t quite high enough (too big of a gap between screens. I could prop it up but that is one more thing to pack

# What I am Still Thinking About

Trying a¬†[portable, VESA mount stand](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0D2YBQKQ3/?coliid=I39XWKR4P5M4MP&colid=C6IHX4375ZSM&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it). Then using a single larger monitor above, with my laptop below. This lets me set whatever height I want, keep it perpendicular to the ground, and set it further back.

BUT, setting up the stand seems fairly annoying.

I have been trying to find the perfect travel set up for work. I tend to go to a coworking space a couple days a week for 4-8 hours a time and I would like some more screen real estate and better ergonomics. I am posting this to share my findings and gather feedback.

Lastly, I am starting to interested in some glasses. The upcoming¬†[Xreal One Pro](https://us.shop.xreal.com/products/xreal-one-pro)¬†look pretty appealing. I have a Quest 3 that I use at home sometimes for work but dont want to take it to a co working space."
