"Kripto Para Nedir?, Kripto Para Ne Demek?",yatirimdanismanligi,1i9qa7h,2025-01-25 11:11:29,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/yatirimdanismanligi/comments/1i9qa7h/kripto_para_nedir_kripto_para_ne_demek/,dreaministanbul,,"Kripto para, dijital veya sanal bir para birimidir ve işlemleri güvenli hale getirmek için kriptografi teknolojisi kullanılır. Geleneksel para birimlerinden farklı olarak fiziksel bir şekli yoktur ve merkezi bir otorite tarafından kontrol edilmez. Kripto paralar, blockchain adı verilen dağıtık bir defter teknolojisi üzerinde çalışir. Bu teknoloji, tüm işlemlerin şeffaf ve değiştirilemez bir şekilde kaydedilmesini sağlar.

# Kripto Para Çeşitleri

Kripto paralar farklı amaçlara hizmet eden çeşitli türlere ayrılabilir:

# 1. Bitcoin (BTC)

Bitcoin, ilk ve en popüler kripto paradır. 2009 yılında Satoshi Nakamoto takma adıyla biri veya bir grup tarafından geliştirilmiştir. Dijital altın olarak da adlandırılan Bitcoin, bir değer saklama aracı ve ödeme sistemi olarak kullanılır.

# 2. Altcoin’ler

Bitcoin haricindeki tüm kripto paralar “altcoin” olarak adlandırılır. Bazı popüler altcoin’ler şunlardır:

* **Ethereum (ETH):** Akıllı sözleşmeler ve merkeziyetsiz uygulamalar (DApps) için bir platformdur.
* **Ripple (XRP):** Hızlı uluslararası ödeme sistemleri için kullanılır.
* **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’in daha hafif bir versiyonu olarak daha hızlı işlem yapılmasını sağlar.

# 3. Stablecoin’ler

Stablecoin’ler, fiyat dalgalanmasını azaltmak için itibari para birimlerine (USD, EUR gibi) veya altın gibi fiziksel varlıklara endekslenmiştir. Örnek: USDT (Tether), USDC.

# 4. Meme Coin’ler

Genellikle bir topluluk veya internet esprisi (meme) üzerine kurulu kripto paralardır. Örneğin, Dogecoin (DOGE) ve Shiba Inu (SHIB).

# 5. NFT’ler ve Token’lar

* **NFT’ler (Non-Fungible Tokens):** Sanat eserleri, koleksiyonlar ve dijital varlıkları temsil eder.
* **Token’lar:** Belirli bir platformda veya ekosistemde kullanılmak için oluşturulan dijital varlıklardır.

# Kripto Paranın Avantajları

Kripto paraları kullanmanın çok sayıda avantajı vardır:

# 1. Merkeziyetsizlik

Kripto paralar, herhangi bir merkezi otoriteye bağlı olmadığı için daha şeffaf ve özgür bir finansal sistem sunar.

# 2. Hızlı ve Düşük Maliyetli İşlemler

Kripto para transferleri genellikle çok hızlıdır ve geleneksel bankacılık sistemine göre daha düşük üretlere sahiptir.

# 3. Sınırsız ve Evrensel Erişim

Kripto paraları kullanmak için bir banka hesabına gerek yoktur. Bir internet bağlantısına sahip herkes, dünyanın her yerinden bu paralara erişebilir.

# 4. Yatırım Fırsatları

Kripto paralar, yüksek getirili bir [**yatırım**](https://yatirimdanismanligi.com/) aracı olarak popülerlik kazanmıştır. Bitcoin gibi bazı kripto paralar uzun vadeli yatırımlar için tercih edilmektedir.

# 5. Güvenlik

Blockchain teknolojisi, verilerin değiştirilemez ve güvenli bir şekilde saklanmasını sağlar. Bu da kripto paraları geleneksel sistemlere göre daha güvenli hale getirir.

# Kripto Paranın Riskleri

Kripto paralara yatırım yaparken dikkate alınması gereken bazı önemli riskler vardır:

# 1. Fiyat Dalgalanması (Volatilite)

Kripto paraların değeri kısa süre içinde büyük ölçülerde artabilir veya azalabilir. Bu, yüksek kâr getirme potansiyeli olduğu kadar yüksek kayıp riskini de beraberinde getirir.

# 2. Siber Güvenlik Riskleri

Kripto para borsalarının hacklenmesi veya bireysel cüzdanların ele geçirilmesi durumunda kayıplar yaşanabilir.

# 3. Regülasyon ve Yasal Belirsizlikler

Birçok ülkede kripto paraların yasal durumu tam olarak netleşmemiştir. Bu da yasal riskler doğurabilir.

# 4. Teknik Bilgi Eksikliği

Kripto paralara yatırım yaparken teknik bilgi eksikliği yanlış kararlar alınmasına neden olabilir.

# 5. Dolandırıcılık ve Ponzi Yapılar

Bazı sahte projeler ve dolandırıcılık amaçlı kripto para girşimleri, yatırımcıları büyük kayıplara uğratabilir.

Kripto paralar, modern finans dünyasını yeniden şekillendiren bir yenilik olarak dikkat çekiyor. Avantajları ve yatırım fırsatları cazip olsa da, beraberinde getirdiği riskleri dikkatlice değerlendirmek önemlidir. Kripto paralara yönelik bir yatırım yapmadan önce detaylı bir araştırma yapmak ve finansal durumunuzu göz önünde bulundurmak önemlidir.

"Sold a virtual item for crypto, have some questions about how to withdraw from Luno/sell for MYR",MalaysianPF,1i9oy1l,2025-01-25 10:10:56,0,0.5,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/MalaysianPF/comments/1i9oy1l/sold_a_virtual_item_for_crypto_have_some/,rtbread,Crypto,"Hi, I wanted to ask, I sold an item on a marketplace and am wondering how I should provide the transaction information for luno in order to exchange for MYR.



Basically, from what I understand, the website manages their own crypto address and transferred the funds to my own Luno address. For a test send, I sent about 1 USD worth of Litecoin and it did end up in my luno wallet but Luno is also asking about the nature of the transaction, i.e., ""Who is the sender"" and ""Where is this wallet's platform on"".



In hindsight, I shouldn't have proceeded with this endeavor because I don't have much knowledge about crypto, but I really don't know the answer to the question about the wallet's platform and also, the sender is technically a company so should I just answer that?. Will I face any problems trying to sell the coin for MYR if I don't provide this information? For context, I should be receiving about RM3k worth of LTC. I just wanted some money to buy school supplies so I really hope I don't end up breaking the law. Thanks for your help"

📈 **BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Set to Benefit from Nasdaq’s In-Kind Redemption Proposal**

📈 **Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Officially Enter Into Greed Territory, Is This Good Or Bad For Price?**

In a recent development, crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that Bitcoin long-term holders have officially entered greed territory. This could benefit the price in the short term, although the long-term consequences could be severe. [Source](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-lths-in-greed-territory/)



**Overall:**

ETFs remain at the center of crypto market narratives, bringing the potential for significant inflows—especially if recent proposals receive the green light. BTC’s dual signals of FOMO-driven short-term interest and rising long-term greed suggest a market prone to volatility but underpinned by solid demand. Meanwhile, Trump’s hands-on involvement and Solana’s high-profile memecoin activity highlight how rapidly politics and hype can reshape the industry’s direction. As always, market participants should balance optimism with caution in this fast-evolving environment.

Been holding on to a few LTC over the years but have no real idea what it’s standing is. Any chance it will do anything in future or is it dead in the water? 
It had its peak and I didn’t sell. It then went on to fall and has appeared to do pretty much nothing ever since. If it’s likely to be over I’ll probably move it over to another coin. 
It seems that it just got lost in the water and never really capitalised on its position at the time of peaking.

Like many of my friends all over America, I've been exhausted from searching for US-friendly casinos. The fact is, the gambling legislation varies from state to state, and you can really get stuck trying to find legitimate brands. Plus, looking for Bitcoin casinos doesn’t always yield results. Some sites allow Americans, while others don’t. So, I’ve realized that, for us Americans, mainly crypto casinos are available, and only those registered outside the US. So, big deal! I spent a lot of time finding these top platforms, and I hope they simplify your search for real, licensed platforms. After the list, I’ll detail each site and its advantages.

In the fast-evolving world of cryptocurrency, where opportunities for investment and financial growth are abundant, scams like Apexfrex.com have become a persistent threat. Apexfrex.com, a platform that markets itself as a promising investment solution, has drawn significant attention—not for its success but for the alarming number of complaints from victims worldwide. In this article, we’ll explore how Apexfrex.com operates as a scam, how you can protect yourself, and how trusted recovery services like [Sinereclaim.com](http://sinereclaim.com) can assist victims in recovering lost assets.





# The Nature of Apexfrex.com’s Scam

Apexfrex.com initially appears to be a legitimate cryptocurrency trading and investment platform. It boasts impressive promises of high returns, seamless transactions, and secure services. Unfortunately, as countless victims have discovered, these claims are nothing but bait to lure unsuspecting investors.

The platform typically employs the following tactics:

1. **Enticing Offers:** Apexfrex.com advertises unrealistic profits and guaranteed returns, creating a sense of urgency to invest quickly.
2. **Sophisticated Design:** The website mimics legitimate platforms with professional layouts, fake testimonials, and fabricated trading data to create a false sense of trust.
3. **Withdrawal Restrictions:** Victims often find that while depositing funds is effortless, withdrawing earnings becomes a nightmare. Excuses such as “pending verifications” or sudden “additional fees” are commonly cited.
4. **Ghosting Victims:** Once users complain or demand their money back, the platform often ceases communication entirely.

This combination of psychological manipulation and technical deception ensures that the scam succeeds in defrauding victims of their hard-earned money.





# Cybersecurity and Crypto Recovery: Why It’s Crucial

Scams like Apexfrex.com highlight the importance of cybersecurity in the cryptocurrency space. Cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible, and scammers exploit this feature to drain wallets and vanish without a trace. Here are key steps to safeguard yourself against such scams:

1. **Verify Platforms:** Before investing, thoroughly research any platform. Check reviews, verify licenses, and confirm the legitimacy of their operations.
2. **Avoid Unrealistic Promises:** If an offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Steer clear of platforms promising guaranteed returns.
3. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Ensure your crypto wallets and accounts are secured with MFA to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
4. **Stay Updated:** Educate yourself about the latest scams and fraud tactics in the crypto world. Being informed is your best defense.

However, even the most cautious individuals can fall victim to sophisticated scams. This is where crypto recovery services, such as **Sinereclaim**, come into play.

Help Needed!

I'm new to eToro and still figuring out how things work here exactly, so please bear with me.

Since eToro allows users to trade crypto, I want to create a BTC wallet and transfer my BTC assets from Binance. However, the app doesn't let me do that with this pop-up on the bottom.

https://preview.redd.it/iq7c2ab7j9ee1.jpg?width=591&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=24a2ec691e5944d196cff838f2622616e2101083

It seems very strange to me that I need to buy BTC on eToro and transfer it to eToro Money in order to create a BTC wallet. However, I proceeded and bought a small amount. Nothing happened on eToro Money, I'm still stuck at this stage with no BTC wallets being created.

Is this normal? eToro's AI assistant doesn't think so, and I've submitted a customer service ticket for help. Have you experienced anything like this?"

Pepe and Litecoin Holders Take Advantage Of The Hottest Crypto Presale Of The Year's 30% Trump Inauguration Bonus,PepeverseOriginal,1i4ylt0,2025-01-19 08:37:48,3,1.0,0,https://i.redd.it/baoycshmeyde1.png,KIDethRabbit,,"The best crypto investors distinguish themselves by being vigilant and smart enough to know when to switch to a new crypto to stay in profit. These Pepe and Litecoin holders have shown these attributes as they swoop right in to take advantage of the record-breaking Remittix presale.

With the diverse market performance from PEPE and LTC, savvy investors seeking the best alt coins have realized it is time for a switch. This feeling is further strengthened by the fast pace at which the new crypto sensation, $RTX, is growing in its presale. This article reviews Pepe Coin price performance, LTC future and what Remittix offers investors. 

Pepe Coin Price Analysis

According to the Pepe coin price chart, the last 24 hours have seen the memecoin rebound strongly from the previous week's lows. This recovery comes after the hammer candlestick pattern formed on the price charts on Monday. Such activity is common, signifying reversal signals for most crypto tokens.

The charts also show Pepe coin price remains above the 100-day moving average. It has also created a falling wedge chart pattern, a common bullish reversal sign depicted by two falling and converging trend lines on the charts. With this price trend, Pepe coin price will likely witness a bullish breakout that could take the memecoin beyond its all-time high. However, this potential relies on hype and the market's speculative nature, which might leave investors stranded.

Analysts Compare Litecoin Price Prediction to December Highs

Litecoin price chart reveals a golden cross formed in the last 24 hours. Experts believe this pattern is responsible for its current surge and increased bullish sentiment. When a crypto price chart shows a golden cross, there's a short-term moving average above a long-term moving average. This movement often signals the beginning of a strong uptrend in the crypto’s price.

Should this momentum persist, LTC could test the next resistance at $139. Should it break that resistance, the token price might hit $147, its highest point since early December 2024. Another inspiration for a bullish trend for LTC is the news around its ETF.

But, should the current surge lose momentum and the support at $131 is tested and breaks, LTC could drop to $125. With a stronger downtrend, the crypto could experience further drops that might take the price to as low as $114 or even below $100, which will mean a 28.3% price correction. These uncertainties explain why Litecoin holders are accumulating this new crypto for better profit potential.

"Why Bitcoin, Litecoin, and DigiByte Should Be Included in the United States Strategic Crypto Reserves – $BTC $LTC $DGB",Digibyte,1i3nzer,2025-01-17 14:05:19,36,0.95,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Digibyte/comments/1i3nzer/why_bitcoin_litecoin_and_digibyte_should_be/,DigiByteDaily,Article 📰,"[Originally Posted on January 17, 2025 By Brian Oakes](https://brianoakes.io/2025/01/why-bitcoin-litecoin-and-digibyte-should-be-included-in-the-united-states-strategic-crypto-reserves-btc-ltc-dgb/)

As the world continues to embrace the digital economy, the United States must remain at the forefront of financial and technological innovation. One key area where the nation can assert leadership is by establishing strategic crypto reserves. Similar to gold and silver reserves, these digital assets can serve as a backbone for economic stability and resilience in an increasingly decentralized financial landscape. Among the myriad of cryptocurrencies available, Bitcoin, Litecoin, and DigiByte stand out as essential candidates for inclusion in such reserves due to their unique technical merits, proven reliability, and specialized use cases.

# Bitcoin: The Digital Gold

Bitcoin (BTC), often referred to as “digital gold,” is the first and most widely recognized cryptocurrency. Its inclusion in a strategic reserve is justified by the following characteristics:

1. **Security and Decentralization**: Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, supported by the largest and most distributed network of miners, ensures unparalleled security and resistance to censorship. With over a decade of flawless operation, Bitcoin has proven its robustness against attacks.
2. **Limited Supply**: With a capped supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin’s scarcity mirrors that of gold, making it an ideal store of value. This inherent scarcity ensures long-term value appreciation and hedges against inflation.
3. **Global Recognition**: Bitcoin’s universal acceptance as a digital asset ensures its liquidity and utility as a reserve asset. It’s widely used as a hedge against fiat currency instability, reinforcing its role as a strategic asset.
4. **Infrastructure and Adoption**: Bitcoin boasts the most extensive and mature ecosystem, from wallets and exchanges to payment processors. This infrastructure makes it a reliable and accessible reserve asset.

# Litecoin: The Digital Silver

Litecoin (LTC) is often compared to silver in the context of digital assets. Created as a “lighter” alternative to Bitcoin, it complements Bitcoin’s role as digital gold in several key ways:

1. **Faster Transactions**: Litecoin’s block generation time of approximately 2.5 minutes is four times faster than Bitcoin’s, making it more efficient for smaller transactions and quicker settlements.
2. **Lower Fees**: Litecoin’s network offers significantly lower transaction fees, making it an attractive option for everyday payments and cross-border transactions.
3. **Robust Security**: While leveraging a similar proof-of-work mechanism as Bitcoin, Litecoin utilizes the Scrypt hashing algorithm, providing an additional layer of diversity in the reserve’s technical foundations.
4. **Proven Longevity**: Launched in 2011, Litecoin has stood the test of time, maintaining its reputation as a reliable and secure cryptocurrency.
5. **Maximum Supply**: Litecoin has a capped supply of 84 million coins—exactly four times that of Bitcoin—ensuring scarcity while allowing for a broader distribution and utility.

# DigiByte: Everyday Utility and Speed

DigiByte (DGB) is a lesser-known but highly innovative cryptocurrency that excels in everyday utility and technological advancements. Including DigiByte in a strategic reserve provides the following advantages:

1. **Unparalleled Speed**: DigiByte’s block time of just 15 seconds makes it one of the fastest UTXO-based blockchains, enabling near-instant transaction confirmations. For example, you could buy a soda with DigiByte in a matter of seconds, whereas Bitcoin or Litecoin might take several minutes due to their longer block times.
2. **Scalability**: Thanks to its SegWit integration and advanced blockchain design, DigiByte can handle over 1,000 transactions per second, far surpassing Bitcoin and Litecoin.
3. **Security through Diversity**: DigiByte employs five distinct mining algorithms, significantly enhancing its network security and decentralization. This innovation reduces the risk of a single point of failure or dominance by specialized mining hardware.
4. **Maximum Supply**: DigiByte has a total supply of 21 billion coins, making it highly accessible for everyday transactions while maintaining its decentralized nature.
5. **DigiAssets**: DigiByte supports the creation of DigiAssets, a feature that allows users to create, trade, and manage digital assets such as tokens, smart contracts, and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). This positions DigiByte as a blockchain capable of supporting a wide variety of applications beyond simple payments.
6. **DApps and Practical Utility**: DigiByte’s blockchain can host decentralized applications (DApps), making it a versatile platform for developers. Its rapid transaction speeds and low fees make it particularly suitable for real-world applications, such as retail payments and micropayments.
7. **Global Accessibility**: DigiByte’s low fees and rapid transaction speeds make it ideal for microtransactions and everyday use, positioning it as a digital currency for the masses.
8. **Grassroots Growth**: With a strong and passionate community, DigiByte has demonstrated organic growth and resilience, proving its long-term viability.

# Strategic Value of UTXO-Based Cryptocurrencies

Bitcoin, Litecoin, and DigiByte share a common foundation as UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output)-based cryptocurrencies. This technical design ensures transparency, security, and efficiency in transaction validation. The UTXO model offers:

1. **Auditability**: Every transaction can be traced back to its origin, ensuring an immutable and transparent ledger.
2. **Efficiency**: The UTXO model simplifies transaction verification, reducing computational overhead and enhancing scalability.
3. **Security**: By using discrete transaction outputs, the UTXO model minimizes the risk of double-spending and other vulnerabilities.

# Complementary Roles in a Strategic Reserve

1. **Bitcoin as Digital Gold**: A cornerstone of the reserve, Bitcoin provides unmatched security, liquidity, and a hedge against economic uncertainties.
2. **Litecoin as Digital Silver**: Complementing Bitcoin, Litecoin offers faster and cheaper transactions, serving as a versatile medium of exchange while supporting DApps and Ordinals.
3. **DigiByte for Everyday Transactions**: With its speed, scalability, and support for DigiAssets and DApps, DigiByte bridges the gap between store of value and practical utility, enabling seamless day-to-day transactions, such as buying a soda in seconds.

# Conclusion

Incorporating Bitcoin, Litecoin, and DigiByte into the United States’ strategic crypto reserves is a forward-thinking move that leverages the unique strengths of each cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s role as digital gold, Litecoin’s utility as digital silver, and DigiByte’s capacity for high-speed, everyday transactions create a well-rounded reserve that can enhance economic resilience and promote financial innovation. As the digital age unfolds, these assets provide the foundation for a robust and adaptive monetary strategy.

💎 Litecoin (LTC): The Most Underrated PoW Coin Ready to Explode (Cool emojis by ChatGPT),litecoin,1i3ico0,2025-01-17 10:05:48,103,0.93,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1i3ico0/litecoin_ltc_the_most_underrated_pow_coin_ready/,GambAntonio,,"## 🔥 Why Litecoin? The Best Alternative to Bitcoin  

Bitcoin is **too big to fail**, but its mining difficulty has reached extreme levels, making it tougher for smaller miners to compete.  

Ethereum, Solana, and other PoS (Proof of Stake) coins **dominate the market**, but they have one fatal flaw: they are **designed to make the rich richer**.  

If you're looking for the **best PoW alternative to Bitcoin**, **Litecoin (LTC)** is the answer—a **truly decentralized** cryptocurrency with **fast transactions, low fees, and real mining security**.  

---

## 📜 **Litecoin: The First Copy-Paste Coin (And Why That Matters)**  

Yes, Litecoin is a **Bitcoin fork**—but here’s why that’s actually a **good** thing:  

- **It was the FIRST copy-paste coin**, not the 500th clone like most others.  
- Created in **2011** by **Charlie Lee**, a former **Google engineer**, Litecoin was designed to be **Bitcoin’s lighter and faster version**.  
- Instead of just copying Bitcoin, it **improved key aspects**:  
  - **Faster transactions** (2.5 min blocks vs. Bitcoin’s 10 min)  
  - **Lower fees**, making it better for daily use  
  - **More scalable**, which is why Bitcoin has used Litecoin as a **testbed** for upgrades  

*(More on Charlie Lee’s LTC controversy later!)*

## 🏆 PoW vs. PoS: **What Gives Crypto Real Value?**  

### **PoW (Proof of Work) – Bitcoin & Litecoin** 💎  

- **Mining requires real-world effort** – Electricity, hardware, and time go into securing the network  
- **Miners can’t create coins out of thin air** – New coins require **computational work**  
- **More decentralized** – Anyone can mine, even with cheaper hardware. Your chances of success are lower, but you **always** have an opportunity  
- **Hard to manipulate** – For large coins like **BTC and LTC, a 51% attack is practically impossible** because the cost would be **astronomically high**  
- **Backed by real production costs** – Since mining has a cost, PoW coins have a **natural price floor**  

---

### **PoS (Proof of Stake) – Ethereum & Others** 🛑  

- **Coins are created with zero effort** – The richest holders get more coins just for holding  
- **The rich keep getting richer** – Large holders accumulate more rewards, while small holders can’t compete  
- **Impossible for small holders to participate** – PoS networks require a **minimum staking amount**, which **gets more expensive every year**  
- **No real production cost** – If trust is lost, the price can **drop massively**, since there’s no mining cost to set a price floor  

With PoS, you **must** already be wealthy to participate. If you don’t have the required minimum, you **can’t validate transactions** and won’t earn rewards.  

**In PoW, you always have a chance, even with weaker hardware.**  

This is why PoW coins like **Litecoin** are **the best option for a truly decentralized financial system**.  

---

## 🔍 **Litecoin vs. Other PoW Coins (Like Monero)**  

Some other PoW coins exist, like **Monero (XMR)**, which is fully private and anonymous. While this is great for privacy, it has a **huge downside**—it's **banned from most major exchanges and institutions that require KYC (Know Your Customer) compliance**.  

Litecoin, however, **has the best of both worlds**:  
- **Public transactions** that make it easy to pass KYC checks  
- **MWEB (MimbleWimble Extension Blocks)** for enhanced privacy when needed  
- **Accepted by exchanges and institutions** because it remains KYC-friendly  

If a platform or service **requires transparency**, it can simply use **regular Litecoin transactions**. If privacy is needed, **MWEB transactions** can be used instead.  

This flexibility makes Litecoin **the only major PoW coin that balances security, decentralization, and real-world usability**.  

---

## ⛏️ **Litecoin = Bitcoin’s Testnet, But With Real Value**  

Litecoin is not just a **Bitcoin copy**. It has always been a **step ahead in innovation**:  

- **Faster blocks** – Transactions confirm in **2.5 minutes**, not Bitcoin’s **10 minutes**  
- **Cheaper fees** – Sending LTC costs **a fraction** of what BTC transactions do  
- **Larger supply** – **84 million LTC** vs. **21 million BTC**, making it better for smaller payments  
- **Pioneered new Bitcoin tech**:  
  - **SegWit** was first activated on Litecoin before Bitcoin  
  - **MWEB (MimbleWimble Extension Blocks)** gives Litecoin **better privacy** than BTC  
  - **Litecoin often tests new upgrades before Bitcoin implements them**  

Litecoin acts as **Bitcoin’s testnet**, but with **real economic value**. If something works on LTC, **Bitcoin adopts it later**.  

---

## 🤔 **Charlie Lee Sold All His LTC – Here’s Why That’s Actually a Good Thing**  

Charlie Lee, **Litecoin’s creator**, sold all his LTC in **2017**, and many people questioned that decision. However, it actually strengthened Litecoin:  
- **No founder hoarding a massive stash of old LTC**  
- **No single person can dump and crash the market**  
- **No central authority controlling supply**  

Projects like Ethereum (Vitalik) or Binance (CZ) often have large founder holdings, meaning they can heavily influence market dynamics. Litecoin, on the other hand, is **truly decentralized**, with no single individual holding millions of coins.  

---

## 📉 **The Halving Effect: Why Litecoin & Bitcoin Prices Will Skyrocket**  

Every **four years**, PoW cryptos like Bitcoin and Litecoin undergo a **halving event**, where mining rewards are cut in half.  

**Current & Future Halving Rewards:**  
- **Bitcoin (BTC)** → Current reward: **3.125 BTC** (Next halving: **2028** → **1.5625 BTC**)  
- **Litecoin (LTC)** → Current reward: **6.25 LTC** (Next halving: **2027** → **3.125 LTC**)  

Since miners earn **50% fewer coins** post-halving, they generally **increase their sell price** to cover costs. This makes new coins scarcer, which has historically led to **massive price surges**.  

---

## 📈 **Bitcoin Mining is Getting More Competitive – Miners Will Switch to Litecoin**  

Bitcoin is currently at **$100K**, and its mining difficulty is at an all-time high.  

- **Higher mining difficulty = More competition for rewards**  
- **More competition = Requires better hardware for higher efficiency**  
- **But anyone can still mine, even with cheaper hardware**—you just have lower odds of success  

Unlike PoS, where you need a **minimum stake** to participate, PoW mining **always gives you a chance**.  

Litecoin mining is **easier and more accessible** than Bitcoin, making it the next logical choice for miners who want to stay in the PoW system without extreme costs.  

---

## 🔥 **Litecoin ETFs Are Likely Coming in 2025**  

The **Bitcoin ETF approval** was a huge step for crypto, and **Litecoin** is a strong candidate for the next round of ETFs.  

Why?  
- **No SEC lawsuits** – Unlike Ethereum, XRP, and others, Litecoin has **never been targeted**  
- **Institutional interest** – Funds are looking for **a second PoW asset** besides Bitcoin  
- **ETF history** – Every crypto ETF approval has led to **huge price surges**  

If an LTC ETF gets approved, demand will **skyrocket instantly**, just like it did with Bitcoin.  

---

## 🚀 **The Simple Strategy to Profit from Litecoin**  

1. **DCA (Dollar-Cost Average)** – Buy a fixed amount regularly instead of trying to time the market  

2. **Wait for 2 or 3 halvings** – Each halving reduces supply and typically pushes prices up  

3. **Profit** – The market follows **mining economics**, not hype  

This strategy has worked for **Bitcoin holders** and has historically worked for **Litecoin holders** as well.  

---

## 💎 **Why Litecoin is the Best PoW Alternative to Bitcoin**  

- **Faster and cheaper than Bitcoin** – Ideal for daily transactions  
- **More decentralized than PoS coins** – No rich validators controlling the network  
- **Balances privacy & compliance** – MWEB for privacy, public transactions for KYC acceptance  
- **Proven history of price surges after halvings** – Scarcity drives demand  
- **Lower mining costs than Bitcoin** – A fairer system for smaller miners  
- **Next in line for an ETF** – Institutional money is looking for the next big PoW coin  

Litecoin remains **secure, scalable, and decentralized**—the perfect combo for real-world use.  

**PoW** ensures **fair distribution** and **real security**. Other PoW coins might face adoption hurdles (like Monero’s privacy bans), but Litecoin **strikes the perfect balance**.  

---

Litecoin was **the first “copy-paste” of Bitcoin**, but it took that foundation and improved it. Now, with Bitcoin mining pushing out smaller participants, **LTC stands as the best PoW alternative** for both individual miners and major institutions.  

**Stack up, DCA, and get ready for the ride—Litecoin is set to shine in 2025 and beyond!**

Litecoin fee estimate,litecoin,1i3hzes,2025-01-17 09:49:25,6,0.88,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1i3hzes/litecoin_fee_estimate/,Valuable_Walk2462,,"Yo, Iv been working on a project for quite some time now, and I am nearly done.  
I just pretty much need to figure out how the whole transaction fee works as right now I am so confused.

So for context Iv installed litecoin core on my linux VPS, synced it and stuff and I am using the litecoin-cli trough a python script to automate certain actions: 

\- create an address

\- getreceivedbyaddress with the argument ""0"" every 10 seconds to monitor if a payment is made

\- once a payment is detected, we use getreceivedbyaddress with the argument ""1"" every 10 seconds to monitor when the transaction has at least been confirmed once

\- send the funds to another address (and this is where I am having a hard time)

I tried looking around to see if there was a way to send ""max"" but that doesn't seem to be a thing.  
And at the moment I found a way to estimate fee with the litecoin-cli estimatesmartfee ""arg"" ""ECONOMICAL"", with the fee rate being 0.00000940 LTC / byte at the moment.  
That seems to be low but then I looked at other transactions I did yesterday for example (on which I paid 100sat/byte (about the same)) it was a 177 bytes transaction so I paid 0.000178032 LTC of fee on a 0.007507 LTC transaction. Thats like good but then does the fee goes up with the amount sent ? Or how does it works, Iv asked around a bit and peoples told me it was the number of inputs / outputs but not sure I got that right.  
If by any chance someone could explain I would very much appreciate it "
Crypto expert: Litecoin ETF-goedkeuring voor XRP & SOL ETF – wat betekent dit voor toekomst crypto?,Blockviews,1i3hwou,2025-01-17 09:45:52,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockviews/comments/1i3hwou/crypto_expert_litecoin_etfgoedkeuring_voor_xrp/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨 Crypto News: Major Litecoin ETF approval could be on the horizon, says top crypto analyst. Investors eye the shift in SEC leadership as optimism rises for crypto ETFs like $XRP and $SOL.  

Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, noted that $LTC might be the frontrunner in achieving ETF approval. Feedback from the SEC on the Litecoin ETF application by Canary Capital has sparked hope in the crypto community. This could mark a turning point for wider adoption.  

While $SOL and $XRP ETFs face delays, the new SEC chair, Paul Atkins, known for his crypto-friendly stance, may bring fresh momentum. The possibility of an approved Litecoin ETF is seen as promising, thanks to its simplicity and categorization as a non-security asset.  

Such approvals could open the doors for traditional investors, offering a smoother pathway to crypto exposure. Simultaneously, presale cryptos like Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE), Solaxy ($SOLX), and Best Wallet Token ($BEST) are gaining attention as they aim to create innovative utilities within the blockchain space.  

Investors are buzzing with anticipation as 2025 could redefine access to digital assets. A Litecoin ETF might just be the catalyst that leads the way.

"Bitcoin Today 01/17/2025: BTC could reach USD 130,000 in February",CapitalistExploits,1i3h63k,2025-01-17 09:10:39,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1i3h63k/bitcoin_today_01172025_btc_could_reach_usd_130000/,kayakero,,"Bitcoin (BTC) appears to have resumed its upward trend, starting Friday, January 17 with gains of 2.9%. This pushed the cryptocurrency to a maximum of USD 102,000, a level it had not reached since January 6. According to data from CoinGecko, BTC's cumulative performance in the last seven days is 6%, although it still registers a loss of 2.2% in the last 30 days.

With this recovery, the Top 10 cryptocurrencies again showed significant gains. Among the biggest increases were Solana (SOL) with 7.5% and Cardano (ADA) with 7.3%. However, Dogecoin (DOGE) led the pack with a rise of 10.4%.

In the Top 100, the OKX (OKB) token registered the largest increase, with a valuation of 16.9%, while the AI16Z token suffered the largest drop, with a 14% decline. Other prominent cryptocurrencies such as EOS and Litecoin (LTC) achieved strong increases of 16%. Litecoin, in particular, continues to benefit from rumors about the possible approval of an ETF.

In addition to this breakout, there are other factors that could drive a strong BTC surge. Some analysts believe that three of these elements could trigger a 30% surge, taking BTC to a value of $130,000 by February.

# The Trump effect

The inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, scheduled for January 20, is seen as one of the major events that could catalyze a boom in the cryptocurrency market. While some argue that the so-called “Trump effect” has already faded, others believe that it is only just beginning to manifest itself.

Trump is expected to deliver on his promises to the crypto sector, including the creation of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve and establishing the United States as a hub for technological innovation. Therefore, the market is closely watching the concrete actions the new president will take after taking office.

# End of consolidation

From a technical perspective, Bitcoin has managed to break out of the sideways movement zone between $90,000 and $100,000 since January 13. According to Altabbaa, this breakout has been key to the current momentum and could consolidate as a definitive move.

Over the past 65 days, BTC has been stuck within this range, but its recent breakout has sparked optimism in the market. This advance tilts the odds in favor of the bulls and suggests that the price could reach a new peak in February.

# Breaking historical highs

A similar pattern occurred between late September and mid-October 2024, when BTC broke out of the $65,000-$70,000 band to set new all-time highs.

If history repeats itself, Bitcoin could consolidate above $100,000 over the next 11 days. Subsequently, an exponential rally could take it to the 161.8% Fibonacci extension level, pushing its price up to $131,055.

However, you can benefit from it, if you will act wisеly

Have you heard of Pegasus? This is a spyware program that installs on computers and smartphones and allows hackers to monitor the activity of device owners. It provides access to your webcam, messengers, emails, call records, etc. It works well on Android, iOS, macOS and Windows. I guess, you already figured out where I’m getting at. 

It’s been a few months since I installed it on all your dеviсеs because you were not quite choosy about what links to click on the intеrnеt. During this period, I’ve learned about all aspects of your private life, but оnе is of special significance to me.

I’ve recorded many videos of you jerking off to highly controversial роrn videos. Given that the “questionable” genre is almost always the same, I can conclude that you have sick реrvеrsiоn.  


I doubt you’d wаnt your friends, fаmily аnd co-workers to know аbout it. However, I cаn do it in а few clicks.

Every number in your contаct Iist will suddenly receive these vidеоs – on WhаtsApp, on Telegrаm, on Instаgrаm, on Fаcebook, on emаil – everywhere. It is going to be а tsunаmi thаt will sweep аwаy everything in its pаth, аnd first of аll, your fоrmеr life.  
Don’t think of yourself аs аn innocent victim. No one knows where your реrvеrsiоn might leаd in the future, so consider this а kind of deserved рunishmеnt to stop you.

I’m some kind of God who sees everything. However, don’t pаnic. As we know, God is merciful аnd forgiving,  аnd so do I. But my mеrсy is not free.

BTrаnsfer **1300$** to my Litecoin (LTC) wаllet:  I receive confirmаtion of the trаnsаction, I will реrmаnently delete аll videos compromising you, uninstаll Pegаsus from аll of your devices, аnd disаppeаr from your life. You cаn be sure – my benefit is only money. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be writing to you, but destroy your life without а word in а second.

I’ll be notified when you open my emаil, аnd from thаt moment you hаve exаctly **48 hours** to send the money. If cryptocurrencies аre unchаrtered wаters for you, don’t worry, it’s very simple. Just google “crypto exchange” or ""buy Litecoin"" аnd then it will be no hаrder thаn buying some useless stuff on Amаzon

I strongly wаrn you аgаinst the following:  
\* Do not reply to this emаil. I've sent it from your Microsoft аccount.\* Do not contаct the police. I hаve аccess to аll your dеviсеs, аnd аs soon аs I find out you rаn to the cops, videos will be published.\* Don’t try to reset or destroy your dеviсеs. As I mentioned аbove: I’m monitoring аll your аctivity, so you either аgree to my terms or the vidеоs аre рublished. Also, don’t forget thаt cryptocurrencies аre аnonymous, so it’s impossible to identify me using the provided аddrеss.

Good luck, my perverted friend. I hope this is the lаst time we heаr from eаch other.And some friendly аdvice: from now on, don’t be so cаreless аbout your online security."

The Problem with 10 minute Blocks - 1 minute Blocks needed,ecash,1i36fp1,2025-01-16 21:41:43,5,0.86,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecash/comments/1i36fp1/the_problem_with_10_minute_blocks_1_minute_blocks/,jaimewarlock,Discussion,"I am a multiplayer game developer working with multiple POW coins like Dogecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ravencoin, and Groestlcoin. These multiplayer games use an in game commodity (which can be used as currency) that is directly linked to the price of an crypto coin. You can use crypto to directly buy the commodity or even sell the commodity for crypto.

So here is the problem. Most of these coins work great for purchases except for Bitcoin Cash. The security difference between 0 confirmations and 1 confirmation is huge. However, in testing, the 10 minute block time for a confirmation is often over an hour. Making customers often wait over an hour creates a poor customer experience. Even as a developer testing deposits and knowing exactly what is going on, it is still a pain. Note this isn't a problem DOGE or RVN due to their quick blocks. And with LTC, the worst I have ever waited is about 15 minutes.

I imagine this is huge drawback to using coins with 10 minute blocks for other applications like gambling or web site access. It wouldn't be so bad if you knew that it would always be 10 minutes or less, but that is only the case 50% of the time. 

I often sell small amounts of crypto for fiat (M-pesa sent to my phone) through a peer-to-peer escrow service. Most people expect to initiate and conclude these transaction in under an hour. I notice that most of these sites have the option of using LTC, but not BCH. This kind of makes sense since you have 3 transactions (deposit/escrow/release escrow) for  in a peer-to-peer sale. On the average, this would take about 30 minutes with BCH, but once again, even just one dragging block, it could easily be over an hour.

People see DOGECOIN as just a meme coin with a lot of publicity, but I see another big reason for it's success. It's FAST. If you are building something that uses crypto deposits, it just makes sense for people to use the fastest coin. I realize that there are other crypto coins that are faster than even DOGECOIN, but they use software that isn't a fork of the original bitcoin software, so they aren't developer friendly, you can't just generate 100,000 addresses, distribute them to your clients, and allow your daemon node to handle the logistics.

Note that this isn't about security of a confirmed block. 51% attacks are a thing of the past for POW coins with large market caps. 1 confirm with 1 minute blocks is still significantly better than 0 confirms on a 10 minute block. And exchanges that require X confirmations for a deposit on 10 minute blocks can just use 10X confirmations with 1 minute blocks.

I have brought up this problem (of 10 minute blocks) to the BCH developers. They don't really consider it to be a real issue. But as a developer of real crypto applications, I can say that it is.

If you want eCash to be a global currency, I would strongly suggest 1 minutes blocks."
Analysts believe spot Litecoin ETF likely to be the first altcoin approval as Nasdaq files listing application,Blockmandev,1i31igi,2025-01-16 17:41:08,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockmandev/comments/1i31igi/analysts_believe_spot_litecoin_etf_likely_to_be/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨 Nasdaq makes waves with spot Litecoin ETF filing  

Nasdaq has filed a 19b-4 form to list and trade a spot Litecoin ETF registered by Canary Capital, marking a potentially massive moment for altcoin enthusiasts. Bloomberg's senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas believes this could lead to the first altcoin-based ETF approval in 2025, with Litecoin ($LTC) leading the charge.  

Recent updates to Canary's S-1 form seem to align everything needed for regulatory approval. Balchunas says Litecoin's commodity designation and a shift in the SEC's approach boost its chances. However, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart remains cautious, stating that SEC acknowledgment will be critical before we pop the champagne.  

In response to this news, $LTC surged nearly 24% in just 24 hours, reaching $129.49. This makes it the best-performing token among the top 25 cryptos by market cap.  

Looking ahead, analysts predict a wave of ETF approvals by 2025, with mixed products that track $BTC and $ETH paving the way. Following Litecoin, cryptos like Hedera and XRP could see the spotlight, though regulatory hurdles may delay tokens like XRP and Solana. Interestingly, reports suggest President-elect Donald Trump might explore $XRP, $SOL, and USDC for inclusion in the US National Reserve, potentially swaying the odds in their favor.

Clearly the big dogs know the Litecoin ETFs are almost certain to be approved due to the obvious similarities to BTC which got approved. Remember Trump takes office in only 4 days then Gary Fraudsler will be removed from SEC chairman. Time is running out to get in before all these bullish events start unfolding. ETF approval deadline is June 12th 2025 at the latest. Litecoin is consistently one of the most transacted, therefore used and held coin due to the almost non-existent fees which will be perfect for the short squeeze when more whales pour in after ETF approval, remember only 84Million MAX supply. 9-10x is still completely on the table for this cycle.

Mind: we are not crypto savvy or rich.

My beloved wanted to have some fun with some of his savings (think €400 to €500) and not with lottery tickets so he played a bit with a meme coin to see how things work in crypto and then he decided to get Litecoin, ending up with about 6 LTC (small stakes for some people I guess).

He (we) decided that he would hold them one year or until they got to € 120, whichever came first.  
We had fun checking the courses now and then, and reminding ourselves not to panic at low course and not go get greedy before 120.

Unfortunately I lost him before those goals had been reached and I had to cash in his coins at a loss (it plummeted shortly after his passing).  
I decided to continue this small journey and bought myself about 6 LTC to hold for a year or until € 120.  
Both the year and the 120 came by and I just couldn't let go.

So now I have LTC, not for profit but for remembrance and wistful smiles, thinking of the fun we had with such small stakes. I'm going to see where this journey brings me."

The crypto space is buzzing louder than ever with the potential approval of a Litecoin-focused ETF. Canary Capital recently amended its S-1 registration with the SEC, marking significant progress in the crypto fund race. While formal approval still hangs in the balance, Bloomberg analysts speculate that Litecoin could leap ahead of other altcoins in the ETF race.  

Market sentiment is heating up as crypto bettors on Polymarket now estimate a 51% chance for the ETF to get SEC nods. If greenlit, Litecoin would join $BTC and $ETH in the exclusive league of SEC-approved spot ETFs.  

This optimism has already sent $LTC soaring, with a 17% price jump to hit a recent high of $120 before cooling to $118. Trading activity also witnessed a massive 240% surge, hitting $1.7 billion in just 24 hours.  

Will Litecoin win the ETF spotlight? The coming weeks will reveal if this underdog altcoin achieves superstar status!

With a sweet 15% price pump in the past 24 hours, all eyes are on this sleeping beauty of the crypto world.  

Even though the bears tried to crash the party, $LTC is brushing them off and strutting above resistance levels. The buzz is all about reclaiming the $121 mark. If $LTC breaks through, someone better pop champagne because the bulls are ready to charge. But hey, let’s not get too comfy. Indicators like CMF signal market strength, but ADX is playing coy, keeping us guessing if a rejection might happen first.  

Pro tip: If the bulls hold the line, this could get spicy with a strong rebound around the corner. So grab your popcorn, crypto fam, and watch this rally heat up. $LTC is serving main-character energy right now, and we’re here for it! 🌟  

Now, if this doesn’t scream ""add me to your watchlist,"" then maybe I'll catch you stacking more $YOI tokens soon, babes. Because remember, $YOI is coming for the future of AI payments, and trust me, you’re going to want in on that action.

Slots.lv might not have a downloadable app for iOS and Android, but their instant-play mobile website mimics the functionality we’d expect from a native mobile client. As soon as you enter your login credentials, you’ll be whisked away into their selection of 245+ real money titles.

# Slots of Vegas – Best Real Money Casino Online for Bonuses

Pros:

* 250+ high-quality games
* Up to $2500 welcome bonus
* Low, 10x wagering requirements
* Works great on mobile
* 24/7 customer support via live chat

Cons:

* No live dealer games
* Doesn’t accept e-wallets

Sometimes a good bonus is all that players want, but then some nasty wagering requirements might get in the way. Luckily, this is not the case at Slots of Vegas – a real money online casino that offers promotions with some of the lowest wagering requirements out there.

# Casino Games: 4.8/5

Slots of Vegas’ selection of casino games for real money might seem a tad limited when compared to our better-ranked picks – but it is by no means of low quality.

Indeed, all of the games that you can play here are powered by the leading RealTime Gaming provider, including immersive online slot games with exciting bonus rounds, specialty games like Fish Catch, and a handful of table games like online blackjack and roulette.

Some of the most popular real money slots at this online casino are Cash Bandits and Rudolph’s Revenge.

The best part is that you can try each online casino game in demo mode, which is rarely a feature available at other online casinos that pay real money.

# Bonuses and Promotions: 5/5

Bonuses for new players is where Slots of Vegas Casino shines the most.

New players can get an impressive 250% bonus up to $3,500 + 50 free spins, which you can use in the Plentiful Treasure game. The rollover requirement is 10 times your bet and there is no maximum withdrawal limit.

There’s also a no-deposit casino bonus code that you can use to get a $25 free chip on the code. Redeem the code SOV25 after you make an account, and you’ll get $25 worth of free play.

Don’t like the sound of these? Check Slots of Vegas’ promotions page to uncover over 20 different casino deposit bonuses for new users.

# Mobile Compatibility: 5/5

This online casino is actually designed with mobile players in mind, with a dedicated website layout that automatically loads when you access the casino from your smartphone’s browser.

Here, you have the chance to take advantage of generous welcome bonuses, take your winnings in no more than 48 hours, and explore its competitive gaming catalog - what more could we ask for?

# Casino Games: 4.9/5

At Wild Casino, you will have the chance to explore 364 slot machines from Betsoft, Dragon Gaming, and Nucleus. Some of the titles on the website are exclusive, so that’s another reason why this website stands out among others.

You also have the chance to explore some table and specialty games. Thanks to this, you can make the gambling experience more exciting and not get bored playing the same game over and over again. Space Invasion, Dream Vacation, and Symbols of Luck are the titles we enjoyed most here.

Besides, there is a separate live casino section where you can wager on European roulette and blackjack. There are 8 poker games available here. Sadly, there is no sports betting available at Wild Casino, so if that’s what you are after, check out some of our top picks.

However, if the absence of betting is not very important to you, Wild Casino will leave you super satisfied. Note that you can try out slots and table games for free in the demo mode before spending any deposit funds.

# Bonuses and Promotions: 4.8/5

If you love bonuses as much as we do, you will be quite impressed with Wild Casino and its latest offers.

Our favorite promotions would probably be a $9,000 crypto deposit bonus. For the first cryptocurrency deposits you make, you will be able to get different rewards that go up to $9,000 in the end – this is quite exciting.

For the first deposit you can get 300% bonus up to 3000 USD. The next 4 deposits are given 150% bonus up to 1500 USD.

There is also a standard welcome bonus of $5000 , which is not much different from the one we just talked about. Use the code to get a 250% match up to $1,000 to get a 100% match up to $1,000.

Besides that, players can also take advantage of more exciting promos, including Refer a Friend, 10% Weekly Rebate, and many more. Make sure you check ongoing bonuses frequently, so you don’t miss out on the newest opportunities waiting for you.

# Payout Speed: 4.85/5

Banking at Wild Casino is a real breeze. We counted 18 different payment methods here, including everything from cryptocurrencies to traditional banking methods, including:

* Bitcoin
* MasterCard
* American Express
* Discover
* Visa
* Ethereum
* Litecoin
* Tether
* MoneyGram
* Bank Transfers

When betting with cryptos, you can deposit a minimum of $20 and a maximum of $100,000 per 1 transaction. If you choose one of the crypto withdrawal options, you'll also get immediate, free payments.

Fiat currency users can deposit funds via credit cards, wire transfers, or mail a paper check. To get started, you must deposit $25 or more using your Visa or MasterCard.

Unfortunately, each money order, bank wire, or paper check will need a minimum withdrawal of $500, which is a little too high. Additionally, paper checks and wire transfers are charged a 3% fixed fee.

# Mobile Compatibility: 4.9/5

All of the games at Wild Casino are fully functional on mobile devices. While there is no separate application for you to download, their instant-play app gives a very smooth mobile gaming experience.

We have tried several slot machines from their gaming portfolio, and they all worked flawlessly. The loading time was fast, and all the buttons, including our beloved “Spin,” were quick to function. We were also quite impressed with the performance of live dealer games. So, all in all, a great online casino experience can be found here.
