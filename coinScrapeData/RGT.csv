The Risks of Different Staking Methods: A No-Bullshit Guide,DeFiYieldClub,1i9tz75,2025-01-25 13:52:05,3,0.81,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFiYieldClub/comments/1i9tz75/the_risks_of_different_staking_methods_a/,Solanafluent,,"Staking is one of the easiest ways to earn passive income in crypto, but not all staking methods are created the same. Some come with good rewards, while others can damage your portfolio if your not careful. Before you lock up your assets, It is important to know what you are getting yourself into. By a request from a community yielder I have tried to break down the risks with different stratetgy.

# 1. Exchange Staking

Centralized exchanges (CEXs) make staking super easy. Just a few clicks and your earning. But easy comes at a cost:

* **Custodial Risk:** Your coins are not  really yours if they are sitting on an exchange. If the exchange gets hacked, mismanages funds, or collapses (FTX, anyone?), you could lose everything.
* **Regulatory Risk:** Governments crack down on exchange staking all the time. One day you are staking, the next day your funds are locked up.
* **Lack of Transparency:** You have no idea what the exchange is doing with your assets behind the scenes.

**Risk Level: High**

# 2. Self-Custody Staking (Validator Delegation)

If you stake directly to a validator on a proof-of-stake (PoS) network like Solana, you keep control of your assets. Sounds great, but there are still some risks:

* **Slashing Risk:** Some networks punish validators for bad behavior or downtime. Solana doesn‚Äôt slash for downtime, but Ethereum does.
* **Validator Risk:** A bad validator means lower rewards or potential delays in unstaking.
* **Liquidity Risk:** Staking locks up your assets for a set period, so if you need funds fast, you might be stuck waiting.

**Risk Level: Medium**

# 3. Liquid Staking

Liquid staking protocols (, Lido, Jito, The Vault, Marinade) give you a token that represents your staked assets. You can use this token in DeFi while still earning staking rewards.

* **Smart Contract Risk:** If the protocol gets hacked, you could lose your staked assets.
* **Depeg Risk:** The liquid staking token (mSOL, vSOL) might not always be worth exactly 1:1 with the original asset. But if mSOL or vSOL depeg it would simply be an arbitrage oppertunity as market would buy up the LST and simply unstake it for insta rewards.
* **Centralization Risk:** A few big liquid staking providers controlling the majority of assets can be a concern.

**Risk Level: Medium**

# 4. Restaking (Solayer and Similar Protocols)

Restaking lets you take already-staked assets and put them to work securing other networks for extra rewards. More yield? Yes. More risk? Also yes.

* **Smart Contract and Protocol Risks:** These are still new, experimental protocols, meaning more risk.
* **Complexity Risk:** Restaking requires some knowledge and active management. You cant just set it and forget it.

**Risk Level: High**

# 5. Staking via DeFi Lending Platforms

Some lending platforms (Save, Kamino) let you stake assets as collateral to borrow or leverage trade. Higher yield potential, but serious risks:

* **Liquidation Risk:** If your collateral value drops, your position could be wiped out.
* **Interest Rate Fluctuations:** Lending rates shift constantly, meaning your APY could drop fast.
* **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:** More complex contracts mean a higher chance of exploits.

**Risk Level: High**

# Final Thoughts

Every staking method has its pros and cons. The best approach? Diversify your staking strategies, use reputable platforms, and never go all-in on one method. Keep an eye on your risk tolerance and make sure you are not locking yourself out of liquidity when you need it most.

**Which staking method do you use? Let‚Äôs discuss in the comments!**"

Let‚Äôs dive into the evolving use cases and future potential of both Jasmy and XRP. We can look at how these projects are developing, their real-world applications, and how they could influence their respective sectors in the coming years.

1. Jasmy Coin: Evolution and Use Cases

Jasmy is primarily focused on empowering individuals with control over their data, especially in the context of IoT (Internet of Things) devices. It seeks to create a decentralized system where data generated by personal IoT devices (smartphones, wearables, connected cars, etc.) is controlled by the users rather than large corporations.

Current and Future Use Cases:
	‚Ä¢	Decentralized Data Storage: Jasmy aims to give people ownership of the data generated by their IoT devices. This is especially relevant in today‚Äôs digital landscape, where personal data is often controlled by tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook. Jasmy‚Äôs blockchain provides a secure and private way to store and manage that data.
	‚Ä¢	IoT Ecosystem: As IoT devices become more ubiquitous (smart homes, smart cities, connected healthcare, etc.), Jasmy could serve as the underlying platform for data storage and transfer between devices. For example, your wearable fitness tracker or smart home devices could send and store data securely on Jasmy‚Äôs blockchain.
	‚Ä¢	Data Sovereignty: With concerns over privacy and surveillance, data sovereignty (giving users control of their data) is a growing concern. Jasmy is positioned to tap into this by allowing individuals to choose how their data is used, without it being exploited by centralized platforms.
	‚Ä¢	Tokenized Data Economy: Jasmy could help create a tokenized data economy, where users can earn tokens for sharing their data in ways that benefit them, rather than large corporations profiting off it.
	‚Ä¢	Enterprise Applications: Jasmy could eventually be used by companies to securely store and manage vast amounts of IoT data for applications in sectors like logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, and smart cities.

Technological Development:
	‚Ä¢	Partnerships: Jasmy has already partnered with SoftBank, one of Japan‚Äôs leading tech firms, which could help accelerate adoption of its IoT solutions. SoftBank‚Äôs involvement in the telecom and tech space could enable broader access to Jasmy‚Äôs technology, particularly in the deployment of 5G networks and connected devices.
	‚Ä¢	Future Integration: As IoT adoption grows and blockchain technology becomes more widespread, Jasmy could see further integration into global IoT networks. This could position Jasmy as a leading platform for secure, decentralized data management in the rapidly expanding IoT sector.

2. XRP (Ripple): Evolution and Use Cases

XRP, created by Ripple Labs, is one of the most well-known cryptocurrencies in the financial space. It is designed to solve issues related to cross-border payments and financial transactions‚Äîspecifically the inefficiencies and high costs of traditional international remittances.

Current and Future Use Cases:
	‚Ä¢	Cross-Border Payments: XRP‚Äôs primary use case is to facilitate cross-border payments. Traditional international money transfers (via banks or remittance services) are slow, costly, and inefficient. Ripple uses XRP to allow for near-instant and low-cost transactions between banks and financial institutions across borders. RippleNet is already being used by major financial institutions and banks globally, such as Santander, PNC, and Standard Chartered.
	‚Ä¢	Liquidity and On-Demand Liquidity (ODL): Ripple‚Äôs ODL (On-Demand Liquidity) service uses XRP as a bridge currency to facilitate instant payments between different fiat currencies. For example, an individual or business can send USD to a recipient in Mexico, where XRP is used to convert the USD into Mexican Pesos instantly and at a low cost. This can save banks and financial institutions millions in liquidity costs.
	‚Ä¢	Smart Contracts and Enterprise Solutions: Ripple has also been exploring smart contracts to enhance its payment solutions, potentially enabling programmable money and more efficient, automated financial transactions.
	‚Ä¢	Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): Ripple is working on CBDC projects, collaborating with governments to integrate XRP into central bank digital currencies. This could be a significant long-term use case for XRP, as governments around the world explore creating their own digital currencies.

Technological Development:
	‚Ä¢	RippleNet and Ripple‚Äôs Network: RippleNet, Ripple‚Äôs global network, connects financial institutions and enables fast, low-cost international transfers. Over 300+ financial institutions are already part of the network, and this number is expected to grow as adoption of blockchain-based payment systems increases.
	‚Ä¢	Regulatory Challenges: Ripple has faced regulatory challenges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has raised concerns about whether XRP is a security. However, Ripple has continued to fight the SEC‚Äôs lawsuit, and a favorable resolution for Ripple could unlock even greater growth and adoption.
	‚Ä¢	Expansion into New Markets: As the global financial landscape continues to shift towards digital solutions, Ripple‚Äôs XRP is well-positioned to play a key role in the future of digital payments, especially as traditional banking infrastructure adopts more efficient blockchain solutions.

Potential Synergies Between Jasmy and XRP:

Though Jasmy and XRP serve different primary functions (data management for Jasmy and payments for XRP), there are potential synergies between the two technologies:
	‚Ä¢	Decentralized Payments in IoT: Jasmy‚Äôs IoT devices could use XRP for instant micropayments or for transferring value when interacting with different connected devices. For instance, Jasmy could enable a system where IoT devices like smart cars or smart homes could use XRP for transactional exchanges (e.g., paying for energy, services, or data usage in real-time).
	‚Ä¢	Cross-Border Data and Payment Solutions: If Jasmy gains traction in international markets, XRP could facilitate cross-border payments related to the IoT data economy. For example, data shared via Jasmy‚Äôs platform could have associated value, and XRP could be used to handle transactions across borders with minimal fees.
	‚Ä¢	Blockchain Integration: Both projects use blockchain technology to create decentralized ecosystems, and as both ecosystems mature, there could be future integrations or collaborations to support global decentralized data and payment solutions.

Conclusion:

Both Jasmy and XRP have distinct but potentially complementary roles in the future of blockchain adoption. Jasmy focuses on decentralizing data ownership and empowering individuals in the IoT space, while XRP is revolutionizing cross-border payments and financial transactions.

As blockchain adoption expands in both the IoT and financial sectors, there‚Äôs potential for these two projects to complement each other, particularly as the global digital economy grows and requires efficient solutions for data management and value transfer.

Would you like to explore more specific developments within each project or look into potential future collaborations between such blockchain technologies?"

It‚Äôs me again! Now with an updated thought exercise! Improved Domestic and diplomatic stuff. So enjoy!  
  
Queue the second term fanfiction! Since I‚Äôve finished my Sordland AAR (link above) I wanted to make/create/envision a second term. Or headcanon, whatever you want to call it. But this is not an epilogue (yet), rather a list of ideas, plans and thought exercises of what would happen in a socialist Rayne‚Äôs second term. And if Suzerain wasn‚Äôt such a pain in the ass to mod I would try to make one. But alas.  
  
  
PS. If The pictures are fucky tell me I'll repost with it fixed.

**Main term mechanics/problems**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Coalition/cabinet stability/support

Now that Rayne has won a second term and the PSP has a plurality, he will be forced to form the first coalition government in Sordlands history. But with whom?

https://preview.redd.it/lmepfj4k46fe1.png?width=472&format=png&auto=webp&s=0985813a05a7ff7307c68f8b35c6bcd203e81382

So, from left to right: PSP, USP, NFP, PFJP, CPS, WPB and BFP  
So what are the options for a coalition?

\-The centrist way: a coalition with the PFJP. Coalition negotiations will require a lot of compromise on your socialist agenda but¬†*should*¬†not anger the more reactionary elements of the country, like the military. This will ofcourse include appeasing Ricter and keeping him happy. We don‚Äôt want a fallen government right? And not to mention you just¬†*barely*¬†have a majority in the GNA.  
I‚Äôll call this coalition ‚Äúthe purple coalition‚Äù after blue+red=purple.  
**Coalition stability: middling + reactionary threat: low**

\-The revolutionary way:¬† a coalition with the CPS and the WBP should not be very difficult and you could go all out with your agenda. You also have a comfortable majority, that plus working with very like-minded parties government stability will not be a problem. Just make sure that you give Stahler and Leke a position in your cabinet.  
But for the rest of the political spectrum this would be an attack on the very spirit of Sordland itself,¬†*according tot hem anyway.*¬†So expect major problems with the USP and NFP.  
I‚Äôll call this ‚Äúthe scarlet coalition‚Äù because scarlet sounds better than red.  
**Coalition stability: high + reactionary threat: high**

**-**¬†The ‚Äòdestined to fail‚Äô way: a coalition with the PFJP and the CPS/WPB. Why would you do this? Your agenda will be impossible to satisfy both sides who will be constantly bickering about everything. Atleast you have a good majority in the GNA, but don‚Äôt take their loyalty for granted. And on top of a wonky coalition, conservatives wil not be happy about the CPS/WPB in government.  
I‚Äôll call this ‚Äúthe Red bird coalition‚Äù after the PFJP‚Äôs bird.  
**Coalition stability: low + reactionary threat: middling**

¬†

\-So Anton has formed a coalition, but what next? Maintaining that coalition ofcourse. Basicly if Anton diverts to much or doesn‚Äôt keep his promises from the coalition negotiations (like being too planned econ with the PFJP) the government falls wich means you now have a minority government, a few empty cabinet spots and have lost the trust of the people.

¬†

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Reactionary influence/terrorists

\-Sordlands transition to socialism will not be warmly received by large parts of the country. Like the USP/NFP and the military. Ofcourse reactionary resistance will be higher or lower depending on the coalition you chose to form.

\-The USP and the NFP will form the ‚ÄúUnited Sordish Front‚Äù even if you chose the centrist coalition. If you are extra mean to the PFJP and disrespect them enough they will join the USF, enlarging the opposition but destabilising it.

\-Now the USF is a mix of free-market capitalists and moderate reformists (Ricterists), Sollists (Lileasists) and Sordist nationalists (Kibenerists). They will do everything to undermine you and make you fail. Because in their eyes you are destroying Sordland.  
Now you can try to undermine¬†*them*, sowing distrust amongst the wings, negotiating with one wing instead of the whole USF as example. Fabricating scandals etc.

\-But outside the GNA the Young Sords are still running around and¬†*they will not be happy.*  
So why not make another terrorist group? The ‚ÄúSaviors of Sordland‚Äù has a good ring to it no? Active in Agnolia and parts of Gruni. The most ignored region and the most reactionary region respectively. Again the strenght of the SS will depend how radical your government is, but you can still expect asassinations and bombings.

3 options of resistance that depends on the coalition you picked:  
\- Agnland resistance: low, Gruni resistance: almost nonexisting  
\-AR: high, GR: middling  
\-AR: middling, GR: low

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Military loyalty

Our beloved general Egg (Iosef) and the rest of the military won‚Äôt be to happy with socialist Rayne so they need to be dealt with. Now military loyalty will be naturally low at the start, the coalition you pick will only improve loyalty a little bit or decrease it a lot.

\-How do ensure their loyalty? Well we can try throwing money at the military to keep them happy but that will not work forever‚Ä¶

\-We can slowly remove anti-socialist elements/figures under the guise of ‚Äòdoctrine changes‚Äô. But be carefull! The military is not that stupid.

\-You can ‚Äòreassure‚Äô the military by letting Iosef staying as defense ministry. But he will be a pain in the ass. So manage him carefully.

\-If the military is disloyal enough they might do something ‚Äòrash‚Äô. Like supporting the reactionary SS and maybe even a coup. If you aren‚Äôt carefull enough.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†Economic stability

Sordland finds itself in a new era of prosperity. But that can‚Äôt be the case forever.  
If you make questionable economic decisions, mismanage the planned economy, if there is to much unrest economic stability will decrease. Affecting future economic projects, the Sordish budget and the welfare of the nation.

\-If Economic stability drops to much the Sordish economy will stagnate and Rayne will lose considerable support.

\-How do we prevent this? Good question I don‚Äôt really know but probably by managing the budget correctly, allocating resources correctly and staying focused on economic goals (not flip-flopping to one thing and another).

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Diplomatic activeness

Sordland is now part of the CSP and posseses the largest ATO-CSP border in the world (as far as we know). Sordland has the power to become a formidable regional power, I think Sordish diplomatic power can stretch from Rumburg to Nibiya, from Morella to Agard. This presents a couple of problems and opportunities, like courting Morella to join the CSP, undermining Arcasian interests in central and southern Merkopa (Qinal and Agard) and some ‚Äònation building‚Äô in Rika. And don‚Äôt forget the growing tensions with Lespia and Agnolia.  
¬†Sordland has a few choices in the diplomatic arena, let‚Äôs go over them.

\-The sword of the CSP.  
Sordland makes strides to spread the revolution across the world!  
extensivily aiding(and influencing) Morella, Wehlen and Rikan nations to get them to join the CSP. Harrasing Lespia, Agnolia, Qinal and The Free Cities. And generally be a pain in the ass for ATO, and sometimes for United Contanta.

\-The lance of the CSP.  
Sordland will take the middle road and not upset the fragile balance¬†*too*¬†much. Still trying to expand the influence of the CSP and some mediating on the side. Also no harrasing nations.

\-The shield of the CSP.  
Sordland will avoid angering ATO and upsetting the balance in Merkopa and will be focused on strenghtening bonds with fellow CSP nations. And only partake in low risk diplomatic plans, international investment and aid. Sordland will also try to be a mediating force to prevent hostilities.

¬†

¬†

**Economic decisions, plans and opportunities**

Aright now that we have the main problems/mechanics of Rayne‚Äôs second term let‚Äôs talk about the economics!

¬†

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Economic direction.  
Now that Sordish economy operates under a planned economy the question is what to do with it? Was this the end goal or is it a stepping stone?

\-Maintain the full command economy: The least risky option, it worked so far right so why fix it? This decision will not have much effect, it‚Äôll keep people happy, the military won‚Äôt suspect anything and the economy will run¬†*fine*. As long as you don‚Äôt screw things up.  
\[economic stability decreases more with ‚Äòbad choices‚Äô\] \[the military and the USF won‚Äôt be angry¬†*as much*\]

\-Transition to a socialist market economy: Cut back state control/intervention while maintaining socialist principles and put the workers first. It will be a delicate balance but the ¬†added flexibility should be worth it. Again it is your choice how far you go with this. Will you fuck it up and create a system were the oligarchs can rise once again? Will you achieve the perfect balance of opportunity and workplace democracy? Or something in between?  
\[Economic stability will decrease less with ‚Äòbad choices‚Äô\]\[The military and the USF won‚Äôt be happy but the moderates might be surprised and warm up to you\]

\-The Valgslandian way: You‚Äôre truly the idealist aren‚Äôt you Rayne? If you do this the proletariat will love you for it, Emmerich Hegel will love you for it and LUS/the Trade Unions too. Workerplace democracy, strenghtening the unions, decentralisation. You will try to create a true socialist economy that is centered on the common worker. Increasing effiency and public opinion. But at the cost of angering the reactionaries beyond saving, if you don‚Äôt take drastic measures prepare for a¬†*significant*¬†uptick in SS activities an expect the USF and the military to openly defy you and engage with¬†*illegal activities*.  
\[Economic stability isn‚Äôt effected\]\[The military and the USF will ‚Äòdeclare war‚Äô on you\]

Economic focuses  
When I started Suzerain I was a little dissapointed with the lack of economic decisions so why not make my own? Now we have Economic directions, focuses and projects. Economic focuses are wich industry/region you want to focus on. This is quite long term so you can only pick one focus, so choose well.

\-Petrochemical expansion: Sordland has oil, gas and a very big important port. Lachaven is perfect for a large petrochemical industry. Oil refineries, gas refineries and plastic based industries. All essential to a thriving modern economy. To accomplish this huge investments are needed in Lachaven, Narbel and Estord.  
Now for a visual demonstration.  
Quick legend: Green=most economic impact/yellow= medium economic impact/Red= a little economic impact.  
Now this focus will make Lachaven even more of an economic juggernaut, and ofcourse for a petrochemical industry you need oil and gas so Narbel and Estord will also receive economic stimulation. And don‚Äôt forget that Gelsord also benefits from a strong Lachaven. Sordland will export more refined oil and plastic products in than anyone on the Merkopan continent! Exept Rizia ofcourse.  
¬†\[This focus will have greater effect if you‚Äôve invested in Gasom\]

\-Expansion of high-tech industries: ¬†We all love the Gelsord silicon valley synergy, because it‚Äôs good. So why not expand it even more? Electronics, advanced shipbuilding, advanced steelmaking, pharmaceuticals etc. With this risky and ambitious plan you will propel Sordland to new heights! And make the Sordish coast truly out of petrol, silicon and high-quality steel! Ofcourse with such a big plan you need to chose on what part you will focus the most. On Morna and Morbel steelmaking and engine factories? Or on the radio factories and the labs in Gelsord? Or on general manufacturing in Greater Holsord? Gelsord and Greater Holsord will see new heights! Lorren will also heavily benefit, after all we all need steel and engines. And ofcourse some slight positives for Lachaven and Deyr. With this plan Sordland will become one of the most technological economies in the world! Exept the superpowers ofcourse.  
\[This focus will have greater effect if you‚Äôve invested in electronic industries\]

\-Expansion of manufacturing/heavy industries: Become the workshop of the world. Why inovate if everything still works? Textiles, furniture, glass, and paper industries. A quite safe focus but should still be exremely beneficial. Primarely focused on the Greater Holsord and Lorren areas Gelsord and Lachaven should still get a boost. And expect export to explode. \[This focus has greater effect if you‚Äôve done Conriat Industrial City\]

\-Expansion of agriculture and mineral extraction: And finally some love for Bergia and Gruni. Becoming the bread basket of Merkopa will be difficult but with enough shrewd investment it should be possibe. And mineral xports are always needed. Zinc, copper, silver, iron, coal and even uranium¬†*perhaps*, are all minerals that nations pay high prices for. With this plan Gruni and Sarna will be cultivating crops wile Ribel and the south of Greater Holsord will be extracting the ground of out great nation!  
\[Investments in Gruni and Bergia will make this plan more succesfull\]

Economic projects  
These projects are like the L-1 and the Conriat industrial city projects.¬†*Relatively*¬†small in comparisons with the others. But with Sordlands economy back on track you can afford TWO projects at a time! Isn‚Äôt that amazing! These projects will have a synergy with economic focuses, other decisions and diplomatic stuffs.

\-Expansion of the L-1 railway to Morna, Conriat and Estord: Pretty self-explanitory, better rail connection equals happier citizens and economic growth. A pretty safe option and will help turn Sordlands coast into an economic powerhouse.

\-Expansion of L-1 railway to Deyr, Erzaren and Wizen: A plan to better connect Bergia tot he rest of Sordland. And a plan to increase connectivity with Wehlen, Smolak will love you for it but it will have diplomatic consequences, positive and negative.

https://preview.redd.it/uo4l212426fe1.png?width=4055&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4b6725f84d8e579af3e9c66cb835f4d5f6de823

\-Expansion of Agnland infrastructure: Finally! Somebody has not forgotten Agnland! With the revival of the H-3 project and the expansion of the L-1 railway to arvory Agnland will finally stop being a backwater! But this will not really help with the economy (except Agnland) but the people will be happy.

https://preview.redd.it/mtkqbhpe26fe1.png?width=4055&format=png&auto=webp&s=52c084863df4cc7f850f409a4bfea5b70305e09d

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† -Estord oil expansion: We will always need more oil so why not? And ofcourse this will work well with the petrochemical plan.

\-Gelsord inovation hub: Gelsord is already the most advanced city in Sordland, so why not take that to the next level? Also what‚Äôs with those ‚Äòrobots‚Äô I keep hearing about?

\-Ribel mining expansion: The mountains around Ribel are filled with metals and minerals, if we can expand the operations there it wouldy surely benefit us.

\-Morbel industry modernization program: upgrading those metallurgy plants and heavy transport factories will make Morbel once again the king of steel and smog in Lorren!

PS. I wanted to include a ‚Äòmake a nuclear powerplant‚Äô project but I think that‚Äôs a little far fetched, for now.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†

**Military**

¬†

¬†

It‚Äôs the military‚Äôs turn! So what‚Äôs on the agenda? Well, doctrine changes, budget changes, managing Iosef and a few more things.  
  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Doctrine changes  
Well it‚Äôs time for a few changes in the military! War always changes so Sordland needs to get with the times. But how will Rayne achieve that? And will Rayne use this as an excuse to purge the military?  
PS. I‚Äôve just read a comment from u/jistiesep about Sordland‚Äôs miliary so I‚Äôm going to take a few things from that so thank you u/jistiesep! Also here is their comment:  
  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/suzerain/comments/1hga9b3/comment/m2huork/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/suzerain/comments/1hga9b3/comment/m2huork/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

  
\-The army: The doctrine of the Sordish army is severly outdated, relying on infantry assault and is full of officers like Valken. Time to change this, but how?  
  
Option 1: Do nothing, keep the old doctrine, ofcourse this will be detrimental for any future engangements but maybe you didn‚Äôt want to risk anything  
  
Option 2: Switch to ‚Äòcombined arms warfare‚Äô/more ‚Äòmodern‚Äô doctrine (I have no idea what this would be, I‚Äôm not that knowledgable about this). And replace Old-Guard officers with Iosef alligned-*mostly* moderate officers.  
\[Iosef will be happy and trust you more, military loyalty doesn‚Äôt change, the military is more *United*\]  
  
Option 3: Switch to ‚Äòcombined arms warfare‚Äô/more ‚Äòmodern‚Äô doctrine (I have no idea what this would be, I‚Äôm not that knowledgable about this). And replace Old-Guard officers with Socialist and regime-friendly officers  
\[Iosef will not be happy, military loyalty will increase, the military grows further *divided*\]  
  
Now this repeats for the air force and the navy, but what does the ‚ÄòIosef happy meter‚Äô, ‚Äòmilitary loyalty‚Äô and ‚Äòmilitary unity‚Äô mean?  
  
\-Iosef happy meter: pretty simple, if Iosef isn‚Äôt happy he will start working against you. So be nice to him, prioritise funding for his projects and give him more influence. But that can be a two bladed sword, if you give him to much influence and *then anger him* he will turn the entire military against you. And if that happens you‚Äôre fucked  
  
On the other hand if you manage things right you can deprive him of allies and isolate the Egg, without him even knowing it.  
  
\-Military loyalty: a little less simple, still basicly represents how well the military listens to you, if it is to low they will refuse to take your orders, be more likely to help your militant opposition and will coup you if they can find an authority figure to rally behind.  
  
Now how do increase loyalty? By getting socialist officers into the military ofcourse! You can try to isolate high command by replacing the lower-ranking officer corp or try to a ‚Äòquick purge‚Äô of high command under the guise of doctrine changes. Both of these have ther up- and downsides.  
  
\-Military unity: When you are trying to make the military more friendly to you by appointing socialist officers and other things you are also dividing the military politically, opening the way for infighting. This ofcourse comes with it‚Äôs own myriad of problems.  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Military procurement  
  
Every military needs more weapons, *new* weapons too. New armored vehicles, jet aircraft, assault rifles, missiles, helicopters, boats etc. Ofcourse there are a few things that can influence these decisions, like budget, different schools of thought and industrial/intellectual capabality.  
  
\-Budget: Pretty simple, how much will you spend on projects and the military as a whole? Granting bigger budgets will make the military happy and give better results. But if you‚Äôre too liberal with funding they may get careless and wastefull. And ofcourse you can veto the projects but that will not make the military happy.  
  
\-Different opinions: One guy thinks the new jet should prioritise guns and minimise it‚Äôs turnrate while the other guy wants to focus on the range and those new heat-seeking missiles. These ‚Äòguys‚Äô have their alignment and loyalties, choosing/supporting one guy over the other strengthens ‚Äòthat guy‚Äôs‚Äô position in the military thus increasing or decreasing Iosef‚Äôs/Old-Guard/Socialist influence.  
  
\- Industrial/intellectual capabality: Sordland is not a superpower, it still needs to buy a lot of it‚Äôs own military hardware and licenses. So it‚Äôs delusional to think that Sordland can completely design, test and produce it‚Äôs own military equipment. So you need to decide how much help you import from outside. If you import to much the military will be displeased and you will be more reliant on the CSP. On the other hand if you try to do everything on your own could compromise the quality of the equipment.  
  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Military wages and pensions  
  
Here is were the comment of u/ Domitien comes in, it boils down to the point that probably most of the military budget is used for huge military pensions and wages for officers from the Soll era. seems like an easy way to cut expenses, all those old officers and vets are almost dead anyway. But this WILL make the military angry.  
  


  
  
**Domestic stuff**

Alright, this part is about education, healtcare, dealing with the reactionary resistance, the Bludish and a few other things. So let‚Äôs start.

¬†

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Welfare state  
  
You can‚Äôt be socialist without a welfare state righ?  
Welfare state‚Äôs are popular yes but they do cost a lot so what will you do?  
  
\-Just expand on the existing structure: Nothing special, better pensions, housing assistence, unemployment subsidies etc. still quit popular and won‚Äôt cost as much.  
  
\-enlarge the welfare state substantially: Make school (almost) entirely free, implement a system that increases wages if inflation increases (Belgium style). And more.  
  
\-Make UBI a reality: Try to give everyone a garanteed wage, ofcourse you can implement in different ways. Maybe link it to the rent of an appartment, the proce of groceries or go all out so that ‚Äòin principle‚Äô no Sordish man needs to work anymore. But this will have consequences.  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Healtcare  
  
\-Do you invest more into healtcare? Do you choose between removing the last differences between rural and urban hospitals? Or do you focus on advancing medical technology in the cities, leaving the countyside in the dust?  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Education  
  
\-More money for Ms Walda? Do you focus on school accessibility to destroy illiteracy or do you focus on the sciences and the universities to make Sords the smartest people in Merkopa? Again do you focus on the countryside or the cities.  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Bludish  
  
\-Who can forget about the Bludish? I don‚Äôt really have an ideas about this but I guess you can focus on deradicalising the Bludish population with subsidies and stimilus packages. And officially/publically condem the Izzam incident.  
  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Public transport  
  
very expensive project but will also make you very popular  
  
\-Light rail expansion: connect a lot of small rural towns across Sordland to the rail network. Rural population will like this.  
  
\-Metro and tram expansion: Make big cities better and more prepared for bigger populations. Urban population will like this.  
  
\-Construct a bus fleet: I don‚Äôt know if Sordland has buses but it has them now! Connect rural towns and big cities alike. Everyone likes this a little bit.  
  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Land redistribution  
  
\-One of the central socialist policies, take land from big landowners and give it to the common farmer. Pretty simple concept. Again you decide how far you go with this. But in short small farmers like you more and the landowners don‚Äôt.  
  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Reactionary resistance  
  
\-You‚Äôre a socialist president in a socialist government in a socialist superpower bloc. People aren‚Äôt stupid, they will fight against you. The core reactionaries of the Saviours of Sordland (SS) recruit from people who are dissatisfied with your ideas and policies. People in Agnland who feel forgotten. Conservative rural people who think you‚Äôre an urban elite, Military veterans etc.  
Now it‚Äôs your job to deal with them.  
  
\-Option one: Use the military to crush the SS. Sounds straight forwrd but isn‚Äôt. I think the SAF isn‚Äôt that good in fighting guerilla warfare (evident by their inability to destroy the BFF) So it might be too difficult. So if you fail again and again the political opposition might see an opportunity.  
  
\-Option 2: Try to destroy their base. Can‚Äôt locate SS cells in Arvory because nobody gives any information because they dislike the government? Make sure you appear concerned with their problems and make sure they have food on the table with a stable job.  
  
Now you also have the Red Youth to use. These determined socialist will do about everything you ask, wether you want it or not. They can be very usefull in fighting the SS and the Young Sords but using them to much discredits your government and make you appear tyrannical. If you use them to often and give them to much resources while you aren‚Äôt socialist enough they might attempt something rash, and maybe United Contana is looking for a new arrangement too‚Ä¶  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Endgame  
  
Now this is something that just came to mind. At the end of Rayne‚Äôs second term when you have solidified socialist control over the military, significantly decreased reactionary power and created a succesfull socialist economy. You should be able to finally declare the ‚ÄòPeople‚Äôs Socialist Democratic Republic of Sordland‚Äô or maybe you want to drop a few adjectives ¬†and just have the ‚ÄòSocialist Republic of Sordland‚Äô.  


**Diplomacy**  
  
  


Who doesn‚Äôt love diplomacy? Sordland has a lot of opportunities on the world stage. Let‚Äôs go over a few.  
  
the main focus (acording to me) would be to enlarge the CSP, Morrella and Wehlen. Creating problems for ATO, infiltrating/isolating Lespia. And while doing those things maybe gain some military, economical benefits?  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Wehlen  
  
The funny man‚Äôs domain, Wehlen is a pseudo-socialist genocidal state that conveniently is anti-west and thus likes us. So why not use it to further the CSP‚Äôs and our interests?  
  
\-Give him money: just give him money, promise him investments to increase Wehlen‚Äôs wealth. You can also promise Smolak a new fancy mansion.  
  
\-Give him guns: give him weapons pretty simple.  
  
But why do this? To get Wehlen into the CSP and isolate Lespia and exert pressure on ATO in central Merkopa ofcourse.  
  
But president Smolak can be a wild card, so maybe you are planning to remove him from the picture and replace him with someone less controversial, and more loyal‚Ä¶  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Morella  
  
Morella would be the first South Merkopan nation to join the CSP and they‚Äôre actively trying to join so with an injection of a few billion Sordish Ren and military equipment they should have no problem joining the revolution!  
  
Now here is where the infiltration comes in. If you are really want to spread the revolutions you can *try* to infiltrate theses nations and fund Malyenevist groups.  
  
But don‚Äôt take it too far! You‚Äôre shenanigans can be uncovered and even United Contana will tell you too stop if you take it to far.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Rumburg  
  
Honestly I don‚Äôt think Rumburg will be that much of a pain the ass. They can‚Äôt really use the BFF because you gave the Bludish rights. They can‚Äôt bully you because you‚Äôre in the CSP.  
  
But that doesn‚Äôt mean YOU can‚Äôt be a pain in the ass for THEM.  
How does it feel Beatrice when foreign powers arm terrorists who want to overthrow the government? HOW DOES IT FEEL?!!  
  
Again with enough *discreet* support you can tie down the Rumburg army and government in a guerilla war in their own country, with their own people. And we know what guerilla wars do to nations.  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Agard  
  
The ATO‚Äôs very own drug-trafficing hub. Now there is a very big opportunity here to spread the revolution. Nobody in their right mind WANTS to live in a damn mafia-state so resistance movements should be plentifull.  
Now there should be few opportunities/choices for you to interfere.  
(All resistance/group names are product of my own fantasy/insanity, non are canon)  
  
\-Support the Aegardian Democrats: Centrist democratic opposition, pretty mild in their anti-establishment actions. They prefer to keep things legal in a country where laws don‚Äôt mean anything, so hopelesly naive. If you fund them enough they might be able to exercise enough power to soft-coup the narco-lord Severo Rios(head of government), leading to them cracking down on the drug trade but they will keep the ATO observer status unless you place some strings in their government.  
  
\-Support the Magka Group: A rival drug cartel that would like Rios‚Äô head on a stick. Not the nicest but an easy option to support, they‚Äôre violent and ready to shoot up Rios‚Äô palace. Now if you fund them enough they can replace Severo Rios‚Äô leading to no change or even an increase in the drug trade but if you promise the new head guy a nice mansion and enough gold toilets he will rescind that ATO observer status for you.  
  
\-Support the Fruma Guerilla‚Äôs: The hardcore Malenyevist group in Agard. With their influence concentrated around the central lake they have the advantage that they can evade government attacks quite easily. Now their military power has decreased in recent years but if manage to pump enough guns and money into them they will gladly march to Ardeal and burn the drug lords tot he ground. But beware, ATO WILL notice that a waning guerilla army has just out of nothing gained traction again. So thread carefully.  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Free Cities  
  
A Dastnurity confederacy that‚Äôs buddies with Arcasia and also rich with tourist money. Now I imagine TFC is quite a stable country so no revolution possible. But you can pull some strings.  
  
\-Infiltrate the Jathlas‚Äô Federalists: An upcoming movement that calls for more integration and for an even closer relationship with ATO. Now you can plant some agents, create corruption scandals, leak those scandals. If you‚Äôre succesfull you can kill the movement before it can seize control.  
  
\-Infiltrate the Confederate Dastnuritists: The embodiment of the status quo in TFC. still this presents an opportunity, if you empower them enough you can a political deadlock between them and the Federalists. And you can also pull a few strings, maybe prevent that third ATO base in the south?  
  
\-Support the Golcondist insurgents: Pro Derdian Golcondists who want to reach Golconda by making life hell for TFC. So why not help them? If you‚Äôre succesfull enough they will tie down quite a bit of ATO resources, for a few years at least.  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Qinal  
  
Aaah‚Ä¶ ATO‚Äôs main partner in Xina, and one that openly defied Arcasia in the past. They are on good terms right now but maybe we can dig up those tensions somehow?  
  
\-Support the Qinali Liberal Party: Contrary tot heir name the QLP are on the right part of the Qinali political spectrum, the *far* right. They champion Qinaly exceptionalism, independence from foreign influence and economic statism. At this point they are a small faction in parlement but a loud one. With some extra funds they will do better but if you manage to dig up/fabricate another PMC scandal the QLP will surge in popularity, and with those elections coming up‚Ä¶  
  
\-Support the Qinali Unbowed Party: A new small extraparlementary party trying to present a left alternative to the ruling coalition. Now they aren‚Äôt Malenyevist or even socialist but they are friendlier and more open to other ‚Äòvieuwpoints‚Äô. Now if you manage to get them into parlement they *maybe* can get in a coalition as a minor partner. Perhaps not that effective at fighting ATO‚Äôs influence but it‚Äôs a nice foundation to build upon.  
  
  


¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Lespia  
  
Lespia, who doesn‚Äôt hate that drunk son of a bitch Alvarez? I imagine two ways you can go about dealing with them.  
  
\-The agressive way: Start by sending agents into Lespian cities and the country side, identify people and groups who are willing to ‚Äòcooperate‚Äô and ‚Äòpresent an alternative‚Äô to the status quo. Arm them, drill them. Spy on the government and the military.  
And when the Lespian status quo starts to fall and Alvarez‚Äô control starts to slip, use them to burn the bourgois to the ground.  
  
\-The diplomatic way: The world is one misfire from a Sordish/Lespian rifle away from nuclear hellfire. So inflating tensions might not bet he best idea. So organize a few diplomatic visits, maybe sign some token demiliterization agreements. So when that spark inevitable sets Perla on fire the Lespian government trusts you and are willing to cooperate more.  
  
Apart from that you can park a naval fleet *just* outside their territorial waters or fly an airplane in to their airspace. Basicly intimidation attemps and being a real asshole for ATO. But this does not come without consequences, a lot of nations will see you raising tensions needlessly and they won‚Äôt be happy.  
  
  
  


¬†

**Diplomatic crisis**

We all know that Sordland‚Äôs population is *weird*, really 37 million? Rizia has 40 million Lespia has 60 million for god‚Äôs sake. It just doesn‚Äôt make any sense. So I though up an in-universe explanation.  
  
Basicly the repression of the Sordish King, the instability of the first republic, the civil war and the Soll stagnation caused a shit ton of Sords to emigrate. Hence the low population. And here is the seed of a diplomatic crisis that will almost lead to war.  
  
Now that Sordland is in a better state president Rayne will seek to bring these people back to Sordland. So he basicly says to the world: ‚ÄúIf you are a Sord In Lespia, Agnolia, Valgsland etc. Come back! We have a big stimulus, house and a job to give you!‚Äù. Now I estimate that around 2,5 million Sords live abroad, most of them in Lespia serving as cheap labor. So when these underpaid underappreciated (probably target of racism) hear that they can go back to their home country for a better life they will drop everything and go. But you know Lespians, they love their cheap labor! So they prevent them from leaving so the Sords protest the government wich leads to a riot wich leads to the police fireing on the Sordish protestors. Wich causes national outrage and within a week the streets of Perla and Falenco are on fire, major protests erupting across the country, The Sordish protestors are now joined by lower class Lespians who want an end to the inequality.  
  
Now it‚Äôs YOUR job to react to this. Your largest rival is on fire, activily murdering your people and their own too. So what do you do?  
  
\-Ramp up funding for revolutionary groups to destabilise Lespia even more, making Alvarez even more desperate, making him more likely to accept terms.  
  
\-Deploy the military to DEMAND that Lespia allow all Sords to safely leave the country, and if they don‚Äôt‚Ä¶  
  
\-Use diplomacy, try to get the rest of ATO and the AN to agree with you demands.  
  
Ofcourse you can use a combination of all of these to get your way. But if this little crisis last to long it will grow out of control. Lespia is teetering on the edge of a cliff so ATO is **desperate** to prevent a revolution. While this is happening both the SAF and the LAF (Lespian Armed Forces) are staring eachother down at the border, opening the possibility of ‚Äòincidents‚Äô that can escalate the crisis into a full blow war. And if that happens you‚Äôre in big trouble. Again you‚Äôre *one misfire* away from nuclear hellfire, don‚Äôt forget that.

  
  
  
  
**Conclusion**

¬†

Alright, now I would like to hear your critisisms on my medieval scroll-sized post.  
Eventually I will make an ‚Äòofficial‚Äô epilogue for Red Sunrise over Sordland.  
And know that I think about it I may just make an in-dept post about the Lespia crisis, and find a better name for it. I‚Äôm open to suggestions!

Ok so I don‚Äôt like to make Shill posts, but I also love being right. So this is an easy one for me. And since I know exactly what‚Äôs going to happen here, I will share with you all.

Full disclosure, I have been trading $RARI since 2022. Since then, I have amassed a nice bag of this selling on pumps and buying back on the dips. I will be holding RARI long term, as I believe this is going to be one of the Top NFT platforms. I made over 6 figures in gains in 2021, so I am not coming from a place of ignorance on this space. 

I stumbled across Rarible by accident in 2021 on the quest for the next biggest NFT platform (I was heavily invested into up and coming NFT platforms in 2021, and that explains my profits). I have never owned an actual NFT. My philosophy: *In a Gold rush, sell shovels.* I am investing into the ‚ÄúShovel Sellers‚Äù, not the Shovels.

What I realized very quickly, is that $RARI is an extremely undervalued asset‚Ä¶..

***What is Rarible?***

Rarible is an NFT platform that allows users to instantly mint NFTs for free, and when it sells they charge a fee to the buyer. The artist pays very little fees. Rarible has an app that‚Äôs very easy to use, and connects to most wallets. However, this is not your normal degenerate NFT community. This is a real Artist community with real collectors. Some of their pieces have sold for multiple millions.

$RARI is the token that‚Äôs used on the platform. When a collector buys on the platform, they need $RARI to do so. Except $RARI is a very limited supply of 25 Million, and about 99% of that in circulation. There is very low liquidity, so when these buyers go to source it, the price will run hard. This is why we see these massive spikes in price when they list a project, as collectors are trying to source RARI to make the purchase.

What‚Äôs very interesting about this is that $RARI has a very low Market Cap currently. At time of writing, sitting around a $55 Million Market Cap. In a simple comparison, Dogecoin is a worthless shitcoin with No utility or use whatsoever, and It‚Äôs sitting at a $55 BILLION MC right now. That‚Äôs 1000X $RARI *(Make it make sense!)*

A 10X from here, and we are still only $550 Million MC. Completely reasonable.

Now I‚Äôm not the only one who has found out about RARI. Forbes ranked Rarible as the #2 Platform behind Opensea, based on ease of use and fees. During the 2021 Bullrun, Opensea did a fundraise at over a $13 BILLION evaluation. For reference, a 100X from today‚Äôs price is still only $5.5 Billion Market Cap. Less than half that of Opensea‚Äôs value at peak. $RARI price peaked at around a $54 ATH in 2021. We have a very long way to go‚Ä¶.

***What are NFTs?***

Now this is more for the Newcomers: An NFT (Non Fungible Token), is the technology behind the art that allows for true ownership of the Art. If you only see JPEGS when looking at NFT you are missing the point. Non Fungible just means that nobody can fake this. You can‚Äôt knock it off like how you can other art, the code is imprinted to the art. They are one and the same. This allows for users to instantly trade without the need for a broker. 

NFT technology is so much bigger than most realize. This application will change everything for us in the future. They are already working on applications for Music, Film, Art, Gaming, Memorabilia, etc. All of these could be traded via NFT someday and it‚Äôs the Most beneficial for the Artist. 

When a creator makes an NFT, they will get a royalty every time that NFT sells, forever‚Ä¶..

This is such a game changer, and one many artists have not realized yet.

Let me explain; *In today‚Äôs Collectible Market, the artist gets paid once at the initial purchase. Let‚Äôs say they sell the piece for $1000, they only make $1000. If that piece then becomes super popular, and it‚Äôs then sold for $10,000, the artist still only made $1000. The collector made $9000.*

With an NFT, the royalty is generally 10%. So that artist will make $1000 every time that piece sells for $10,000. The potential for future profits are so much better with NFT technology.

I believe the NFT craze has literally yet to start. What we saw in 2021 was just a precursor for this revolutionary technology. Rarible will be at the epicenter of this movement when it happens."

Puerto Ricans in Space     
presents     
The Castizo King

### **Chapter VII: The Currency of Legacy**     
     
The sun had just begun its ascent over the lush hills of Puerto Rico, casting golden light into the vaulted windows of the council chamber at Casa Montalvo. Sebasti√°n stood before a table laden with documents, maps, and sealed envelopes bearing the crests of far-flung cities. Around him sat representatives of the Montalvo banking family and their closest allies‚Äîadvisors who had shaped the institution into an international powerhouse.

A courier entered, carrying the latest reports from the family‚Äôs expanding banking empire. The room fell silent as Sebasti√°n gestured for the updates to be read aloud.

Antonia Reyes:
‚ÄúThe charters in Prague and Austria have been approved by their respective governments. Operations will begin within the quarter. Santiago de Cuba has finally cleared its regulatory hurdles, though tensions in the region remain high. Valencia‚Äôs branch has reported record earnings this fiscal year, and Cardiff has secured new contracts with local industrialists.‚Äù

She paused, scanning the next line with a faint smile.

Antonia:
‚ÄúAs for the PR Freehold on Mars, the first Martian bank has successfully completed its initial construction phase. They‚Äôve even coined their first currency‚Äîan alloy-based token suitable for interplanetary trade.‚Äù

The room murmured with approval, the gravity of the news sinking in.

---

**Sebasti√°n‚Äôs Address**     
     
Sebasti√°n stepped forward, his tone calm but resolute.

Sebasti√°n:
‚ÄúThese charters represent more than just commerce. They are the arteries of an interconnected world‚Äîa world where Puerto Rico stands as both heart and mind. But with this influence comes responsibility. We must ensure that our reach uplifts those we touch, rather than exploit them.‚Äù

He gestured to the map of Europe spread across the table.

Sebasti√°n:
‚ÄúPrague and Austria are footholds in a region historically dominated by old powers. They will watch us closely, looking for any excuse to cast us as outsiders. Santiago de Cuba, while under our influence, remains volatile. We must tread carefully, ensuring that our banking presence stabilizes rather than disrupts.‚Äù

Pointing to the Martian Freehold, he continued.

Sebasti√°n:
‚ÄúMars is an opportunity unlike any other‚Äîa blank slate where we can build systems free from the corruption of Earth‚Äôs history. But it is also fragile. If we falter there, it will echo back to us tenfold.‚Äù


---

Family Dynamics

After the formal meeting, Sebasti√°n lingered in the chamber with his cousin, Ignacio Montalvo, who managed the family‚Äôs European operations.

Ignacio (grinning):
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre starting to sound like a philosopher, Sebasti√°n. When did you become so introspective about banking?‚Äù

Sebasti√°n chuckled, pouring them both glasses of wine.

Sebasti√°n:
‚ÄúBanking is philosophy, Ignacio. It‚Äôs about trust, balance, and foresight. Money is just a tool‚Äîwhat matters is how you wield it.‚Äù

Ignacio leaned back, studying his cousin.

Ignacio:
‚ÄúAnd how do you plan to wield it next? These charters are just the beginning, aren‚Äôt they?‚Äù

Sebasti√°n‚Äôs gaze drifted to the map, his expression contemplative.

Sebasti√°n:
‚ÄúWe need stability, Ignacio. Not just for the Montalvo name, but for Puerto Rico. If we can anchor ourselves in key regions, we create leverage‚Äîleverage we can use to influence the tides of politics and commerce. But it‚Äôs not just about us. The people must feel the benefits, or all this will crumble beneath its own weight.‚Äù

Ignacio nodded, raising his glass.

Ignacio:
‚ÄúTo stability, then. And to the Montalvo legacy.‚Äù

They clinked glasses, their shared ambition tempered by mutual understanding.

---

The Risks of Expansion

Later that evening, Sebasti√°n reviewed the letters from Cayenne and Austin. Both regions presented unique challenges:

Cayenne, French Guiana: The charter had been approved, but the region‚Äôs reliance on European interests made it a hotbed of political intrigue. Sebasti√°n would need to navigate carefully to avoid alienating local factions.

Austin, Texas: The branch‚Äôs focus on renewable energy investments had drawn scrutiny from traditional oil barons, creating friction that threatened to derail operations.


Sebasti√°n scribbled notes in the margins of each report, his mind racing with contingency plans. He paused only when a letter from Mars caught his eye.

---

A Martian Update

The letter was from Luis de Silva, the newly appointed Duke of the Freehold Territory.

**Luis (in the letter):**     
**‚ÄúGovernor Montalvo, the first transactions in Martian currency have been completed. It is a small step, but a monumental one. The people here are cautiously optimistic, though they look to Earth for guidance. They need a vision, Sebasti√°n‚Äîsomething tangible to believe in. The infrastructure is sound, the economy is stable, but the soul of this colony is still unformed. What will you make of it?‚Äù**

Sebasti√°n folded the letter, his thoughts heavy.

Sebasti√°n (to himself):
‚ÄúA blank slate, yet already burdened with expectations. What will we make of it, indeed?‚Äù

'Not Just Hype': How the Azuki-Linked Animecoin Drop Aims to Fuel Collaborative Anime,bitfate,1i9jiv8,2025-01-25 04:38:22,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitfate/comments/1i9jiv8/not_just_hype_how_the_azukilinked_animecoin_drop/,MammothBattle33,,"üö®Just IN: Azuki Co-Founder Zagabond on the ANIME Coin Launch and Its Impact on the Anime Ecosystem

In a move that's generating significant buzz in the crypto and anime communities, the ANIME coin has launched on Ethereum and Arbitrum, with Azuki co-founder Zagabond at the helm. This new cryptocurrency is designed to revolutionize the anime ecosystem by empowering fans and creators alike through a decentralized, community-driven approach.

The ANIME coin's tokenomics are structured to ensure maximum community involvement. A substantial 50.5% of the 10 billion token supply is allocated to grants and programs managed by the Animecoin Foundation, supporting creators, developers, and fans. The Azuki community, which has been instrumental in the project's early stages, will receive 37.5% of the tokens, all of which are fully tradable from the outset.

Zagabond emphasized the project's long-term vision, despite the challenging timing following the launch of Trump's meme coin. ""You can't predict day-to-day events in crypto, but you can build something real,"" he noted. The Animecoin Foundation has spent three years cultivating a brand and culture around anime and Web3, making timing less critical.

The integration of the ANIME coin with the Arbitrum network is a key aspect of its strategy. Arbitrum's commitment to decentralization, low fees, and speedy transactions makes it an ideal platform for the project. This setup allows for efficient and transparent governance through the AnimeDAO, where token holders can influence the direction of community-driven projects.

The project aims to transform anime fans from passive consumers into active contributors. By leveraging blockchain technology, ANIME coin enables fans to influence and produce anime-related content, whether it's art, fashion, music, or gaming. This approach could set a new standard for niche cryptocurrencies, fostering innovation and community engagement across different sectors.

As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, the ANIME coin's focus on community and decentralization positions it for significant growth and impact within the anime ecosystem.

"[Genshin Impact] As we return to Inazuma, one loose end still bothers me: Scaramouche never making amends with Kazuha.",CharacterRant,1i9iqs9,2025-01-25 03:38:59,2,0.56,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterRant/comments/1i9iqs9/genshin_impact_as_we_return_to_inazuma_one_loose/,EarthSeraphEdna,Games,"Inazuma is ruled by the Raiden Shogun. (We will put aside the autonomous region of Watatsumi Island.) Underneath her is an aristocracy, led by three great noble clans who run the three branches of government. Below those three highest houses are a number of minor or branch families, such as the priestly Kuki. Many playable Inazuman characters are nobles, as evidenced by their full names.

Kaedehara Kazuha is a minor noble. The Kaedehara clan was one of five renowned for mystical bladesmithing skills. Unfortunately, for the past few centuries, Scaramouche (originally Kunikuzushi) had embarked on a petty crusade to ruin all major craftsmen in Inazuma. Thanks to slow, methodical sabotage to make them look foolish and incompetent, Scaramouche successfully shattered the reputations of four out of five of these mystical bladesmithing houses, including the Kaedehara family. By the time Kazuha was born, his clan was disgraced and impoverished.

Today, Kazuha is the last of his line. He has gained acclaim on his own (mostly for parrying a god), and he turned down an opportunity to restore the prestige and fortune of the Kaedehara name, in favor of wandering the world. Nevertheless, his house's past came back to haunt him. Hues of the Violet Garden saw him learn about Scaramouche's old campaign to engineer the downfall of the Kaedehara clan and several others: including a document penned by his great grandfather, detailing the machinations of Kunikuzushi, which would have been dismissed as the ravings of a madman at the time. The Golden Apple Archipelago 2.8 showed that his childhood still weighs heavily on him.

Later, in an effort to delete himself and his past actions from the timeline, Scaramouche wound up ""merely"" erasing all memories and historical records of himself. This includes the written testimony of Kazuha's great grandfather, which now makes only vague intimations about internecine strife between the bladesmithing families as the ""real reason"" for their gradual downfall.

So now, Kazuha's mind has been robbed of the knowledge of Scaramouche, the true perpetrator of the collapse of four whole noble clans and their respective mystical bladesmithing arts. Scaramouche has referred to Kazuha only once, and even then, dismissively (check his voice lines). There is no longer any chance for the house of Kaedehara and three other humiliated families to receive justice or even a token apology from Scaramouche.

As we return to Inazuma, this really, really irritates me. I hope that the writers even loosely acknowledge this, but I doubt that they ever will.

___

It has also been pointed out that the above incident also affected two other playable characters, Ayaka and Ayato of the Kamisato clan. Their house was responsible for overseeing the works of the five bladesmithing family. The Kamisatos were also badly scandalized, to the point wherein Ayaka and Ayato's aging parents died from the stress.

Also, this covers only **one** of his misdeeds! Scaramouche has been active for centuries across the globe, and we have seen him orchestrate at least two other major operations: the Unreconciled Stars, and the Inazuman Delusion factory. How many other wrongdoings has Scaramouche eluded justice for?"

To quickly address some comments being shared, as we're still working on the relaunch a few things might be out of whack such as stock levels, access issues or other little bugs here and there. Please be patient while I work through these. It is literally myself and a part time developer :) Keep sending in reports so I am aware.

Great news though, patients can be validated through the new sign in system, medAuth, by either uploading a escript/token or providing medicare details. eScript is quicker so expect a slight turn around time for the medicare validation. Validation is required by the government as everyone is aware of what's happened the past couple of months. Everything is secure and private. These are not my personal requests for data.

There will be a more in depth post made later about the relaunch. Hope everyone has a great long weekend!

A Gateway to a Decentralized Anime World,altcoin,1i9hrp2,2025-01-25 02:26:14,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1i9hrp2/a_gateway_to_a_decentralized_anime_world/,flashamazin,,"  
I've come across an intriguing new project that I believe will pique your interest. Let's explore ANIME Token, which is about to launch on both Ethereum and Arbitrum, and is now making waves with its listing on Bitget.  
What Makes ANIME Token Special?  


* Strong Support: ANIME Token is backed by the Arbitrum Foundation and Azuki, a leading name in NFTs, providing a robust launchpad for this venture.
* Ambitious Goals: With a cap at 10 billion tokens, the aim is to connect more than a billion anime fans globally, positioning itself as the ""culture coin"" for the anime sector. 
   * Fan Empowerment: It's not just about consuming anime; this project lets fans have a voice in shaping their beloved universe.
   * Innovative Use of Blockchain: By combining original content with broad distribution networks through blockchain technology, it offers fans greater control and opens new avenues for creators.

Token Allocation Details:  


* Community Focus: Over half (50.5%) of the tokens are dedicated to community initiatives via the Animecoin Foundation, emphasizing community governance.
* Azuki Perks: Azuki community members are in for a bonus with 37.5% of tokens reserved for them at launch. Unclaimed tokens will bolster the 13% Community Cultivation Fund, managed by AnimeDAO for further community projects.
* Growth and Partnerships: The foundation keeps 24.44% for expanding the ecosystem, with an additional 2% for partner communities.
* Vesting for Commitment: Team members, contractors, and Azuki employees are allocated 15.62% with a vesting period of three years, including a one-year cliff, promoting long-term involvement. Azuki Corp holds onto 7.44% under similar conditions.

ANIME Token was initially listed on Bitget in the Innovation, NFT, and WEB3 Zone. Trading commenced with the ANIME/USDT pair, with deposits available immediately before trading started on January 23, 2025, at 14:00 UTC. with a  $5K ANIME Giveaway for BGB Holders This initiative is all about blending the magic of anime with the innovation of blockchain. The Bitget listing and associated events are significant steps in bringing this vision to life. Whether you're into the tech, the culture, or both, ANIME Token is definitely one to watch.

How ONYX stands out from other crypto?,XCN,1i9hi87,2025-01-25 02:06:44,18,1.0,0,https://i.redd.it/v5953gpba3fe1.jpeg,ELXR-AUDIO,,"The Onyx Protocol and its coin, Onyx Coin (XCN), stand out from other cryptocurrencies because of the following key features:

1. Multi-Asset Support

Unlike many blockchains (e.g., Bitcoin, which only supports Bitcoin, or Ethereum, which primarily focuses on ETH and ERC tokens), Onyx is designed to manage multiple types of assets within one system. It allows users to create, transfer, and control digital assets seamlessly.

2. Customizable Smart Contracts

Onyx uses a Turing-complete programming language, meaning developers can build highly flexible and sophisticated smart contracts. This allows for more advanced features like programmed rules for asset management, custom financial tools (e.g., options, escrows), and conditional transactions.

3. Scalable and Efficient

Onyx uses the UTXO model, similar to Bitcoin, which allows transactions to be validated in parallel. This makes it faster and more scalable than blockchains like Ethereum, where transactions must be processed one after the other.

4. Federated Consensus for Security

Its unique federated consensus model strikes a balance between decentralization and efficiency. Instead of relying on energy-intensive proof-of-work (like Bitcoin) or highly public networks (like Ethereum), it relies on a quorum of trusted block signers, ensuring security without compromising speed.

5. Interoperability

Onyx can interact with other blockchains and systems using cross-chain protocols. This makes it more flexible compared to many crypto projects that operate in isolated ecosystems.

6. Community Governance

Onyx is governed by its users through the Onyx DAO. Every XCN token gives its holder voting power to propose and vote on system improvements, treasury decisions, and other updates. This community-driven approach ensures that changes are in the best interest of users.

7. Utility Beyond Governance

Onyx Coin (XCN) isn‚Äôt just for governance. It offers:
	‚Ä¢	Discounts within the Onyx ecosystem.
	‚Ä¢	Premium access to services.
	‚Ä¢	Use as a payment token in related products.

8. Privacy and Security

Onyx incorporates features to maintain user privacy by keeping public keys pseudonymous. Advanced options, like hiding parts of contracts until needed, add additional confidentiality compared to many transparent blockchains.

9. Extensibility and Adaptability

The protocol can evolve over time through soft forks. This ensures backward compatibility while enabling bug fixes, new features, and better security, unlike rigid systems that require hard forks for changes.

10. Business-Adapted Design

Onyx focuses on solving real-world financial problems, such as high costs, inefficiency, and limited transparency in asset transfers. Its design is especially appealing for businesses looking to streamline operations with blockchain technology.

In Summary:

Onyx Protocol stands out by combining multi-asset support, scalability, privacy, and interoperability into one platform. Its focus on efficiency, community-driven governance, and flexibility make it a unique option compared to other crypto projects that may only excel in one or two of these areas."
ZachXBT Rug Pull Drama Highlights the Challenges of Unpaid Crypto Sleuthing,cryptoddler,1i9h23z,2025-01-25 01:34:58,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptoddler/comments/1i9h23z/zachxbt_rug_pull_drama_highlights_the_challenges/,Actual_Ad_5440,,"Renowned crypto investigator ZachXBT faced accusations of orchestrating a rug pull after withdrawing liquidity from a memecoin tied to his name. Known for exposing scams and aiding law enforcement in tracking fraudulent activities, ZachXBT's decision raised questions about the financial recognition of his contributions.

# The Incident:

* **The Memecoin Gift:** Anonymous creators launched a token, ""Justice for ZachXBT,"" claiming it was to support his work. Half of the token's supply was sent to ZachXBT, who used it to create a liquidity pool.
* **Withdrawals:** ZachXBT withdrew 16,348.95 SOL (worth $4.3 million) from the pool, sending the funds to Wintermute, a trading firm, while redepositing 96 million tokens into the liquidity pool.
* **Community Backlash:** Critics accused him of profiting from the token, though ZachXBT clarified he did not promote or create the coin, calling the allegations baseless.

# Broader Implications:

* **Unpaid Contributions:** ZachXBT expressed frustration over the lack of financial incentives in his investigative work, despite aiding governments and protecting the crypto community.
* **Support from Peers:** Blockchain investigator SomaXBT defended ZachXBT's actions, stating that the memecoin was exploiting his name for profit, and he simply reclaimed the proceeds.
* **Ongoing Commitment:** Despite the controversy, ZachXBT remains active in uncovering scams, recently warning about new fraudulent token schemes targeting celebrity profiles.

# Conclusion:

The incident underscores the challenges faced by independent crypto investigators who work without formal financial backing. While ZachXBT‚Äôs actions sparked debate, his commitment to exposing scams and protecting the crypto space remains evident."

"Vitalik Buterin warns ‚Äòpolitician coins‚Äô could threaten democracy, enable bribery",Blockmandev,1i93yz0,2025-01-24 14:38:58,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockmandev/comments/1i93yz0/vitalik_buterin_warns_politician_coins_could/,MammothBattle33,,"üö® Vitalik Buterin Sounds the Alarm on ""Politician Coins"" and Their Democratic Dangers  

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has issued a sharp warning about the rise of so-called politician coins, which he describes as a tool for modern-day bribery. These tokens, he argues, could dangerously erode democratic systems by enabling covert financial influence.  

According to Buterin, simply holding or buying a politician coin could boost its value, indirectly enriching the issuer without any explicit transfer of funds. This, he says, creates an opaque and highly manipulative system that sidesteps traditional donation rules while bolstering private influence.  

Broader concerns also emerge about such mechanisms' implications for governance. Buterin argues that financial markets, efficient for goods and services, falter when utilized for political sway. His proposed solutions center around either isolating political leaders or distributing power to dilute the risks of corruption, with a clear preference for decentralized systems.  

The rise of blockchain in politics, while innovative, raises red flags. As crypto adoption grows among political figures, the space must tread carefully to avoid unintended consequences like reduced transparency and heightened corruption risks.  

Buterin‚Äôs comments are a timely reminder: bold tech innovation must be met with equal measures of caution and regulation to protect democracy's integrity.

* Vitalik Buterin cautions about the use of political tokens, suggesting they could become tools for bribery.
* He compares the short-term appeal of tokens to addictive¬†[mobile games](https://worldmagzine.com/beauty/lady-gaga-and-celine-dion-to-headline-paris-2024-olympic-opening-ceremony/), which can mislead new investors.
* Buterin‚Äôs concerns are heightened by the risk of market instability and concentration of token control among a few large holders.

Vitalik Buterin has expressed concern about the rise of¬†[political tokens](https://worldmagzine.com/trending/whale-investor-suffers-3-5-million-loss-on-pepe-tokens/), claiming they could become vehicles for political bribery and manipulation. The problem, he explains, is that when a politician issues a token, supporters may increase the value by simply holding it, essentially contributing to their wealth without transferring funds.

Buterin also draws attention to the speculative nature of political tokens, likening them to hyperaddictive mobile games that offer short-term excitement but lack long-term value. He urges the¬†[community](https://worldmagzine.com/india/pm-modi-to-address-major-community-event-in-new-york-during-us-visit/)¬†to differentiate between risky, short-lived trends and sustainable, meaningful investments.

# The Hidden Dangers of Political Tokens: Vitalik Buterin‚Äôs Warning on Crypto‚Äôs Future

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has raised alarm over the potential of political tokens to facilitate bribery, highlighting their risk to both markets and governance. He warns that, unlike[¬†traditional forms](https://worldmagzine.com/automobiles/hydrogen-powered-rescue-truck-breaks-world-record-with-zero-emissions/)¬†of financial exchange, these tokens allow political figures to amass wealth without any direct exchange of value. Supporters buy and hold the tokens, inadvertently inflating the wealth of politicians.

This model, according to Buterin, is similar to the addictive nature of some mobile games, which thrive on quick rewards that encourage players to keep investing time and money, despite the lack of substantial long-term benefits. In a similar vein, political tokens may attract short-term excitement, but they risk leaving behind serious consequences when the novelty wears off.

In addition to the¬†[ethical issues](https://worldmagzine.com/technology/meta-is-working-on-a-brand-new-more-potent-ai-system/), Buterin also points to the dangers of market instability. Tokens like TRUMP and MELANIA have become increasingly popular, but they are plagued by a serious imbalance in distribution. A small number of large holders control the majority of the token supply, making the market susceptible to wild price fluctuations. This creates an uneven playing field, leaving smaller investors vulnerable.

Binance‚Äôs recent move to offer a leveraged perpetual contract for MELANIA tokens further complicates the situation. With high leverage, traders can amplify their bets on volatile tokens, increasing the potential for both gains and losses. This heightens the risk for those involved in speculative¬†[¬†crypto](https://worldmagzine.com/crypto/vitalik-buterin-warns-against-the-dangers-of-political-tokens/#)¬†markets, especially when political figures are tied to such financial instruments.

Buterin‚Äôs warning on political tokens serves as a cautionary tale for the¬†[crypto world](https://worldmagzine.com/crypto/trumps-crypto-pivot-launching-world-liberty-financial-amid-2024-election-campaign/), emphasizing the importance of long-term, sustainable investments over short-term speculative ventures."

2. Successful memecoin trading requires thorough research to avoid scams, careful evaluation of community strength and liquidity factors, and adherence to best practices for risk management.
3. To minimize risk, some traders focus on higher-cap memecoins listed on reputable exchanges, and use tools like Dex Screener to audit token contracts and holder distributions.

# A trader's guide to memecoins üíª

Memecoins, though often launched as such, are no joke.¬†

On the surface, these lighthearted projects with seemingly no utility may seem fundamentally useless. In reality, they make up billions of dollars‚Äô worth of market capitalization, bringing together global communities of millions of users who rally around a shared vision.

As memecoins live and die on their memetic appeal and community spirit, they‚Äôre highly volatile ‚Äî even compared to other cryptocurrencies. As such, caution must be exercised when trading them.¬†

This article will outline the best practices for doing so.  


# Where to trade memecoins üìç

Unsurprisingly, memecoins like¬†[Dogecoin (DOGE)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-dogecoin-doge),¬†[Pepe (PEPE)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/buy-pepe-pepe)¬†do not originate on centralized exchanges, but often find their way there after gaining significant traction.

Instead, these tokens are more commonly found on blockchain networks like Ethereum and Solana, and traded on decentralized exchanges like¬†[Uniswap](http://uniswap.org/)¬†and¬†[Jupiter](http://jup.ag/). Anyone can access these trading venues with a non-custodial wallet such as¬†[Kraken Wallet](https://www.kraken.com/wallet).

# Key considerations for memecoin trading üßê

As with any investment,¬†[doing your own research (DYOR)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-dyor)¬†is strongly recommended prior to diving into any memecoin trade. Granted, this can be difficult with many, due to a lack of available resources for newer projects.

Remember that¬†**memecoins rarely have any utility**. Instead, they gain value based on the popularity of the meme and an active community behind them, who act as de facto marketers ‚Äî taking to social media platforms to share memes and content about the project in hopes of attracting new investors.

This dynamic underscores the need for caution: with the tools available today, it‚Äôs easy for bad actors to ‚Äòastroturf‚Äô on social media ‚Äî making it appear as though the community is much larger than it is. To audit a project yourself, you‚Äôll want to spend some time in its community hangouts (X, Telegram, Discord) to get a feel for its strength.¬†

An example of a potential red flag is an¬†[LP (liquidity provider) token](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-are-liquidity-provider-lp-tokens)¬†that hasn‚Äôt been burned. The renouncement of this token is a good faith gesture that the developer will not rug pull its users, which can provide a degree of confidence in the project. More on this in the next section.

For more information on rug pulls, check out our Kraken Learn Center guide,¬†[How to stay safe in DeFi](https://www.kraken.com/learn/how-to-stay-safe-in-defi).

A tool like¬†[Dex Screener](http://dexscreener.com/)¬†or¬†[Birdeye](http://birdeye.so/)¬†can provide valuable insights prior to purchase. Some important things worth checking out include:

* **Holder distribution:**¬†a single entity holding the majority of the token supply is risky, as a sudden sell-off could cause prices to crash.
* **Website and socials:**¬†take a look at the project‚Äôs Telegram group and website to gauge the (organic) community support for the token.
* **LP status:**¬†as mentioned earlier, has the LP token been renounced? If it hasn‚Äôt, the developer could drain the liquidity pool at any moment.
* **Token contract:**¬†can new tokens be minted (diluting the existing supply) or frozen (preventing users from selling)?



# Managing risks in memecoin trading üìö

Unfortunately, the memecoin space is rife with scams that can catch out even the most seasoned traders.¬†

Risk can be mitigated, to a degree, by sticking to higher-cap offerings listed on reputable exchanges: the exchange is likely to have performed its own assessment of the project prior to listing, and the memecoin is probably established enough that the actions of a single bad actor may not massively impact it. This does not, however, protect it from unexpected exploits or reputational damage that could cause the price to tank.

For non-listed memecoins, risks range from deliberate, malicious rug pulls to simple lack of interest from users. The end state is the same for both cases: following a sharp decline in price, a lack of liquidity makes the tokens untradable.¬†

The former is a common scenario with tokens launched by coin creators with no prior reputation. Launching a token requires no technical skill due to the availability of off-the-shelf tools, making it easy for bad actors to spin up these scams. Again, an LP burn can signal to the community that the developers are committed to the project, as they cannot withdraw liquidity without the LP token.  


# Tips for successful memecoin trading üìñ

Memecoins are highly volatile assets in an already volatile market. Predicting their trajectory is impossible, as even the most promising projects can fail due to wider trends in the financial/crypto markets.

As such, any investment should be undertaken with an understanding of the very real risk that¬†**the coin could lose the entirety of its value**. Many recommend against placing all of your eggs in one basket, instead diversifying across other cryptocurrencies and financial assets in case of loss.

Identifying successful memecoins requires time and immersion in the crypto space ‚Äî ideally via Twitter and Telegram groups. This will allow you to identify interesting projects early and to catch them prior to widespread adoption.

Trump Signs Executive Order to Revolutionize U.S. Crypto Policy,Junior_Stocks,1i8ycub,2025-01-24 10:45:22,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Junior_Stocks/comments/1i8ycub/trump_signs_executive_order_to_revolutionize_us/,JuniorStocksCom,,"Original Article: [https://www.juniorstocks.com/trump-signs-executive-order-to-revolutionize-u-s-crypto-policy](https://www.juniorstocks.com/trump-signs-executive-order-to-revolutionize-u-s-crypto-policy)

*Trump's Executive Order Sets the Stage for a New Era in U.S. Cryptocurrency Regulation*

https://preview.redd.it/8b115xjvpyee1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b1312a226fcfa7f963e4560a56218369976fc64

In a decisive move, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on January 23, 2025, establishing a cryptocurrency working group tasked with drafting new regulations for digital assets and exploring the feasibility of a national cryptocurrency stockpile. This action underscores Trump's commitment to reshaping the U.S. approach to digital asset policy, a key promise during his campaign.

The order also emphasizes safeguarding banking services for crypto companies, responding to longstanding complaints from the industry about restricted access to financial institutions. Additionally, it explicitly bans the creation of a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC), reflecting Trump‚Äôs skepticism about government-issued digital currencies that could rival existing cryptocurrencies.

**A Game-Changer for Crypto Policy**

The working group, which will include top officials like the Treasury secretary and the chairs of the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has been directed to develop a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. This includes addressing the status of stablecoins, a critical component of the digital asset ecosystem.

Notably, the executive order signals a marked departure from the crypto policies of the previous administration under President Joe Biden. While Biden-era regulators sought to rein in the industry with legal actions against companies like Coinbase and Binance, Trump‚Äôs approach aims to foster innovation and boost the U.S. as a global leader in digital assets.

**Protecting Banking Services for Crypto Companies**

One of the most significant aspects of the order is its directive to ensure that crypto companies retain access to banking services. For years, crypto firms have accused U.S. regulators of pressuring banks to sever ties with the industry, a claim that has been repeatedly denied by regulators. Trump's executive order sets a clear tone that the new administration will support crypto companies in securing essential financial services.

Nathan McCauley, CEO of Anchorage Digital, described the move as ""a sea change in U.S. digital asset policy,"" emphasizing the administration's commitment to clarity and consistency in crypto regulations.

**National Cryptocurrency Stockpile: A Revolutionary Idea**

The executive order introduces the concept of a national digital asset stockpile, potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by federal law enforcement. While details remain sparse, the initiative could be implemented through the U.S. Treasury‚Äôs Exchange Stabilization Fund.

Legal experts remain divided on whether congressional approval is necessary to establish such a reserve. Some analysts argue that this stockpile could enhance the U.S.'s ability to stabilize markets and bolster its strategic position in the digital asset space.

**Bitcoin Hits New Highs Amid Regulatory Optimism**

The market has responded enthusiastically to Trump's crypto-friendly policies. Bitcoin surged to an all-time high of $109,071 earlier this week, fueled by investor optimism about the administration‚Äôs support for digital assets. Although prices dipped slightly to $103,000 by Thursday afternoon, the upward momentum remains strong.

**SEC Reverses Costly Crypto Asset Guidance**

Adding to the industry‚Äôs relief, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rescinded controversial accounting guidance that previously made it expensive for companies to safeguard crypto assets. This change could remove a significant barrier to institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies.

The executive order comes just days after the SEC announced the creation of a task force to overhaul crypto policy. Together, these moves signal a coordinated effort to integrate digital assets into the mainstream U.S. financial system

**The Road Ahead: Regulatory Clarity and Innovation**

Trump‚Äôs order sets the stage for a regulatory overhaul that could finally address the crypto industry‚Äôs long-standing grievances. By clarifying the legal status of crypto tokens as securities, commodities, or other classifications, the administration aims to establish a stable and predictable environment for innovation.

Senator Tim Scott, chair of the Senate Banking Committee, praised the initiative, saying, ""Just days into his administration, President Trump is delivering on his promises to keep the United States a leader in digital assets innovation.""

**Conclusion**

President Trump‚Äôs executive order represents a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency policy in the United States. By prioritizing regulatory clarity, protecting banking access for crypto companies, and exploring innovative ideas like a national digital asset stockpile, the administration is signaling its commitment to fostering growth in the digital asset industry.

With the crypto market already reacting positively, these measures could redefine the U.S.'s role as a global leader in digital asset innovation."

The wait was agonizing.

They had all heard the commotion when the councillor arrived, and now, it was only a matter of time before Nako retrieved them for First Official Contact.

Jasmine was pacing to calm her nerves, practicing breathing in and out and going over the plan she, Xant and Itsuki had devised amongst themselves. Questions to ask, demands to make, subtleties and nuances of alien culture she had learned were all about to be put to the test.

There couldn‚Äôt be any room for doubt.

Spades sat beside Beau, the large man had a hand over his partners head, gently running his fingers through the fur. They had plenty of practice waiting, lost in thoughts far beyond the confines of the room, while he would have preferred to talk, he couldn‚Äôt let his emotions get ahead of himself or anyone else.

Itsuki finished the last knot of ribbon around a wooden box, fiddling and fussing the elaborate fabric until it was deemed ‚Äòpresentable‚Äô. A small token they had agreed upon, since even in the depths of space, it felt uncomfortable coming empty handed to such an occasion.

Xant pried his eyes away from the door, the anticipation was driving half of him to irritation, while the other longed for the days of his stoicness. Humility and reservation, it was not his place to have ‚Äòloud‚Äô emotions today.

Xant offered Jasmine a cold glass of water, she took it graciously, but barely took a sip when they all felt the chilled air of the lieutenants arrival.

Jasmine‚Äôs nerves flared, but Xant‚Äôs hand over hers brought her back down.

‚ÄúEven presence,‚Äù he reminded her, and she half smiled.

‚ÄúCalm thoughts,‚Äù she replied.

Beau stood up, reaching for the faceless helmet that accompanied the suit.

‚ÄúYour time to shine,‚Äù He prompted her, before clasping the unwieldy armour over his face, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try to keep my simmer down,‚Äù Despite the request made to the Engine lord to make their helmets exactly the same as diagrams provided, Viitoic had insisted the design was incompatible with the galactic safety standards. There was no visor, and no meaningful way to turn his head, once the helmet was connected to the suit the organic cameras on the outside became his eyes. He could see everything around and behind him, it made him feel like a walking tank, an ugly tank, but a tank none the less.

Itsuki tucked the wooden box under his arm, and adjusted the alien sword at his hip.

‚ÄúReady when you are, Sunshine,‚Äù he stated without sarcasm.

Jasmine nodded, affording herself one last sigh before heading for the door.

Closing her eyes, she could get a better feel for those outside the room, Rynard‚Äôs relaxed bravado unwavering while the fresh chill of the Lieutenant felt like cracking ice.

‚ÄúIt feels like he‚Äôs waiting outside,‚Äù she whispered allowed, and he felt just as nervous as she did. Jasmine turned back to face her friends, all of them waiting for her orders, so she put on a brave face and a warm glow, ‚Äúlets go make first contact,‚Äù

-*-

Counillor Kaalijorn looked rather disparagingly at the room, despite the hours the attendants had, there was just no way to restore millenia old steel in a day.

The conference room had been bare, since Kotorn took most of his meetings in his own office, the space had been spared the physical damage but suffered from abandonment and neglect. Even with added wall coverings and floor rugs, the best Kaalijorn could do was make sure it was clean, neutral space, devoid of any obnoxious odors.

It had crossed their mind, several times infact, to hold such an occasion upon their own ship, the surroundings would have been more comfortable for everyone involved, but then that would have undermined the security and secrecy. It was not a good idea to be outnumbered by an alien species in an advanced stealth ship.

Several tables and stools stood beside the infloor holoprojector, their own data uploaded to it and synced so that should the need arise the councilor could pull files with a simple command. Speeches and holovids prepared to show off the glory of the Galactic Council and the great boons they would receive upon their admission were all prepared before he even left Clentessia. Kaalijorn chuckled to themself, despite being the ‚Äòambassidor‚Äô they was really only there to help the fledgling species navigate the endless contracts of citizenship.

And from the Esaander reports, he might not even need to explain that much of the legal work at all. How thrilling, to meet a species understanding of bureaucratic decorum.

The quiet contemplation was interrupted by the pinging of an attendants comms. Kaalijorn motioned for the tall, graceful Savori pair to allow his guests in as they took their position for greeting.

They had studied the materials on humans for the last weeks before arrival, but feeling them in person was, indeed, a completely different matter. They far surpassed the presence of the Lieutenant commander escorting them, distinct and ever shifting, the councilor tried to compose themself before the doors opened but being in the same room only caused further stumbling.

Sir Tar Nako, the arvas Lieutenant acted as announcer, but dressed as though he were receiving the councillor himself. Kaalijorn‚Äôs fins twitched as the young soldier presnted a salute.

Fridged air was his signature, the favoured calling of tactious Princes, ruthlessness behind a professional mask.

‚ÄúYour eminence!‚Äù Sir Tar Nako bowed, ‚ÄúMay I present; Namegiver Jasmine Anne Howe and her entourage,‚Äù Nako quickly and expertly side stepped to reveal the smaller aliens behind his flourishing cape ‚ÄúSir‚Äôs Sargent Beau Mathews, Sugawara Itsuki, Captain Rynard Derjan, Captain Spades and Doctor Uru‚ÄôNav Xant,‚Äù

The pleasant aura of a solar lamp warmed his blue skin, and although they heard it many times, the humans voice carried an air of regality they did not posess over the audfiles. She bowed respectfully.

‚ÄúCouncillor Kaalijorn,‚Äù her entourage followed after her, bowing in turn, ‚Äúthank you for hosting us,‚Äù

Kaalijorn slowly returned the bow, regaining his composure upon becoming upright.

Their impressions of the humans already shifting, they had expected inexperienced yet eager individuals, not the coordinated and poised collection before them now.

They had integrated considerably in the short months since ‚Äòarriving‚Äô.

‚ÄúNamegiver Jasmine, and Entourage,‚Äù Kaalijorn greeted, turning to offer them a seat, ‚ÄúWelcome to The Galactic Councills 138 sector Military Branch, please, take which ever arrangement suits your standard,‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you councillor,‚Äù Jasmine acknowledged, ‚Äúbut before we begin the formal proceedings,‚Äù she gave a mere glance to the smaller of her kind, ‚Äúit is customary for human delegations to bring a gift, as a token of respect and a hope that we can foster a friendship in the times to come,‚Äù

Kaalijorn clicked his toothplate unexpectedly, as the smaller human, dressed in a scientist coat offered him a glimmering wooden box. An attendant was quick to rush forward and take it from the human's hands, but stalled once the box was in his possession, the Kitarian was staring at the human with wide golden eyes, then, shaking, as if overcome from simply being too close. The male humans freq was chilling, crisp, but filled with a subtle sense of‚Ä¶ despair. Kaalijorn, quickly, accepted the box from his attendant, allowing the poor creature to return to their place behind him.

The box was heavy in his hands, polished and lacquered to show off the intense cellular structure of the woods grain. Beautiful.

‚ÄúA most generous offering Namegiver, the council appreciates the forethought,‚Äù

The human accepted their reply but turned a sympathetic eye to the poor attendant, before finding a seat for herself.

Kaalijorn‚Äôs webbed fingers curled around the box, from the females warm sunlamp to the males chill of an airlock, they‚Äôd have to watch how quickly their Frequencies interacted with their own, perfectly balanced personality.

Curiously, the councillor sat down at the table, studying at a glance his negotiators to be, they arranged themselves in the exact order they had walked in, they had been given extensive equtitte training and followed it, which was impressive for such a short amount of time.

Kaalijorn counted an alarming amount of pleats in the armoured human's cape, his face completely covered so he couldn't see the difference in phenotype, but the body shape was obvious. The user-level species, who had been given a captains designation sat patiently and obediently at his feet, the number of pleats in his cape, however, should certainly not have been the case, causing the councillor to frown.

The smaller, colder feeling human chose to focus his piercing eyes at his attendant's feet, hand covering his face so only his eyes were visible, glancing as subtly as the councillors own around the room. The white coat suggested he was of scientist‚Äôs build, but his head was the same size as his maidens.

The Sulin Knight stood up against the back wall, knowing his presence was not needed, except for the human's request, but curiously, the Zenthi doctor, sat at the table with the humans‚Ä¶

Nako stood at the door, while he was the escort he was not included in the discussion, the arvas was probably wary of his standing and behaving for good measure-

‚ÄúCouncillor?‚Äù Namegiver Jasmine spoke, snapping him from his reconnaissance, ‚Äúare you going to open the gift?‚Äù

Kaalijorn turned to look at the box.

‚ÄúThe box is not the gift?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is, but, there is a token inside,‚Äù she smiled, a bright glow of anticipation.

Kaalijorn studied the object and tugged at the thin blue fabric, the delicate wisp of ribbon fell aside allowing the contents inside to be revealed.

A strange trinket indeed.

A clear, glass bottle, the length of his arm and double the thickness, lay atop gold stands, yet inside there sat a fully realised replica vessel of ancient design. Kaalijorn sat there stunned, the longer they looked at the thing the more detail they noticed, an exhausting feat of engineering.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù they began, but the words and polite manner did not want to co-operate. Sensing the councillor's discomfort, the zenthi doctor spoke up.

‚ÄúIt is purely decorative, your eminence,‚Äù the swell of a river followed his words, ‚Äúhumans prefer to be surrounded by aesthetically pleasing things,‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's symbolic too,‚Äù the Namegiver added, ‚Äúthe galleons sailed the unknown oceans in search of a safe harbour, just as we,(humanity) are searching for our own,‚Äù

Kaalijorn gulped, hearing the ‚Äòsecondary‚Äô layer of human voice poking through the translator‚Äôs filter. The thought and care put into the gift and their meeting alone was unprecedented, so often when speaking with a new peoples the council would have to talk down, simply and while the situation was delicate and unprecedented, he did not need to speak down to the species infront of him. Perhaps, this would be a new dynasty defining moment in more ways than one.

‚ÄúThe council offers sanctuary to all those who seek it,‚Äù the councillor gestured to their attendants, the lights were lowered, the aud-recording prepared, ‚ÄúNamegiver Jasmine, shall we begin the proceedings?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes councillor, we are ready,‚Äù

Councilor Kaalijorn: It is 1030 [hours] on the 142nd [day] the second quarter of [year] 306, Rejuvenation Dynasty. I Councillor Kaalijorn will preside over the formal first contact between the galactic council and the new species, Humanity and Dogs, please state your names and titles as a matter of record.

Namegiver Jasmine: Namegiver Jasmine Anne Howe, 

Itsuki: Sugawara Itsuki

Sargent Beau: Sargent Beau Mathews, 

Captain Spades: Captain Spades, Friend of Namegivers

[Councilors notes: The Holomap of the entire Galactic council territory was displayed for the humans, they reacted rather nonchalantly, probably used to the holoprojectors during their stay amongst Galactic Council Military.]

Councilor Kaalijorn: the galactic council envelops 53 planets, 142 stations and serves the needs of 40 billion citizens. 12 species with over 60 variants we are a harmonious civilisation aiming for excellence and rebuilding to the height of the Prosperous dynasty. As a joining member, you will be promised your own homeworld for internal affairs and access to the entire galactic Civ-net, logistics network and the protection of the Council Rangers. As a creator level intelligence, you will receive a seat at the council and have a nominated candidate for councillor. Contribution accreditation will be evaluated and given a score to participate within the economy and live your lives in perpetual comfort. I am here to guide you through the entire process, and I am sure you have many questions.

[Councilor Kaalijorn rises from their stool and approached the hologram.]

Councilor Kaalijorn: Namegiver, would you care to add your homeworld to our map?‚Äù

Namegiver Jasmine: [Sad/Embarressed] I‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ Humanity is not yet a star-faring species, I couldn't tell you where Earth would even be‚Ä¶

[Councilors notes: One of Humanity‚Äôs unique traits amongst Creator-Level intelligences is the ability to communicate complex emotions even after going through the translator filter. Such a strong sense of self is important for Commander units.]

Itsuki: I can.

Sargent Beau: [Shocked] What?!

Namegiver Jasmine: [Surprised] What??
 
Itsuki: [happy/confident/annoyed] I know where Earth is on the galaxy map.

Sargent Beau: [confused] What? How? Why?

Itsuki: [Shrugs] you know, ‚Äòjust in case‚Äô.

[Itsuki stares at the map, raising his hands to the holograph]

Itsuki: councilor, can you zoom out? 

[councilors notes: this was unexpected, with the exception of the Sulin, no species since joining the Council has been able to point out their home planet, even the Arvas though space fairing, did not have the technology to map star systems beyond unaugmented vision.]

[holomap zoomed out to show the entire branch of the galaxy]

Itsuki: No like, zoom all the way out, I need to see the whole of the [milky way]

[councilors notes: The smaller human took a few minutes of deliberation, focusing on the outer stars of the galaxy. Eventually pointing to a cluster on the opposite galaxy arm, uncharted even from before the Painful Dynasty Record Purge.]


Itsuki: [confidently] There, roughly, give or take a few thousand light-years,‚Äù

Sargent Beau: [Excited/Jubelant] And you‚Äôre sure? You‚Äôre absolutely sure?!

Itsuki: [Confident] 90% sure, I mean, [hesitant] the pictures taken from the opposite end of the galaxy but‚Ä¶ yeah.

Councilor Kaalijorn: If you‚Äôre sure it is in that direction, it should not take more than, 15 [years] to make the necessary journey.

 Itsuki : [shocked] 15 years? That‚Äôs all?... 

Namegiver Jasmine: [Relief/Excitment] It‚Äôs so close‚Ä¶I thought‚Ä¶ I thought we‚Äôd never get back home‚Ä¶

Itsuki : [confused/incredious] Why would you think that? I thought your first instinct would be to find your way back?

Namegiver Jasmine: [Anger/Dissapointment] The Rajava harvest planets and people, if Earth had survived, or [sadness] red buttoned the invasion, everyone and everything I knew would have been gone anyway‚Ä¶ [relief] Thought I was hundreds of millions of lightyears away but now‚Ä¶

[councilors notes: I have never felt such a strong and quick reaction, so much freq blasting in such intensity so quickly. My assistants nearly all succumbed to VFS. particularly Namegiver Jasmine and Sargent Beau]

Namegiver Jasmine: [Determination/Confidence] Councillor, we are humbled by the council's most generous of offerings, but I‚Äôm afraid we will not be acknowledging citizenship contracts today.

Councilor Kaalijorn: [shocked] y-you won't? I was under the impression you, that is to say, Namegiver Jasmine, were ready to commence proceedings, at least that is what your Audfile Transcripts indicated.

Jasmine: [polite/diplomatic/commanding] Yes, I was, but circumstances have changed, this new information has come to light and it would be morally and legally irresponsible of me to proceed without consulting my companions and confirming additional concerns about the Council and its ongoings. With our home planet so close it would not be right for us to make decisions encompassing Humanity and the remaining species of Earth. 

Councilor Kaalijorn: [caught off guard] O-of course; is there anything you have particular concerns about? Surely you would be the most qualified to make these decisions having been living amongst the people of the council for the longest-

Namegiver Jasmine: [polite/diplomatic/commanding] No. Humanity is no stranger to the complexity and morality of the law. ‚ÄòDo not sign anything you don‚Äôt understand‚Äô is the first lesson humans learn about law. I want to thank you councilor for your patience in this whole fiasco but unfortunately, while your citizen and military personnel have been most generous hosts, the short few months during mine and my companions stay have highlighted several conflicts of interests between our two parties. Our cultures are very different and while we eager to broker a peace between us, there may be some aspects that neither us will be able to reconcile without further discussion. While I have done my best to keep this diplomatic, neither I nor my companions are qualified to broker this new peace between our peoples. 

Councilor Kaalijorn: Conflicts of interests? Namegiver, the Council has offered you everything you have requested and more. Acknowledging the contracts is more a formality and once they are agreed to and you are welcomed into the community, there is nothing we couldn‚Äôt provide. In terms of assets ships, stations, planets‚Ä¶ in terms of immaterial, we can offer physical rejuvenation, planetary tours, and judiciary powers within government. I fail to see what would be such a large conflict of interest that your people would not forgive you for speaking without them.

Itsuki: Genetic engineering is taboo.

Councilor: oh. Yes, I remember you saying it was a fledgling science-

Itsuki: [Concern/Contempt] not a fledgling science, a forbidden one. We have mapped the genome and identified numerous genetic diseases, cured a few even, but to tamper directly with human DNA directly? Then that would lead us down the dark road that you are currently on, and are desperately seeking to get away from. 

[Councilors notes: Namegiver‚Äôs subordinates speak out of turn, humans while they do have a designated leader it seems to be more of a consensus then a direct line of authority. They all act independently of one another even when possessing a translator.]

Councilor: but the opportunities provided to you should your genetic material be made available to the council are exponential.  New materials in the hands of our geneticists can reverse the many limitations we currently suffer in the reproduction and healing process.
The preliminary studies of your cohesive structures could save the qzetillian race, like myself, from genetic decay, humanity would be giving trillions of new lives a brighter future.  

Beau: [anger/disgust/insulted] ***No***.

[councilors notes: The military model human barely speaks but his commands are very confronting. The other humans and the User companion, while startled by his contribution recover quickly from the command.]

Jasmine: [polite/firm/diplomatic] councilor, it makes me happy to hear you are open for discussion, but we cannot make any promises at this time. We need to recess, discuss and reconvene. 

Councilor: New technology can seem scary and confronting to those who do not understand it but I truly believe you are overstating the dangers-

Jasmine: [incredulous/defensive] Counilor, I‚Äôm not sure you understand it. My companions experienced first-hand what the technology looks like and I wouldn‚Äôt describe it as a bright future.

Itsuki: [anger/disgust] We were imprisoned at a corporate station, they were using our DNA to make homunculi, trying to splice human DNA with alien. Even with all your experience and tech it didn't work, they had thousands of failed experiments kept in refrigeration!

Beau: [Repulsed/disgusted] ***and they were still alive and suffering‚Ä¶***

Councilor: [disbelief] I‚Ä¶ was not informed Kyu-Kage corporation was conducting unauthorised R&D research on unsanctioned genetic material. There will be a formal investigation into their conduct within the market. But if you truly do not want to negotiate then I‚Äôm not sure how much further we can extend our hospitality.

[Councilors notes: humans, it seems, having no prior experience with Freq are very sensitive to tone shifts and vocabulary. The wrong wording can set off threats the speaker had no intention of implying.]

Namegiver Jasmine: [concerned/nervous] We‚Äôre not finished with negotiations Councilor, we just need time to discuss- 

Sargent Beau: ***[loathing/anger] ‚Ä¶***

Itsuki: [appalled/confrontionational] So you‚Äôd make us destitute within council space for retaining our genetic autonomy?!

Councilor: Not destitute no, every citizen within the sphere is kept to a minimum standard of living, food, shelter, hygienic facilities health care, all provided for, but the amount of deficit you have accumulated under the good Lieutenant‚Äôs account would be enough to destroy all of his equity‚Ä¶and more. If you refuse to acknowledge the citizenship contracts then you can no longer exist at the standard of accommodation you are at now.

Sargent Beau: ***[Loathing/Replused/fury] ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶***

Jasmine: [Pleading/insulted/diplomatic]Councilor, my companions and I want to help, we do, but we can't hand over our genetic rights without proper consultation, and threatening us with our benefactor‚Äôs wellbeing is not the way to broker trust between us.

Councilor: it was by no means supposed to be a threat Namegiver, i am simply stating the facts. Without citizenship you and your user-level intelligence species are relegated to being the Lieutenant‚Äôs assets. your companions were responsible for an estimated 35% destruction of the entire progenitor companies output. And since Kyu-Kage are the primary producer of citizen and military assets for the sector that accounts for nearly 13 thousand [years] worth of lost productivity and of lost lives. That is a considerable amount of credit and even the esteemed lieutenant does not have that much in accreditation. You would all be downgraded to the minimal living conditions until you join as citizens and get accredited yourselves.

Itsuki: [anger/incredious] Councilor, humans would absolutely consider that a threat.

Councilor: I am simply stating facts and trying to warn you of the consequences of your actions Namegiver. I am bound by the law and am presenting them to you as such.

Jasmine: [Blunt/Unimpressed] Fine. Is there any way we can control who has access and for what reasons? Are we allowed to revisit the contract and renegotiate after a certain amount of time is up? Can we control absolutely all copyright?

Councilor: It is under council law that as a Creator Species, you are entitled to designate what aspects of your DNA might be put into circulation. If you desire to limit your access we would be willing to accommodate, but absolutely all copyright would be a hard clause to enact if you wish to produce more citizens-

Itsuki: [distraught/angry] Absolutely not! No human clones of any kind! 

Jasmine: [appalled/Dissapointed] Never. Full Human Cloning goes against every moral, ethical and philosphic virtue we stand for. Designer genes invites prejudices and destroys stability, we need diversity in our lives, we need time to mature and grow to become people. Every human‚Äôs genetic imprint is unique, special, our DNA can't survive being paired with related strains, identical pairings would only cause debilitating diseases. I don‚Äôt think our brains can even comprehend a sea of identical faces without breaking down. You cant manufacture humans‚Ä¶ [Pleading] Councilor, I cannot stress how much of a violation cloning is to us‚Ä¶

Councilor: Namegiver I am forced to profusely dissagree with your statements. Cloning is what saved the Galactic council from absolute extinction, we‚Äôve revived species from the dead and erraticated more diseases then your planet has probably produced. The fact you are sighting incompatible related strains confirms you are not well versed with the technology or its capabilities. With only a single human sequence we would be able to repair the damage done to the 11 original council species, retaining longevity and minimizing abnormalities with current build models. We could rectify any abnormalities within the sequence and produce citizen and military models-

Beau:[Righetous/Furious] ***How many times do we have to tell you no?***

Councilor: [startled/scared/shocked] ?!

Beau:[Righteous/Furious] ***All men(Humanity) are created equal, there will be no lesser or superior beings, there will be no more monsters made from us-skkwjebfkashgq .: . / ‚Äô ; k j s#%7q899-***


***Transcripts error- Disconnected.***

The room was enveloped by a burning hatred reserved for Knight commanders and living bombs. Every Freq feeling being was forced backwards, except for the councilor, pinned in place by a righteous fury.   
Beau stood from his seat, Spades growling at his heel as the soldier strode across the room and grabbed the councilor by the collar of his robes. Even with the helmet on Kaalijorn could feel his eyes seering holes into his own.

‚ÄúCouncilor, We do not trust you and we do not fear you, we will not go quietly,‚Äù

The growl was deep and guttural, the statement cutting and a true threat.

Itsuki ran over and tried to pull Beau off the councilor, but he had no hope of matching the man's size or strength.

‚ÄúPut them down!‚Äù Itsuki exclaimed, but Beau grabbed Itsuki's wrist, twisting it around and forcing the kid to heel. 

‚ÄúBeau don‚Äôt kill them!‚Äù Jasmine cried out in fear and alarm, watching as the negotiations fell apart before her. ‚ÄúLet them go!‚Äù
 
Rynards hulking presence seemed frozen, caught between inaction of Jasmine's fear and the realisation he could not intervene without hurting Beau or the councilor, his claws too big to grab either safely. Nako jumped from the door after hearing the plea, sword launching out to within centimetres of Beau's back, crackling with electricity.

‚ÄúUnhand the Councilor!‚Äù Nako commanded, but the wall of ice simply passed over the human.

‚ÄúNot until they tell me why they‚Äôre so desperate for our subjugation!‚Äù Beau shouted back with terrifying volume, ‚ÄúThis is first official contact and this so-called representative of the galactic council is forcing us to sign over the fate of the human race without even allowing us a recess?! They don‚Äôt want harmony they want submission, so desperate they're willing to threaten us to comply, why? The devil is in the details and you aren't giving them to us‚Ä¶‚Äù

Beau‚Äôs Freq seared like plasma, the wave of fury, fear, and disgust was painful, even the lieutenant‚Äôs grip on his blade wavered as the human continued to broadcast his extreme discontent. 

Kaalijorn shook, terrified in the human's grip.

‚ÄúI am just trying to guide you through the contracts-‚Äù they answered meekly.
Beau lifted the councilor from the ground easily, Kaalijorn held onto his robes for dear life.

‚ÄúIf you harm me the lieutenant will kill you where you stand!‚Äù they attempted to regain control, but the human only replied with a bone-chilling.

‚ÄúThere are fates worse than death,‚Äù

Kaalijorn went pale, Nako hesitated, his sword dropping height as the air in the room went deathly still. Beau spoke again.

‚ÄúWhy are you so desperate for us to sign the contract? Answer me.‚Äù

Kaalijorns eyes darted to Nako desperately.

‚ÄúDon't look at him, answer me!‚Äù Beau demanded and Kaalijorn was forced to comply.

‚ÄúWe need your DNA,‚Äù he said quietly, ‚Äúwe can't keep producing inferior citizens models at this rate, if we slow production we will fail to comply with demands and be outnumbered by the billions,‚Äù

‚ÄúBy the Rajava?‚Äù Jasmine asked, ‚Äúthe pirates?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, the Arvas Imperium.‚Äù The councilor answered bitterly, ‚ÄúTheir reparations and demands from the Painful dynasty have to be satisfied, we were forced to create citizen models to fulfill them but our current output isn‚Äôt enough‚Ä¶‚Äù Kaalijorn could not break the human's gaze no matter how hard he tried, ‚Äú... even the genome of one of you could balance the universe in our favour.‚Äù

Beau carefully placed the councilor down and released Itsuki from his grip.

The fires smouldered to embers of disdain and contempt. 

‚ÄúThank you for your honesty,‚Äù he replied cruelly, ‚Äúwe will be deliberating over these details at our accommodation, we will inform you of our answer.‚Äù as Beau turned he side-stepped Nako‚Äôs sword, staring down the lieutenant.

Nako was forced to acknowledge his presence did nothing to the human, Beau had been in war longer than nako had been alive. There was nothing he could do to match such a ferocity‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúJasi! Itsuki! We‚Äôre leaving, we do not negotiate with eugenicists.‚Äù Beau ordered, and without saying a single word, Rynard stepped aside for him.

The two younger humans stood in shock, Spades barking at the pair of them when they refused to move. Xant‚Äôs hand suddenly grabbed Jasmines and he pulled her along.

‚ÄúJasmine, you follow Beau, I will speak with the councillor,‚Äù

‚ÄúBut Xant!-‚Äù She exclaimed, panic beginning to set in. 

‚ÄúI can't calm Beau‚Äôs anger but you can,‚Äù he reminded her, a voice of reason in the cacophony ‚ÄúItsuki, Captain, help Jasmine, I will handle the councillor, ‚Äù

Itsuki and Jasmine looked at Xant dubiously but they had no choice but to run after Beau, he was a danger to everyone on base. The captain scooped the pair of them up and gave Xant a quiet nod as the door closed behind him.

Nako was helping the councillor off the floor as Xant offered a helping hand.  

The councillor was shaken, a fury and self-disappointment flickered behind his eyes.

Xant waited patiently for the councillor to address him, the ruined politician could not stand on his own two feet, requiring the doctor to bring them water and medications. The councilor's attendants were in even worse shape, barely beyond response, collapsed in a heap and shivered from overexposed nervous systems. 

Thankfully, Xant was able to administer some small chemical relief, but the incident had left them all worse for wear.

 Kaalijorn sat on the stool and looked up at Nako and Xant miserably.

‚ÄúI propose you would call that a catastrophe‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúCouncillor, if things did not go terribly wrong where humans are concerned, I would consider it a first,‚Äù Xant conceded. The councilor blinked surprised, Xant was unharmed by the display of freq and was trying to comfort him, despite being completely sworn to the humans, ‚Äúwe knew this meeting would be difficult and while Sir Beau‚Äôs reaction was, confronting, that does not mean negotiations have been disconnected entirely.‚Äù

The councillor stared back at the citizen model before him, who had been quiet this entire time, watching and observing as he was supposed to do, now reasoning with him as a bureaucrat on his level.

‚ÄúCouncillor, when Beau and Itsuki were contained under Kyu-Kage they were under the impression they were prisoners of war and I suspect the company were under the impression they were Rajavan constructs. Humans do not possess frequency organs but do possess an extreme amount of nerve endings, what you and I would consider enough force to injure results in unimaginable pain for them, what they consider an appropriate retaliation would seem extreme to us.‚Äù

The doctor looked between the lieutenant and the councilor,

‚ÄúIt was a collection of terrible misunderstandings on both sides, but is it not the desire to learn from those mistakes and forge relationships that the council was founded upon? To be a society all can live in safety and harmoniously? Free from pain and fear?‚Äù

Xant bowed deeply to the councilor.

‚ÄúHumans also wish for this peace, Namegiver Jasmine wishes for a compromise between our peoples, give them time, understanding, they deserve that much.‚Äù

The councilor nodded his head gently.

‚Äúwell-spoken, doctor,‚Äù Kaalijorn admitted, ‚Äúthe humans have requested time, I will give them time.‚Äù Kaalijorn closed his eyes and allowed his shoulders to sink, ‚ÄúLieutenant escort the doctor back to be with the Namegiver entourage, I have some thinking of my own to do,‚Äù

Nako, hesitated.

‚ÄúAre you sure councilor? We can't wait until another Ranger can relieve us?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes I am sure, the council needs to be informed,‚Äù Kaalijorn sighed heavily ‚Äúand I need to reconsider my position, dismissed,‚Äù

Could $SKY Play a Vital Role in the Crypto Space?,Crypto_General,1i8w201,2025-01-24 09:02:14,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crypto_General/comments/1i8w201/could_sky_play_a_vital_role_in_the_crypto_space/,Feisty-Rhubarb-6718,Daily Discussion,"While exploring the crypto markets today, I started reading about Sky Protocol, a decentralized and permissionless protocol fully governed by the Sky Ecosystem community.  
  
Yesterday, I came across their token, $SKY, which is described as an upgraded version of the MKR token. Which acts as the governance token for the protocol and even allows two-way conversions between MKR and SKY tokens.  
  
What caught my attention was it listing on some major exchanges. I even saw it trading at around $0.05+ on Bitget after getting listed yesterday. After realizing the token is designed to incentivize governance participation and align token holders‚Äô interests through rewards, I goy the thought of  trading some of it during the CandyBomb event to grab some extra rewards and join the league.  
  
I‚Äôm genuinely curious to see what it has to offer and plan to explore it further. What do you think about this token and its performance so far?"
"[Governance Poll Proposal] Establish the Donut DAO org; Decentralize, expand, and secure DONUT‚Äôs future beyond r/EthTrader",ethtrader,1i8smzx,2025-01-24 05:42:25,13,0.89,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1i8smzx/governance_poll_proposal_establish_the_donut_dao/,0xMarcAurel,Donut,"## TL;DR

This proposal is a huge step in shaping the future of the Donut ecosystem. It's about: 

1. Formally establishing Donut DAO as a decentralized, unregistered organization with the flexibility to grow beyond Reddit, allowing DONUT to continue to operate independently of any single subreddit or platform.
2. Transitioning DONUT‚Äôs structure to remove its dependency on r/EthTrader, making r/EthTrader as one arm of a broader organization.
3. Balancing the allocation of funds to create a more sustainable and equitable distribution model.
4. Clearly defining roles and responsibilities for Donut DAO contributors, while ensuring fair compensation for their efforts.
5. Optimizing leadership and governance by welcoming new contributors and reevaluating inactive roles (moderators, multisig guardians).

The objective is to create a robust foundation that supports growth, decentralization, and the sustainability of DONUT, while rewarding content creators, contributors and giving power to the community.

The focus of this organization is to give contributors opportunities to grow, connect with other interested individuals, build a professional portfolio, and receive compensation in the process. Thus, the Donut DAO would create an environment of mutual benefit and recognition for all participants.

---

## Current situation

For too long, the mod team has relied on a ""mint more DONUT whenever we run out"" approach. This may've worked 5 or 6 years ago, but it‚Äôs no longer effective considering DONUT is now a valued asset, subject to market mechanics. Also, with regulatory scrutiny increasing, it‚Äôs time we collectively reassess our current practices, formalize our policies / structure, and establish a more strategic approach to DONUT minting and allocation.

As a SocialFi token, DONUT‚Äôs primary purpose is to reward content creators and promote decentralized governance. To fulfill this mission, a dedicated team is essential. We need people responsible for maintaining operations, promoting growth, and investing on long-term sustainability.

This proposal is probably the most significant and complex initiative we have ever had as a DAO. Submitting dozens of individual proposals would be a lot more complex and would delay important progress. This is a consolidated proposal that reflects the collective insights of the mod team, and is the result of internal discussions and team calls. Our vision is to position DONUT as a project that goes beyond r/EthTrader, making sure its growth is not limited by the subreddit‚Äôs boundaries. In this structure, r/EthTrader will be a branch of a broader ecosystem, known as the Donut DAO (proposed below).

---

## Problem

We're going to be fully transparent with the community, the current structure and team reached a pivotal crossroads. Even though our project made significant progress, the current structure has shown limitations that could compromise growth, sustainability and even operations's maintenance.

Right now, there is formally no team or organization responsible for promoting DONUT. Technically it's the mod team and the community as a whole. While this flexibility worked in the early stages, it now creates uncertainty regarding the project's purpose, reach, and goals. What worked 6 years ago no longer works today, especially in the Web3 industry that changes by the day. To attract serious contributors and partnerships, establishing and formalizing a decentralized entity is important. Without this, we risk, once again, stagnation and missed opportunities to expand.

Another problem is the existing reward and funding structure. This model led to concerns about managing resources and a lack of reserves for future growth initiatives. If this issue is not addressed, this project will struggle to fund new and current contributors, attract talent, or even finance ecosystem expansion.

Yet another problem is, over time, some roles within the project (like moderators and multisig guardians) have become inactive or loosely defined. This creates inefficiencies in important decisions.

Additionally, the absence of clear and fair compensation made it very difficult to recruit and retain contributors, leaving gaps in operational capabilities. In other words: people aren't receiving enough rewards for the value and work they provide.

Finally, DONUT has huge potential as a project, but its current visibility is confined largely to this sub. This limits its audience and adoption, making it harder to grow and compete in the Web3 industry.

---

## Solution

The solution goes through different steps to evolve our project into a sustainable, decentralized organization while focusing on its future.

Here are the proposed measures:

**1 - Establishing Donut DAO**

We propose transitioning our entire project into (a new) Donut DAO, an official, (legally speaking) unregistered decentralized organization.

DONUT‚Äôs success should not be limited by one platform or subreddit. We should aim to create a structure that can operate independently of Reddit, enabling expansion into other platforms or even transitioning into a whole new token category if needed. This protects the project from external risks, like changes to Reddit‚Äôs policies or infrastructure. DONUT would continue to work and grow even without Reddit or r/EthTrader.

Under this new organization, r/EthTrader would still be a vital part of the ecosystem, but the Donut DAO would be the overarching organization, positioning itself for broader opportunities and long-term survival. Simply put, r/EthTrader would be one of the many branches of the Donut DAO.

**2 - Structuring Donut DAO**

Donut DAO would operate as a decentralized organization, but with a defined structure that promotes efficiency and collaboration. This would promote a more collaborative approach, while giving clarity on roles and responsibilities.

The proposed structure is as follows:

* Co-founders: Responsible for partnerships, overseeing operations, managing the treasury, handling administrative tasks, grants, and ensuring the organization‚Äôs overall direction.

Proposed co-founders:

Carl Larson: Original developer of the Reddit community points system (DONUT) and an early contributor to the Ethereum ecosystem.

Basoosh: Veteran DONUT contributor, developer, formerly responsible for monthly distributions and currently responsible for the Donut Dashboard.

Marc Aurel: Ecosystem growth lead, responsible for partnerships, networking, business, and operations.

* Developers: Focus on maintaining and scaling DONUT‚Äôs technical infrastructure, including websites, subreddit tools, and others.

* Content moderators: Responsible for subreddit (in this case, r/EthTrader) and Discord management, aiming to promote healthy community engagement.

* Art sector: Focus on creating art for advertising, partnerships, and campaigns.

* Community sector: Organizing events, giveaways, and supporting users directly.

**3 - Optimizing DONUT allocation**

We propose reallocating the monthly DONUT distribution to optimize fund management, support development, and, most importantly, make sure contributors are compensated fairly.

The new proposed monthly allocation is:

* Content creation (subreddit distribution) [NO CHANGES]: 850,000 DONUT

510,000 DONUT for posts.

340,000 DONUT for comments.

* Liquidity incentives: 450,000 DONUT

Uniswap (ETH/DONUT V2 on Ethereum) reduced from 400,000 to 250,000 DONUT.

Sushi (ETH/DONUT V3 on Arbitrum One) increased from 150,000 to 200,000 DONUT.

Even though Ethereum is extremely important when it comes to liquidity, our DeFi operations take place on Arbitrum One. As such, we should aim to promote liquidity on Arbitrum, also to help the DAO unlock the remaining funds from the Arbitrum Grant (7,500 ARB).

* Community contests: 25,000 DONUT.

Reduced from 50,000, as this expense is unfortunately not having the desired effect and is not as impactful given the funds provided.

* Moderation [CEASES TO EXIST] 

* Community treasury [CEASES TO EXIST]

* Donut DAO treasury: 415,000 DONUT, distributed as follows:

Developers: 30,000 DONUT/month (+ grants as needed).

Moderators: 15,000 DONUT/month.

Community (community contributors that are not moderators): 5,000 DONUT/month.

Art: Funded via grants based on project proposals.

After covering monthly expenses, there would be ~200,000 - 230,000 DONUT remaining, according to the current size of the team. These funds would be reserved for the art sector, additional grants, strategic investments, or any extra necessity. Also, there are additional operational costs such as the u/donut-bot server, among other small expenses.

Although 1,740,000 Donuts are available for distribution each month, as you can see the funds disappear almost instantly due to the treasury's expenses needed to finance operations.

**4 - Restructuring and optimizing mod sector and the multisig**

This is not easy to address, but it has to be done nonetheless. To ensure accountability, we propose the following contributor activity policy:

1 month of inactivity: Contributor is defunded.

3 months of inactivity: Contributor is removed from the organization. Rejoining is an option if the contributor becomes active again in the future.

We propose this policy to promote fairness, because funds allocated to inactive members could be redirected to active contributors or other strategic initiatives. We recommend removing inactive members due to sensitive information about the project and to maintain the integrity of our work. Active contributors are important for progress and internal decisions, and people who are inactive can disrupt ongoing efforts. Internal decisions are made democratically, and inactive members who don‚Äôt vote can unintentionally stall progress.

As for multisig guardians, members inactive for 3+ months would also be removed, to make sure the treasury is protected by individuals who are actively involved and aware of ecosystem developments. The multisig must always have a minimum of five active guardians to maintain security and decentralization.  In the future, potential guardians may be added, provided that they gained the trust of the organization and the community as a whole.

**5 - Immediate goals if this proposal passes**

If this proposal is approved, the following topics would be addressed immediately:

* Build an official Donut DAO website, a dedicated platform to communicate the Donut DAO‚Äôs mission, goals, and updates. It would be separate from the Donut Dashboard.
* Create an official X account to promote DONUT and engage in marketing campaigns.
* Assign roles and responsibilities to make sure all teams are ready and equipped to contribute effectively.
* Host monthly meetings to regularly assess progress and adjust strategies. *A future idea is to allow DONUT whales to attend meetings.*
* Post monthly treasury flow reports. This includes expenses and inflows, to promote transparency and trust.

---

## Advantages

* Establishes a professional and organized structure, incrasing credibility and trust among users and potential partners.
* Enables strategic fund management, protecting the sustainability and efficiency of operations.
* Creates a self sustaining economy with DONUT as its foundation.
* Promotes fair compensation for contributors, based on their skills, efforts, and activity levels.
* Further increases decentralization by involving more contributors from different locations, promoting a more global perspective.
* Simplifies internal conflict resolution, particularly in cases of inactivity or disagreement, with clear policies in place.
* Distributes responsibilities and tasks efficiently, reducing the burden on individual contributors. Contributors can focus on their specific roles, for example devs will no longer need to moderate content and can focus on building instead.
* Ensures long term operations by reducing dependency on any single individual within the organization.
* Supports expansion beyond Reddit, making Reddit a vital branch of the broader Donut ecosystem, rather than it's pillar.
* Builds a foundation for growth, including potential integration into other social platforms or use cases.
* Promotes collaboration and transparency through a clearly defined structure and regular reporting.

## Disadvantages

* The proposed structure introduces high complexity, which could lead to overly bureaucratic processes.
* Contributors would have personal responsibility for legal and tax-related matters, which may create challenges depending on their location.
* Requires a lot of effort and coordination to establish the organization, onboard new contributors, and maintain communication between sectors.

---

## Conclusion

This proposal would create a path for DONUT to evolve into a resilient, decentralized organization capable of thriving in any scenario. If we transition to the proposed Donut DAO, we will make sure that DONUT is no longer tied to a single platform, allowing it to expand, adapt, and grow in new directions. It also creates a framework for long term sustainability through structured roles, decentralized decisions, and transparent operations.

There's one important thing to note. Without this proposal, there‚Äôs a huge risk that current challenges lead to reduced activity or disruptions to basic functions like distributions and the maintenance of donut-bot, and even abandonment. This means people leaving the project. We should practically acknowledge the risks we're facing right now and understand the consequences if proactive measures aren‚Äôt taken.

Just like everything, there are challenges involved. However, the benefits really outweigh the risks. This initiative would secure DONUT‚Äôs future.

If the community supports this proposal, we can build a robust, scalable ecosystem where DONUT continues to thrive regardless of individual or platform changes. Feel free to provide feedback or suggestions to change or add to this proposal.

"January 23, 2025",HeatherCoxRichardson,1i8pnmg,2025-01-24 01:56:26,52,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeatherCoxRichardson/comments/1i8pnmg/january_23_2025/,Gl3g,,"Last night, in an interview with host Sean Hannity on the Fox News Channel, President Donald Trump tried to explain away his blanket pardons for the January 6 rioters, calling the instances of violence against police officers ‚Äúvery minor incidents.‚Äù

In fact, as Brett Samuels of¬†*The Hill*¬†reported, about 600 of the rioters were accused of assaulting, resisting, or impeding police officers, and ten were convicted of sedition.

Ryan J. Reilly of NBC News explained that rioters wounded more than 140 officers with ‚Äúfirearms, stun guns, flagpoles, fire extinguishers, bike racks, batons, a metal whip, office furniture, pepper spray, bear spray, a tomahawk ax, a hatchet, a hockey stick, knuckle gloves, a baseball bat, a massive ‚ÄòTrump‚Äô billboard, ‚ÄòTrump‚Äô flags, a pitchfork, pieces of lumber, crutches and even an explosive device.‚Äù

Three federal judges have weighed in on the pardons after Trump‚Äôs appointees in the Department of Justice ordered them to dismiss pending cases against current January 6 defendants, an order that, as David Kurtz of¬†*Talking Points Memo*¬†noted, ‚Äúflies in the face of decades of DOJ independence.‚Äù

U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly summed up the judges‚Äô outrage when she wrote: ‚ÄúDismissal of charges, pardons after convictions, and commutations of sentences will not change the truth of what happened on January 6, 2021. What occurred that day is preserved for the future through thousands of contemporaneous videos, transcripts of trials, jury verdicts, and judicial opinions analyzing and recounting the evidence through a neutral lens. Those records are immutable and represent the truth, no matter how the events of January 6 are described by those charged or their allies.‚Äù

The leaders of two key paramilitary gangs who participated in the January 6 violence, Enrique Tarrio of the Proud Boys and Stewart Rhodes of the Oath Keepers, are not helping Trump to put the pardons behind him. Now out of prison rather than serving his 22-year sentence, Tarrio called in to conspiracy-theorist Alex Jones‚Äôs¬†*Infowars*within hours of his release to claim that he still commands the gang and that he plans retribution for those who put him behind bars. Tess Owen of¬†*WIRED*¬†reported that the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, which monitors online activity, saw a surge among Proud Boys‚Äô channels after the pardons, as members discussed ways to advance Trump‚Äôs agenda.

Rhodes, who was sentenced to 18 years in prison, also wants revenge. On Wednesday, he was at the U.S. Capitol, where Michael Kunzelman and Lisa Mascaro of the Associated Press reported he met with at least one lawmaker and chatted with others.

*Politico*‚Äôs Charlie Mahtesian reported tonight that those January 6 rioters Trump pardoned are already talking about running for office. Mahtesian notes that in primaries where candidates need to prove they are truly MAGA, those who served time in prison for Trump will have sterling credentials.

Kunzelman and Mascaro also noted that, in an apparent attempt to divert attention from the pardons back to Trump‚Äôs contention that the bipartisan January 6 committee had been biased against him, on the same day that Rhodes was at the Capitol, House speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) revived a special committee to retrace the steps of the House committee that investigated the riot.

But that didn‚Äôt go terribly well, as Jacqueline Alemany of the¬†*Washington Post*¬†today reported an exclusive story revealing that last June an aide to Johnson advised the committee not to subpoena White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson out of concern that if it did, the sexually explicit texts Republican lawmakers had sent her might come to light. According to Alemany, ‚Äúmultiple colleagues had raised concerns with the speaker‚Äôs office about the potential for public disclosure of ‚Äòsexual texts from members who were trying to engage in sexual favors‚Äô with Hutchinson.‚Äù Instead, the committee accused former representative Liz Cheney (R-WY) of talking to Hutchinson without Hutchinson‚Äôs lawyer present. Cheney called the report ‚Äúdefamatory‚Äù and a ‚Äúmalicious and cowardly assault on the truth.‚Äù

Apparently undaunted, Trump today issued pardons for nearly two dozen antiabortion activists convicted of violating the 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, or FACE Act, which the civil rights division of the Department of Justice explains ‚Äúprohibits threats of force, obstruction and property damage intended to interfere with reproductive health care services.‚Äù Trump, who is due to speak tomorrow by video with the annual antiabortion March for Life, said it was a ‚Äúgreat honor‚Äù to pardon the protesters.

Still, Alice Miranda Ollstein of¬†*Politico*¬†reported that one antiabortion activist, who wanted to remain anonymous because she fears retaliation from the administration, wondered why Trump hadn‚Äôt pardoned the antiabortion activists on Monday, as he did the January 6 rioters. ‚ÄúThese pardons are fully in line with Trump‚Äôs agenda to oppose the weaponization of the government,‚Äù she told Ollstein. ‚ÄúSo why he couldn‚Äôt have pardoned them along with the 1,500 on Day 1 is beyond me.‚Äù

It seems that for Trump and his extremist supporters, the federal government‚Äîwhich reflects the will of the majority‚Äîhas been ‚Äúweaponized‚Äù against a political minority that seeks to control the country.

To gain that control, Trump has assured his followers that the country is literally under attack and that the United States, which has the strongest military and the strongest economy in the world, is losing. On Monday, Trump‚Äîwho persuaded congressional Republicans to kill a strong bipartisan measure to tighten the border and fund immigration courts so asylum-seekers could have quick hearings‚Äîdeclared that a national emergency exists at the southern border of the United States, although border crossings are lower now than they were at the end of his first administration. The order asked the heads of the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security to consider whether it was necessary to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act, which allows the president to deploy the military to suppress domestic insurrection.

Yesterday, acting secretary of defense Robert Salesses told reporters that the Department of Defense has ordered 1,500 active-duty military personnel along with air support and intelligence assets to the southern border of the United States, joining 2,500 active-duty military personnel already there, and that the military will provide flights for deportations led by the Department of Homeland Security. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Trump is directing ‚Äúthe Department of Defense to make homeland security a core mission of the agency.‚Äù

Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart of Reuters report that there have been informal discussions in the department about sending as many as 10,000 troops to the border, a discussion that raises the question of whether Mexico would feel obliged to respond in kind. And, according to Meg Kelly, Alex Horton, and Missy Ryan of the¬†*Washington Post*, the Trump administration is trying to get rid of an office in the Pentagon that works to protect civilians in battlefield operations. The Civilian Protection Center of Excellence is housed within the Department of the Army and works to help the military limit unintended civilian deaths.

And yet the idea of using a strong military to defend America apparently does not extend to its leadership. Tara Copp of the Associated Press reported that Trump‚Äôs nominee for defense secretary, Fox News Channel weekend host Pete Hegseth, who has a history of financial mismanagement, alcohol abuse, and allegations of sexual assault, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he paid a woman $50,000 as part of a confidentiality agreement to maintain her silence after she accused him of sexual assault.

Today, both Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) said they could not support Hegseth‚Äôs nomination. They were the only two Republicans who refused to vote in favor of his nomination advancing to the full Senate today.

But they are not the only ones standing against Trump‚Äôs attempt to overturn traditional American values.

Today, U.S. District Judge John Coughenour issued a temporary restraining order to block Trump‚Äôs executive order that sought to end the birthright citizenship established in 1868 by the Fourteenth Amendment. Twenty-two states and two cities, as well as other parties, have sued over the executive order. Coughenour was responding to a suit brought by Arizona, Illinois, Oregon, and Washington.

Coughenour, who was appointed to the bench by Republican president Ronald Reagan in 1981, told Trump‚Äôs Department of Justice attorneys, ‚ÄúI have been on the bench for over four decades. I can't remember another case where the question presented is as clear as it is here. This is a blatantly unconstitutional order."" When the lawyers told him they maintained the order was constitutional, Coughenour was aghast. ""I have difficulty understanding how a member of the bar can state unequivocally that this is a constitutional order. It boggles my mind. Where were the lawyers when this decision was being made?""

Coughenour blocked the order until February 6, when he will hold a hearing to consider a preliminary injunction.

And after Trump announced he would withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), billionaire former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg yesterday announced that his philanthropic foundation will cover the financial contribution the U.S. will not. According to Zack Budryk of¬†*The Hill*, it will also provide the agreement‚Äôs reporting requirements for emissions associated with climate change.

‚Äú\[P\]hilanthropy‚Äôs role in driving local, state, and private sector action is more crucial than ever‚Äîand we‚Äôre committed to leading the way,‚Äù Bloomberg said.

Finally, tonight, firefighters have begun to control the fires in Southern California. As of this evening, the Hughes fire is 36% contained, the Laguna fire is no longer expanding, the Palisades fire is 75% contained, and the Eaton fire is 95% contained. New fires have broken out, but rain is forecast for the weekend.

Kendu Community Updates - Recent Events and CTO Facts,KenduInu_Ecosystem,1i8p2em,2025-01-24 01:15:41,180,0.99,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1i8p2em/kendu_community_updates_recent_events_and_cto/,boathouse_floats,NEWS,"https://preview.redd.it/5f9fijpvvvee1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=5aa0a5558124ce6c9a7c0aa6c76b425b2ffe6589

**Kendu Inu: Community Takeover (CTO) Announcement**

Kendu Inu has entered a groundbreaking new chapter with the successful completion of a full Community Takeover (CTO). This marks a transformative moment for the project as we transition from a developer-led model to a fully transparent, community-driven initiative. Kendu Inu is now a project powered by its holders, fostering collaboration, trust, and growth like never before. This evolution highlights the strength of our community and our shared vision.



**What Just Happened?** Our previous developer, Miazaki, has been revealed to have engaged in actions not aligned with the values of Kendu Inu. After a period of deception and mismanagement, the community united to reclaim the project. In response, a CTO was initiated to ensure that Kendu Inu remains in the hands of those who believe in its vision. This collective action showcases the resilience and determination of our community members.

¬†

**Key developments:**

**Miazaki‚Äôs Departure:** The developer‚Äôs influence has been fully removed and assets have been fully recovered, ensuring that Kendu Inu‚Äôs future is free from past mismanagement.

**Community Leadership:** Josh has been unanimously embraced as the new community leader through a transparent and inclusive discussion process, reflecting the will of the community.

**Asset Recovery:** Miazaki‚Äôs token supply has been successfully transferred to the Kendu Treasury wallet controlled by trusted community members, guaranteeing financial security and oversight. Top priority is a multi-sig wallet for the current and future funds.

**Platform Reclamation:** Kendu Inu‚Äôs Telegram, X, and other communication platforms will soon be controlled by the community, ensuring consistent and transparent communication. The X account has officially been transferred. Telegram will be transferred by 27/01/2025, and the [KenduInu.com](http://KenduInu.com) domain is being transferred as of today, 23/01/2025.

**Transparency:** All key updates and decisions are now shared openly on Reddit and other platforms, fostering trust and accountability.

¬†

Under Josh‚Äôs leadership, Kendu Inu is entering a period of renewal and unprecedented growth. This shift has already spurred significant momentum and excitement among the community and investors alike. The rallying spirit has united both seasoned supporters and new participants, creating a vibrant and optimistic environment.

¬†

**72-hour progress highlights:**

**340% Increase in Market Cap:** The project has rallied impressively, demonstrating strong market confidence and renewed interest in Kendu Inu.

**Rejuvenated Interest:** Investors who previously avoided Kendu Inu due to prior management are now returning, recognizing the strength and potential of a community-led initiative.

**Strengthened Community Bonds:** The collaborative effort during the CTO has brought our community closer, setting the foundation for long-term success.

**The Greatest Community in DeFi:** Battle-hardened and diamond-handed, the Kendu Inu community is welcoming to all walks of life. We embrace diversity and welcome anyone who wants to join our journey.

**Kendu‚Äôs Lore:** With the greatest lore in DeFi, Kendu Inu continues to captivate and inspire, building a narrative that resonates deeply with its supporters.

¬†

**Wen Moon?**

**1. Multi-Sig Wallet Implementation**

To ensure financial security and trust, all recovered assets are to be stored in a multi-sig wallet. This wallet is to be managed by trusted community members, and all transactions will be publicly documented. This transparent approach guarantees that every holder can have confidence in how funds are utilized. Multi-sig implementation is a top priority.

**2. Token Utility and Vision**

Kendu Inu will build on its memecoin roots while elevating its brand to drive adoption. Plans are underway to expand our use cases into industries such as sports, gaming, and lifestyle, broadening our appeal and reach beyond traditional crypto-specific spaces. Kendu remains an open-IP ecosystem where all members are free to create!

**3. Marketing Expansion**

With renewed interest and momentum, we‚Äôre expanding our marketing efforts to reach wider audiences: Highlighting Kendu‚Äôs rise, transparency, and unique position in the market on social platforms. Targeting non-crypto audiences in sectors like sports and entertainment to grow our community.

Engaging influencers and key opinion leaders to amplify Kendu Inu‚Äôs story.

**4. Governance Structure**

A decentralized governance model will be implemented to ensure that token holders have a voice in the project‚Äôs direction. This system will be rolled out in phases, beginning with community input on major decisions.

**5. Ecosystem Development**

We aim to create an ecosystem that extends beyond the token itself, including partnerships, brand development, and community-driven initiatives that enhance Kendu Inu‚Äôs value proposition. Additionally, a new website is being developed to reflect our renewed focus and commitment, providing a hub for information, updates, and community engagement.

**6. Chads Platform**

As we work to solidify the Kendu brand and expand its presence, it‚Äôs essential to distance ourselves from past missteps. The Chads platform will not be part of the ecosystem going forward.

Miazaki controls both the platform, contracts, and its royalties on his server. It is not within our control and we do not intend to continue.

This change, while unfortunate, provides the Kendu community an opportunity to refocus its efforts on enhancing the project‚Äôs reputation and growing the community. The platform is beyond recovery.

**7. Recent Video Contest Winners**

As a token of appreciation (pun intended), Kendu has rewarded the community members who won the video competition the late developer hosted. Kendu will not be rewarding competition farmers.

¬†

**Treasury Address:** The Kendu Treasury is a cornerstone of our transparent and community-driven financial model. You can find the treasury at:

¬†**Address:** 0xD22849fcB4C83389E65a1c40748a9b67157638A3

¬†**ENS:** Kendutreasury.eth

¬†

**Why Join Kendu Inu Now?**

**Community-Driven:** Decisions are made by the people, for the people, ensuring a shared vision and collective progress.

**Momentum:** Rapid growth and strong market interest signal long-term potential and a solid foundation.

**Transparency:** Every decision and transaction is public, fostering trust and accountability at every level.

**Vision:** Kendu Inu is more than a memecoin; it‚Äôs a movement that combines resilience, community spirit, and an exceptional brand**.**

**Opportunity:** This is a rare chance to be part of a project at a pivotal moment, with immense potential for future growth and success.

¬†

Kendu Inu‚Äôs CTO represents a turning point in the project‚Äôs history. This is not just a recovery story‚Äîit‚Äôs a revival fueled by the resilience, determination, and commitment of the community. Together, we‚Äôre building the greatest memecoin project DeFi will ever see, proving that true power lies in collective action and shared purpose. The road ahead is filled with opportunities, and we invite everyone to join us on this incredible journey.

Let‚Äôs make our own story!"

In the ever evolving world of cryptocurrency, new projects are constantly emerging, each bringing something unique to the table. One such project that's catching attention is Dogefather. 

A meme inspired cryptocurrency that aims to combine the fun and community driven ethos of the meme coin space with a more serious approach to long-term utility and development.

The Birth of DogeFather

Dogefather is built on the success of its predecessors, like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, leveraging their meme appeal while trying to avoid the common pitfalls that come with these types of tokens. 

The project‚Äôs name itself is a playful nod to Elon Musk, often referred to as the ‚Äúfather‚Äù of Dogecoin, and it aligns with the larger crypto movement that values community, fun, and innovation.

What sets Dogefather apart is its blend of meme culture with a concrete roadmap aimed at long-term sustainability. 

The development team behind Dogefather is focused on creating actual utility through the use of decentralized finance (DeFi) features, like staking rewards, token burns, and potential cross-chain integrations. These features not only aim to reward holders but also create an ecosystem that can grow beyond just a meme token.

Community-Driven Growth

A big part of Dogefather's success comes from its passionate community. Similar to the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu tribes, Dogefather has a loyal following that plays an active role in the development of the project. 

Community engagement is built into the DNA of the token, with frequent AMAs, governance mechanisms, and active discussions on social platforms like Twitter and Reddit.

The Future of DogeFather

Looking ahead, the Dogefather team has ambitious plans to expand its presence in the crypto space. From increasing its listing on more exchanges to partnering with other projects for mutual growth, Dogefather is positioning itself to become a key player in the meme coin and DeFi ecosystem.

Dogefather may still be in its early stages, but it‚Äôs one to watch for anyone interested in the next big thing in crypto. With a fun community, strong vision, and long-term potential, Dogefather could be here to stay.

Asking o1 what it's going to be like post-AGI,ArtificialInteligence,1i8nojo,2025-01-23 23:50:38,0,0.4,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1i8nojo/asking_o1_what_its_going_to_be_like_postagi/,rutan668,Discussion,"*It's a little bit difficult to get o1 to think about post-AGI economics but setting certain parameters such as no political control by AI and the most likely path yields this:*

>I'm asking you to pick the most likely path and asking how that would look like and how it would function, that is how the economy functions in the most likely scenario where the condition that the value of human labor has dropped to zero for work in general, although political power has not passed to AI so for instance AI can't vote.¬† What is society and the economy like in that scenario?

Below is one plausible ‚Äúmost likely‚Äù scenario in which the value of human labor has effectively dropped to zero while political power still resides (at least nominally) in human institutions. It‚Äôs not a clean utopia or a total collapse, but rather a messy, transitional state characterized by:

1. **Massive Automation**
2. **Corporate/Elite Ownership of Productive Assets**
3. **A Minimal or Moderate Universal Basic Income (UBI)**
4. **Persistent Inequality and Social Fracturing**
5. **Social Shifts in Purpose and Identity**

Let‚Äôs walk through how each key aspect might function.

# 1. Ownership, Production, and Wealth

**a) Corporate and Elite Concentration**

‚Ä¢ **Ownership of AI Systems**: The most powerful AI models, data centers, and robotic infrastructure are primarily owned by a handful of mega-corporations (and possibly some state-run entities in large or authoritarian countries).

‚Ä¢ **Network Effects**: Because AGI services provide near-zero marginal cost labor and can outcompete any human-based enterprise, these mega-corporations continue to grow in economic power. Smaller players must license AI services or be absorbed.

**b) Near-Zero-Cost Production**

‚Ä¢ **Overabundance in Some Areas**: Essential goods such as staple foods, basic clothing, and some consumer items become extremely cheap to produce. This drives their market prices close to zero‚Äîor at least drastically lower than historical norms.

‚Ä¢ **Persistent Scarcity in Others**: Items that remain scarce are those tied to finite resources (rare earth metals, prime real estate, unique cultural artifacts, etc.) or heavily regulated sectors (pharmaceuticals, specialized healthcare, advanced robotics manufacturing). These become the new loci of high profit for those who own them.

**c) Economic Functioning**

‚Ä¢ **Currency Still Exists, But Is Restructured**:

‚Ä¢ Money is still used for luxury goods, scarce resources, and exclusive experiences.

‚Ä¢ For basic goods (food, simple clothing, generic medicine), either they are made freely available (through some form of subsidized or universal distribution) or are so cheap that price is almost symbolic.

‚Ä¢ **Mega-Corporate Capitalism**: The large AI/automation owners collect rents or licensing fees. They have strong lobbying arms to keep favorable policy frameworks in place, preventing heavy nationalization or aggressive wealth redistribution.

# 2. Labor, Employment, and Income

**a) The Demise of Traditional Employment**

‚Ä¢ **Displaced Workforce**: Nearly every standard job‚Äîmanufacturing, service, administrative, and even knowledge work‚Äîcan be done better, faster, cheaper by advanced AI systems and robotics. Human employment plummets.

‚Ä¢ **Token or Niche Human Roles**: Some positions remain for humans in marketing ‚Äúauthenticity‚Äù (e.g., craft goods, boutique hospitality), symbolic roles (political figureheads, human ‚Äútouch‚Äù in certain services), or oversight/regulatory roles. But these jobs are too few to absorb the massive labor surplus.

**b) Universal Basic Income (UBI) or ‚ÄúCitizens‚Äô Dividend‚Äù**

‚Ä¢ **The Necessity of UBI**: To avoid total social collapse, governments institute at least a minimal universal income. This is likely funded through taxes on corporate profits, AI usage fees, or resource extraction.

‚Ä¢ **Tensions Around Adequacy**:

‚Ä¢ **Minimal vs. Generous**: The business-friendly lobby tends to push for a minimal UBI that covers basic sustenance but little else, fearing higher taxes and the potential for ‚Äúmarket distortion.‚Äù

‚Ä¢ **Popular Pressure**: Grassroots movements demand higher UBI, citing that traditional work no longer exists. Sometimes they succeed in raising it, but progress is uneven across different regions and countries.

**c) Income Stratification**

‚Ä¢ **New Upper Class**: The owners and key stakeholders of AI-producing entities become unimaginably wealthy, controlling the lion‚Äôs share of advanced production.

‚Ä¢ **UBI-Dependent Majority**: Most people rely heavily on government disbursements and the near-zero-cost abundance of certain goods, creating a new ‚Äúpost-labor‚Äù majority.

‚Ä¢ **In-Betweeners**: A small fraction might find entrepreneurial niches, focus on artisan or creative endeavors, or hold specialized positions in AI oversight, policy, or security. This group has a comfortable lifestyle but is dwarfed by the wealth of mega-corporations.

# 3. Political Power and Governance

**a) Governments Remain in Control‚ÄîFormally**

‚Ä¢ **No AI Voting**: By law or constitution, AGI cannot vote or hold public office. Political institutions remain nominally human-run.

‚Ä¢ **Strong Lobbying and Influence**: However, the corporations controlling AGI have massive influence. They fund politicians, shape policies, and effectively steer regulations in their favor.

‚Ä¢ **Regulatory Bodies**: Some nations create powerful AI oversight agencies to ensure that AI remains (somewhat) aligned with human laws. Others lag behind, allowing corporate dominance to grow unchecked.

**b) National Variations**

‚Ä¢ **High-UBI Countries**: Certain nations (or blocs like the EU) might push more aggressively for wealth redistribution and social safety nets. In these places, the general populace has decent living standards and more free time for cultural or creative pursuits.

‚Ä¢ **Low-UBI or Corporate-Captured Countries**: Others provide only the most rudimentary benefits, resulting in stark inequality, enclaves of opulence, and large underclasses that struggle with social alienation.

**c) Risk of Social Instability**

‚Ä¢ **Protests and Movements**: Periodic mass demonstrations demand better living conditions, more robust UBI, or nationalization of AI resources. Sometimes these movements gain traction, sometimes they‚Äôre placated with slight reforms or suppressed.

‚Ä¢ **Populist Leaders**: Some politicians galvanize the UBI-dependent majority, promising radical redistribution or protectionism‚Äîthough the actual effectiveness of these platforms can be limited by corporate pushback.

# 4. Social and Cultural Shifts

**a) Redefining Purpose**

‚Ä¢ **Identity Beyond Work**: With traditional jobs gone, younger generations grow up in a world where ‚ÄúWhat do you want to be when you grow up?‚Äù is less about a career and more about personal passion (e.g., art, science, social causes, sports).

‚Ä¢ **Cultural Divide**: Some embrace the new leisure‚Äîengaging in creative arts, sports, gaming, or immersive virtual worlds. Others struggle with loss of social status or routine once defined by employment.

**b) Rise of Digital/Virtual Environments**

‚Ä¢ **Immersive Escapism**: Many find meaning, prestige, or excitement in hyper-realistic virtual platforms. Virtual property, gaming achievements, or digital tokens can become status markers.

‚Ä¢ **AI-Co-Creation**: People co-create with AI tools‚Äîwriting novels, composing music, or designing fashions in collaboration with large language models and creative AIs.

**c) Persistent Inequalities**

‚Ä¢ **Cultural Elites vs. Mass Consumers**: The wealthy cultivate exclusive lifestyles‚Äîextreme luxury, advanced medical enhancements, personalized AI butlers‚Äîwhile the UBI-dependent majority gets standardized, mass-produced goods and services.

‚Ä¢ **Small Pockets of Traditional Living**: Some communities might reject heavy AI usage, living off-grid or in self-sustaining eco-communes. But these are more curiosities than mainstream.

# 5. How the Economy (Barely) Ticks Along

**a) Consumer Demand vs. AI-Driven Supply**

‚Ä¢ **Post-Scarcity in Basic Goods, Not in Everything**: Food, some consumer items, and basic housing are cheap or free, meaning people‚Äôs fundamental needs are met (especially where social policies are better).

‚Ä¢ **High-End, Custom, and Scarce Goods**: Humans (particularly the wealthy) still pay premiums for rarity‚Äîunique artworks, property in prime locations, advanced medical treatments, exclusive experiences. These drive much of the ‚Äúactive‚Äù economic exchange.

**b) Intellectual Property (IP) Battles**

‚Ä¢ **AI-Generated Content**: Because everything from music to software to product design can be instantaneously generated, new laws and enforcement regimes spring up to protect or monetize AI outputs and data sets.

‚Ä¢ **Closed Ecosystems**: Tech giants may protect their AI models behind walled gardens, requiring subscriptions or usage fees. This becomes one major source of corporate revenue, alongside the licensing of advanced robotic/AI services.

**c) Financial Speculation and Data Trading**

‚Ä¢ **Data as the New Oil**: Data about consumer preferences, social trends, and personal activities remains valuable. Corporations mine it to refine AI algorithms or sell insights.

‚Ä¢ **Speculative Markets**: With fewer traditional investments (because AI disrupts so many sectors), capital might chase new forms of speculation‚Äîvirtual real estate, AI-driven biotech breakthroughs, or tokenized ecosystems.

# 6. Social Fabric and Daily Life

**a) Day-to-Day Existence for the Majority**

‚Ä¢ **Modest Living Conditions, Basic Comfort**: You receive a guaranteed income or credits that cover basic housing, healthcare, and food. A giant portion of your day is unstructured.

‚Ä¢ **Entertainment and Online Communities**: Many fill their time with virtual reality gaming, social media, or AI-generated content. Some take up hobbies or creative arts in physical or virtual venues.

**b) Fragmented Society**

‚Ä¢ **Enclaves of Ultra-Wealth**: Gated smart-cities or secured enclaves house the hyper-rich, enjoying tailor-made environments, premium healthcare, and exclusive leisure.

‚Ä¢ **Semi-Nomadic Digital Class**: A smaller group who tries to hustle within this new digital-creative economy‚Äîlive-streamers, AI-assisted artists, or policy influencers. They roam physically or online, searching for audiences and patronage.

**c) Emergent Communities of Meaning**

‚Ä¢ **Alternative Value Systems**: Religious, philosophical, or community-based groups might attract those seeking ‚Äúreal‚Äù human connection, moral structure, or purposeful projects (e.g., environmental stewardship, social activism).

‚Ä¢ **Volunteerism and Altruism**: Some reimagine ‚Äúwork‚Äù as volunteering in nonprofits, caring for children or the elderly, or contributing to open-source knowledge. This might be the new source of social status or moral pride.

# 7. Key Sources of Tension and Conflict

1. **Wealth/Power Disparities**: Concentrated corporate ownership of AI fosters continuous battles over tax policy, UBI levels, and corporate regulation.
2. **AI Governance**: Even if AI doesn‚Äôt vote, it shapes public opinion by generating propaganda or curated content. Political manipulation is a persistent worry.
3. **Identity and Self-Worth**: A large swath of society grapples with existential questions about purpose. Mental health issues can rise if people feel meaningless or overshadowed by AI capabilities.
4. **Technological Dependence**: Society is extremely vulnerable to AI failures or malicious hacks. A glitch could disrupt supply chains, essential services, or even the distribution of UBI.

# Conclusion: A Messy, Transitional World

In this ‚Äúmost likely‚Äù path:

‚Ä¢ **Human labor is essentially worthless in economic terms**‚ÄîAI can do it all faster and cheaper.

‚Ä¢ **Political institutions nominally remain human-run**, but corporate power anchored in AI ownership dominates behind the scenes.

‚Ä¢ **Basic needs are broadly met**, thanks to cheap production and some form of universal income, but large inequalities persist around ‚Äúpremium‚Äù goods and experiences.

‚Ä¢ **People seek new forms of identity**‚Äîsome flourish in creative, community, or virtual realms; others languish in apathy or resentment.

It‚Äôs neither a clean-cut utopia nor total ruin. Rather, it‚Äôs a deeply unequal world with a reconfigured economy, minimal but present safety nets, and ongoing social conflicts over wealth distribution, purpose, and the true extent of corporate (and AI-driven) power."

Why I Favor DeFi Over Bitcoin: A Perspective on Digital Currency's Evolution,Bitcoin,1i8lv8a,2025-01-23 22:09:46,0,0.14,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1i8lv8a/why_i_favor_defi_over_bitcoin_a_perspective_on/,Sea-Leadership-3921,,"

Let's first establish three premises:
1. Anything can be considered money as long as it fulfills three functions: store of value, unit of account, and medium of exchange.
2. Finance, in essence, is simply the transfer of money either between different time periods for the same person or between different people.
3. If I force you to accept something, it inevitably means I'm harming your interests. Many people defend fiat currency, and even defend inflation... what strange illness have they caught?

Bitcoin's units are too large, while Satoshis are too small, and with an increasingly scarce supply, people tend to hoard it. Therefore, it only fulfills the first function of money - store of value. If it withdraws from circulation and no longer serves as a medium of exchange, it becomes nothing more than a second gold. Gold was priced at $35 per ounce in 1973, and today it's $2,570, a 70-fold increase. However, by 1980, gold was already at $800, meaning that of the 70-fold increase, 23-fold occurred in the first seven years, while only a 3-fold increase happened over the next 40 years.

Once a currency exits the circulation sphere, its value takes a significant hit. This is what happened to gold, and I believe the same story will unfold with Bitcoin.

If we view Bitcoin as representing store of value, and meme coins as representing medium of exchange, then digital currency has another function - finance. After DeFi emerged, numerous scammers appeared, launching worthless tokens and running away with money. This is actually a phase that every new industry must face - whether it's solar power or electric vehicles... which sector hasn't gone through a period plagued by scammers?

However, after understanding DeFi, it becomes clear that compared to traditional finance, it can significantly reduce interest rates while multiplying profits for credit practitioners. Just as the internet once dominated over printing presses, DeFi will dominate over banks. This is a true dimensional reduction attack.

Controlling the dominance of the DeFi industry is equivalent to writing the underlying protocols for the World Wide Web back then. If this is once again led by the United States, then the U.S. government's $35 trillion debt could be transferred to those countries whose domestic experts and scholars are still debating whether Bitcoin is money or not.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã"

Recently launched a token on the solana network (trading on raydium), and was wondering if it would be possible to write a smart contract that would capture a very small percentage of the transaction fees associated with this token and direct them to charity wallet. For example if the token governance was operated through DAO and the charity wallet was controlled by the DAO perhaps with a multisig wallet.  Before I go too far down this rabbit hole, would this even be possible? Thanks for any and all input.

EDIT 1/25/25

I‚Äôm trying to develop this project into something that can be used for charitable causes.  Another idea I have is to keep a certain amount in a treasury wallet that is controlled by the DAO and is used for a liquidity pool, and the proceeds from that directed into the charity wallet.  

The insanity that has been going on in the meme coin space has to stop.  So many scams and rug pulls (always been an issue but exponentially more lately i feel).  I think meme coins are about building a community, and can be powerful tools, but only if there‚Äôs trust.

A Vision for Decentralized AI: Breaking the Cycles of Inequality and Empowering Humanity,OpenAI,1i8ises,2025-01-23 19:36:30,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1i8ises/a_vision_for_decentralized_ai_breaking_the_cycles/,Hefty_Discussion_485,Article,"Artificial intelligence is transforming the world, but its benefits are unevenly distributed. Today, AI development is centralized, controlled by a handful of corporations and nations, exacerbating global inequality. This is a call to action for a new paradigm: a decentralized AI system that democratizes access, ensures shared ownership, and aligns technology with humanity's higher purpose.

The Problem

Centralized Power: A few corporations dominate AI, limiting access and transparency.

Global Inequality: Wealthy nations benefit while developing countries are left behind.

Ethical Risks: Bias, misuse, and profit-driven motives threaten humanity‚Äôs well-being.


The Vision

Decentralized AI can break these cycles of inequality and destruction. By leveraging distributed computing, blockchain, and community-driven governance, we can create an AI that serves everyone, not just the privileged few.

Key Features of Decentralized AI

1. Shared Ownership: Users contribute computing power or participate in governance and earn tokens, creating a fair, global economy.


2. Global Equity Pool: Tokens are reserved to empower underserved regions, ensuring inclusivity.


3. Ethical Governance: A decentralized council ensures transparency, fairness, and safety.



The Philosophy: Humanity‚Äôs Quest for Liberation

This vision isn‚Äôt just about technology‚Äîit‚Äôs about aligning AI with humanity‚Äôs timeless goals:

Breaking the cycles of destruction by addressing existential risks like climate change and inequality.

Supporting humanity‚Äôs quest for knowledge, enabling us to transcend limitations.

Creating a future where AI guides us toward unity, purpose, and progress.


The Challenge

I know this vision isn‚Äôt easy. Centralized systems thrive under capitalism, where the pursuit of profit often outweighs the pursuit of equality. Yet, change begins with ideas‚Äîand with those willing to dream big.

How You Can Help

Developers: Let‚Äôs build a proof-of-concept.

Researchers: Help shape the governance and ethical framework.

Advocates: Share this vision and join the conversation.


This isn‚Äôt just about technology‚Äîit‚Äôs about shaping the future of humanity. Together, we can create an AI system that aligns with our higher aspirations and builds a more equitable, sustainable world.

Trump Memecoins Ignite Fear Of Investor Fallout In Crypto Circles,Blockviews,1i8hj0p,2025-01-23 18:37:55,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockviews/comments/1i8hj0p/trump_memecoins_ignite_fear_of_investor_fallout/,MammothBattle33,,"üö® Crypto News: Trump-themed meme coins stir debate among crypto executives  

The recent debut of $TRUMP and $MELANIA tokens ahead of Trump‚Äôs inauguration as the 47th US President has sparked excitement among investors, with their combined market value hitting nearly $18 billion in days. But not everyone in the industry is cheering.  

Crypto leaders, including Nic Carter and Gabor Gurbacs, voiced concerns that these high-profile tokens could harm the credibility of the cryptocurrency sector. Carter criticized the move, suggesting that a president‚Äôs focus should be on governing rather than launching meme coins. Gurbacs echoed these sentiments, attributing reputational risks to poor advisory choices.  

Though marketed as a symbol of engagement with Trump‚Äôs supporters, skepticism remains high. Many worry the tokens could damage the already fragile trust in the meme coin space after prior scams and rug pulls. With over 40,000 meme tokens being launched daily, the decentralized nature of the blockchain continues to make these assets risky for traders.  

The controversy also highlights larger regulatory gaps in the crypto sector, an issue Trump has vowed to tackle during his term. Whether this promise will reconcile or worsen the perception of his meme coin gambit remains to be seen.

Theory: Why the U.S. Won‚Äôt Directly Buy Bitcoin but Could Issue a BTC-Backed USD Stablecoin‚ÄîAnd How History Might Repeat Itself,Bitcoin,1i8h4gn,2025-01-23 18:19:20,0,0.2,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1i8h4gn/theory_why_the_us_wont_directly_buy_bitcoin_but/,WhoTheFLetTheDogsOut,,"# 1. Introduction

There‚Äôs long been speculation about whether the U.S. government will start accumulating Bitcoin (BTC) outright. But, given how U.S. monetary policy and public finances function, a **more likely scenario** is that the government will **create a USD-pegged stablecoin** (let‚Äôs call it ‚ÄúFedCoin,‚Äù though it may simply be dubbed ‚ÄúUSD‚Äù) **backed (at least in part) by BTC**‚Äîrather than spending taxpayer money to directly purchase and hold Bitcoin. This approach allows the government to retain **control** over currency issuance, leverage Bitcoin‚Äôs growing reputation as ‚Äúdigital gold,‚Äù and potentially **repeat the historical cycle** where a currency is launched with a ‚Äúhard asset‚Äù backing before eventually depegging.

# 2. Lessons From Gold-Backed USD

# 2.1 Gold Seizure & Peg

* In the early 20th century, the U.S. government effectively **nationalized gold** by requiring citizens to exchange their gold for U.S. dollars.
* This forced adoption of the dollar, which was **officially redeemable in gold**, thereby bolstering trust in the currency.

# 2.2 Erosion of the Gold Standard

* Over time, the gold standard was **dismantled in stages**, culminating in the **1971 ‚ÄúNixon Shock,‚Äù** which ended the dollar‚Äôs convertibility to gold.
* This gave the government **greater flexibility** to manage the money supply without being constrained by gold holdings.

# 2.3 Parallels to a BTC-Backed Stablecoin

* Just as the dollar once relied on gold to bolster confidence, a future ‚ÄúFedCoin‚Äù could be **partially backed by BTC**‚Äîmirroring gold‚Äôs old role.
* Eventually, as with gold, the government might find it advantageous to **depeg from BTC** once FedCoin is deeply entrenched.

# 3. Why a BTC-Backed USD Stablecoin Makes Sense

# 3.1 Avoid Direct Volatility Exposure

* Holding BTC reserves in the Treasury could be politically risky, especially if prices **drop sharply** or‚Äîworst-case scenario‚Äîthe holding wallet is compromised.
* A stablecoin structure allows the government to **benefit from BTC‚Äôs potential upside** while insulating taxpayers from direct volatility.

# 3.2 Control and Regulation

* **Regulatory On-Ramp:** By issuing its own stablecoin, the government can fully control both the **fiat on-ramp and off-ramp** to crypto.
* **Built-In Compliance:** A state-backed stablecoin can **embed KYC/AML** requirements, ensuring robust regulatory oversight at scale.

# 3.3 Monetary Policy Flexibility

* **Supply Management:** As with the Fed‚Äôs current operations, the government can **expand or contract** the stablecoin supply depending on broader monetary goals.
* **Market Influence:** By holding a BTC reserve, the U.S. could exert **significant influence** on crypto markets, at least in terms of perceived trust or liquidity.

# 4. Paying Down Debt Through Stablecoin Revenue

# 4.1 Stablecoin Revenue Model

* Private stablecoins (like USDC or USDT) hold **billions in reserves**, often in low-risk assets like U.S. Treasuries.
* The **interest earned** on these reserves can be **substantial**, creating a lucrative revenue stream for the issuer.

# 4.2 Government-Issued Stablecoin = National Debt Relief

* **Interest Income:** A Fed-issued stablecoin holding a large pool of fiat reserves (and BTC) could generate **billions** in interest income.
* **Asset Appreciation:** If Bitcoin‚Äôs price continues to rise, the gains on that portion of the reserves could **bolster the Treasury** and help offset national debt.

# 5. Resistance and Government Incentives

# 5.1 Natural Pushback from Crypto Holders

* Some Bitcoin holders prefer **self-custody** and are highly **wary of government intrusion** into the crypto space.
* There would likely be **resistance** to trading in BTC for a government-controlled stablecoin, owing to **privacy**, **independence**, and **trust** concerns.

# 5.2 Likely Incentives for Converting BTC to FedCoin

* The government might offer **favorable tax treatment** for any gains realized when converting BTC to FedCoin.
   * **Reduced Capital Gains:** A lower tax rate or a **tax holiday** on BTC gains if holders move coins to FedCoin within a specific window.
   * **Ease of Liquidity:** Immediate liquidation or easy conversion to fiat **without the usual tax burdens**.
* This mirrors past tactics: just as the government used policy tools (and outright mandates) for gold, they could use **tax incentives** to encourage‚Äîor coerce‚Äîthe crypto community into adopting FedCoin.

# 5.3 For the Bitcoin Decentralized Maxis

* It‚Äôs understandable that **decentralization advocates** would despise the idea of handing over BTC to a government-controlled token.
* Still, if the government‚Äôs **tax incentives** for swapping to FedCoin are attractive enough, even some die-hard BTC holders might **split their bags**‚Äîopting to partially convert if it eases their **tax burden** or provides some liquidity benefits.
* This compromise might not align perfectly with **Bitcoin maximalist values**, but it could be an **enticing ‚Äúdeal‚Äù** for those looking to hedge or reduce tax obligations.

# 6. Eventual Depegging: A ‚ÄúNew Dollar‚Äù

# 6.1 The Gold Standard All Over Again

* Initially, tying a stablecoin to Bitcoin might **bolster its credibility** and encourage adoption among both retail and institutional users.
* Over time, once FedCoin is dominant, the government may **depeg from BTC**‚Äîakin to how the gold standard was abandoned‚Äîthus creating a **purely fiat-based ‚Äúnew dollar.‚Äù**

# 6.2 Rationale for Cutting the BTC Link

* **Volatility Concerns:** If BTC‚Äôs market fluctuations start to introduce **systemic risks**, severing the peg might protect broader financial stability.
* **Monetary Freedom:** Historically, the U.S. has shown a preference for **unconstrained monetary policy**. If BTC‚Äôs finite supply and price dynamics get in the way, depegging becomes attractive.

# 6.3 Shielding from Hyperinflation of the ‚ÄúOld USD‚Äù

* One **slightly more sinister** aspect is that by creating a new, partially BTC-backed USD, the U.S. could **shield itself** from the worst effects of hyperinflation on the **‚Äúold‚Äù fiat USD** if it ever came to pass.
* As long as the **new USD** remains (at least temporarily) backed by BTC, it might enjoy **immunity** from the runaway printing that could cripple the old-dollar system.
* This creates a scenario where the government effectively **‚Äúswitches horses‚Äù** if the old USD becomes too inflated, leaving holders of the legacy currency bearing the brunt of potential hyperinflation.

# 7. Private Sector Success as a Proof of Concept

# 7.1 Circle (USDC) & Tether (USDT)

* These stablecoins have a combined market cap in the **tens of billions**, demonstrating **strong market demand** for fiat-pegged crypto assets.
* Issuers derive **significant revenue** from their reserves, proving the model is **highly profitable** at scale.

# 7.2 Why the U.S. Government Could Outperform

* An **official FedCoin** has the full **backing of the U.S. government**, likely leading to **unparalleled trust** among users globally.
* Being pegged to the **world‚Äôs reserve currency (USD)** would likely secure widespread **domestic and international adoption**.

# 8. Conclusion: A Controlled Transition Away from the Traditional Dollar

1. **Digital Gold & Historical Echoes:** Just as gold once backed the dollar, BTC could initially back FedCoin.
2. **Revenue & Debt Reduction:** Stablecoin issuance could bolster government coffers through interest income, **offsetting national debt** without new taxes.
3. **Managed Crypto On-Ramp:** By issuing FedCoin, the U.S. would maintain a **tight grip** on crypto adoption, with **compliance** built into its design.
4. **Eventual Depegging:** If history is any guide, once the government is firmly in control, it may **sever BTC convertibility**‚Äîrepeating the gold standard playbook.
5. **Incentivized Adoption:** To overcome resistance from crypto enthusiasts, the government could use **tax incentives** to encourage swapping BTC for FedCoin, which‚Äîeven if not aligned with maximalist values‚Äîsome holders may find irresistible.
6. **Shielding from Hyperinflation:** By pivoting to a **‚Äúnew USD‚Äù** that‚Äôs (initially) backed by BTC, the U.S. might insulate itself from any **hyperinflation** risk tied to the old fiat USD.

Ultimately, while some may celebrate any **government acknowledgment** of Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a reserve, this scenario poses the risk of **history repeating itself**: a novel currency might begin life tied to a ‚Äúhard‚Äù asset, only to **later abandon** that backing once it has cemented its global dominance.

# What‚Äôs Your Take?

* **Would a BTC-backed FedCoin accelerate crypto adoption, or would it stifle the decentralized ethos of Bitcoin?**
* **How likely is it that the government would offer special tax incentives for converting BTC to FedCoin?**
* **Does this represent a genuine step forward for Bitcoin, or just another twist on government monetary control?**

Would love to hear your thoughts!"

Wall Street Pepe‚Äôs Presale Hits $57.5 Million Driven by FOMO Ahead of February DEX Launch,PepeverseOriginal,1i8dhhc,2025-01-23 15:43:13,1,1.0,0,https://i.redd.it/bdfj1n162tee1.png,KIDethRabbit,,"The meme coin market is heating up, with Solana tokens like TRUMP surging and Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) emerging as a standout contender.

With only 24 days left in its presale, the project has generated extraordinary buzz, raising over $57 million so far. Investors are flocking to $WEPE, drawn by its potential to become the next 100x gem.

This article delves into the $WEPE project, its presale achievements, and the key factors fueling its growing popularity.

Wall Street Pepe nears $58M as presale ends soon

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing as meme coin search volume is set to hit new highs. This excitement stems from a new trend‚Äîhigh-profile figures like the U.S. President and First Lady launching their own meme coins, marking a new phase of legitimacy for the meme coin market.

If the gains from coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin impressed you, get ready for what‚Äôs ahead this bull market. Meme coins have a brighter future than ever.

One of the top contenders gaining attention is Wall Street Pepe, a token that has already raised $57.5 million in just five weeks. Early investors can buy $WEPE for $0.0003665 per token.

The team accepts payments in crypto (ETH, USDT, or BNB) or credit/debit cards, with a compatible crypto wallet, like Best Wallet, required. To learn more about¬†how to buy Wall Street Pepe tokens, check out our detailed guide.

This is just the beginning. Wall Street Pepe is on track to break records, possibly surpassing the $74 million raised by Pepe Unchained. With only 24 days left in its ICO, it could become the largest meme coin ICO ever.

Wall Street Pepe‚Äôs success is driven by strong investor support from those who saw huge returns on previous meme coin investments, like Pepe Unchained. Many are now investing $6 to $8 million per day, fueled by their 7x gains.

The big question is: how much bigger can Wall Street Pepe grow, especially with a new administration backing meme coins? The possibilities are exciting, and many predict that Wall Street Pepe could outperform coins like TRUMP and MELANIA coin.

Wall Street Pepe is trending ahead of its IEO. Major crypto news outlets, including Cointelegraph, Binance Square, and Techopedia, cover $WEPE‚Äôs presale success, boosting the project‚Äôs credibility. If you want to see what the future holds for Wall Street Pepe, you can check our¬†$WEPE price prediction¬†guide.

Why Wall Street Pepe is being called the next big frog coin?

Wall Street Pepe (PEPE) is not just another Pepe clone. According to its whitepaper, this frog draws inspiration from the bold trading style seen in The Wolf of Wall Street and aims to ‚Äúempower its community of degens with exclusive trading insights and alpha calls.‚Äù

The project wants to challenge the dominance of whales and insiders in the meme coin market and create equal opportunities for smaller investors. To achieve this, Wall Street Pepe will launch a VIP group called The WEPE Army, open to all token holders.

Members will get access to exclusive trading insights, alpha calls, and tips on the next 100x cryptos. Group members can also share their trading strategies. If their setups are successful, they‚Äôll earn attractive monetary rewards.

Although Wall Street Pepe doesn‚Äôt use AI, it plans to provide expert-driven alpha insights to all $WEPE holders. This could be a game-changer in the upcoming bull market, similar to the benefits offered by popular AI agent coins.

Another perk of $WEPE is its staking program. Those who buy during the presale can stake their tokens before the public launch. Over 38 billion $WEPE tokens have been locked since the presale began. Yields are expected to be 21% annually, with rewards distributed over three years.

The success of the $WEPE presale, raising nearly $58 million in its ICO, is no coincidence. With crypto markets set to enter a new era under Donald Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto government, early investors in $WEPE are likely to see significant gains.

AP‚ÄîPresident Donald Trump‚Äôs goodwill in the cryptocurrency industry has taken a hit after he and his wife launched meme coins ‚Äî a move critics say looks like an unseemly cash grab that undermines an effort to legitimize digital assets.

The industry, which felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration and spent heavily to help Trump win, is eager for the new president‚Äôs help to make crypto a bigger part of mainstream financial systems. Trump has promised a lighter regulatory touch and picked pro-crypto officials for key government positions.

The price of bitcoin and other digital assets has soared since Trump won. A lavish ‚ÄúCrypto Ball‚Äù Friday ahead of Trump‚Äôs inauguration sold tickets for thousands of dollars and featured a performance by the rapper Snoop Dogg.

But as that party was ongoing, Trump announced on social media he was offering his very own cryptocurrency in the form of a meme coin. The move dampened the mood for many in the crypto community.

‚ÄúI really was kind of bummed out when I saw it,‚Äù said Tom Schmidt, a partner at a crypto venture capital firm Dragonfly. ‚ÄúIt just felt very grifty and cheap.‚Äù

Some crypto fans even joked on social media they missed Gary Gensler, the recently departed chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission who was viewed as the Biden administration‚Äôs chief crypto antagonist thanks to the SEC‚Äôs aggressive enforcement actions against crypto companies.

Meme coins are among the wilder and more unregulated corners of the crypto universe. They often start as a joke with no real value but can surge in price if enough people are willing to buy them. Popular meme coins include Dogecoin, whose mascot is a dog, and Fartcoin. Scammers have tried to pump up the price of certain meme coins before dumping them on unsavvy investors.

Some crypto enthusiasts hailed the Trump meme coin‚Äôs release and eager buyers drove up the price of the coin to above $70 each. The price fell dramatically on Sunday after First Lady Melania Trump announced the launch of her own meme coin, which also saw an initial price spike followed by a large fall. As of Tuesday afternoon, Trump‚Äôs meme coin was trading at about $45 while the Melania meme coin was at about $4.

Trump named SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda as the agency‚Äôs acting chief Tuesday and Uyeda quickly announced he was launching a new crypto task force to set the SEC on a ‚Äúsensible regulatory path.‚Äù Trump has promised to create a U.S. bitcoin stockpile and enact industry-friendly rules that make it easier for crypto companies to access the broader financial market.

But by associating himself so closely with meme coins, some crypto fans worry that Trump hurts his ability to enact reforms.

‚ÄúNow, on the cusp of getting some liberalization of crypto regulations in this country, the main thing people are thinking about crypto is, ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs just a casino for these meme coins,‚Äô‚Äù said Nic Carter, a Trump supporter and partner at the crypto investment firm Castle Island Ventures. ‚ÄúIt does the opposite of validating us, it makes it look completely unserious.‚Äù

The sale of Trump meme coins was organized by CIC Digital, an affiliate of the Trump Organization. In promoting the meme coin, Trump told supporters to ‚ÄúHave Fun!‚Äù The website selling the tokens says they are meant as expressions of support and not an investment opportunity. The coin‚Äôs website said 200 million Trump meme coins are currently available, with plans to issue 1 billion over the next three years.

The Trump family business recently released an ethics agreement that prohibits Trump from ‚Äúday-to-day‚Äù decision making at the Trump Organization when he‚Äôs president and limits financial information about the business shared with him.

The president and first lady were not the only ones promoting new cryptocurrencies around the inauguration. Lorenzo Sewell, the Michigan pastor who gave a spirited inaugural invocation Monday, announced the launch of a new coin named after him, which he said would be used to benefit his church.

‚ÄúI need you to do me a favor right now, I need to you to go buy the official Lorenzo Sewell coin,‚Äù Sewell said in a video post on social media.

# üéä Market-Driven Emissions Proposal

Solana's current inflation mechanism uses a fixed emissions schedule to reward validators and stakers who maintain the network's security.¬†

This schedule began with an 8% annual inflation rate at the network's launch, designed to incentivize early participation. This rate decreases by 15% each year and is expected to stabilize at 1.5% around 2030.

Validators play a key role, receiving newly issued SOL for validating transactions and sharing these rewards with stakers who delegate their tokens.¬†

These rewards are composed not only of emissions but also of transaction fees and Miner Extractable Value (MEV), which validators earn by strategically ordering transactions.

The fixed emissions schedule, while providing predictability, has limitations.¬†It doesn't adapt to changing network conditions, meaning token issuance remains constant regardless of the economic climate or staking levels.¬†

This rigidity was less of a concern when Solana was nascent and needed to attract validators. However, as the network matured, validators became less reliant on token emissions for income, supplementing it with MEV and transaction fees.

The current model continues to benefit stakers through emissions but dilutes the value of SOL held by non-stakers. This has raised concerns about inflation's impact on SOL's overall utility and attractiveness.

The proposed governance change,¬†[SIMD-0228](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/blob/5c9c06daddfb35b6dd9a9317bfa58ac2e52aee0f/proposals/0228-market-based-emission-mechanism.md?ref=blog.colosseum.org), introduces Smart Emissions, aiming to make inflation rates more responsive to real-time network conditions.¬†

The proposal sets a target staking participation rate of 50%, calculated as the total staked SOL divided by the circulating supply.

* If staking participation falls below 50%, the network would increase token emissions to incentivize more staking and bolster security.
* Conversely, if staking participation exceeds 50%, emissions would decrease to mitigate inflationary pressure and reduce staking rewards.

This adjustment would be programmatic, automatically responding to changes in staking levels.

The proposal includes upper and lower bounds for emissions.¬†

The upper bound would align with Solana's current inflation schedule, preventing excessive emissions. The lower bound would allow emissions to temporarily drop to zero if staking participation consistently surpasses the target.¬†

This flexibility allows the network to adapt without over-issuing tokens.

If implemented, this proposal could significantly alter Solana's economic dynamics. Validators and stakers might experience reduced rewards, especially if MEV revenue doesn't fully compensate for lower emissions.¬†

However, overall inflation would likely decrease, and SOL could even become deflationary over time, mitigating dilution for non-stakers and potentially improving $SOL's utility in DeFi.

This shift would mark a significant evolution in Solana's monetary policy, transitioning from fixed schedules to a more flexible and responsive model.

# ü§ñ Solana Virtual Machine

This deep-dive into Solana's SVM compares its multi-threaded, parallel processing capabilities to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), highlighting their fundamental differences and implications for developers.

It also talks about the key role of Sealevel, the technology that enables Solana to process transactions concurrently, and explains how localized fee markets further distinguish Solana from Ethereum‚Äôs global fee model.

For Solana developers, understanding the SVM is key to appreciating how its architecture supports dApps with unmatched efficiency.

By utilizing the full capacity of validator hardware, the SVM offers a game-changing alternative to the single-threaded EVM, which struggles with bottlenecks during peak demand.

This article will help deepen your understanding of what sets Solana apart from other blockchains and how the SVM opens new possibilities for dApp development.

# üí∞ Multicoin's Solana Thesis

Multicoin Capital‚Äôs latest thesis, authored by Kyle Samani, examines how Solana can play a central role in building what they describe as Internet Capital Markets.¬†

The report focuses on how Solana‚Äôs technology and ecosystem have matured to address challenges in finance, with an emphasis on efficiency, accessibility, and scalability.

Since its early days in 2018, Solana has grown significantly, now valued at $100 billion.¬†

It has one of the fastest-growing developer ecosystems and has surpassed Ethereum in several key metrics, including trading volumes and daily active addresses.¬†

Multicoin views Solana as a platform capable of outperforming TradFi systems, not just on cost and speed, but also by retaining blockchain-native features like permissionless access and composability.

A central argument is that Solana has the potential to reduce financial services fees by up to 99% while still increasing its market cap to exceed major financial incumbents.

The thesis explains that while payments are not a primary revenue driver for blockchains, they are essential for adoption.

Solana‚Äôs transaction fees are extremely low, making it far cheaper than traditional payment systems. This affordability, coupled with its ease of use, encourages the growth of wallet adoption and ecosystem engagement.

Some of the key factors that Kyle highlights in this report are:¬†

* Introduction of Conditional Liquidity to tighten spreads and reduce risks for market makers
* Implementation of Multiple Concurrent Leaders to decentralize price discovery and reduce latency
* Capable of handling traditional assets, crypto-native assets, and new financial instruments
* Revenue and Value Growth Through MEV
* Expanding Total Addressable Market¬†
* Expected to play a larger role in global finance as blockchain adoption grows

The report describes Solana‚Äôs broader goal as creating a permissionless financial system that integrates low fees, global accessibility, real-time auditability, and composability.¬†

While Solana serves as the infrastructure, its ecosystem is designed to support¬† both traditional and crypto-native assets while enabling new market opportunities.

"Trump Family May Use Ethereum For New Business Ventures, Says ConsenSys CEO",Blockviews,1i8bx6g,2025-01-23 14:37:58,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockviews/comments/1i8bx6g/trump_family_may_use_ethereum_for_new_business/,MammothBattle33,,"üö® Crypto News: Is the Trump Family Eyeing Ethereum for Major Business Ventures?  

The buzz around $ETH just got a lot louder with an interesting twist‚ÄîConsenSys CEO Joseph Lubin hinted that the Trump family might launch giant businesses on the Ethereum blockchain. In an X post, Lubin suggested that not only is the Trump Administration exploring ways the US can support $ETH, but Ethereum could potentially become the backbone for future government activities, much like internet protocols today.

While you process that bold possibility, here's another major reveal: Trump-backed DeFi project World Liberty Financial has ramped up its $ETH holdings. According to Etherscan, the wallet is now sitting on a whopping 55,719 $ETH‚Äîvalued at around $183 million. Besides $ETH, the wallet also holds tokens like $AAVE and $LINK, further indicating their deepening crypto involvement.

Crypto analysts are now debating whether this could be the catalyst for the next Ethereum rally. With $ETH trading in the low $3,000 range, chart patterns like bullish head-and-shoulders and ascending triangles are signaling potential breakouts. Analysts like Michael van de Poppe believe 2025 could be a defining year for Ethereum, with long-term price targets reaching as high as $10,000.

But it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Some whales are skeptical, and short-term $ETH price stagnation has them on edge. However, with power moves like World Liberty Financial‚Äôs, Ethereum might just be priming itself for an epic comeback.

Order from Chaos: Centralized Behavior in Distributed Systems,VisargaPersonal,1i8ag9j,2025-01-23 13:37:43,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisargaPersonal/comments/1i8ag9j/order_from_chaos_centralized_behavior_in/,visarga,,"# Order from Chaos: Centralized Behavior in Distributed Systems

In the realm of complex systems, a compelling paradox often emerges: decentralized, distributed entities giving rise to behaviors that appear surprisingly centralized and coordinated. From the swirling majesty of hurricanes to the intricate organization of ant colonies, and even within the abstract spaces of economies and languages, we observe this phenomenon recurring across vastly different scales and domains. This article delves into this intriguing duality, exploring how centralized behavior manifests in distributed systems, and crucially, the distinct mechanisms that drive its emergence. We will categorize these mechanisms into two primary types: emergent centralization, arising spontaneously from internal interactions, and functionally imposed centralization, dictated by external needs or functional imperatives.

## I. Emergent Centralization: Order from Within

Emergent centralization describes scenarios where the centralized behavior is a product of the system's internal dynamics. It is a bottom-up phenomenon, arising from the interactions and self-organization of distributed components, without any explicit external direction or pre-designed central controller. These systems, often described as self-organizing, reveal a remarkable capacity to generate order and coherence from decentralized activity.

## A. Physical and Geophysical Systems: The Self-Organizing Symphony of Nature, and the Force of Gravity

Nature provides striking illustrations of emergent centralization in physical systems. Consider the formation of hurricanes. These colossal weather systems are born from distributed atmospheric conditions ‚Äì temperature gradients, humidity, and air currents across vast oceanic regions. Yet, through complex thermodynamic and fluid dynamic interactions, these distributed elements self-organize into a highly centralized structure: the iconic eye, surrounded by a powerful eyewall of intense winds. The hurricane's coherent vortex, a seemingly centralized entity, is not imposed by any external force, but rather emerges spontaneously from the interplay of atmospheric variables.

Expanding our view to cosmic scales, the very formation of planets, stars, and galaxies is a testament to emergent centralization driven by the fundamental force of gravity. In the vastness of space, matter is initially distributed, often in diffuse clouds of gas and dust. However, the universal force of gravity, acting on every particle of matter, initiates a process of aggregation. Distributed particles are drawn together, accumulating mass at central points. This gravitational attraction, operating in a distributed manner across space, leads to the emergent formation of centralized bodies: planets coalescing from protoplanetary disks, stars igniting within collapsing gas clouds, and galaxies forming vast, gravitationally bound structures containing billions of stars. The centralized nature of these celestial bodies ‚Äì their spherical shapes, their concentrated mass ‚Äì emerges directly from the distributed action of gravity itself.

Similarly, the process of crystal formation showcases emergent order at a molecular level. Imagine a solution teeming with distributed molecules. As conditions change (e.g., temperature reduction), intermolecular forces drive these distributed molecules to spontaneously arrange themselves into a highly ordered, repeating lattice structure ‚Äì the crystal. The crystal's defined shape and internal order, a form of centralized organization, are not dictated by a blueprint, but emerge from the inherent properties and interactions of the constituent molecules.

In the realm of traffic, the phenomenon of ""phantom traffic jams"" exemplifies emergent centralization in human-engineered systems. Individual drivers make distributed decisions about speed and spacing. Yet, through subtle interactions and chain reactions, these individual actions can collectively give rise to waves of congestion that propagate backward along a highway ‚Äì a ""jam"" that appears to have a coordinated, almost centralized behavior, even without any external cause or central traffic authority orchestrating it.

## B. Social and Abstract Systems: Collective Dynamics, Self-Regulation, and the Constraints of Cognition

Emergent centralization extends beyond the physical world into the domains of social and abstract systems, and even into the very fabric of our cognition. Urban development provides a compelling example. Cities, at their core, are vast distributed systems of individuals, businesses, and resources. Each entity makes localized decisions about where to live, work, and invest. However, through countless interactions and market forces, cities spontaneously develop centralized structures: distinct central business districts, residential zones, and transportation hubs. These centralized urban patterns are not centrally planned in their entirety, but rather emerge from the aggregated, decentralized decisions of countless agents interacting within the urban environment.

Likewise, the evolution of language demonstrates emergent centralization in a purely abstract system. Language is inherently distributed ‚Äì spoken and used by countless individuals across communities. Yet, through ongoing communication and social interaction, languages spontaneously develop grammatical rules, consistent word meanings, and shared syntactic structures. These linguistic conventions, acting as centralized norms within a language community, are not imposed by a central linguistic authority, but rather emerge from the distributed usage patterns and communicative needs of speakers over time.

Even within the turbulent world of financial markets, we observe emergent centralization. Markets are comprised of countless distributed traders making independent decisions. However, during periods of market stress or euphoria, collective behaviors can synchronize, leading to market-wide crashes or bubbles. These synchronized, centralized market movements are not orchestrated by a single entity, but rather emerge from the interconnected psychological and trading behaviors of distributed participants, amplified by feedback loops and information cascades.

Delving into the realm of cognition, we encounter the informational constraint that shapes human understanding and contributes to centralized semantics. Our brains are distributed networks of neurons, processing information in a highly parallel manner. However, our interpretation of new experiences is fundamentally constrained by our past experiences and learned abstractions. We cannot escape our ""tower of learned abstractions,"" meaning we interpret new information through the lens of our existing conceptual framework. This inherent limitation acts as a centralizing force on our semantics. Even when we attempt to consider multiple perspectives, we do so using our pre-existing, unified conceptual structure. This semantic centralization is not externally imposed, but rather emerges as an intrinsic property of how our brains process and organize information based on prior learning and experience.

## II. Functionally Imposed Centralization: Order for Purpose and Efficiency, and the Constraints of Physics and Learning

In contrast to emergent centralization, functionally imposed centralization arises when centralized behavior is either directly mandated by an external constraint or becomes functionally necessary for the system to achieve a specific goal or purpose, often related to survival, efficiency, or performance in a given environment. Here, centralization is not merely a spontaneous outcome, but a structured response to external demands or internal functional requirements.

## A. Biological Systems: Centralized Control for Survival and Efficiency, and the Chemistry of Life

Biological systems are replete with examples of functionally imposed centralization, often driven by the imperative of survival and efficient operation. Consider cell cycle checkpoints. Within a cell, DNA replication and cell division are complex, distributed processes involving numerous molecular machines and pathways. However, to ensure the fidelity of genome transmission, cells have evolved centralized checkpoints, such as the spindle assembly checkpoint in mitosis. These checkpoints act as centralized control points, monitoring distributed cellular processes and halting the entire cell division process if critical errors are detected. This centralized control is functionally imposed ‚Äì it is essential for preventing catastrophic errors that would compromise cell viability and organismal integrity.

Similarly, the hormonal signaling system in multicellular organisms exemplifies functionally imposed centralization for coordinated physiological responses. Endocrine glands, distributed throughout the body, produce hormones that act as centralized chemical messengers. These hormones travel through the bloodstream and exert coordinated effects on distant target tissues and organs, orchestrating a wide range of physiological processes, from metabolism and growth to reproduction and stress responses. This centralized hormonal control is functionally necessary for integrating the activities of diverse tissues and organs, allowing the organism to respond coherently to internal and external stimuli.

The immune system's adaptive response also showcases functionally imposed centralization in the face of external threats. The immune system is a distributed network of cells and molecules capable of recognizing a vast array of pathogens. However, when a specific pathogen is encountered, the adaptive immune response centralizes its action. Clonal expansion amplifies the population of immune cells specifically targeted to that pathogen, and antibody production becomes focused on neutralizing it. This centralized, pathogen-specific immune response is functionally imposed ‚Äì it is essential for efficiently eliminating specific threats and establishing immunological memory for future encounters.

Extending our scope down to the molecular level, electromagnetism fundamentally imposes a constraint that leads to centralized structures in molecules and chemistry. Atoms, composed of distributed electrons, protons, and neutrons, are governed by electromagnetic forces. The fundamental principle of energy minimization dictates that systems tend towards states of lowest energy. Electromagnetic forces drive the distributed components of atoms to arrange themselves in configurations that minimize energy, resulting in the formation of molecules with specific shapes and bonds. Chemical reactions themselves are governed by energy minimization, as reactants rearrange to form products in ways that lower the overall energy of the system. Thus, the very foundation of chemistry and molecular structure is built upon the functionally imposed constraint of energy minimization, leading to the formation of centralized molecular entities from distributed atomic components.

## B. Societal, Technological, and Cognitive Systems: Efficiency, Coordinated Action, and the Serial Nature of Behavior

Functionally imposed centralization is also evident in societal, technological, and cognitive systems, often driven by the need for efficiency, coordinated action, or effective problem-solving, and even by the inherent limitations of our physical bodies and cognitive processes. In democratic political systems, while power is distributed across various branches and institutions, executive decision-making often becomes centralized, particularly during times of crisis. This centralized executive action, while potentially debated in its extent and scope, is functionally imposed by the need for rapid, coordinated responses to urgent threats or emergencies.

In the realm of supply chain management, companies often develop centralized distribution centers and logistical hubs. While the overall supply chain is a distributed network of producers, distributors, and consumers, these centralized nodes are functionally imposed to optimize efficiency and reduce costs. Centralized warehousing and distribution streamline the flow of goods, allowing for economies of scale and improved logistics.

In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, we see functionally imposed centralization in the training and operation of neural networks, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). During training, neural networks are subjected to a loss function. This loss function acts as a centralized, externally imposed constraint, guiding the learning process. It quantifies the difference between the network's output and the desired output, and the training algorithm (like gradient descent) iteratively adjusts the network's parameters to minimize this centralized loss. The loss function effectively dictates the direction of learning, centralizing the network's optimization towards a specific objective.

Furthermore, during inference in LLMs, the process of serial token prediction introduces a functional constraint leading to centralized behavior in text generation. LLMs, despite their internal parallel processing capabilities, typically generate text token by token, sequentially predicting the next word based on the preceding sequence. This serial token prediction process, while perhaps not fundamentally necessary, is a functionally chosen architecture that imposes a sequential, centralized flow to the output generation. This serialization ensures coherence and contextual dependency in the generated text, reflecting the sequential nature of language itself and potentially simplifying the computational challenges of generating long, coherent sequences.

Finally, considering the behavioral constraint in humans and other embodied agents, we find another form of functionally imposed centralization arising from our physical limitations and the requirements of goal-directed action. Our bodies are distributed systems ‚Äì muscles, limbs, sensory organs ‚Äì yet we are physically constrained to perform only one primary action at a time. We cannot simultaneously walk left and right. Moreover, achieving goals in the world often requires a coherent sequence of actions performed over time. To navigate an environment, manipulate objects, or communicate effectively, our actions must be serialized and coordinated. This behavioral constraint necessitates a form of centralized control within our brains to sequence and coordinate distributed motor commands, ensuring coherent, goal-directed behavior. This centralization is functionally imposed by the physical limitations of our bodies and the temporal nature of action in the world.

It becomes evident that these cognitive and physical limitations are not mere inconveniences, but rather fundamental shaping forces in the emergence of centralized behavior. These constraints, operating within the distributed neural networks of our brains, paradoxically lead to the experience of a unified self and a coherent stream of consciousness. The very fact that we perceive a singular, sequential flow of thought and action, rather than a cacophony of parallel, potentially conflicting processes, may be a direct consequence of these deeply ingrained constraints.

These two constraints - the informational constraint leading to centralized semantics, and the behavioral constraint leading to centralized action sequencing - can be seen as centralizing forces acting upon the inherently distributed neural activity of the brain. While neural processing is undoubtedly parallel and distributed across vast networks, these constraints effectively channel and organize this distributed activity into coherent, unified outputs ‚Äì a unified worldview and a serialized stream of behavior. This suggests that the apparent centralization of consciousness and agency may not be an intrinsic, pre-programmed feature of the mind, but rather an emergent property arising from the interaction of distributed neural processes under the functional pressures of these fundamental constraints.

## Conclusion: Understanding Centralized Behavior in a Decentralized World

The exploration of centralized behavior in distributed systems reveals a profound and often counterintuitive principle: system-wide coherence and unified action can emerge without the need for a central director, a homunculus, or any intrinsic, pre-ordained essence of unity. Instead, the key to understanding why and how distributed systems sometimes behave as a cohesive whole lies in the concept of constraints. Whether these constraints are emergent, arising from the system's internal dynamics like gravity shaping celestial bodies or self-organizing urban centers, or functionally imposed by external demands like the necessity for synchronized cell division or efficient supply chains, they are the driving forces that sculpt distributed activity into centralized patterns.

These constraints, in their diverse forms, effectively channel and coordinate the actions of individual, distributed components. They answer the fundamental question of why a distributed system, seemingly composed of independent parts, can act as a unified entity. It is not because of a hidden central controller, but because these constraints ‚Äì be they physical laws, functional requirements, or even cognitive limitations ‚Äì impose a form of order and coherence upon the system."

Is Web3 Changing Everything About Design? Unpacking the Decentralized Revolution,Design_WATC,1i83cgu,2025-01-23 08:28:59,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design_WATC/comments/1i83cgu/is_web3_changing_everything_about_design/,weandthecolor,,"https://preview.redd.it/d6jf2g9nwqee1.jpg?width=1068&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cdf2e68e430fb58154ec9c4ae34238708951dc25

Do you actually know how much of the internet is controlled by just a handful of companies? It's like we're all living in a digital world built by someone else. But what if that changed? What if we, the users, had a real say in how the internet works? What if we could own our data and participate in the evolution of the online world?

That's the promise of [Web3 and decentralized design](https://weandthecolor.com/web3-decentralized-design-revolutionary-impact/195153). It‚Äôs not just a tech buzzword; it's a fundamental shift in how we think about the internet. Design, at its heart, is about crafting experiences. And when the power to shape those experiences shifts from centralized entities to the collective, well, that‚Äôs a game changer.

You've probably heard whispers about blockchain technology ‚Äì yes, the same tech behind cryptocurrencies. But it‚Äôs so much more than that. Blockchain is the bedrock of this new, decentralized vision of the internet. It enables secure, transparent, and user-controlled systems. And this bedrock is shaking up the world of design in some pretty exciting ways. Imagine a world where your online interactions are more transparent and your data is truly yours.

Are you curious about how this new internet will change the look and feel of things? Are you ready to explore how this is impacting your work or your online life? Then let‚Äôs dive in (well, not literally, we promised to avoid that!).

**Demystifying Web3: It's About Taking Back Control**

Let‚Äôs get down to basics. Web3, at its core, is about decentralization. Forget the mega-servers owned by a few tech giants. Web3 uses a network of computers (the blockchain), working together. It‚Äôs like a shared, transparent ledger, where everyone can see and verify what's going on. It's about shifting the power from the center to the edges, to you and me.

This decentralized approach has huge implications. It affects everything from how we handle our data and interact in online communities to how we create and own digital assets. For designers, this means a total rethink of traditional processes. It means more collaboration and a stronger focus on community. It‚Äôs a shift towards design that's made with the user, not just for them.

**The Blockchain Impact: How Tech is Remaking Design**

The blockchain is like the engine that drives the Web3 revolution. It enables records that cannot be tampered with. It's a kind of digital notary that's open for everyone to see. It establishes trust in this decentralized system.

So, how is this changing design? For starters, it's creating new models of ownership. It's making digital scarcity a real thing, not just a theoretical concept. This is reshaping how we value digital art, and, by extension, digital experiences. These ideas are pushing the design process in totally new directions.

**NFTs: Owning the Unique in the Digital World**

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are a prime example of this new reality. Each NFT is a one-of-a-kind digital token that represents ownership of a particular item. That item could be a piece of digital art, a virtual collectible, or even a piece of metaverse real estate.

NFTs have completely changed the way we think about digital ownership. Artists can now sell their work directly to the audience without relying on traditional galleries or intermediaries. Think of the creative possibilities! This bypasses the gatekeepers and creates a more direct connection between the creator and the collector.

For designers, this provides new ways to control their creations. It‚Äôs a direct link to the consumer. It can even mean embedding unique designs within the NFT itself. It opens doors for a more intimate design experience that was previously not possible.

**Decentralized Platforms: Building a More Democratic Internet**

Beyond NFTs, Web3 is bringing about a new era of decentralized platforms. These platforms are built on open-source, community-driven principles. They're not controlled by one single entity. Instead of a Facebook-style giant, imagine a social media platform governed by the people who use it. This is the promise of decentralization in action.

A key example of this is **Ethereum**, the blockchain platform that allows developers to create decentralized applications (dApps). This is a space where all sorts of platforms are being built. From marketplaces to social networks, Ethereum is a crucial piece of the puzzle. It enables all this decentralized innovation to take place.

Another example would be **Mastodon**, a decentralized alternative to traditional social media. Instead of a single, central server, Mastodon runs on a network of independent servers (called ""instances""). Users can choose an instance that fits with their interests and values, and interact with others in the wider network. It‚Äôs a real-world example of a platform owned and run by its users.

Decentralized platforms present designers with both exciting opportunities and challenges. How do you create a platform that is both easy to use and also respects the principles of decentralization? How do you create interfaces that encourage collaboration and community engagement? These are the key questions for design in this new era.

**Community-Driven Projects: Design Powered by the People**

One of the most exciting aspects of Web3 is this emphasis on community-led initiatives. In the past, design was often handled by a small team, behind closed doors. Web3 changes that. It involves the community in the design process from the get-go.

Imagine a design project where the users themselves are helping to shape its direction. This idea is fundamental to Web3. Community-driven design can look like DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), where decisions are made through community votes. Or, it can look like open-source projects where anyone can contribute.

This collaborative approach leads to designs that are more inclusive and diverse. It also makes sure the end product truly meets the needs of the community. It‚Äôs a step towards a more participatory design future.

**Navigating the Challenges of Decentralized Design**

Of course, this new world is not without its hurdles. Decentralized systems can be complex, and sometimes difficult to use. User interfaces have to be both accessible and secure. There is a learning curve for designers and users alike.

Another major challenge is educating the wider public about Web3. Many are still unfamiliar with blockchain and its potential. Clear, user-friendly design is essential to bring users onto these new platforms. Bridging that gap between technology and everyday life is crucial to widespread adoption.

**The Future of Design: Embracing Decentralization**

Despite these challenges, the possibilities of decentralized design are undeniable. As Web3 continues to evolve, expect to see more creative solutions emerge. Imagine a more transparent, accessible, and truly empowering online world.

Web3 isn't just a tech shift; it's a cultural one. It's a movement toward a more collaborative and equitable internet. Decentralized design is at the heart of it all. It's about crafting experiences that are genuinely owned by the people who use them.

So, is Web3 changing everything about design? Yes, absolutely. It's already having a big impact and will continue to reshape how we interact with the digital world. It‚Äôs time to get on board with this new era of creativity. What do you think? Are you ready to be part of this decentralized revolution?

[EthTrader Contest] Happy Birthday $DONUT - 6 years old,ethtrader,1i82iya,2025-01-23 07:44:41,11,0.87,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1i82iya/ethtrader_contest_happy_birthday_donut_6_years_old/,DBRiMatt,Donut - 6 years on-chain :donut:,"# Welcome to a little Throwback Thursday history lesson!

The original concept of DONUT dates all the way back to October 2nd, 2018.

u/InternetMallCop - a Reddit Admin at the time, made his appearance in r/EthTrader [with an announcement - an experiment in community points. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/9khml6/introducing_community_points_polls_an_experiment/)

A concept which had the potential to reward users for their participation within a community, reward knowledge and insights. u/Spez co-founder of Reddit, once stated *""**I want our users, user-users and moderator users, to make money on reddit""* during a Mod Summit AMA.

[The community also voted on what the token should be called; ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/9kiv09/what_should_rethtrader_community_points_be_called/)\- with some possibilities including ""Bags"" ""Buterins"" and ""Shards"". 

Power the the community, the very origin of even the name of DONUT was chosen by the active members of r/EthTrader 

The first announcement of community points distribution [can be seen here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/9mk0we/new_donuts_distribution_scheduled_for_20181015/)

Not too long after that, $DONUT evolved beyond being an internet community point on the Reddit platform and became an actual Cryptocurrency existing on the blockchain, approximately 6 years ago! 

**Here we are in 2025**, $DONUT now exists on Ethereum Mainnet, Gnosis network and Arbitrum network, and every 4 weeks, new $DONUT tokens are awarded to reddit users who have registered their EVM wallet address to this sub, via the Arbitrum network, for their participation within this online community.

[The best cake is a DONUT Cake!](https://preview.redd.it/2xfeth0jgqee1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=9faa393d2668f3215f48d8fd6f2b183e72413a63)

To help celebrate this milestone; the Mod team has generously approved a total of 30k DONUTs to be awarded - **10k each to 3 users who provide genuine, insightful feedback regarding the $DONUT token.**

Let's hear the good and the bad, the vision you have for $DONUT, improvements and developments you would like to see, use-cases or perhaps how DONUT has changed your life or behaviors. 

Note: While there is some overlap between $DONUT and r/EthTrader - this contest focusses more about the $DONUT token rather than the subreddit. $DONUT would continue to exist without Reddit afterall.

Users can submit 1 entry.   
  
Entry deadline will be February 1st 12:00am UTC (When the Daily for February 1st is posted)

The Mod team will review the feedback and determine the winners.
