Lessons Learned,DIYaesthetics,1i9kvr6,2025-01-25 06:18:21,31,0.98,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYaesthetics/comments/1i9kvr6/lessons_learned/,xbxrock,Ha Filler ,"Being the we learn from each other, I want to share my experience. 40 y/o male for reference

Last year in the summer I decided to take the plunge to fill my chin. Filled deep with three boluses around 1.5ml total (used a little in surrounding area). I want to mention that I highly discourage this area and surrounding area unless you are very knowledgeable/skilled due to being high risk area. Everything went well, no pain, no VO. Fast forward to November, I really started to notice a central platysma band that was just off... When I moved my head in certain ways, it would almost protrude out, definitely a WTF moment. More than that I noticed a little sensitivity in my chin. 

In December I was getting threads done professionally in my neck to help with laxity and I asked the NP to look at that band area, which was obvious. (Yes I can inject myself, but I freak out with threads lol)... I told her I had done chin filler in the summer without any issues and that was the only thing new. I got the ""aha"" from her. She brings in the ultrasound and looks at my chin. Some of the filler migrated down, infiltrated, and was encapsulating or had encapsulated under the band.

First question she asked was did I put any toxin in my chin beforehand. I had done my DAO but not my chin this time around. Due to those muscles in the chin being pretty active, filler tends to move and migrate quite a bit. Fortunately she was able to dissolve it for me without any issues. I wanted to do it myself but since she already had the ultrasound out, I figured that would be the best option. I really liked my result so I might do it again one of these days.

Key takeaways: Use toxin and allow it to start working in chin before you place filler. Don't be afraid to ask a professional for help or their opinion. Be mindful of your personal anatomy.

I hope this can be helpful for someone in the future 😁 Mistakes made are lessons learned!"
[SPOILERS ALL] Played the whole series and Veilguard was the best,dragonage,1i9ep0b,2025-01-24 23:07:48,0,0.36,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1i9ep0b/spoilers_all_played_the_whole_series_and/,MaximusDM22,Discussion,"I grew up playing DAO and DA2. Thought I would play the series before I played Veilguard and it was a great experience. DAO was a great intro into the world. Got a decent understanding of the blight, the fade, and magic. Just enough to create an intiguing world. The mechanics were fun and character interactions were great. Morrigan was my favorite. 

DA2 expanded on it but it was sort of a side quest that kicked off the next game. It was fun with cool characters, but didnt push the story too far. 

Inquisition was my least favorite. I hated how it felt like a grind to get more power. It felt sort of like an online MMO. It was also a bit buggy with more awkward character interactions. The characters were cool but not really memorable for me. It did expand the lore a lot tho. By the end I figured that the old gods were the ancient elf mages and they were trapped in the black city.   

Then the Veilguard. At first I didnt like it much. The combat was very different, I missed the DAO style combat. But once I got used to it was really good. Sort of similar to God of War type of combat. I was a spellblade and was able to string some cool combos together. I was also iffy on the art style, but after a bit I thought it fit the game really well and liked it. It grew on me. The lore was finally fully fleshed out and uncovered the biggest mysteries of the game. We even finally saw the last parts of Thedas. My favorite part was the seige of weisshaupt. Seeing the horde of blight, legitimately struggling in each stage, and getting through each level by just a thread made for an epic battle. For a couple moments I really thought I wouldnt be able to survive the seige. And the characters! Devon and Lucanis were the best. Felt like they would actually be some cool guys to get to know. Actually felt sad when Devon died at the end. 

Overall the game was really polished. I could tell that they learned from previous games and addressed previous issues. I thought the end wrapped things up well too. Covered all the lore, all the world mysteries, and left Thedas safe mostly. I could see a future game since the Veil is still held up by Solas, but I think one isnt necessary. This game makes a good ending for a great franchise."
Refinement and Use of Love Gu,ReverendInsanity,1i9aufb,2025-01-24 19:44:34,13,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverendInsanity/comments/1i9aufb/refinement_and_use_of_love_gu/,foolishorangutan,Theory,"I hope that my theory here is original and good, I just happened to think about it today. Maybe others have already thought of these things, or I’m just wrong. Please critique it.

I think that Fang Yuan will acquire love gu and refine it. Now, this isn’t just a generic statement of ‘he is a refinement path venerable so he can do what the others couldn’t’, I have specific ideas for how and why.

We know that love gu is capable of fate-like effects.

>Fate Gu said: “Oh human, why can’t you understand? Love is a type of fate, I arranged it to make Verdant Great Sun fall in love with Desolate Ancient Moon, I also arranged it to make the rockman fall in love with Desolate Ancient Moon. I also arranged success and failure in their lives, so they eventually ended up dead.”

-Chapter 1619

>“It says that love is a type of fate, in that case, love can definitely change fate!” Hong Ting said in increasing excitement.

-Chapter 1698

Limitless Demon Venerable says a Dao Guardian is necessary for eternal life, Fang Yuan’s goal, and it seems like Dao Guardians are ordained by fate. Although he says ‘destinies’, destiny gu should not have existed at that time, so I’m inclined to think it is actually fate, although I’m not sure. Maybe there is some profundity here beyond my current comprehension.

>Bright light flashed in Limitless Demon Venerable’s eyes: “Good! You are my Dao Guardian, our destinies are intertwined, according to my deduction, only with the help of the Dao Guardian can a venerable go one step further, to break through the realm of venerable and attain eternal life!”

-Chapter 2208

So, it might be possible to acquire a Dao Guardian by using love gu as a sort of fate. We already know love gu is capable of many things, so this isn’t unbelievable. Of course, the obvious choice for a Dao Guardian is Bai Ning Bing. I don’t think it’s necessary for them to love each other for love gu to make him a Dao Guardian, which is fortunate because love gu can’t force love and Bai Ning Bing is unlikely to feel it naturally. This idea was inspired by u/Valuable-Pride9101, I am sceptical of some of his theories about love gu and otherwise but Bai Ning Bing becoming a Dao Guardian seems like a good one. Of course this is assuming that Bai Ning Bing is not already a Dao Guardian. Maybe the mention of ‘destinies’ is because now that destiny gu exists, Fang Yuan and Bai Ning Bing will automatically become intertwined.

Now, we all know that love gu cannot be refined. However, I do not think that this is a natural state for love gu, and I think its selection requirements might also be unnatural. I think that when love gu was affected by the freedom gu formed by the feathermen in immemorial antiquity, it was altered to be more free-spirited. I think the current love gu is the same one from back then, so the dao marks left by freedom gu are still restricting it. We see that Ren Zu did not seem to meet the requirements that the Spirit Affinity House think love gu has, and after freedom gu targeted it, it left Ren Zu. (Perhaps this was fate’s plan to make it more difficult for love gu to be used against it like Red Lotus did, especially since it says it controlled the freedom of those feathermen. It then resists the self love of Ren Zu’s self gu, maybe this self love was poisoned by the effect of freedom on the love gu it bit. This is very speculative.)

>“Why did it acknowledge me?” Zhao Lian Yun was curious.

>First supreme elder shook her head: “I am not sure. But our sect has concluded two points. Firstly, a person has to believe in love to gain its acknowledgement, this is the foundation. Secondly, someone’s love has to reach an intense level, the greater your love, the higher the chances of gaining love Gu’s acknowledgement.”

>“Is that so?” Zhao Lian Yun blinked as she listened.

>She realized, it was because she loved Ma Hong Yun so deeply, even willing to give up her own life, that love Gu came and acknowledged her.

>Why did this not happen for Feng Jin Huang?

>Because she had no lover.

>Love was not familial affection or friendship.

-Chapter 1230

>Sometimes, love comes to you on its own.

>Love Gu said: “Oh human, I can smell hope and fear from you, as love, they are my food.”

>Ren Zu was overjoyed: “You can take fear away, but hope is mine, I cannot give it to you.”

>Love Gu refused: “Only hope and fear can nourish me together, that is how I survive. Oh human, then I can only stay by your side.”

-Chapter 1175

>The freedom Gu fused together into a gigantic freedom Gu.

>This freedom Gu easily took away Ren Zu’s love Gu.

>“Henceforth, love is free.” This giant freedom Gu said.

>Ren Zu’s self Gu quickly flew out, it wanted to snatch love Gu, but it could not overpower freedom gu, it only managed to take a bite of love gu.

>Self Gu said angrily: “Love, also belongs to oneself!”

-Chapter 1230

(Freedom gu seems to be a profound gu, it seems to be able to interact with fate to some extent, we see this from it affecting love gu, which is a type of fate, and also from when Ren Zu had it in his hands and fainted from the pressure. This is just a side note.)

>In the end, he fainted from the pain.

>After a long time, he slowly woke up.

>Fate Gu’s spider silk was no longer constricting him, responsibility Gu also did not exert heavy pressure, while cognition Gu had disappeared.

>“Wait, what about freedom Gu?” Ren Zu did not sense freedom Gu’s existence, and in his moment of panic, he opened his hands.

>The moment a gap appeared, freedom Gu flew away and left Ren Zu behind.

-Chapter 1954

I think there is another big potential use of love gu beyond just acquiring a Dao Guardian. Love gu can be used to produce hatred gu, when Ren Zu tried to force feathermen to love him it created hatred gu.

>Love Gu sighed: “Oh Ren Zu, forcing others to love is impossible, you will only create hatred.”

>As it said that, a Gu worm appeared before Ren Zu.

>Ren Zu took a look, it was hatred Gu indeed.

-Chapter 1230

Currently, I think hatred gu is inside Qing Chou, who is within Divine Emperor City. However, I think Divine Emperor City will be destroyed during Fang Yuan’s attack, including hatred gu. This will allow Fang Yuan to refine it with the help of love gu. Hatred gu is extremely powerful, it can form a killer move with lightning gu that can destroy one of the immemorial heavens, perhaps by countering heaven path. Fang Yuan already has lightning gu, so if he can acquire hatred gu he can recreate this killer move. Maybe this can be used as the basis of a killer move to directly target heaven’s will itself? Of course, it can probably be used to destroy spectral heaven, though it’s unclear why that would be necessary except that it could disrupt whatever heaven’s will is planning. Maybe it could also be a weapon against Paradise Earth if he revives again as a heaven path venerable. (I have to wonder if Paradise Earth died on purpose to secretly support Fang Yuan by providing food for the sovereign immortal body and other resources while lulling everyone into a false sense of security. Yes, I know this is a bit far-fetched.)

>”According to <<The Legends of Ren Zu>>, hatred Gu and lightning Gu can cooperate and amplify each other’s power to form a terrifying killer move that directly destroyed immemorial blue heaven?”

>Fang Yuan read it carefully again as he wondered, did this mean that these two Gu worms could counter heaven path?

>Where were heaven path dao marks most gathered in?

>Undoubtedly, the immemorial nine heavens.

-Chapter 2022

>This was because this lightning pool’s core was not ordinary, it was a rank eight Immortal Gu that Fang Yuan had — Lightning Gu!

-Chapter 2045

Now, how will Fang Yuan acquire love gu? Well, he is already in Heavenly Court with Zhao Lian Yun. She was thinking in the latest chapter about stealing Ma Hong Yun with love gu from the sovereign immortal aperture. I don’t know what the exact order of events will be, but I think somehow Ma Hong Yun will be revived and love gu will be taken by Fang Yuan (along with Zhao Lian Yun herself maybe, after Fang Yuan offers to revive Ma Hong Yun) or it will be destroyed while Fang Yuan is killing all of Heavenly Court’s gu immortals.

I think love gu being destroyed is key to refining it. Maybe as a refinement path venerable Fang Yuan could just remove the freedom gu’s dao marks (of whatever path, maybe human?), but a way that is more likely to succeed in my view is that they will be removed if it is destroyed, and then it will be recreated elsewhere in the gu world, and Fang Yuan will find it with stealing heavenly secret rank nine killer move, like he did with wisdom gu. I think obtaining love gu after destroying it will be a challenge, since wisdom gu was created in a hard-to-find place I think love gu will also be. However, if heaven’s will realises Fang Yuan is using stealing heavenly secret, or if it just takes extra precautions with love gu, it will place it somewhere that is extremely hard to find. Maybe it will be in Space Cave, or some other place we have not seen like Ordinary Abyss. Actually, since Ordinary Abyss can’t be entered by extraordinary people, it could be a good way of keeping out Fang Yuan and other Venerables and also might be a way to incorporate some weaker characters in the main plot. This would also fit with how wisdom gu was created in a place that Fang Yuan couldn’t enter due to him having too many dao marks.

>This place was very well hidden, unless any Gu Immortal saw it personally, it would be hard to detect.

>[…]

>During the fate war, in order to complete Red Lotus’ plan, wisdom Gu was used as one of the materials.

>As a result, rank nine wisdom Gu ceased to exist.

>But under the laws of the Heavenly Dao, life and death coexisted. Under the control of heaven’s will, a wild rank six wisdom Gu soon appeared in the five regions.

>This wisdom Gu was hidden within the air bubble.

>After Fang Yuan stole heavenly secrets, he found the location of many wild Immortal Gu, among them, wisdom Gu was his greatest gain.

>[…]

>As for Fang Yuan, he had too many dao marks, if he stretched his hand into the air bubble, it would likely burst.

>Thus, only his clone could accomplish this.

-Chapter 2292

>”It is no use.” Self Gu said: “Your accomplishment tree, even if it has fallen, is proof of your grandeur. A grand person is extraordinary, how can a person who is not ordinary enter ordinary abyss?”

-Chapter 807

Well, this is my theory. As I said, I welcome critique. Please point out any flaws."

Daoist Gu> The Ubermench. Fang Yuan as the inversion of Nietzsche,ReverendInsanity,1i8xvmh,2025-01-24 10:24:41,41,0.88,34,https://i.redd.it/garcra19myee1.jpeg,Tungstenerian_,Discussion,"Note this is an extremely long and exhaustive text. It took me about 2 months to complete my thoughts on this topic and alot of headaches. I hope you enjoy friends. Any feedback or critisms is welcome as I want to refine my ideas and feedback is the best for that.



Fang Yuan’s character is deeply grounded in Eastern philosophical traditions, as acknowledged even by Gu Zhen Ren himself. The ""three ways""—Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism—form the philosophical and metaphysical backbone of Fang Yuan's world. In a previous analysis, I explored how Fang Yuan could be interpreted as a twisted Daoist monk, subverting core principles of these systems to achieve his goals. However, this discussion extends beyond Eastern traditions. I will argue that Fang Yuan also aligns, perhaps equally, with aspects of Western philosophy, specifically Nietzschean thought.

I also preface this by saying, I am not a Nietzschean Scholar, and by no means an expert on Nietzsche. I did read most of his books and his biography ""I Am Dynamite!"" By Sue Prideaux. With that said, Nietzsche was purposefully vague about his philosophy, he even said this: 


Friedrich Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil, Aphorism 290, reads as follows:

""One no longer loves one’s insight enough when one communicates it. A thinker who wants to communicate his thoughts has already lowered himself to the level of a writer. To the extent that he is a writer, he becomes common. Only the thinker who finds it necessary to conceal himself is of any consequence. Even the bravest among us rarely has the courage for what he really knows. And we philosophers are more afraid of being understood than of being misunderstood.""

So will I get things wrong? Most certainly especially given the fact that even Nietzschean scholars themselves have very diffrent interpretations of him. These differences can be small but they can be big I will even detail some here. 

The point then is to make this post with my undertanding of Nietzsche and contextualize Fang Yuan within the that framework.

Another important aspect is to  acknowledge the role of reader interpretation. Readers often identify themes and ideas that may not have been intentionally embedded by the author. While this is a valid consideration, dismissing an argument solely because it may not align with authorial intent is a flawed approach. This dismissal constitutes the genetic fallacy, which occurs when an argument is rejected based on its origins rather than its merit.

As defined, the genetic fallacy is:
""A logical fallacy that occurs when someone rejects an argument based on its origins or history. It's also known as a fallacy of relevance or a red herring fallacy.""

To be clear, I do not claim to present an absolute truth. Instead, I offer an argument that leads to a specific interpretation of Fang Yuan’s character. If the premises of my argument fail or the conclusion does not logically follow, I will concede. However, if the argument holds, then its validity is independent of its origins.

One of the most recurring questions among fans—both Western and Eastern—is how Fang Yuan aligns with Nietzschean philosophy.


We will start with ""three stages of life"" according to Nietzsche, the Camel, the Lion, and the Child. These stages represent Nietzsche's framework for existential growth

and value creation.

Nietzsche’s Three Stages of Life

• The Camel Stage
The Camel symbolizes submission to external values and traditions. Individuals in this stage accept societal burdens and moral obligations, often perceiving them as forms of discipline or strength. However, this stage is ultimately characterized by a lack of autonomy, as individuals act out of duty rather than self-determined purpose. This stage is often called ""Tho shalt"". It's a commandment from your society, your family, your religious group exct. 

• The Lion Stage
The Lion represents rebellion and self-assertion, rejecting imposed values and asserting independence through Nietzsche's ""sacred No."" While this stage dismantles external authority, it remains reactive, defined by negation rather than the creation of new meaning. In other words it is an insecurity on the part of the lion. He doesn't exist independent of the system, no rather he is defined by whatever is the opposite of the system or the dragon. The lion exists in opposition the Dragon. The lion fights against this dragon.

In Nietzsche’s Thus Spoke Zarathustra, the dragon represents the oppressive weight of external authority, tradition, and morality—the ""Thou Shalt."" It is described as a great beast covered in shimmering scales, great and golden  with each scale inscribed with a commandment or rule that says ""Thou Shalt."" It is the the collective weight of meaning, of thouands of years of human moral and ethical practices  The dragon is the embodiment of all the values, norms, and ideologies that humanity has accumulated over time. It demands obedience and submission, presenting itself as the ultimate authority, claiming, ""All value is already created.""

The lion stage is thus a rejection in the simple words, I will, as in I personally reject you and your values. 

• The Child Stage
The Child embodies creative freedom, moving beyond both submission and rebellion. Representing innocence, playfulness, and self-directed value creation, the Child affirms life without resentment or reliance on external frameworks. This is the stage of amor fati, the love of one’s fate, and the creation of meaning from within.

Fang Yuan and Nietzsche’s ""Stages of Life""

The Camel Stage
Fang Yuan begins his journey burdened by societal expectations, both on Earth and in the Gu world. His upbringing in a hierarchical clan system mirrors the Camel stage: he strives to gain respect and status within established frameworks. However, the clan ultimately ostracizes him when they realize he cannot be exploited for their benefit. This rejection disillusions Fang Yuan, planting the seeds of rebellion that mark his transition to the Lion stage.

The Lion Stage
In the Lion stage, Fang Yuan rejects societal values and hierarchies, embracing the ""demonic path"" of individual power. His rebellion is not immediate but gradual. Initially, even as an outcast, he attempts to work within the clan's norms, such as through trade. However, key events, such as the attack on his caravan and the death of a close relative, solidify his disillusionment. Fang Yuan comes to view societal values as tools to perpetuate elite power structures. This realization shifts him toward a self-directed value system, further distancing him from the Camel’s sense of duty.

Now the child phase is a bit more complicated and multifaceted, and honestly this was one of the things I struggled most with in my research, as I held the Dr. Paul S  interpretation before I did my research so linking Fang Yuan to the interpretation of Schacht was some research that hurt my brain and presenting it in a digestible form was also kinda hard and I might not have succeeded idk you tell me 😅

The Child Stage represents a state of creative freedom and self-directed value creation, transcending the stages of submission and rebellion. It embodies innocence, playfulness, and the capacity to affirm life without resentment or reliance on external frameworks. In Nietzschean terms, the Child embodies amor fati—the love of one’s fate—by finding meaning internally rather than seeking it in imposed structures or negating them entirely.

Interpretations of the Child Stage

Dr. Richard Schacht interprets the child as a symbol of psychological freedom, where one creates values anew without entirely rejecting ontological truths. This stage transcends the Camel, which passively bears the burden of tradition, and the Lion, which rebels against it. Instead, the child operates from a state of innocence, spontaneity, and joyous creativity. Schacht emphasizes that this affirmation of life arises from personal, experiential realizations rather than external duty or reactionary negation. The child symbolizes a state where meaning is shaped through one’s vision, free from societal norms or metaphysical constraints.

In contrast, Dr. Paul S. Loeb views the child as embodying radical freedom, rejecting all moral or ontological frameworks entirely. For Loeb, the child signifies complete autonomy and liberation, existing beyond any constraints, even self-imposed ones. However, this interpretation risks portraying the child as untethered from any coherent foundation for value creation, potentially missing the deliberate nature of creative affirmation that Nietzsche emphasizes.

In the end I think an argument can easily be made that Fang Yuan actually represent both of these interpretations in diffrent ways but that would be to long.







In the Camel phase, Fang Yuan begins as a character burdened by the weight of societal expectations, shaped by his upbringing in two distinct worlds. Coming from Earth—likely China—he inherits cultural norms and social obligations that emphasize hierarchy and collective benefit. Upon entering the Gu World, he encounters a parallel set of societal structures, characterized by their own hierarchies and moral codes. Early in this phase, Fang Yuan seeks to gain respect and social standing within these established frameworks. However, his efforts are ultimately undermined when his clan determines that he cannot be exploited to advance their interests within the hierarchy. This rejection and ostracization mark the beginning of his disillusionment and initiate his gradual transition to the Lion phase.

In the Lion phase, Fang Yuan starts to reject societal expectations and norms. Initially, despite being cast out by his clan, he continues to operate within the system to some extent, choosing to engage in trade. While this decision distances him from the clan, it still aligns with their broader hierarchical framework, albeit as an outcast. The death of chad uncle big beard  when his caravan is attacked futher reinforces the Gu World's harsh reality,  individual power supersedes organized hierarchy. This realization accelerates Fang Yuan's shift into the Lion phase, where he begins to openly reject the values and structures of his society. Ofcource also where his idea of perseverance begins.

Over time, his experiences with the entrenched interests of societal elites deepen his disillusionment. He comes to understand that moral frameworks are not universal or impartial but serve to uphold hierarchies that benefit a select few. This awareness drives him further away from the Camel’s sense of duty and toward the development of a self-directed value system. Ultimately, Fang Yuan embraces the ""demonic path,"" signifying his full rejection of conventional morality and his movement toward the Child phase. 

I wish we could have seen more of his first life as this is where the gap is. We know he was already 300 in his first  and still not exacly on the demonic path when he met his lover. What exacly made him tip over to the next stage? 

It is it seems concensus on the Chinese side of the fandom I have interacted with, that writing RI was insanely difficult, but if Gu Zhenren was to write Fang Yuans first life, it would be an even bigger and more difficult undertaking. I would honestly agree...

However here is where the inversion starts, this is the point that I have been building up to. 


Rather than outright rejecting the ""golden dragon"" of cultural inheritance—an awe-inspiring embodiment of Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism, radiating luminous grandeur and sacred authority —Fang Yuan infiltrates and subverts it. This dragon, once a symbol of harmony, wisdom, and transcendence, and ultimately human moral progress and enlightened is corrupted from within, its brilliance hollowed out and transformed into a necrotic, rotting form. We know he does this through the idea that his views of the three temples are fundamentally wrong. 

After this,

Fang Yuan as the Eternal Child

Fang Yuan embodies elements of the eternal child in a way that aligns more closely with Schacht’s interpretation, though with critical nuances. The reason is that Schachts interpretation leaves room for the Child to choose if he wants to accept a metaphysical truth or not, not out of being forced or manipulated, but out of self choosing.


Fang Yuan operates within the metaphysical frameworks of Daoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism, but rather than rejecting these systems outright, he subverts and transforms their principles to serve his own ends. Thus Fang Yuan as you can see, is more in line with this interpretation. He chose this interpretation of the three temples, he came to these conclusions himself.


Fang Yuan’s characterization can be understood as a synthesis of two key philosophical tendencies. For him, permanence is the sole attribute of true value, linking him inexorably to the Great Dao—the only entity within the Gu World that possesses this quality. The Great Dao is invincible and immutable, embodying the very traits that both Fang Yuan and Limitless seek to emulate in their own existence. Limitless and Fang Yuan, as characters, can be interpreted as striving to align their ontological nature with the properties of the Great Dao.



In a Western framework, this parallels the Christian aspiration to reflect God’s nature through personal transformation. A believer seeks to emulate divine attributes in daily actions until their essence mirrors that of God. Similarly, Fang Yuan and Limitless aim to align themselves with the Great Dao, albeit through divergent approaches. While this pursuit is universal among Gu Masters and Gu Immortals, Fang Yuan stands apart in his singular focus. He fixates exclusively on the permanence of the Great Dao, disregarding lesser Daos and other attributes. Limitless, by contrast, represents the extreme version of the average Gu Immortal, obsessively pursuing all aspects of the Great Dao and valuing every fragment of insight with equal intensity.

Fang Yuan's rejection of this comprehensive approach further distinguishes him. Limitless’s preoccupation with eternal life, for instance, is less about becoming a mirror of the Great Dao in its entirety and more about his fixation on permanence as its most profound characteristic. This selective prioritization underscores a fundamental divergence in their philosophies, revealing the quitisentual diffrence between Limitless and  Fang Yuan’s.

Having established he became an ""eternal child"" the diffrence becomes bigger between what Nietzsche describes and what Fang Yuan actually is. Instead of representing an eternal ""yes"" in a playful and innocent sense—where one is divorced from dogma and embraces their humanity—he is to be seen as some sort of insane child. He indeed embodies the ""eternal yes"" to his character, yet, if you allow for further symbolism, he is on the back of the necrotic, poisoned dragon, proclaiming an eternal ""yes.""

How do I justify this horrific symbolism?

It ties directly to what it means to be Gu Zhenren. Remember that Reverend Insanity in Chinese is also Gu Zhenren, the author’s pen name.

The concept of Gu in Chinese mythology, central to Reverend Insanity, holds layered symbolic significance. Historically, Gu refers to an ancient poison, often depicted as a malevolent force created by sealing venomous creatures together until one survives by consuming the others. Even today some Chinese fans that I talked to say it's a sensitive topic that not everyone will be comfortable talking about so again, it's seen as dark and evil. It represents corruption, decay, and the harnessing of destructive forces. In Reverend Insanity, this symbolism is not just metaphorical but foundational to the novel’s exploration of morality, transcendence, and the philosophy of power. Think about it: the strongest wins in the Gu world. It’s about survival and outplaying others. The only difference is that, instead of there being a strongest Gu (in the ancient Chinese understanding of the concept), there is a strongest Gu Master.

What is the strongest Gu Master? Based on everything said here, and within the novel itself, the strongest Gu Master is the one who ""poisons"" the most—the one who steals, lies, cheats, and ultimately kills the most or does so the most efficiently. The idea that this sort of world is inherently toxic or poisonous is made abundantly clear.

Fang Yuan embodies the “Gu Zhenren.” The term Zhen Ren in Daoist philosophy denotes an enlightened or “true person,” someone who has achieved harmony with the Dao—the ultimate, unchanging principle underlying the universe. A Zhen Ren is traditionally associated with spiritual unity, balance, and the pursuit of universal truth.

This is where a critical intersection emerges. The reason the author continuously explains and emphasizes Fang Yuan’s 500 years of life experience is that, in Chinese culture, it lends believability and fits the narrative. Chinese fans have explained that they didn’t understand the humor non-Chinese readers found in repeatedly referencing the 500 years of experience. Instead, it serves to reinforce that, yes, this person is a Zhen Ren—he is genuinely enlightened. He is in their view ""divine"" in this sense or has a nature of being ""divine"".

However, Fang Yuan subverts this ideal as established before.. The addition of Gu transforms the title into ""Poisonous Enlightened One,"" encapsulating a figure who achieves transcendence not through harmony but through corruption and destruction. At this point, we see how this plays out both in the story and the meta-story.

In my interpretation, this is the most horrifying aspect of Fang Yuan. This is why he is an ACTUAL villain. He cannot be bribed to go against his goal, he cannot be seduced, and he cannot be reasoned with. This unreasonable person goes on to overthrow all human values and common sense, using them against civilization itself.

It’s one thing to have a villain who is outright evil, who doesn’t believe in good or evil, or simply doesn’t care. But it’s another to have someone like Fang Yuan—someone who takes everything you value, everything you believe to be right or wrong, and throws it back in your face. Not through argumentation, but by killing you, all while adhering to the principles you believed were just and good.

Again the diffrence between the two embodiments of the ""eternal child"" is where the diffrences between the Daoist Gu/Gu Zhenren and the Ubermench begins to also show. The ""eternal child"" is supposed to eventually grow into the Ubermench under many interpretations if not most...


Daoist Gu vs. the Übermensch

In this section, I will explain the qualities of the Übermensch, discuss what some Nietzschean scholars have to say about these qualities, and step by step, show you why the Daoist Gu surpasses this concept.


---

1. The Will to Power

Nietzsche’s Perspective:
For Nietzsche, the will to power is the driving force behind all life. It’s not merely the desire for domination but a creative force that allows individuals to shape their lives, master themselves, and create new values. Nietzsche saw this as a rejection of passive existence—a dynamic energy that fuels human growth and transformation. Scholar Bernard Reginster argues that the will to power is about overcoming resistance and adversity, transforming challenges into opportunities for creativity and growth. To elaborate further, Robert C. Solomon emphasizes its role as a fundamental life-affirming energy, encouraging individuals to transcend limitations

2. Self-Overcoming

Nietzsche’s Perspective:
Self-overcoming is the process of transcending one’s limitations, weaknesses, and contradictions. It is a perpetual act of growth, where individuals confront their own vulnerabilities and refine themselves into stronger, more autonomous beings. Nietzsche saw this as essential for becoming the Übermensch.

Scholars like Julian Young note that self-overcoming is not about achieving perfection but embracing the continual process of self-improvement and transformation. Walter Kaufmann highlights that self-overcoming requires honesty with oneself and a willingness to confront uncomfortable truths.



3. Embracing Fate (Amor Fati)

Nietzsche’s Perspective:
Amor fati is the ultimate affirmation of life. It involves loving one’s fate and accepting the world as it is, including its suffering, chaos, and imperfection. For Nietzsche, this is the hallmark of the Übermensch: the ability to say ""yes"" to life in all its forms without resentment or denial.

Scholar Robert C. Solomon interprets amor fati as a radical acceptance of life’s totality, where suffering and joy are equally essential. Bernard Reginster sees it as the antidote to nihilism, transforming suffering into an opportunity for growth and affirmation.


What I described so far sounds literally like Fang Yuan. Instead of explaining how he embodies these values in a direct way again, I’ll showcase three passages from Reverend Insanity that illustrate why Fang Yuan is the absolute embodiment of these principles.



Will to Power

This one is relatively easy to demonstrate:

""Fang Yuan was hard on others but even more ruthless on himself.""




This alone captures the essence of Nietzsche’s will to power. Fang Yuan constantly transforms challenges into opportunities and rejects a comforting, passive life.

For a more detailed example:

""You are old. Uncle. Your great ambitions and
aspirations have already disappeared from
your youth. These years, you have lived an
easy life and it has corrupted your heart.
You are vying for the family assets, not for
cultivation but to maintain your rich life.
With such a mentality, how could you
obstruct me?""


FANG YUAN'S CONFRONTATION WITH HIS
UNCLE ABOUT THE FAMILY INHERITANCE -
CH. 101

It’s even stated somewhere—though I don’t have the quote written down—that Fang Yuan is addicted to the feeling of overcoming adversity.








Now 
Self overcoming:

""How difficult is the perseverance of one person?

*I know you know that I know the tik tok music is kicking in at this point 😭😂*

I had once screamed, gradually, I lost my voice.

I had once cried, gradually, I lost my tears.

I had once grieved, gradually, I became able to withstand everything.

I had once rejoiced, gradually, I became unmoved by the world.

And now!

All I have left is an expressionless face, my gaze is as tough as a monolith, only perseverance remains in my heart. This is my own, an insignificant character, Fang Yuan’s — Perseverance!

Fang Yuan’s Perseverance- ch. 1285

Moving on....


Amor Fati—affirmation of life, accepting one's humanity fully in all its aspects:

""I lived my own life according to my own feelings, and even if the waves toss me up and down, sending me to the brink of death, I will never grieve, lament, fear, or worry. I will savor all these flavors thoroughly, and I will keep laughing crazily until the end."" – Fang Yuan

Or:

""Even if I fail in the end and obtain nothing, even if my life is a complete failure—so what?

Even if the five regional walls disappear in the future—so what?

Even if my research is meaningless—so what?

That is what I want to do!

You can call me crazy, you can call me an idiot, you can call me stubborn, you can call me stupid.

Alright.

I am crazy, I am an idiot, I am stubborn, and I am stupid.

But I… still want to do it regardless!

That is how I want to live!

That is how I can find meaning in my life!""

Or:

He had already done everything he could.

""If a chance were given to me again, I would still choose to live this way. Hehehe, so be it. My story as a Gu Immortal shall end here. Although I did not leave behind any biography or inheritance... it doesn't matter.""

Fang Yuan's will was quickly dissipating.

He was tranquil, even feeling happy in a way.

If he still had a face, the corners of his lips would probably curl up into a smile right now.

Dying while pursuing one's goal—what regrets could he have?



Now, after quoting some of the hardest lines in Reverend Insanity, why am I saying Fang Yuan is a subversion of the Übermensch when it seems he embodies it fully?

On the surface, Fang Yuan appears to embody the concept of the Übermensch with his ruthless drive, self-determination, and rejection of external morality. This is the exact same as it was with his inversion of Daoism. He follows all the steps, the entire program, only to twist it in the conclusion. To be fair, the signs started with the ""eternal child"" phase.


The quintessential difference lies in the way Fang Yuan interacts with fate and the world itself.

The Übermensch accepts fate and all aspects of life as they are—amor fati— this is a way to escape nihlism according to Nietzsche. An existentialist solution that I will discuss a bit later, whereas Fang Yuan accepts only his efforts and the fate he carves for himself. He does not accept the world as it is, he accepts its harsh rules and the way things are, but only in so far as he struggles against them, if he fights at his best and loses, he will accept it, but he isn't content in just accepting the world without a fight.  He does not accept fate; in fact, he rejects it so vehemently that he destroys Fate Gu. Fang Yuan utterly rejects the imperfection of life and the temporary nature of his own humanity (this part is also very important in the later section)

Ultimately, Fang Yuan accepts only the destiny he creates, not any external or imposed fate. This distinction sets him apart from Nietzsche’s concept of the Übermensch.


On Nietzsche and His Philosophy

Many people mistakenly view Nietzsche as an ""edgy"" philosopher who rejected morality and ethics altogether. This is a shallow and incorrect interpretation. In fact, Nietzsche rejected such a view so strongly that during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, he volunteered for the Red Cross instead of enlisting as a soldier, disgusted by the idea of war and mass death—actively going against the indoctrination of his school days in a Prussian imperial school. Infact he went to such lengths as to renounce his Prussian citizenship in protest and went on to be a professor at the University of Basel in Switzerland.

Nietzsche was deeply critical of the cultural and philosophical constraints imposed by Christianity and what he perceived as derivative philosophies like Kantianism, which he saw as shackling the human spirit. However, he did not deny the value of human life or endorse amorality.

If Nietzsche were to encounter Fang Yuan, he would likely be horrified. Nietzsche once pondered what someone would look like if they were entirely unshackled by Western philosophical and religious traditions—someone psychologically and ideologically detached from millennia of human morals and values.

Gu Zhenren gave us an answer in Reverend Insanity. Fang Yuan embodies this concept, not through the lens of Platonic-Augustinian Western thought but within the framework of the Three Temples. Fang Yuan is Nietzsche's hypothetical detached individual, yet not in a way Nietzsche would admire at all.

Nietzsche also did not invent nihilism, nor did he advocate for it. His entire life's work was dedicated to finding a way to overcome nihilism.

The ""death of God"" created a void of meaning in Western culture, according to Nietzsche, because, for millennia, God was seen as the foundation of morality, metaphysics, and truth. God was viewed as the Platonic form of the Good itself—the Logos and the backbone of all values. Nietzsche foresaw a crisis of meaning as the Church’s influence waned.

This brings us to Nietzsche's famous quote:

""God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?""

In this context, the Übermensch is Nietzsche’s proposed solution to the void left by God’s death: to embrace life fully, create one’s own values, and find meaning through amor fati—accepting one’s fate and the way of the world, worshiping the Earth as it is, without restraint.


---

Fang Yuan and Nihilism

There are many forms of nihilism, but the two most relevant here are:

1. Existential Nihilism: The belief that life has no inherent meaning, purpose, or value. This often arises from the perception of a lack in the world’s ontology—a void of inherent meaning, whether due to the absence of God, Platonic Forms, or another metaphysical foundation like the Great Dao.


2. Moral Nihilism: The rejection of objective morality or ethical truths—the belief that good and evil are subjective constructs without universal validity.



Traditionally, there are four options to overcome nihilism:

1. Self-destruction


2. Existentialism


3. Absurdism


4. Kierkegaard-style faith (a ""leap of faith,"" technically existentialist but theistic in nature, so I see it as distinct).



But what does Fang Yuan do?

Fang Yuan takes a fifth path, because his nihilism does not stem from an inherent lack in the world. Fang Yuan doesn’t believe the world itself is missing something, thus making it meaningless. In fact, he enjoys things, sees beauty in the world, and engages with it fully.

It’s also clear that he isn’t a moral nihilist. Fang Yuan makes claims about right and wrong all the time, and he believes these claims hold actual validity. When he critiques people’s actions, for example, he doesn’t think, “Well, this is just my opinion.” Instead, he makes judgments with absolute conviction. For instance, he considers those who are content to be indoctrinated as ""restrained dogs.""

The perfect quote to illustrate his mindset is:

""There is only immortality. Only eternal life should be the goal one should pursue! If one cannot live forever, is there any difference between a rank nine Gu Immortal and a pile of shit in the gutter?! I am a huge fool, but I do not wish to be a fool that is made of shit... But if I cannot obtain immortality, I am also a pile of shit in the gutter… hehehe.""

-ch. 464


Another great one would be:

Only eternal life, this majestic and unattainable target, could make the journey of his life become more interesting.

This was the meaning he gave to this life! Pursuing eternal life did not mean he was afraid of death or afraid of failure. He calmly accepted death and failure. Whether eternal life existed or not, there was no evidence to prove it. But even if it did not exist, so what? Fang Yuan enjoyed the process. In the process of pursuing eternal life, he found his meaning and felt that this life was quite interesting. The lowly lust and desires of his body, satisfaction of love and hatred, he was already tired of them.

Only eternal life was worthy of being his target to pursue.
Fang Yuan's philosophy - ch. 567

Now the concept of, this is the meaning he gave to this life you might think goes against the idea that he is not an existentialist, but it actually strengthens my case and it will be shown soon.



He genuinely believes this—not as an opinion, but as an absolute truth. He is a moral naturalist. This interpretation is infact required to view him as an inverse of the three temples to begin with.

So, Fang Yuan doesn’t think the world is inherently lacking, nor is he a moral nihilist. Instead, his situation is more akin to a unique form of nihilism—what I would call human nihilism. Anything transient is worthless; therefore, the medium through which he experiences reality—his humanity—is what makes reality itself worthless to him.

With that context, what is his solution? He decides to confront the problem head-on. He seeks to challenge it, ultimately aiming to change his very ontological nature to one of permanence. He seeks eternal life.

That is actually insane! Think about what that entails. If humans in our world, faced with nihilism, took this approach, they would likely create whatever they think is missing to give reality meaning—like a Platonic concept or a God. That’s exactly what Fang Yuan is doing. It’s mind-blowing. This is why he isn't an existentialist, because he is making the subjective meaning into actual ontological truth. If he attains eternal life, it would be a complete cure for his ""human nihlism"" thus why he says if he doesn't succeed he would be dogshit aswell.



To be more informal and level with you guys—don’t you think that’s pure aura? Fang Yuan  operates on the level of the actual Übermensch as a concept. He stands in opposition to it and, in the end, would most likely view the Übermensch as just more dogshit. Like, bruv!

Thank you for reading through all this rambling friends. I hope you enjoyed 🙏

So I thought I’d do a deep dive into research for something expensive and long lasting, which is when I found this sub. That was the beginning of the end - since then I think I’ve tried about 20 different fragrance samples. But after trying them all, I don’t really feel much closer to finding ‘the one’. But I have learnt a lot about what I really don’t like… 

What I don’t like (sorry in advance for any offence this might cause) are pretty much all the top recommended fragrances for men. **Bleu de Chanel, Chanel Platinum Egoiste, Dior Homme, Dior Elixir and Eau Sauvage Parfum**… while I can acknowledge they’re all different, and I quite like the ‘dry down’ of some of these scents (a new word I’ve learnt!), I find that on first spray they all smell a bit like teenage boys and locker rooms. **Bleu de Chanel** smells straight up like cheap men’s shower gel before the much much nicer dry down. What is this smell I dislike so much and how do I know what fragrances have the same notes? 

The fragrances I have liked don’t seem to share much in common, and they’ve all got some negatives about them. But currently at the top of my list are:

* **Le Labo Another 13**: clearly very synthetic but when I wear this I can’t stop smelling myself. Makes me feel like a junkie. Equally, it’s kind of boring. 
* **Le Labo Santal 33**: loved this at first but dislike it more and more with each wear. Don’t get the pickles note everyone else gets but definitely get something odd/sharp and a bit nauseating. 
* **MFK Grand Soir**: probably one of my favourites but not a fan of the vanilla.
* **Serge Lutens Ambre Sultan**: doesn’t have the vanilla of Grand Soir but is lacking something else Grand Soir has that makes it more complex.
* **Diptyque Philosykos**: A fragrance I actually had years ago and loved. Still love it now. Unfortunately was ruined by someone else wearing it that myself and my GF associate it too much with :(
* **Le Labo The Noir**: Also really like this but it’s a bit too womanly I feel. 



So clearly I’m into the more unisex and I’m into some ambers. But beyond that, I’ve got no idea. The following fragrances I’m filing under ‘meh’:

* **Frederic Malle Musc Ravageur** 
* **Terre d’hermes**
* **Jazz club**
* **Serge lutens santal majiscule**
* **Diptyque Tam Dao** 
* **Encre noir**
* **Moustache Eau de Parfum Rochas**
* **Le Labo Matcha 26**



Anyone able to help a brother out? I’m losing my mind here as well as my sense of smell. "

Objective:
Convince a girl in NYC that you're a mystical Chinese Daoist on a karmic journey who needs her help to ""restore the balance of the cosmos"" by joining you for an epic (and steamy) sword ride. 

And it's gonna be **LEGEN-----** wait for it-
---

## Step 1: The Setup ##



**Wardrobe:**

- Flowing robes that scream ancient wisdom.

- Fake jade pendant, bamboo hat, and kung fu slippers (bonus points for authenticity).


**Props:**

- A prop sword (foam or wooden — safety first!). Engrave random Chinese characters (they don’t need to make sense).



- A pouch of “dragon breath beads” (just candy).


**Research:**

Memorize vague Daoist sayings like:

“The river flows, but the fish chooses the stream.”

“Only those who balance the yin can embrace the yang.”

--

## Step 2: The Encounter ##



Find yourself a busy spot in NYC — Times Square, Central Park, or outside a bubble tea shop.

Pretend to meditate dramatically with the sword across your lap.

Wait for your target to walk by, then dramatically ""sense"" her energy. Whip your head up and gasp:


> *“It’s you! The chosen one!”*

---

## Step 3: The Prophecy ##


Approach her with a mix of awe and urgency.

Explain that you’ve been on a 1,000-year journey to find the Reincarnated Jade Phoenix (which is her, obviously) to complete the Cycle of the Eternal Sword.


> You: “Your aura… it radiates the karmic glow of the Jade Phoenix. Do you feel it? The weight of destiny calling to you?”
Her: ""What?""
You: “Don’t fight it. The Dao flows through you. I must guide you through the *ritual of the Blade Dance* to restore cosmic harmony!”

---


## Step 4: The Sword Demonstration ##



Show off some ridiculous sword moves — a mix of kung fu movie clichés and whatever you vaguely remember from “The Karate Kid.”

End with a dramatic bow and declare:


> You: “The sword has chosen you, Jade Phoenix. Ride with me on this karmic journey!”

If she’s skeptical:

> You: “Doubt is the greatest enemy of balance. Trust the Dao, for it has brought us together.”

---

## Step 5: The Close ##


Hand her *your* sword and ask her to *“feel the weight of her destiny.”* 

Use this opportunity to *guide her hands on the sword* (this is where the sparks start to fly). 

Tell her that only together can you *“ride the sword into the celestial heavens and restore balance.”*


> You: “Are you ready to embrace your cosmic purpose, Jade Phoenix?”
Her: (If she says yes) “The Dao smiles upon us both!” 😉


Cue the sexy sword ride into the karmic sunset.


---

Notes:

If she’s not buying it, pull a “You’ve passed the test!” and invite her for drinks to ""continue your mystical teachings.""

The key is commitment. Stick to the bit like Barney Stinson — confidence, absurdity, and charisma make the play legendary.

---

Final Daoist Advice:

> “The path to the ultimate sword ride begins with one ridiculous lie.”

The will of the ancient universe is beyond the multiverse itself as it preceds everything, beginning and nothing. But Wang Ling existence which considered as a variable or anomaly to even the Supreme Gods and the Will of the ancient universe itself which means Wang Ling dimension or rather cultivation realm is beyond even the Will of The ancient universe itself that created the Outer Gods. Each of the universe contains smaller worlds (Smaller Universes/Lower Dimensions worlds) and the 9 Universe aka the whole multiverse is the highest universe with Earth aka the Earth Universe being the lowest but with Wang Ling help and upgrade it becomes the strongest since Wang Ling realm is beyond/above all the higher-dimensions as well as the multiverse too (Beyond-Dimensional Existence).

This basically means the True Creator of the Multiverse isn't Wang Daozu but Beyond-Dimensional Will of the Universe/Multiverse. They/It's are/is basically like Akasha from Nasuverse. As for the Will of the Earth or other Will that doesn't creates the Outer Gods, Old Ones, Dragon Gods, Eternal Gods, they scales lower than the Ancient Will that creates those eldritch and cosmic-beings. We could say they are either boundless concepts/entities or semi-boundless (High 1-A+). Perhaps they are Monad of the entire verse.

So, we could assume there's Monadism God which is Ancient Will of the Universe and Will of the Universes. This means there's pre-established harmony. What does it means? In the doctrine of the Pre-Established Harmony **God is not acting permanently in the world**.

1. **1.** [The philosophy](https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/word/%E5%93%B2%E5%AD%A6/) of [Leibniz](https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/word/person/%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%97%E3%83%8B%E3%83%83%E3%83%84/#jn-229047) , [which states that ](https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/word/%E5%AD%A6%E8%AA%AC/)[the universe](https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/word/%E5%AE%87%E5%AE%99/) is made up of independent monads, and that the reason [the universe](https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/word/%E5%AE%87%E5%AE%99/) is in a unified order is because God has predestined a harmonious relationship to arise between the monads

This proves why the Ancient Will of the Universe and the Will of The Universe (Including Earth Universe) never fought with each others as they are all Monads just has different rank with the Ancient/Primordial Will of the Universe. I mean there's no reason to fight a fellow boundless concept/entity right? When it's more entertaining to watch others fight but it seems the Will of the Universes especially Earth Universe has grown too weak to be labeled as a Monandism God that's why i deem them as Lower-Monad God as Will of the Universe especially the Earth Universe who was supposed to be the weakest one originally is still the weakest until now because Wang Ling never upgraded the Will of the Universe directly, he only upgraded the Earth civilization and cultivation system and the durability of the Earth and the Earth Universe but not the Monad itself aka Will of the Earth Universe. This explains why and how such a Monad God figure like Earth Universe cannot handle Wang Ling attacks since the Earth Universe Monad is the weakest and lowest out of all other Monads. It seems there's only a few Monads as Ancient Will of the Universe created half or more than half of the Main Universes/Multiverse. The Earth Monad is the second that we know and the rest is nameless and mostly unknown.

So, they are all more like a one-time action Monad God that only creates everything and then will never appear again but this seems doesn't apply to Will of the Universe as they sometimes appear whenever Wang Ling fights due to his power is immeasurably too strong than their own Lower-Monadism God existence aka Will of the Universe but the Ancient Will of the Universe never had this problem as it is the true Monadism God of the verse.

Similar to Akasha>Alaya & Gaia concept of Nasuverse just there are more than one.

The tiering table of the Will of the Universe/Multiverse would be like this:

Will of the Ancient Universe>Will of the Universes

 Eternal Civilization Stage: The most famous is the era of the Four Great Emperors, in which the Eastern Emperor uses a diary trap to summon the protagonist and some of his companions to travel through time and space to overcome difficulties.

Wang Daozu, the strongest of the Eternal Civilization, relied on his powerful strength to create the Divine Realm and Earth as the new home for humans after the destruction of the Eternal Civilization . He also created the Way of Heaven. The cause of the destruction of civilization is unknown, and it is likely related to Daozu destroying the Eternal Civilizations due to his strength above the other Eternal Civilizations members. 

The Eternal Civilization was not completely destroyed. Many powerful people left their own civilizations, mostly in the configuration of God's Domain-Earth. Many modern civilizations came from this, such as the Shinto Star.

Due to its isolation from the outside world, the Divine Realm gradually fell into disrepair. Wang Daozu's direct family was in the Divine Realm.

Earth civilization has gone through many eras, such as the classical era, the technological era , the great fighting era, and the current scientific cultivation era. The protagonist took the lead in opening up the revival of spiritual energy, the peace between humans and demons, and the connection with both the universe and the multiverse.

There are other ways besides the Way of Heaven. Some are stronger than the Way of Heaven, but none of them have the power to directly confront the Way of Heaven except Wang Ling.

Heavenly Dao is not very important in the Immortal King world, and can only control cultivators below Dao God, because those above Dao God cannot defeat them, literally. However, cultivators of the Earth-God Realm system all follow the path of comprehending the Heavenly Dao, and are unwilling to provoke the Heavenly Dao since they will be erased/punished by the Heavenly Dao, Great Dao, Outer Dao etc. But, the Heavenly Dao Wang Ling possess is infinitely/immeasurably different especially Wang Tong Dao as they all scales to however the Author wishes to, so they can be the absolute strongest at times without anything equal or stronger than it but at times they can be strong but somehow useless at certain stuff or doesn't works well because of the Plot, so the Author use Plot Induced stupidity or Character Induced stupidity to Wang Ling Wang Tong Dao or other kinds of Daos that Wang Ling possess in order to prolong the conflict or keep the engagement of the readers in the novel story.

The Heavenly Dao has a whitelist project. Some powerful people who have survived from ancient times to the present and the orderers recommended by the God Realm are all on the whitelist. Those who are too strong will be automatically added. Once on the list, the Heavenly Dao must give preferential treatment and must not harm them. Attacking whitelist users with the power of the Heavenly Dao will be sanctioned by the Heavenly Dao. If you are big enough, you can directly recommend others to the whitelist. After being reviewed and approved by the Heavenly Dao Committee, you can enter, even if you are just a mortal. Because the Heavenly Dao is the rule added by the King Dao Ancestor to the universe, the descendants of the King Dao Ancestor also have preferential treatment, but attacking whitelist users will also be sanctioned by a short-term ban on the right to use the power of the Heavenly Dao, unless both are whitelist users; but as mentioned in the previous paragraph, the Heavenly Dao cannot control powerful cultivators above the Dao God, so the setting of the Heavenly Dao protection was only used once, and all the rest were preferential treatment.

Orderers are the guardian of the universe and sometimes some orderers are also the guardian of the universes/multiverse. They have the list of the strongest individuals/entities in the whole universe or multiverse depending on which universes/multiverse they governs/oversees but Wang Ling will never be part of the list as he is out of the system, we could say Wang Ling is immeasurably stronger than the system to the point the system doesn't able to list him into the list of the strongest entities in the entire universe/multiverse.Their strength varies in power and they aren't always supposed to be the strongest in each universe or multiverse since their purpose is not to dominate the universe/universes or multiverse they are guardian of but to protect. And with all the cultivators from each universe varies in realms and all of them competing in becoming the overlord of the universe, there's no need/reason for the Heavenly Dao, Wang Daozu or Will of the Universes to assign a guardian with strength that's beyond the entire universe or multiverse itself. This is why Wang Ling was never considered/offered to be an orderer itself.

The Immortal King world has the setting of classical cultivation and reincarnation. Dao Gods and above can directly accumulate cultivation through reincarnation. It has various mythology too, such as Taoism/Daoism, Buddhism, Ecclesiastical (Gods & Angels), H.P Lovecraft/Cthullu/Outer Gods, SCP (Not really a whole universe but only the organization exists in Earth Universe and it's called as SCB instead of SCP), Mythical animals from various belief in the world, Races made up of animals that cultivates into Godhood or slaves of the Gods (Lions, Lizards etc), Aliens Races that sometimes some of them resembles an animals too (Octopus Aliens), etc.

There are many small worlds (Lower Dimensions/Universes/Small Multiverses), such as the demon world of the demon clan, the immortal star of the immortal clan, the sword king world, the hometown of the sword spirit, the void skeleton king world, etc. This world even if it's not truly universes/multiverse each it's contained inside another universe/multiverse that is too small or insignificant to the other 10 Main Universe/Main Worlds/Main Multiverse. Each of these worlds able to upgrade itself to a higher one whether in terms of spiritual power, durability and even dimensionality and can be also temporarily upgraded by cultivators especially Wang Ling during a fight in order to make the specific world/planet or even the whole universe and universes/multiverse to be durable enough to withstood their fight. But usually this rule doesn't apply to their projections, avatars or clones since their power/strength, capabilities and existence isn't that harmful to destroy the whole universe, galaxy or the small worlds/universes/multiverse. But cultivators beyond Dao-God above able to destroy smaller worlds (Universes/Multiverse) rather easily but for the Main World/Main Universe/Universes/Multiverse they have to face the Will of the Universes and even the Ancient Universe Will too, which is basically the Will of the Multiverse.

There are ten infinitely/immeasurably large universes, each with its own heavenly way systems, which can give users superimposed power. These ten universes are basically a multiverse each of its own as they contains smaller universes or small multiverse on each of them. The Heavenly Way have it's own grades with higher-grades transcending the lower ones. Each of the universes has it's own order, laws and plot/settings and this also includes various forms of power-system but most of them are mostly in names only as everything still originates and revolves around Heavenly Daos or originates from it. Only few individuals can alter each of the multiverse plot/settings such as Wang Ling being the highest plot manipulator in the verse with no known limit/no clear limit since he's beyond immeasurable compared to the cosmology of the verse, the second one would be Wang Daozu. There's 3000 Heavenly Dao on each universe and since there's ten main world/universe in the multiverse there's 30.000 Heavenly Dao in total.

There are Nigh-Omnipotent and Omnipotent Beings from each universe but they are only Nigh-Omnipotent and Omnipotent in their own universe not the multiverse settings, but this of course doesn't applies to Wang Ling, the Creator of the way of heaven (Wang Daozu) and cultivators that has already transcended into Dao Ancestors realms above. There's no True Omnipotence or True Omniscience or True Omniscient in this verse aside from Ancient Will of the Universe and Will of the Universe, Wang Ling itself is a variable and even if he is really True Omnipotent, True Omniscient and True Omnipresent, he'll never impose such things to himself nor made others knows about his true capabilities, Beyond-dimensional existence, etc as he is not the type who seeks power to rule or dominate the entire universe/multiverse. He's only interested in the worlds/universe & multiverse peace. Mainly protecting Earth Universe since Sun Rong is in it. Other thing like friends, arch-enemies, foreign entities, etc..comes second, third, etc. But i am not the author so the one who decides whether Wang Ling is True Omnipotent, True Omniscient and True Omnipresent is not me but Kuxuan the Author.

The tenth universe is facing the crisis of spiritual energy leaking from the four poles. The Immortal Saint Book sent by Master Ling deduces that the Chosen Son will solve the crisis. As a side story, the Orderly Gu Shunzhi is a permanent resident, Wang Ling's sister makes a guest appearance, and the Immortal Saint Book is a permanent resident. The author of this book is currently in a situation where the author occasionally resurrects and updates a chapter. The protagonist Qin Zong will travel to Wang Ling's main world after growing up in the future. It is not known yet whether Wang Ling is the Chosen Son who will be the one who saves the Multiverse from it's destruction of beyond-dimensional/higher-dimensional entity (single individual) or force (Army) that even the multiverse can't fight back against but Wang Ling theories of being the reincarnation of Wang Dao Zu was stated to be wrong too because he is too strong for a mere Dao God-level and now the exact strength of Wang Dao Zu is unknown so he might have become Heavenly Ancestors just like Wang Muyu and Qiao Yanyuan. And we can expect Bai Zhe to be that figure who will ruin and destroy the Multiverse (Along with the Smaller Worlds/Lower-dimensional universes/Multiverse inside of each of the universes/Multiverse)

Cultivation system : foundation building, golden elixir, Yuanying, transformation, refining emptiness, scattered immortals, true immortals, true lord/venerable, immortal lord/venerable, immortal saint, Tao/Dao lord, Tao/Dao god, Tao/Dao ancestor, human ancestor, earth ancestor, heavenly ancestors, immortal/Ancestor king, immortal Ancestor....Wang Ling...

Important Note: The Author never gave out a clear official structure or tiering of the worlds as he keeps adding more and more worlds/universes and smaller worlds/universes/multiverse. So, it is up to the readers & fans that has to be the one that comprehends and write all of the cosmology of the verse without the author help. This is made by combining bits and pieces of all information from the entire novel oldest up to latest chapters. Most readers & fans of Immortal King verse don't know power scaling or even if they do know they don't know or comprehend even 1% or 5% of the cosmology of the verse, that's why there's various debates/downplays from various readers & fans because they only read the Daily Life of Immortal King verse to power scale or to downplay the verse. I might be the same but the difference between me and them is i have at least 50%-75% comprehension of the verse and it's cosmology i would never dare to say 80%-100% as only the Author knows the entire verse and i am not Kuxuan himself, just a reader who's tired of everything especially related to Wang Ling being hated, downplayed, ""accused of being wanked"", having no clear cosmology except ""wank-cosmology"" in some sites, misunderstood for just being an op mc that solos his verse with no story or plot, etc."
DAO First playthrough but the fade makes me want to quit,dragonage,1i6rkrs,2025-01-21 14:55:03,56,0.73,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1i6rkrs/dao_first_playthrough_but_the_fade_makes_me_want/,KCatlee,Discussion,"I am 22 hours in, I love the characters but the fade (circle) is tiresome even with a walkthrough.

I am getting a bored and I was a bit disappointed with the world-building and quests but I was willing to see it through, however I’m very close to giving up altogether because of the fade. It’s long, it’s annoying, I should’ve installed the mod to skip it but I don’t know if it is possible to install it anymore (playing on steamdeck and already in the Fade)

Those who almost stopped at this point, is it worth it to continue playing?

  
\[Update\] I did install the mod and continue playing DAO, I did enjoy my time until then and I really want to finish the story (it’s my first playthrough and I haven't been spoiled!). I also want to add that I love the fantasy setting, my main critic when it comes to the worldbuilding is that it’s very linear but it’s an old game so I should be more lenient (I am more used to the elder scrolls games). I was having a great time until this episode (I did the Connor arc earlier) so I am very willing to finish it!"

I first got clued into this back when I was juggling a job and getting ready to start my own business. One time over a meal, my dad gave me a wake-up call. I wanted him to hook me up with a certain contact, and we’ve always been super straightforward with each other: I tell him what I need, and then he tells me his conditions. That day, his only requirement was that when I met this “contact,” I should skip the small talk. Use three sentences to explain what I’m capable of and the value I bring, then another three sentences to explain exactly what kind of support I need and what I hope to get out of it.

I was really puzzled. In my view back then, this kind of conversation seemed too abrupt. Isn’t the point of polite social niceties—like flattery and small talk—to give two total strangers a bit of a buffer, so things don’t feel so awkward?

My dad said, “That’s how it looks to you, coming from an employee’s perspective. It’s why a lot of people stay employees their whole lives. For people like us, our time is expensive. When a nobody like you sits across from us, we only need a few glances and a bit of talk to see where this is going. In that scenario, too much politeness is overkill. I’d rather you spend that time telling me more about your project, or about yourself.”

I said I found that rude. He just gave me this look, and said, “You’re already pulling strings here—why worry about being rude?” Then he asked me, “Which is more important, being polite or being honest?” And once again, I was speechless. The last time I got stumped like that was when I told him about my experiences abroad and he started quoting the Dao De Jing at me. I’ve always felt like we’re from different planets—our wavelengths never match.

When my dad saw me freeze up, he sighed and asked, “Did you forget all that ‘elite culture’ you supposedly learned overseas? Don’t you get that the core of self-interest is actually honesty? Being honest with yourself, not making excuses to hide your selfish desires.” Then our conversation drifted off into a bunch of vague ideas. It felt like something was stirring in the air, but I couldn’t quite grasp it. At moments like these, I can only admit I’m just not that quick on the uptake. But that’s okay—any truth that you instantly figure out is probably the wrong truth, right?

It was months later during a casual hangout with friends that I finally got what my dad meant. That day, my friend A got drunk and started quietly crying on the table. She said she’d broken up with her boyfriend because they had different plans for the future, and she refused to compromise. Now she sort of regretted it—maybe she was too selfish. Another friend, B, also tipsy, started slurring out her thoughts: “C’mon, people usually sober up when they’re drunk, but you’re getting more confused. There’s nothing wrong with using your time to make yourself better. And by the way, why are you even bothering with those double eyelid tapes? Big eyes mean nothing if they’re empty inside.”

My friend A kept crying and glaring at B at the same time. B hates when people cry, so she got even more direct: “Take a look at the people around you—from your teachers to your friends to your significant other—tell me they aren’t all in proportion to your own worth? You think our parents forced us into top schools and an ‘elite culture’ for what? Without all that, you think any professor would give us the time of day? And that’s a professor, an academic type, still that pragmatic about social status. Think about it: if you ended up at a average local university, how would you even know the people you do now? And let’s not kid ourselves—if you had, I sure wouldn’t hang out with you.”

My friend A snapped back, “You’re so indecent!” I was sitting there thinking, “Whoa, that’s harsh.” But B didn’t care at all: “This is egoism, get it?” Hearing “egoism” and “indecent” together was weirdly eye-opening. Suddenly, I remembered how my dad had been all cryptic with me. B really is a genius in her own way.

I finally understood the subtext of what my dad had been hinting at: in this super utilitarian society, people have a price tag, too. People get treated as commodities. Friends, teachers, lovers, even family will flock to you when you’re doing well. It’s offensive, it’s impolite, it shatters your worldview—but think about it: when you brag “I have a friend who…,” it’s usually about how high-status or capable they are. When you talk about your advisor, you’ll brag about how brilliant they are academically. When it’s time to get married, you evaluate your partner’s family background. And when parents talk about their kids, they usually start with “My child got that award, made this much money.” I’ve never heard anyone say, “Hey, I know this random broke homeless who lives off trash picking.”

The hardest pill to swallow is that if we had a choice, most of us would pick a high-status family to be born into—no hesitation. Remember, that hypothetical is basically a total reset: you’re wiping out all memories and experiences with your current parents, so at that moment, they’re just a set of data points (height, weight, social status, education, etc.). It’s a two-way street. You’d abandon your parents, so nobody’s really more noble or selfless than anyone else. Let’s not get hung up on labeling people “high-educated” or “low-educated,” or slapping “exquisitely selfish” and “egotistical” on them. Maybe higher-educated folks just admit to themselves that they’re selfish and accept it. Everyone else is either too shortsighted to notice or just in denial.

So the main takeaway: focus on living your best life and keep at that carefully calculated self-interest. That’s it. When you’re truly honest with yourself, there’s a bonus: you’ll see that a lot of times you’re carrying other people’s selfishness, too. For instance, parents might project their unfulfilled dreams onto you, dressing it up however they want—kind of like the “small talk and flattery” employees use in marketing and sales. It’s all the same tactic, just wrapped in a nicer package. Underneath, nothing’s changed. It’s not genuine politeness; it’s real offense.

What my dad was trying to say over that meal is that people like him hate that kind of offense—or rather, people like me aren’t worth their time to humor in that game. Everyone should just be upfront and save time, so we can get things done.

Of course, I’m not saying you should point at your parents’ noses and accuse them of being offensive or wasting your time, or tell them they need to be honest. You’d probably end up with an even bigger mess on your hands. Dealing with someone who doesn’t even realize they’re being “indecent” can be more exhausting than dealing with a polite fool—and I guess that’s why my dad is always so indirect with me. (In a way, how you guys see “indecent” parents might be how my dad sees me, the “polite fool.” …Sigh.)

Anyway, that’s it. I realize now my dad’s actually super patient with me. Let me wrap this up in a “decent” way:

Should mages have full autonomy? ,DragonageOrigins,1i62lcf,2025-01-20 17:08:06,106,0.91,148,https://www.reddit.com/r/DragonageOrigins/comments/1i62lcf/should_mages_have_full_autonomy/,jackfuego226,Discussion ,"Lets put aside the Chantry's personal beef with mages and look at the actual facts about the situation. On the one hand, we have the basic principle of human rights, right to life, liberty, etc., etc. On the other, mages in DAO alone created 5 separate extinction-level events if the player hadn't stopped them. The Circle Tower and Warden's Keep almost let loose a plague of abominations on Fereldan, Zathrian caused a curse of intelligent werewolves that lasted for centuries, and the mages at Armgorrok created an infestation of harvester golems.


But the scariest one to think about is in Redcliffe. Connor, a literal child with what we can only assume was a month or so's worth of magic training, was able to raise an army of undead strong enough to take over Redcliffe Castle and almost wipe out the nearby village. It never goes further than that due to gameplay, but we can only imagine how far it could have gone if left unchecked without the Blight. While it's true the demon helped contribute to this, the same boost can be given to literally any mage with much more power and training if they accept the deal.



So, what do you think? Should mages be allowed to be trusted 100% to their own devices considering  how bad it can be when that happens? Me personally? I think that while some of the Chantry's measures are a bit extreme, like the tranquil, there should definitely be some form of checks and balances involved just to be safe.


What are y'alls thoughts?




Edit: I suppose I should clarify. I'm not trying to claim that Fereldan has the ideal of basic human rights, but rather, we, the player, considering them when making our choices about mages in these games."

My cousin who got a 3d printer in November, printed up a bunch of terrain for me as well as this cool tank from Cults3d! I'm going to use it as a proxy for the DAO Union Hover Tank entry (although it's obviously not hover) so basically it's a tracked proxy for a GW T'au Hammerhead Tank. 

My DAO Union has detachments of GW T'au, AT-43 COGs, and allied Humans made from GW Cadians and other Human models from other games (they all use the standard DAO army list though so no custom unit)  So this will be attached to the Human units. 

The cleanup was a bit rough. My cousin is new to printing so he's still learning about best settings and stuff. But it went together just fine! 😁 

I added the magnetized sponson weapons, as well as a couple little details like the night vision targeting light above the gun, and some modifications to the track guard parts above the sponsors. I'm not going to add too many more bits and greebles I think. 

Hopefully I can start the paint work tomorrow! 😁

Dogs of War and Cathay coming to The Old World together (Conspiracy Theory),WarhammerFantasy,1i532cb,2025-01-19 12:00:06,22,0.71,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/WarhammerFantasy/comments/1i532cb/dogs_of_war_and_cathay_coming_to_the_old_world/,Cinderfox19,The Old World,"Recently, there have been 2 things floating around the community getting everyone excited: A Leak of Estalia/Dogs of War and a Hint about Cathay being added to The Old World.

But what if I told you they could be coming together? That we may well be getting an 'Army of Infamy' of Cathayan Mercenaries and/or Pirates to go alongside the Dogs of War/Southern Realms.

Originally, this was going to be a simple response to someone who brought this possibility to my attention, but the more I thought about it, the more a theory started to form.

Games Workshop are building up to the reintroduction of the Dogs of War after their 21 year absence from the setting. To me, that is beyond dispute, it's just a matter of when. Not just because of the map leak, but also their extensive 40 page coverage in the Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 4th edition book ""Up in Arms"", which reaffirmed their existence and delved further into their lore.

Plus, we've known about leaks from Total War: Warhammer III for a year or more now, with Borgio and Belladonna being discovered in the game files. (along with the constant addition of Dogs of War units with every DLC)

So if that's the case, then what's all this about Cathay recently? why are they being teased and how would they fit into The Old World setting, which has so far been laser focused on the lands between the Empire, Bretonnia, and Nehekhara?

The answer could be that GW plans to release a limited run of Cathay as part of the broader Dogs of War, which would not only make a ton of sense, but also allow them to test the viability of Cathay on Tabletop and figure out what the Race needs to really shine, without pulling an Age of Sigmar. (going into a new race head-first, then ret-conning/making redundant parts of their range because they changed their minds)

**Disclaimer:** this is mainly a bit of fun/speculation, I do think this could be a possibility but I'm not married to the idea by any means.

There are 4 main pieces of evidence to support this wild theory:

# 1. Cathay as part of the Dogs of War

Dogs of War are mercenaries from every corner of the Warhammer world, From the Amazons in Lustria, to the Northmen of Urslo and the Hobgoblin Khans of the Eastern Steppe, so Cathay's absence in their roster would be a glaring omission.

Believe it or not, Cathay had Dogs of War units all the way back in 6th edition, in the form of **Celestial Dragon Monks:**

>**Rare Units**

>In times of dire necessity, a High Elf commander may hire the services of a mercenary Dogs of War regiment, such as the famed Voland's Venators or the enigmatic **Celestial Dragon Monks of the far east**, though this is generally seen as a last resort.

>\- High Elves 6th edition (Jan 2002), page 31

They're also mentioned in the Ogre Kingdoms 6th edition army book:

>From Pigbarter the Spice Route heads east into distant Ind, the land of a Thousand Gods. It snakes through the far north of Ind, at the tail of a great mountain range, **where monasteries of the Celestial Dragon Monks are found**. Mystical but highly aggressive, these legendary warriors practice enlightenment through violence and through strict meditation and training have even mastered the ability to breathe fire and run across water without breaking its surface.

>\- Ogre Kingdoms 6th edition (Jan 2005), page 55

And re-appear in the Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay book ""Altdorf: Crown of the Empire"" from 2021, meaning their lore is concurrent with modern cannon.

>**Lady of the Commandry Yabo Chao, Weijin's Venerable Ambassador:**

>In the wake of the Great Fog Riots, the presiding Cathayan Ambassador was unmasked as a follower of Tzeench and fled from the waiting pyres of the Witch Hunters of ""the order of the Silver Hammer"". Outraged missives from Altdorf were met by cutting recriminations from Weijin. Sigmarites slated Cathayan efforts to root out Chaos as lacking zeal, whilst the Dragon Emperor's mandarins retorted that their occidental counterparts must be grossly myopic not to have spotted such an obvious imposter.

>The current Ambassador to Altdorf is working hard to smooth over these differences. She is Lady of the Commandery Yabo Chao, venerated envoy of the Dragon Emperor. Chao is a skilled and accomplished diplomat with detailed knowledge of the history and culture of Weijin and Altdorf. She is a patient and coolheaded communicator and is gaining a reputation for withstanding the most furious tirades a Sigmarite zealot can muster, before calmly tearing his argument to shreds.

>Negotiating trade deals with her has become a pleasant form of humiliation for Altdorf's merchants, Her logic is ruthless and her contracts waterproof, but her manners are so impeccable that to be bamboozled by her is somehow rather charming.

>**Her honor guard, a regiment of Celestial Dragon Monks,** have also won renown, campaigning against the Beastmen and Forest Goblins who infest the Reikwald with the same devastating effect as squadrons drawn from Atdorf's Knightly Orders.

>\- WFRP 4th edition - Altdorf: Crown of the Empire (Mar 2021), page 25

Despite the prominence of Dragon Monks across 20 years of lore (with more written about them than practically anything else regarding Cathay) we still haven't seen (bald) head nor (dragon) tail of these supposed Celestials. Could GW be saving them for the Dogs of War?

# 2. The Lords of Shang-Yang Leak

For those unfamiliar, back in June of 2024, there was an alleged leak for Total War: Warhammer III, which posited that Cathay was getting a large-scale DLC introducing Dogs of War mercenaries into their culture. Even suggesting we'd get 2 new Mercenary Legendary Lords.

These Lords and units were based on the cultures adjacent to Grand Cathay: the Ogres from the Mountains of Mourn and the Tigermen of Ind:

**Cathayan Ogre Mercenary Faction**

Mung the Brutal (Ogre Mercenary Legendary Lord)

Leering Devil Tyrants (Ogre Mercenary Lord)

**Ogre Mercenary Units**

Hunting Beasts

Mancrusher Giants

Leering Devil Maneaters

Leering Devil Maneater Cavalry

**Cathayan Tigerman Mercenary Faction**

Bashiva (Tigerman Legendary Lord)

Sawai (Tigerman Lord)

Clawspeaker (Tigerman Hero)

**Tigermen Units**

Tiger Warriors

Tiger Warrior Stalkers

Ironclaw Tiger Warriors

This DLC was apparently titled ""The Lords of Shang-Yang"" and Shang-Yang was actually mentioned  in the first Dogs of War 5th edition army book way back in September 1998 (27 years ago):

**TL;DR for the first part of this Silk Road story:** Two Tilean Merchants out of Karaz-a-Karak; Brothers Ricco and Robbio wanted to venture further east than ever before, because they found precious silk. The Dwarfs said it was foolish, but the brothers plans went ahead regardless, with them thinking they'd end up in Ulthuan or Lustria because they didn't know the world extended far beyond their knowledge.

They returned home to Verezzo and got funding for an expedition from several surrounding states + their Merchant Prince and set out from Karaz-a-Karak in 1699 with more than 1000 Tileans.

>**The Silk Road**

>It was many years before anyone in Tilea heard of the fate of the expedition or what they had discovered. Then in 1714 (15 years later) a merchant caravan of pack yaks arrived at Verezzo, laden down with bundles of silk. With the silk came a message from Ricco and Robbio, explaining that they were now residing in the westernmost outpost of the Empire of Cathay! Of course, up to then no one in Tilea, or for that matter the Old World, had known that Cathay existed at all.

>It was now clear that there was no eastern route to Ulthuan or Lustria. The world was indeed flat and much much larger than anyone could have imagined. Instead of Elves, the Tileans had encountered an entirely unknown realm. Indeed it was a populous empire of vast extent and unimaginable wealth.

>Apparently Ricco and Robbio had not been permitted to enter the Empire of Cathay because, as the Cathayans had politely explained, they were hairy and uncouth barbarians! However, the Emperor Wu, greatest of all the Cathayan Emperors, had been intrigued by these strangers. He had been delighted with the return of the banner of his Palace Guard and was gratified to receive the submission and tribute of the entire land of Tilea!

>This caused great mirth in Verezzo where they guessed that the cunning Ricco and Robbio had appealed to the vanity of this oriental potentate in order to avoid being summarily beheaded! The message went on to say that the Emperor had agreed to hire the entire expedition having been impressed by a mock battle in which the mercenaries had held off a small part of the Cathayan army. The Tileans accompanying the pack yaks explained that it had not been a 'mock' battle and the army, although small by Cathayan standards had in fact outnumbered the Tileans by about three to one!

>Since that time a mercantile quarter has flourished in Shang-Yang which is the westernmost of the Cathayan fortress towns on the 'Silk Road'. This is the name by which the trade route to Cathay, opened up by Ricco and Robbio has become known. Trading caravans go along this route very rarely and only a few reach their destination due to the terrible hazards of the journey and the scourge of the Hobgobla Khan and his great horde which, when all his loyal tribes are drawn up for battle, is said to extend from horizon to horizon!

>The mercenaries in Shang-Yang have become 'guests' of the Emperor of Cathay and valued warriors in his service. The Emperor uses these troops to help defend his western frontier against the wrath of Hobgobla Khan. Of course by doing this, the Tileans serve their own interests by keeping open the silk road.  
\- Dogs of War 5th edition (Sep 1998), page 94-95

This leak never came to fruition and might have even been fake, but it seemed far too outlandish and specific for it to be completely fabricated.

# 3. The Monkey King

The Monkey King is a morally grey and rather mischievous character who carved out his own discordant kingdom in and around the Mountains of Heaven, lorded over by his very own Monkey Court.

Despite being a sworn enemy of Cathay and specifically Li Dao (the Fire Dragon), he and his Monkey Warriors are regularly called upon to assist Cathay in times of Crisis.

On the topic of him and his Monkey Court, Total War has this to say:

>Calling the Monkey Court a ""court"" is perhaps generous, as the Monkey King and his people seldom do anything so organised as hold court. Even so, much like the Tiger Court, the Monkey King is expected to govern his Monkey Warriors in the same way as the Cathayan Dragons rule over the people of Grand Cathay. When the Monkey Court does meet it is always a chaotic affair, and while the Monkey King smugly believes himself to be the equal of any of the Cathayan Dragons, other Cathayans can only look on in horror at the disorganised way in which he rules his kingdom.

>\- Total War: Warhammer III

So here we have a morally ambiguous character; a culture on the borders of Cathay (just like the Ogres and Tigermen). His Monkey Court has drawn direct comparison to the Court of the Tigermen of Ind, who have also been hinted as mercenaries and The Monkey King has himself been called upon as a last resort to aid Cathay, just as one would a Dog of War.

Many people are dying to see him in Total War/on Tabletop, but he'd never make sense as part of Cathay-proper, nor do I see him getting an army book of his own.

To Me, Making The Monkey King and his warriors Dog of War Mercenaries would perfectly round out the trifecta of Cathayan Merc's and it'd be the best way to include him in the setting, while keeping him mostly independent.

# 4. Yin-Yin's Pirate Fleet

This is an addendum I'm adding after the fact on the Jan 20th 2025. I made this post a day before The Old World map update and with the inclusion of the Cathayan ship near Marienburg (a city well known for its mercenaries, expeditions and privateers) I think this fits neatly into what I'm getting at here.

Perhaps instead of Chimps, Ogres and Tigermen, it'll be Yin-Yin: The Sea Dragon we see drift into the Old World to stir up trouble.

During this time period the Cathayan brothers are all at war with one-another in the absence of their parents, as described by this quote from the Old World core rulebook:

>**The Empty Throne**

>In recent times, the great balance of Grand Cathay has been threatened and it faces danger like at no other time in its long history. For over two centuries, the Celestial Dragon Emperor and the Moon Empress have been absent, leaving the running of the empire to their children. It is a time of darkness and disharmony for Cathay. Not even the draconic rulers of the empire seem to know where their father and mother have gone or, more worryingly, if they will ever return.

>Throughout the empire, rebel lords and ambitious magistrates scheme to take power, while the countryside has become infested with bandit kings and criminals.

>In Weijin, the Jade Dragon, Yuan Bo, struggles to hold his father’s empire together and oversee the Celestial Court and its Astromancer cabals with little help from his bickering siblings.

>In the east **Yin-Yin, the Sea Dragon looks out across the Jade Sea, her treasure fleets travelling east, south and west in search of gold and glory.**

>Meanwhile in the south Li Dao, the Fire Dragon guards the border against invasions from Ind and Khuresh, all the while keeping one eye on the mischievous Monkey King in the nearby Mountains of Heaven. In the west

>Zhao Ming, the Iron Dragon, indulges himself, consumed by his alchemical research.

>\- Warhammer: The Old World Core Rulebook (Jan 2024), page 87

Yin-Yin has been known to go pirate; conduct naval assaults in other parts of the world and during this tumultuous time, she's sending her fleets out far and wide, trying more to escape the situation at home than fix it.

She offers another possibility for a Cathayan Army of Infamy, focusing on the Naval/Pirate side of Cathay; with them either selling their services as mercenaries, or taking merc's with them to swell their ranks...after all, she and her navy are: ""in search of gold and glory"", which is the mantra of the Dogs of War.

But what do you make of all this? Will Games Workshop take the plunge and go all-in on Cathay? could GW come out with a Cathay Grand Army and a Cathayan Mercenary Army of Infamy? or do you see another possibility?

How would you like to see the relationship between Cathay and the Dogs of War handled and could Yin-Yin or the Monkey King be the missing link between the two?"

My Take on Veilguard,dragonage,1i431kk,2025-01-18 03:18:20,0,0.45,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1i431kk/my_take_on_veilguard/,WDZanz,Discussion,"Alrighty, first, there's gonna be major spoilers, seriously I wrote drafts, and I'm gonna talk about how I felt about various parts of the game. Actually, it ended up being a thesis. That's right, I'm writing the end before the beginning because I wanted to emphasize that this will contain enough spoilers to ruin the experience if you read further and aren't done with the game. My advice, if you wanna know what this post says, but don't want spoilers, finish the game. Some further background, I did finish about a week ago right before class started for me and I explored basically everything I could, so the playthrough was about 70 hours. But, it's been a week and I won't remember everything perfectly because school has been kicking me while I'm down. But I had enough time tonight, So we're full sending this book of a post. I'll put a TL;DR, but you really should read the whole post, or maybe reference single paragraphs if that's all you read so that I know you're not overlooking everything. I mean, if you want a productive conversation, you would have to know my opinion and well I'm putting my heart on my sleeve (if that's the right saying).

So, my overview of the game is... I think it was pretty dang good, I'm not really familiar with how origins or DA2 work, I didn't really have access to them and I don't have a computer that I think can run them well, so I'm just going off of Inquisition. In all honesty, after being in love with Inquisition for like 8 years, I was worried Veilguard wouldn't live up to it, and I went in completely blind, so I really had no idea what to expect. In fact, I even remember being kinda thrown off because the way they did the character customization for building the face took me 20 minutes to figure out what was happening. And I've seen some videos since playing where people are complaining about the look, like I would describe it as pretty soft? I don't know, it wasn't the direction I was expecting, but it definitely didn't look bad. You may be thinking, ""wow, you started by saying Veilguard was really good, yet you're throwing out comments that sound a little complainy..."" Yes, I did, but that's probably the end of my complaints, I can't think of anything that \*I personally\* (Just my opinion) found to be clunky. That even goes for glitches. During regular play I don't think I found a single one, and I definitely didn't find anything game breaking, so that's great, and beats out Inquisition considering you can find yourself locked out of the Solas friendship type questline. But anyway, I'm gonna yap about the basics.

Basic Mechanics: Things like the fighting, though maybe more nuanced stuff will come up. So I like the fighting changes between Inquisition and Veilguard. It is harder, but I just finished God of War Ragnarök too, so I was over prepared for the difficulty of Veilguard. Next time, I'm definitely gonna up the difficulty, but for putting it just one level up from the normal, I thought it was well balanced, especially given the cap at 50 and that most enemies scaled pretty well. It was easy, from my perspective, I think I really did just select one too easy for my experience with games with that type of combat, I was able to take on certain bosses well above my level, but it wasn't completely a cake walk. All of this is to say I think it's a great game for a more casual experience, and especially for newer players, but I will likely find ways to make it harder just for the heck of it.

Another newish take that I really liked was the companion interaction. I really think they made a great change making the companions more involved in like fighting ability. The fact that interactions have an impact on not only normal exploration, but was a pretty integral part to the end of the game, it was much better. I'm glad that companion interactions had more meaning. Also, when I get to story beats, it really upped the emotional factor of the game for important decisions, so just an overall great change I think. And I want to add, it felt very obvious that doing more companion interactions would really help in the long run, even out and about. When a newer companion comes along and they aren't as leveled, I can say for sure I felt it when I went out with them, and that's pretty cool I think. I still feel closer to the Inquisition companions, but I have also been able to explore how that works for years, and the fact that Veilguard companions already feel pretty compelling after one playthrough is a good sign that I'll grow to like them just as much as the cast of Inquisition.

The last mechanic I think I can reasonably talk about would be the loot system. It feels leagues better than Inquisition, and I'm so ok with the fact that they changed how upgrades and crafting worked. The fact that finding a chest directly upgrades some kind of equipment is waaay better than just finding some junk that you're almost guaranteed to sell, and it's nice that selling to multiple vendors also has some importance because in Inquistion, I just dumped garbage loot at the vendors in Skyhold and really never made use of vendors in other locations (despite the fact that they did usually carry at least something new: a potion type, really good armor, schematics). It's also my personal opinion, but I think the shops were way more efficient and had very few ""what's the point?"" kind of items. Buying mementos is pretty important, and a new weapon for a companion is great, or upgrades for existing equipment? And you can make an argument that there's no reason to have as many cosmetics as there are, but I would say the customization is... thorough? There is a lot, but it's not overwhelming, and unlike lots of games with customization stuff like that, I didn't feel compelled to buy them because the shops contain way more important stuff than cosmetics, so it was like a treat: ""Oooo, I got enough gold, and this thing looks cool, and there's nothing else to buy at this shop, so why not?"" Again, it's a personal opinion, but the way items and upgrades are handled is leagues above Inquisition.

Ok, Now I want to talk more about aesthetics. I mentioned it briefly at the beginning, but while the style was weirder than what I was expecting, I still think the game looks good, and generally, the game looks pretty incredible. More specifically, I think the variety of the environments was just as good as Inquisition, and honestly, after playing through the game, moving away from the fully open locations was probably a good idea. There was still plenty to explore, and it wasn't overbearing, and as a bit of a completionist, it was very nice. 

Environment specifics: I was worried when I first got to the Lighthouse that it was kind of small, and it didn't feel like it would stand up against Skyhold, but I do like it, and again, it's not overwhelming, but not really losing anything either. Skyhold had plenty of secrets to find, but I liked that the light house minimized them a bit and let you focus primarily on your companions. The banter is great, and pretty often you could have like those time dependent conversations with them, it was nice. And you were able to customize the Lighthouse too, in a way that I think was more obvious than with Skyhold. And that's even including the fact that Skyhold had it as a quest to customize the place. But I rarely went into the Wizard/Templar tower of Skyhold after finishing it up, it's out of the way and didn't contain anything important, so despite being able to customize, I had no reason to visit, and I had to physically remember that it existed so that I could see the ""hard"" work that went into fixing it up. It's a pretty small part of the game, but I think the Lighthouse was unique and handled really well, I liked that it was more about having a place to talk to companions. 

My Favorite Environment: You know, it's gotta be Treviso, and maybe I'm biased because I liked Lucanis. But every environment was pretty cool, and my next up would probably be the Necropolis. I chose to be a Mourn Watcher just cause it sounded the most interesting, and when I made it to the Necropolis, it was a little creepy, but that's amazing that Veilguard kept up with good environments. I will never shut up about my love hate relationship with the Exalted Plains from Inquisition, the way the devs crafted that environment I think captured the lore perfectly, and there was something about Treviso and the Necropolis that sort of felt like that too, oh god, and maybe Minrathous too? Like this is just for some perspective, but Inquisition has the Exalted Plains and maybe the Winter Palace that expertly convey the mood described in the overall lore and story, but in Veilguard, I got that feeling from the Necropolis, Treviso, and Minrathous. And honestly, the more I play Veilguard, the more I'm gonna get into these environments, and if I can list three incredible ones on my first playthrough, I think I'm only gonna grow to like most of them. Except maybe the Rivain Coast, it wasn't anything too remarkable in my opinion. Dang though, the cave you get access to later in the game was pretty cool, that you were basically entering a volcano. See what I mean? Inquisition just doesn't quite have that like Veilguard does, and this is coming from someone who's a fan of the Hinterlands too, so I don't know. Don't worry, I'll discuss the cross roads probably more in the next section.

Ok, I think we're at the point where we can talk about some of the story beats. First, I'm kinda glad they started with something that felt so vital to the story, and honestly, I let Neve down so much in this playthrough, she was totally justified to hate me on multiple occasions. I'm gonna go in order though. So like during the ritual, I chose for her to come with me to knock down the tower, and it got her hurt, right? Well it was definitely awkward when traveling for the first few missions after that, and I'm almost positive it would've been the same had I picked Harding, but the point is I think they make it clear that your companions are going to get hurt, and it \*will\* change things depending on who you pick to help. God, seeing that in hindsight is crazy because at every moment where I had to make an important decision, I was so torn. Coming from the perspective that someone would be happy that I picked them to lead or to help them in some way or another did backfire plenty of times. I'm gonna talk about many of them because Neve has every opportunity to hate me, dear lord every decision I made involving her just kept hurting her. 

So, After that first mission for the ritual, you mostly do a bit of exploring, getting one or two companions, and the next big story beat is when you have to pick between Treviso and Minrathous. Yeah, it doesn't help Neve that I picked Treviso over Minrathous, I just thought Lucanis was super cool and I wanted to help him, his argument was more convincing that I should save civilians. But, as would be the case for every important decision, not picking Minrathous had a pretty big impact on Neve (which changes fighting ability, so pretty cool) and the environment itself. I was not expecting to see public hangings, but I mean, I get what I get for picking Treviso. Anyway though, I put some thought into that decision, and the consequences were more severe than I had imagined, and maybe you're thinking ""oh well it didn't really change much."" well yes it did, it took much longer to get the Shadow Dragons leveled up, and it took effort to get Neve to trust me again, not to mention it changes her ability set, so it definitely feels more impactful than when you pick the Mages over the Templars in Inquisition. It became kinda difficult to level Neve up, by the way. I literally took every opportunity to talk to her so she wouldn't fall behind my other companions, and she still did! So I mean if you think your decisions didn't impact gameplay, then I don't know what would other than killing someone off. 

Next up after that decision is probably the quest regarding Mythal. I don't know because I haven't tested it yet, but I was able to convince Mythal to help (I also fought her too to get the dragons acheivement), and maybe that became the most important aspect behind the final mission and getting a peaceful resolution. Maybe, I wanna test it out, but either way, that conversation to convince her was sooooo cool, and does that exist in a previous Dragon Age game? I wouldn't be surprised if it does in Origins or DA2, but coming from Inquisition, that quest was a great idea, and it really adds variety to the set of things you can do in the game. Not to mention, it probably is extremely important to the end of the game, but I'd have to play again to see, and the best part is I am excited to try it out because it could result in a drastically different ending conflict. But this mission doesn't have much impact on the companions, so I don't really need to go into more detail. 

After that mission was I think the one where you have to save the Veil Jumpers from the Venatori. This was the point in the game where Rook became more recognizable among the enemy, which was cool, and also creepy considering someone wanted to know how Rook smelled. I've seen some creepy stuff throughout the Dragon Age games, I think Veilguard still didn't really let up on that. Is it as gross as Origins? Probably not, but Veilguard is the first time I've heard characters be explicitly creepy, or maybe I just wasn't paying much attention in previous games. I don't know, a game has to contain all sorts of atmospheres and moods and Veilguard really seemed to highlight to me that the Venatori are pretty deranged, and this mission added that context like I don't remember seeing very well in Inquisition. 

Something I almost forgot about were the team meetings in which the entire Veilguard gets together and talks about how to accomplish the next goal. I liked it more than the meetings you'd have with the advisors in Inquisition, it felt a little more personal and I liked the ragtag feel of Veilguard and how it sort of remained that way. Then again, it's equal to the way Inquisition handled being the leader of a massive organization and not losing your humility. Or at least that's what I got. When you have the opportunity to learn about Solas, that part was also really cool, and I liked that sometimes it was completely unfathomable to some of the characters, I think it really highlights the complicated nature of Solas and I don't think it let up that Solas is basically a god and good luck getting through this by out tricking the trickster god. Solas still felt as alien as he was in the Trespasser DLC, and it remained pretty consistent throughout the game, and hindsight is 20-20, because I totally see now that if you didn't commit to some sort of path with Solas, you probably had to fight him. Don't tell, I'll figure it out in future playthroughs, but some of you probably had to fight Solas right, like there were three options: fight him, trick him, or talk him down. But anyway, the story beats consisting of team meetings I thought were great. It was also a very direct way of saying that maybe taking care of your companions would be useful later.

Ok, I could write about more events, because there must have been at least a few more major ones, but I'm gonna skip right to the last mission. The point at which it says ""there's no backing out"" was like several hours before the game actually finishes and was comprised of about three total missions. So, just a note, the way the game shifts in tone is great. you learn that you're supposed to have at least a couple weeks to prepare for the big showdown, and then... the gods just casually move the moon to create an eclipse a few weeks a head of schedule, so if that's not the largest show of power since Infinity War, well then clearly I don't engage with much media. So anyway, you gotta head out and split into teams and take on the gods. I picked Davrin as a Team leader and at another point I pick Neve to take down like the magic devices, for those of you familiar, which at this point should be everyone reading this thesis, you know what that means! Yeah, Neve has every reason to hate me and I don;t wanna talk about Davrin. Honestly, I liked Davrin more than Harding... so naturally I was devasted when I picked him to be the team leader in the final mission when the consequences came back to bite me. Picking Neve too had really surprising consequences, but I'm glad two characters didn't meet their end. Oh wait! yes they did, holy christ the way they handled Varric completely threw me for a loop, and the moment it clicked while I was in the fade was a level of emotion I rarely experience in any game. That one interaction might have singlehandedly been enough for me to like Veilguard more than Inquisition, but I'm gonna sit on the fence a little longer and let more playthroughs convince me. 

So... That's it, there's no way I'll have remembered every opinion I have in one sitting, so feel free to ask questions about more deep stuff. I didn't want to go off the rails with spoilers but I know it'd go there. Anyways,

TL:DR: I personally like Veilguard a lot, so much that it may be even better than how I feel of Inquisition, which is quite the achievement given the many hundreds of hours I've put into Inquisition. I saw enough people with bad opinions that I wanted to be a good opinion of the game. Personally, if you didn't like Veilguard, well I would like to know why because this is the Be All End All: At least in comparison to Dragon Age Inquisition, I think Veilguard strips a lot of the ""bad"" stuff and adds quite a lot of good, three easy examples being the loot system, the story beats being more emotionally convincing, and the companions being more impactful in gameplay. I don't know really much about DAO or DA2 and I understand that Veilguard may not hold up to those games, but I did put my nostalgia of Inquisition aside for Veilguard (and I wasn't optimistic about Veilguard in the beginning), and it was worth it because I think it's a respectable addition to the series."

Play Again from Origins or Start from Inquisition Before Veilguard?,dragonage,1i3sbf3,2025-01-17 17:15:54,8,0.65,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1i3sbf3/play_again_from_origins_or_start_from_inquisition/,IndependentPudding85,Discussion,"

Hello!

As I told in other post, I’m feeling like playing Dragon Age: Veilguard and I was thinking about revisiting the series, but with the idea of playing Inquisition, it got me wondering if I should play the earlier games again.

I was planning to start over with Dragon Age: Origins to refresh the plot and characters, but after trying it again (even with mods), it feels like it has aged both mechanically and graphically. I played through it several times years ago, so I do remember bits and pieces, but I'm not sure it's worth forcing myself to play something that I no longer enjoy as much. Another issue is that, playing on an Ally ROG, the controls for DAO and DAII are not adapted for console controllers.

Although Origins & II is a classic, I'm not sure whether to force it and see how it goes or just read up to refresh my memory of those games and preserve them in my memory as they were.

Do you think I should give it another try, or would you recommend that I skip straight to Inquisition and then move on to Veilguard from there?

Thanks in advance!

Becoming a Lethargic Potato Can Make You Rich - CPC (Insider Thesis/Alpha),ICPTrader,1i3i5ys,2025-01-17 09:57:51,11,0.93,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/ICPTrader/comments/1i3i5ys/becoming_a_lethargic_potato_can_make_you_rich_cpc/,PeaMysterious3452,ALT Talk,"https://preview.redd.it/c5lxvu3l5ide1.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=05039bc6be9a41529908ca0b8168f2a8ff751592

# Intro

The foundation of CPC is the thing everyone—and I mean EVERYONE—deeply craves: relaxation and feeling comfort wherever you are in life.

The Couch Potato Club is able to do this in a humorous way that embraces our desire to let go and be lazy without any worries, anxiety, or fear. We saw a need in ICP, and we clung to that feeling. There's way too much fear and doubt over ICP, yet this is the best place in all of blockchain to be building and holding assets. It's not right. The most scalable, advanced, truly decentralized world computer tech is basically the easiest investment we can make for the future, yet we are pulled deep into FUD, market psychology, and feel anxious over the most natural moves. CPC is here to empower the ICP maxi, dead-sure 8-year gang confidence ICP deserves in the funniest way possible, by letting people become a literal couch potato! By embracing the spud life, we are building the necessary community, comfort, and wealth all our fellow spuds in ICP deserve.

ICP is FULL of people who know all we have to do is sit back and embrace the ups and downs (the 8-year gang). Eventually the world will realize the fair value of ICP in the hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars per ICP. Embracing that feeling of certain wealth is exactly what we all crave. We deserve to know that being in the ICP ecosystem this early makes us all winners.

How does CPC as a project fit into this? The ecosystem on ICP benefits many times over compared to the ICP token alone. While ICP appreciates as the best tech in crypto, the meme market and developers are also brought to ICP.

CPC is a meme with a community where you get to sit back and enjoy humor, drops, and eliminate stress while value is brought to you by an incredible, dedicated, and empathetic team—all while currently being a microcap with extreme upside potential on the best tech foundation in all of crypto.

CPC takes the bullishness of ICP another step forward by not only capitalizing on the ICP bull run but also the ecosystem bull run, slowly ramping up speed within ICP. I can't be the only one watching a meme coin bull run starting since the beginning of easy launch projects (like those off launch.bob.fun). We are seeing scarcity on exchanges as holders are sending ICP to external wallets to engage with ICP projects. This will propel the price of ICP up. This is the exact phenomenon that pumped Solana back to its all-time high from under $10.

It is my strong belief that this year the value of the ICP ecosystem, including CPC, will grow multiples more than ICP as a standalone token does. You can literally sit back and remember that if the CPC/ICP pair, for example, stays stagnant, the value of your holdings in ICP pairs will trend to the upside as ICP does—being led by the biggest research and development team in crypto. You can withdraw ICP from the ecosystem whenever but leave with potentially a ton more ICP, especially if you invest early in a broad spread of projects with strong teams and strong performance so far.

# Utility

So now it's clear CPC is not some blind, shot-in-the-dark degenerate investment because it's a meme; it has a backbone because it's fundamentally part of ICP. Let's look at what CPC aims to deliver to let the ICP community relax:

1. Being rewarded for being lazy:

The more you hold, the more you receive; being a large holder gets you access to more drops. Why be lazy when you can be lazy AND gluttonous? Already we're offering many giveaways in our OpenChat!

More to come - Couch potatoes get rewarded for all the other lazy things: napping, not exercising, procrastinating, and binging!

2. Potato NFTs (Earlier Future)

A potato can be so many things: a sweet potato, Yukon gold, russet—covet your favorite type or hunt for the best couch it's sitting on! Having an elite couch potato is rare and expensive; besides, it's your personality in the community. CPC is just our currency!

3. Exclusive DAO (Developing):

The couch potato club gets to act as a family of relaxed and committed potatoes. You can either do very little and hold a little, see what a team of people like this writer are able to do, or you can join the 5M+ CPC whale channel, which will naturally be an exclusive club and get more expensive and work better together over time.  
The DAO/Team has successfully achieved huge milestones in the first 2 weeks since launch, from no team and no roadmap to a serious game plan with the wealth and skilled team to make it happen. The DAO has pooled thousands of dollars into a treasury for use in airdrops, marketing, and development. In our opinion, spending now is a small price for a huge benefit. From listings to partnerships to upping liquidity to 30%, we have already proved to be a solid team willing to take our own time and energy to make this work.

4. Community & Memes (Here and getting better as we go!):

Everyone needs an online family and friends when you're isolating yourself from discomfort and dystopia by sinking deeper and deeper into a couch every chance you get. Now you can have it just by opening your electronic device! OpenChat and eventually a couch potato app will be your best friends and family now!

Explore CPC social media, where brain rot degeneracy meets the goodness of potatoes. Subtle onboarding with hilarious AI brainrot to the likes of apple dog and other AI edits—you don't even need to be in crypto to be pulled into the mysterious couch potato family that's hoarding a stupid internet token. (Good luck; from there it's over.)

5. The secrets I won't spoil:  
Couch potatoes deserve to lazy max and avoid all effort. Why do things yourself when you can just have something else do things for you? :)

# The Plan

Here's my insight from behind the scenes:

Like the couch potatoes we are, we are in no rush to moon immediately; the team has a lot to achieve, but we also have the motivation and talent to do it, as we've shown so far. We believe a slow approach is fine, as the future is extremely bright on ICP, and all the winnings will come eventually. Still, our target for early this year is a 5 million market cap, roughly 37x from the price at this time of writing.

How will we get there? Well, this is where maybe we lied about being lazy LOL. Don't worry; holders get to be lazy still.

https://preview.redd.it/9yper0686ide1.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c5b8f5027882ba223e38d10b2d3fcf68427bd39

Marketing:

The CPC will be engaging in thorough partnerships and strategic exposure campaigns alongside team onboarding and tech development to expose the rest of the ICP ecosystem and beyond to our belief that we can ALL relax and become rich.

Now that the OpenChat listing went through, we are doubling our holders over and over again through large range giveaways; we will be looking to make 10x days here. With each new holder, we will imprint curiosity and expose more of the ecosystem; even if it's a small amount in each holder, the distribution and curiosity will begin.

I have seen this type of campaign work wonders for projects like the likes of Jupiter on SOL. This campaign will be less broad and more selective by targeting communities and influencers that are strong in the ecosystem. The fun part is we will be trading CPC for other tokens with project owners to give away the tokens themselves while we give their tokens to the CPC! The way this campaign works not only increases the price of CPC, it also pools a large amount of airdrops for our own couch potatoes.

Next we will hit a large giveaway campaign rather than a small targeted dispersion of CPC. Larger holders will receive more of the large CPC bounty in OpenChat when the time is right.

Then we head directly into a special surprise to remind everyone that CPC isn't just a cash-in, cash-out situation; you want to be in as early as possible so you can keep seeing what happens next.

You get to sit around, chat with the club, and collect rewards for simply being active, all while abandoning the FUD, anxiety, and turmoil of the rest of the market that psychologically weighs us down.

This is obviously not all for marketing; we have other ways of spending our treasury with the likes of influencer partnerships, engagement maxing with bots and promoted posts, and content partnerships. I won't bore everyone with specifics because this is getting to be a very long read lol.

2. Potato Strength:

Transparency: The team is devoted to building trust and delivering promises. We are in this community too, and you are in good hands.

Branding - What started as no team and no roadmap, just a quick meme launch on Bob, is now a larger goal to establish the ultimate couch potato club where members are revered.

Skill Onboarding - Whether it's moderation and personality, creativity and design skills, marketing and social media, or coding and development skills, we are constantly on the hunt to recruit and upgrade the collective capabilities of the CPC team.

Liquidity maintenance and exchange listings - Keeping a great trading environment is key. Liquidity should be kept around 30%, and you should always feel like your money is safe and accessible.

Community maintenance and vibe maximization—the best community is one that feels like a family and has many ways of getting along. By creating multiple ways of engaging the community and embracing the core of relaxation and humor, we will create a beautiful place to relax, shill, discuss crypto, share memes, have voice chats, have movie nights, and play games together from the couch



3. Foundation:

Tokenomics - 1 Billion CPC straight from [launch.bob.fun](http://launch.bob.fun) provides an environment that won't inflate and where the community and DAO have as much as they desire to acquire; complexity like unlocks causes too much anxiety and ruins the fairness of wealth distribution. Here the only way anyone benefits is from being earlier than the rest. Over time I'm certain this environment will be deflationary as burned and lost tokens amount to a significant decrease in circulating CPC. The team has taken their fair bit to secure a treasury and liquidity already, so we are all set!

ICP - If you're here, you probably already know the world desires the new generation blockchain technology that ICP brings. Building on ICP is the best foundation, duh. Being a first mover on ICP and establishing community here will be building immense wealth.

Humans - We all like letting go and not having to do much, just laughing, resting, and enjoying. CPC is perfect for us by design.



In conclusion, CPC is a project I am bullish on for the fundamentals, game plan, and position in this ecosystem, and hopefully this has managed to convince you to either join our OpenChat for giveaways (coming now,through the weekend, and beyond) or just invest a little and see what we do along with the rest of the ICP ecosystem. I would argue that right now is a very nice price to accumulate as we exit this bearish moment in the market.

Let us get that bready, slow and steady, and have lots of naps and snacks along the way. :)

Late-Game Character Setups for Azure Moon Maddening Mode with Analysis and Comments (No New Game Plus),FireEmblemThreeHouses,1i37dol,2025-01-16 22:32:06,14,0.95,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemThreeHouses/comments/1i37dol/lategame_character_setups_for_azure_moon/,TheRunningPianist,Gameplay,"I recently completed Azure Moon on maddening mode and I decided to share my character setups. Basically, I had an active team of twelve rotating members. If I was dealing with a battle that allowed fewer than twelve units, the remaining members of my team served as adjutants.

My goals were to 1) finish the game, including all paralogue battles available given the characters I recruited, and 2) keep all my recruited characters alive. The character setups that I had were more than good enough to accomplish both of these. If your goals don't align with mine, you may be better off with different characters and setups, but if you also want to finish the game, keep your units alive, and have fun doing so, consider giving some of my setups a try.

**Byleth (grappler)**

Equipment: killer knuckles+ with Blue Lion Brooch

Battalion: Jeralt’s Mercenaries

Abilities: brawl prowess level 5, brawl critical +10, death blow, hit +20, brawl avoid +20

Important combat arts: healing focus, fading blow, fierce iron fist

An effective dodge tank with the ability to also do some serious damage. He is particularly useful in Hunting by Daybreak, where you can stick him in some wooded areas and manipulate the enemies into piling on top of him (hit rates will be in the teens or even single digits and he will draw the enemies’ attention away from the other characters), as well as the final battle. As such, my first priority before the time skip was to make sure he mastered the war monk class to get brawl avoid +20; that meant having him focus mostly on brawling and faith during the first twelve chapters. He didn’t get death blow or hit +20 until after Chapter 14, which was okay; neither of them were as crucial for Hunting by Daybreak as brawl avoid +20, and his damage output and accuracy were actually fine as they were. Jeralt’s Mercenaries gives an additional 15 points to his dodging chances.

During Hunting by Daybreak and the final battle, I equipped him with the Chalice of Beginnings so that he would counterattack even archers and mages if they were so foolish to attack him. But generally, the Chalice of Beginnings works better for Dimitri (more on this later), so most of the time, Byleth equipped the Blue Lions Brooch for an added boost in charm. I gave him the killer knuckles+ because they were light and an extra boost in critical hit rate never hurt anyone.

**Dimitri (great lord)**

Equipment: killer lance+ with Chalice of Beginnings

Battalion: Cichol Wyvern Company

Abilities: lance prowess level 5, lance critical +10, hit +20, battalion vantage, battalion wrath

The notorious battalion vantage-battalion wrath build that can only be done using Dimitri. For those of you who don’t know, battalion vantage allows Dimitri to “counterattack” before an enemy’s attack and battalion wrath boosts his critical hit rate by 50, but these abilities only activate when his battalion is at one-third endurance or less. Put Dimitri in the middle of a swarm of enemies and watch him decimate every one of them and emerge unscathed. The Chalice of Beginnings ensures this works even on archers and mages. The killer lance+ and Cichol Wyvern Company further boost his critical hit rate; by Chapter 19 or so, his critical hit rate exceeds 100% when battalion wrath is activated. This all could be disrupted by a battalion attack, but thanks to his high charm, most of them will miss.

Before the time skip, I made it a priority to raise Dimitri’s authority to A; he had both battalion vantage and battalion wrath by the end of Chapter 11. Note that death blow isn’t on his list of abilities; there was no room for it, and I felt that the other abilities were more important for this build.

**Annette (dark flier)**

Equipment: magic staff

Battalion: Nuvelle Fliers Corps

Abilities: reason level 5, fiendish blow, black magic range +1, rally speed, rally resistance

When I first played Azure Moon on maddening mode, I intended to use Annette as a rallying unit. Then I discovered that she’s actually a decent offensive mage with good magic potency and speed and a pretty good black magic spell list. I then started using Annette as a dark flier—have her cast sagittae or Excalibur on an enemy and then fly away.

I still give her some rallying abilities as they are useful at times. But I don’t equip her with the Crusher or a bolt axe and only give her a magic staff because her spells are more powerful than magic axe or hammer attacks. Besides, the Crusher and the bolt axe both weigh her down.

**Felix (sniper)**

Equipment: Failnaught with speed ring

Battalion: Nuvelle Chamberlain Company

Abilities: bow prowess level 5, bow critical +10, death blow, hit +20, close counter

Important combat arts: hunter’s volley

A bow user with hunter’s volley is always a good addition to your team. I chose Felix because he is one of relatively few units with both high strength and high speed, not to mention good dexterity. The setup here should be pretty straightforward.

**Ingrid (falcon knight)**

Equipment: Luin with evasion ring

Battalion: Galatea Pegasus Company

Abilities: lance prowess level 5, lance critical +10, death blow, darting blow, hit +20

The second of two flying pests on my team. Ingrid had a bit of a rough start and for much of the first half, she was either an adjutant or relegated to collecting items from chests, but once she got the Luin and darting blow and starting leveling up, she got so much better. Toward the end of the game, she can actually do some substantial damage even with her subpar strength as she often double-attacks due to darting blow and her high speed. Plus, she makes a good dodge tank and her unusually high resilience means she can withstand most magic attacks too.

**Sylvain (paladin)**

Equipment: Lance of Ruin with accuracy ring

Battalion: Gloucester Knights

Abilities: lance prowess level 5, lance critical +10, death blow, hit +20, battalion vantage

Important combat arts: swift strikes

Probably the one team member I worried about most as he wasn’t as fast as most of the others and couldn’t withstand attacks like Yuri, Ingrid, Dimitri, or Byleth. But he was able to deal strong and consistent damage, particularly with swift strikes. His setup is relatively standard and straightforward. I didn’t feel paladin was the best end-game class, but it was good enough for Sylvain and this setup was relatively easy. The accuracy ring is there to offset the subpar accuracy of the Lance of Ruin.

**Linhardt (bishop)**

Equipment: healing staff

Battalion: Nuvelle Attendants Corps

Abilities: faith level 5, reason level 5, fiendish blow, white magic range +1, white tomefaire

The best dedicated white mage in the game by quite a substantial margin. He cannot be promoted to a gremory, but honestly, he doesn’t need it; the number of black magic uses he naturally gets is usually fine and his primary roles were healing, warping, and undoing status effects. Thus, bishop is already a good enough end-game class for him as he still gets twice the uses of white magic spells plus an added boost to his healing. The healing staff adds even more to the amount of HP he can heal at one time. Although white tomefaire is really only good to improve the potency of Nosferatu, getting black tomefaire on him (which would probably actually be more useful) is typically more difficult given that Linhardt often does not use black magic often enough to reach S+ in reason by the end of the game.

**Lysithea (gremory)**

Equipment: Thyrsus

Battalion: Macuil Evil Repelling Company

Abilities: faith level 5, reason level 5, fiendish blow, dark magic range +1, dark tomefaire

Lysithea could theoretically thrive in several different classes, but I chose gremory for her. Not only does she have a great list of dark magic spells, she learns warp and seraphim, so I wanted her to have twice the number of uses of her white magic spells too. Thyrsus allows her to cast her dark magic from further away and occasionally halves damage, thus partially mitigating her extreme frailty, and dark magic range +1 improves this even further. Getting dark tomefaire for her by the end of the game is actually relatively easy.

**Alois (war master)**

Equipment: killer axe+ with critical ring

Battalion: Fraldarius Soldiers

Abilities: axe prowess level 5, axe critical +10, death blow, hit +20, quick riposte

Important combat arts: healing focus, war master’s strike

Alois’ role is to deal heavy damage through critical hits. His equipment, his battalion, axe critical +10, and the critical +20 ability inherent to the war master class all boost his critical hit rate; by the end of the game, practically every single one of his attacks was a critical hit. Quick riposte is nice for that additional follow-up attack, but it usually isn’t necessary as Alois almost always fells enemies in one blow. He was particularly useful in taking down monsters quickly before they had a chance to do any serious damage.

Initially, Dedue was supposed to fill this role. But after the time skip, Dedue fell behind whereas Alois got all the needed abilities relatively quickly and soon became ready for war master certification and outpaced Dedue in terms of stats. Now that I’ve played through his game again, I would say Alois is the best candidate for this particular setup and probably war master in general; he has better speed, luck, and dexterity than others in the war master pipeline except for Caspar, but he doesn’t suffer from Caspar’s authority weakness or low charm, so he can more readily lead a higher-end battalion like Fraldarius Soldiers that can really boost his critical hit rate and strength.

**Cyril (bow knight)**

Equipment: the Inexhaustible with march ring

Battalion: Gautier Knights

Abilities: bow prowess level 5, bow critical +10, death blow, hit +20, close counter

Important combat arts: curved shot, point-blank volley

The second of two bow users on my team. I keep most bow users as snipers as I prefer not to give up hunter’s volley. But Cyril learns point-blank volley, so the loss of hunter's volley wasn't so bad. I also decided to make him a bow knight for the added mobility. His setup should be relatively self-explanatory. I chose him to be the one to lead a battalion with stride due to his relatively low charm.

You may also want to give him a killer lance+ if you want to use vengeance. Personally, I could see the appeal of vengeance, but I didn't consider it crucial for success on maddening mode by any means (I think I used it twice, maybe three times during the entire game, and swift strikes, hunter's volley, point-blank volley, and Alois' attacks did the job just fine with less setup). But I know how many people out there seem to love it.

**Constance (gremory)**

Equipment: magic staff

Battalion: Cethleann Monks

Abilities: faith level 5, reason level 5, fiendish blow, black magic range +1, black tomefaire

After Byleth and Dimitri, she was probably the most valuable member of this team. Like Lysithea, Constance is an offensive mage with at least one very useful white magic spell. Thus, I felt she would be more effective as a gremory; having six uses of rescue as opposed to three is well worth giving up the black tomefaire ability that she would get as a warlock or dark flier. Besides, she learns black tomefaire when her reason reaches S+ anyway, and fiendish blow, the magic staff, and her battalion already increase her magic potency.

But if I had to do her setup differently (and this is something I realized after I completed the game), I would replace faith level 5 with uncanny blow, primarily so that bolting is much less likely to miss.

**Yuri (dancer)**

Equipment: Wo Dao+ with Fetters of Dromi

Battalion: Mockingbird’s Thieves

Abilities: sword prowess level 5, sword critical +10, hit +20, sword avoid +20, special dance

Important combat arts: windsweep

This setup allowed Yuri to be effective in multiple roles in addition to dancing; personally, I don’t believe the dancer needs to or should dance during every turn (usually, I have the dancer dance only about 70% of the time). The Fetters of Dromi were useful in giving him added movement and allowing him to move again after dancing. Meanwhile, with sword avoid +20, Yuri also became an effective dodge tank; honestly, it felt like a waste not to take advantage of this ability that all dancers get or his stratospheric speed. If any enemy tries to attack him, they will usually miss, and Yuri will often respond with a critical hit thanks to sword critical +10, the Wo Dao+, and his high luck and dexterity. I made sure Yuri could also use windsweep to whittle down a boss’ HP without fear of a counterattack.

I will usually switch the Wo Dao+ out for a rapier whenever Yuri is dealing with an armored enemy or a boss like the Death Knight."
Newbie Trying to Decide What Tea to Try Next. First Order Arrived! ,tea,1i369ni,2025-01-16 21:32:44,4,0.83,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1i369ni/newbie_trying_to_decide_what_tea_to_try_next/,chris-pezza,Question/Help,"I recently decided to get into Chinese tea, and quickly discovered how overwhelming the options are. I went with Yunnan Sourcing due to costs / seemed better than an international middleman, but as a result spent 3 weeks deciding what to buy.

My order arrived a week ago, and I’ve tried everything now. There are a few I’d get again, and overall I’m enjoying most of it. I’d love some help figuring out what I should try next, either from Yunnan or a similarly affordable Chinese outlet.

Initial hunches are that I’m more into Oolongs, Raw Puer, and Aged White, and less into Green, White, and Black. Granted I'm a newb and it’s winter. I suspect, similarly to wine, that my preferences will shift with experience and the season.

This was my first order:

* 2018 Yunnan Sourcing ""Wu Liang Mountain"" Wild Arbor Raw Pu-erh Tea Cake
* 2015 Bao Feng Xiang Ji ""Gong Mei"" White Tea Cake
* 13 Years Aged Da Hong Pao Rock Oolong Tea
* Imperial Mojiang Golden Bud Yunnan Black Tea
* FREE GIFT 2013 Yunnan Sourcing ""Yi Dian Hong"" Ripe Pu-erh Tea Cake
* ""King of Duck Shit Aroma"" Dan Cong Oolong Tea
* Snow Chrysanthemum Buds Flower Tea from the Kunlun Mountains
* Wild Tree Purple ""Sweet Ya Bao"" White Tea
* Imperial Dragon Well Tea From Zhejiang \* Long Jing Tea

Impressions:

* The raw pu-ehr had some really nice flavors, I can see how if it smoothed out with time, and got more complex, it would be amazing. I don’t think I’d get this specific one again, but I enjoyed it look forward to trying more sheng.
* The aged white tea cake is amazing and subtle, brews forever. Absolutely want to explore this genre. 
* The aged Oolong was shocking and delicious, but very mood dependent as its major chocolate vibes. 
* The black tea is very nice and roasty, maybe too much caffeine when I stack others throughout the day.  
* The gifted ripe pu-ehr was weird on the first go. Second time around I liked it more, I’d drink more of it. But it’s not great. 
* The duck shit Oolong is nice. Didn't strike me like some others but I'd like to try more of this style.
* The herbal snow chrysanthemum is kind of soapy, but a little bit added when the aged white was getting weak was good. 
* The purple white tea is a little much for me, despite being subtle. Too floral. 
* The dragonwell is nice, but not great. I got a sense of the style and am sure I’d like a better, fresher version. 

I want to try at least one more from each style group in the next order as well. One’s I’m considering ordering next:

* Imperial Gold Needle Yunnan Black Tea
* 2024 Yunnan Sourcing ""Suan Zao Shu"" Old Arbor White Tea Cake
* Wild Tree Purple Moonlight White Tea from Jinggu
* 2014 Yunnan Sourcing Autumn Bing Dao Raw Pu-erh Tea Cake
* Wild Da Hong Pao Rock Oolong Tea from Wu Yi Shan
* Imperial Grade Pure Bud Bi Luo Chun Green Tea

I’m not sure about a ripe pu-ehr yet, and for young raw I’m thinking to sample W2T.

I appreciate any suggestions y’all might have. Thank you!

What is your most favorite house and why? Which is your least favorite?,fragrance,1i2usvf,2025-01-16 12:52:35,18,0.91,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1i2usvf/what_is_your_most_favorite_house_and_why_which_is/,namis_tangerines,Discussion,"As I’ve been getting more and more into perfume, I’ve started to notice certain houses I enjoy, and ones that I don’t. 

My most favorite so far, which has continually impressed me, has been E’tat Libre D’Orange. I didn’t expect much ordering their discovery set, just because I’m a bit picky, but wow. I don’t dislike a single perfume out of their entire set, and I have developed multiple favorites so far. I’m really impressed with their creativity, and their scents seem to perform well. They have a die-hard fan here.

My least favorite… and it absolutely kills me to write this… has been Diptyque. I wanted to love them SO bad. SOOO bad. Everything about their aesthetic is so enticing, and I had high hopes, but… I haven’t been blown away by any single fragrance from them! There’s something about every fragrance on my skin that just makes my nose crinkle, and I haven’t been able to put my finger on it yet. My most favorite so far is a tie between Tam Dao and Philosykos, but I don’t love either enough to justify a $240 purchase.

Just curious what the community’s personal favorites and least-favorite houses are, and what the reasoning is. "
MCAS-how long until full remission?

Most people suggest a low histamine diet, for me that’s really difficult since I’ve been pretty strictly trying to gain weight back, does anyone have cases of getting better with only medication and vitamins?(glutathione, DAO, charcoal, bentonite, vitamin C, zinc, etc)?

I was also wondering, as everyone accepts it takes around a year to three years for full recovery if that was based on CIRS symptoms or more from MCAS symptoms, as when I get away from exposure my CIRS symptoms disappear within the next month, but my MCAS symptoms seem to stick with me. Any ideas?"
[Some Veilguard Spoilers] Each protagonist has a different love language.,dragonage,1i2qrnn,2025-01-16 09:59:34,77,0.74,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1i2qrnn/some_veilguard_spoilers_each_protagonist_has_a/,hard_ass69,Discussion,"When I say ""love language"" here, I mean expressing love, not necessarily receiving.

I'm playing through Dragon Age: Inquisition right now, and thought about how this is the only game where you can't give gifts to gain approval/relationship points with your companions. I found this odd until I realized your main way of gaining extra approval with companions is those little side quests you do to help them in small ways: destroying red lyrium deposits for Varric, finding Circle tomes for Vivienne, etc.

I realized that, clearly, the Inquisitor doesn't give people gifts to show they appreciate and care for them. Then I thought about it some more, and realized each protagonist shows people affection in a different way and couldn't get it out of my head, so I decided to write them up here! This was almost certainly not intentional, but it was fun to think about.

# The Warden - Giving gifts

While you can give gifts in DA2 and DAV as well, it's not as much of a developed mechanic as it is in DAO. In Origins, the Warden can give gifts to their companions to show them that they listen and express appreciation and affection for them.

Whether finding things out in the world or buying them from a merchant, the Warden comes across something they can't use personally but think ""hey, my friend would probably like this."" Giving paintings to Sten or jewelry to Morrigan, and especially when the companion talks about something deeply important to them that they lost, the Warden finds them that same thing (like >!Alistair's mother's locket!<) or something similar (like >!Zevran's leather gloves or Morrigan's fancy mirror!<) to tell them ""hey, you're important to me, and I listen"". Even when they haven't talked about said thing yet and you find the item early, they'll say ""wow, you know me so well, I didn't even have to tell you how important this was to me.""

# Hawke - Words of Affirmation

This is the most interesting one, IMO, because the friendship/rivalry mechanic in DA2 shows that regardless of how friendly you are with your companions, they all value hearing what Hawke has to say to them. Supporting them and agreeing with their views increases your Friendship, like supporting Anders' fight for mage rights, or showing Varric or Isabella that you like having fun. Being unsupportive or challenging their views increases Rivalry, such as challenging Merrill's views on demons or being a rule-breaker in Aveline's presence.

In acts 2 & 3, if your relationship score is high enough with some companions, you get the sidequest ""Questioning Beliefs"" where you talk to your companions about where they're at in life and what's going on in their heads. Even though gifts are a thing in this game, it's really just a way of triggering a conversation with your companion, where they reveal a bit more about themselves to Hawke and are then supported or challenged by them.

# The Inquisitor - Acts of Service

As I said earlier, your main way of getting up your approval with companions here is just doing favors for them. Cole talks about how he lost his friends and doesn't know where they are now. He doesn't even want to do anything to help them or try and find them because he feels like it's partly his fault that they're in danger now. You can then use the War Table to find and rescue them, and Cole appreciates this, adding a little note to the operation report saying ""I asked you not to do this. I was upset until it saved them. This is good.""

Helping Dorian help Maevaris or tracking down Venatori with him; helping Blackwall track down Grey Warden artifacts (and making damn sure he's in your party when you do, because he wants to see them, dammit!); helping Cassandra track down dangerous apostates and rebel templars; bringing Iron Bull along to kill Dragons, monsters and Venatori; all little things the Inquisitor can do to make their companions' lives a bit easier or more interesting, put their minds at ease and show them that they care.

# Rook - Quality Time (Spoilers ahead)

I think you could easily argue **words of affirmation** for Rook as well, but tbh, I'm this deep now and I need this to make this dissertation of a reddit post worth it. My explanation for this will require some spoilers as well.

>!So, a lot of people have complained that it's a bit weird that Rook's companions bring them out on coffee dates and picnics while this whole world-ending threat is going on, and I used to think the same thing, but this explanation/interpretation really turned me around on it: Varric is dead. And Rook doesn't seem to be processing or acknowledging it. So, rather than just bluntly talk to Rook about it and cause them unneeded stress, the companions try to bring Rook along on walks with the classroom pet or serene strolls through the necropolis to hopefully get their mind off things and get them to open up. The reason I would argue **quality time** over **words of affirmation** is that, these conversations are usually less about supporting or challenging their worldviews, and more about Rook just getting to know their companions better and sharing more about themselves.!<

>!Now, how does every companion know that this is the way to get through to Rook, instead of gifts or challenging conversations? Well, my headcanon is that Harding, having known them the longest, tells the other companions that Rook usually loves getting to know people and taking them on outings, but since Varric's death they've been super focused on the mission and clearly aren't taking care of themselves, so she tells all of them ""if you're heading out somewhere, please try to get Rook with you and distract them for a bit.""!<

EDIT: Oh, and I just realised, whenever you have an optional conversation with companions, you get approval when the conversation ends. So even outside the whole >!spoiler spoiler!< Rook still gains approval just by going out of their way to talk to and spend time with companions whenever they're just chilling in the Lighthouse.

# DA5 protagonist - ?????

So, since every other love language is covered so far, does that mean **physical touch** is up next and DA5 will feature lots of hugging, cuddling and holding hands with companions? I mean, I wouldn't mind that, but others might find that uncomfortable.

Maybe they could take a different approach next time, and instead of the protagonist having one or two love languages that get applied to all companions, maybe have each companion have their own languages instead. Some companions you can get approval from by getting them gifts or doing acts of service, while others prefer to go on outings.

TL;DR I spent far too long thinking and writing about how we show love to our digital companions.

EDIT: It has come to my attention that the idea of the 5 love languages originates from a very homophobic and conservative minister (read [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210311005845/https://www.5lovelanguages.com/2014/12/understanding-homosexuality/) and [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210311005845/https://www.5lovelanguages.com/2014/12/understanding-homosexuality/)). Do with that information what you will."
If you still don't get the whole picture: The new Internet of Blockchains is forming right now and this explains every single major price action we've seen since Nov. 2024!,CryptoCurrency,1i2qcnh,2025-01-16 09:39:53,0,0.42,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1i2qcnh/if_you_still_dont_get_the_whole_picture_the_new/,Longjumping-Bonus723,ANALYSIS,"I'll try to make it quick. There are a few projects being able to connect to the existing networks (banks etc.). They are commonly referred as the ISO coins. This is about ISO 20022 and TC307 and TC68 and XML/JSON messages and SWIFT and many other very technical compliances and standards that are too techy for me as well.

If you take a closer look at HBAR XRP XLM ALGO LINK XDC and QNT (you may also add CSPR, DAG, IOTA and LCX but I'm a bit cautious about them for different reasons) you see very similar patterns not caused by drops in BTC dominance. The patterns look like whale actions - insiders. Consider yourself lucky to be reading this right now because this is a gold mine and I'm already at about +400%. No financial advice though!

So those bad boys are taking roles in the new financial world. Some do big money (XRP), some will do retail money (XLM), some will interconnect specific regions and networks using interoperability tools (QNT), some will enhance the current outdated SWIFT network (LINK), some will take roles in Trade Finance (XDC - wow, that surge yesterday... @\_@), some will do supply chain. CSPR is actually even taking part in creating the details of these standards (watch video below about CSPR). HBAR is touching nearly all of these fields as you know.

They all have in common that they are sitting together with the current leaders of fintech, TradFi, enterprises, banks, even governments. It's basically a exclusive club and the net worth of the assets involved... well. Basically most of the money on earth.

"Last exam (Uni) in a few hours - crazy heartbeat, flu symptoms, red hot face, can't sleep ",HistamineIntolerance,1i2cq0e,2025-01-15 19:50:18,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/1i2cq0e/last_exam_uni_in_a_few_hours_crazy_heartbeat_flu/,Red_Squirrel__,,"Hey guys,
So tomorrow morning I'm going to write my (hopefully) last exam at uni. I only had five days to prepare and will probably get ripped a new one by totally failing this exam.. 

I should be sleeping by now  - obviously I'm not. I'm laying in bed for two hours now, my heart has been beating like crazy for even longer. My throat hurts, my nose feels half stuffed half runny. My face is quite red, feels hot and somehow sore. Also my hands: red an sore, skin had teared open by itself because of the dryness, a few cuts started bleeding. It feels very inflammated. 
Overall I feel somehow dizzy and a bit out of body. I'm very weak (not that tired, more like fatigue?). The symptoms now are beeing, accompanied by me having super short  breath. Laying is rough. But don't I dare to do some physical movement - my heart will completely freak out, I won't be able to breathe properly. 

And I don't ducking know what's going on! Could that be Histamine-related? 
I take Dao-enzymes 3x a day, sometimes antihistamines as well. Sometimes it helps. 
But the last few days have been horrible and I don't really now why. 

I do have high stress for the last several months, that's right. But I thought it's already a bit less stressful by now. So I wonder why I feel worse. 

Thanks and appreciation for any answer "
False negative on test from multivitamins and probiotics?,HistamineIntolerance,1i1ubfw,2025-01-15 05:09:47,1,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/1i1ubfw/false_negative_on_test_from_multivitamins_and/,belikethebison,,"Maybe this is a bit far fetched but I suspect that I might have histamine sensitivity or some kind of food allergy or something.
Ask my doctor for help and she told me to do an skin allergy test which I'm going to do. 
I ordered some multivitamins and probiotics and mu question is if I should wait to start taking those after I've done the allergy test? 
Like if the supplements can maybe help my body to deal with the histamine and I might get a false negative on the test? Some ingredients like Vitamin C and some probiotics can help do deal with histamine i have read.

I also asked my doctor to do blood test for lgE and/or DAO deficiency but she didn't even respond to that lol... some doctors seem to hate when patients try to look into things themselves...
I might be able to do those tests on my own without her help and just go to the blood testing clinic. 

I've read that the skin allergy test is not that reliable? That's why I want to do the blood test.
But first I'm going to do the skin allergy test.

So hold off on the supplements or it doesn't matter? "
Confused about supplements ,HistamineIntolerance,1i1u2oa,2025-01-15 04:51:31,5,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/1i1u2oa/confused_about_supplements/,Acceptable-Trick-725,,"Hello everyone! I am a bit confused regarding supplements and how to take them. 
So far I read here that is good to supplement with copper, B6, magnesium, zinc, vitamin C. 

I will go in couple of days to do a blood test to check for these deficiencies. Although I think I have low copper levels since I also have Hashimoto (hypothyroidism), super exhausted, skin problems, brain fog. 

My biggest issue is with the loose stools...and therefore probably lack of enough nutrients. 

My questions are:
- is copper citrate also a good option? I can't find copper glycinate in the pharmacies and also I found out can give liver toxicity (just internet search) 

- how do you take all the suplemments throughout the day? I read some posts that say that ascorbic acid interacts with copper or that zinc and copper shouldn't be taken together. Also I need to be careful to take them later due to the levothyroxine. 

- how long did you take the supplements before going to check again with a blood test?

- and maybe stupid question... Is taking Dao going to interact with any of this? 

Thank you! "
Cultivation is Creation - Xianxia Chapter 32,HFY,1i1nz0s,2025-01-14 22:00:49,24,0.93,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i1nz0s/cultivation_is_creation_xianxia_chapter_32/,RecentFeature1646,OC,"Ke Yin has a problem. Well, several problems.

First, he's actually Cain from Earth.

Second, he's stuck in a cultivation world where people don't just split mountains with a sword strike, they build entire universes inside their souls (and no, it's not a meditation metaphor).

Third, he's got a system with a snarky spiritual assistant that lets him possess the recently deceased across dimensions.

And finally, the elders at the Azure Peak Sect are asking why his soul realm contains both demonic cultivation and holy arts? Must be a natural talent.

Expectations:

\- MC's main cultivation method will be plant based and related to World Trees

\- Weak to Strong MC

\- MC will eventually create his own lifeforms within his soul as well as beings that can cultivate

\- Main world is the first world (Azure Peak Sect)

\- MC will revisit worlds (extensive world building of multiple realms)

\- Time loop elements

\- No harem

**Chapter 32: You Two Are...?**

I stood outside Wei Lin's quarters, hesitating for just a moment before knocking. The sound echoed oddly in the predawn quiet – most disciples wouldn't be awake for hours yet.

The door opened to reveal Wei Lin, shirtless and wearing a smile that faltered the instant he recognized me. His hair was disheveled in a way that suggested it hadn't been messed up by sleep.

""You're back alre—"" His expression faltered as he registered who was actually standing there. The smile shifted into something more awkward as he quickly grabbed a nearby robe. ""Ke Yin! I wasn't expecting... that is...""

""Expecting someone else?"" I couldn't help but grin at his uncharacteristic fumbling. Wei Lin, master of the smooth transaction, actually looking flustered? This was too good to pass up.

""I was just..."" He started to form what was undoubtedly going to be a perfectly reasonable explanation, when movement from around the corner caught my attention.

Lin Mei appeared, her face flushed as she tried to casually walk past. ""Oh! Ke Yin, I was just... I left some... herb catalogs here earlier...""

I looked between them – Wei Lin's lack of a shirt, Lin Mei's flustered attempt at nonchalance, the way they both seemed to be trying very hard to appear normal.

I pointed at them, my finger moving back and forth as my mind processed this new information. ""You two are...?""

Lin Mei's composure cracked first. She turned an even deeper shade of red before punching Wei Lin's shoulder, hard enough to make him wince. ""I can't believe you! We agreed to keep it quiet, and you couldn't even manage a month without being obvious?""

""He's my best friend,"" Wei Lin protested, rubbing his shoulder. ""He would have figured it out eventually anyway.""

""Best friend?"" I echoed, feeling a strange mix of happiness and guilt. While I'd been buried in cultivation and survival planning, my friends had been... living. Actually living, not just training or plotting or preparing for the next crisis.

""The path to the Dao is a lonely one,"" cultivators often said. Even at just the Qi Condensation realm, I was starting to understand why. The constant drive to improve, the endless hours of solitary practice, the weight of secrets that couldn't be shared... it was easy to lose touch with the simple human connections that made life worth living.

""I'm happy for you both,"" I said, meaning it. ""Though I have to ask – how did this happen?""

Lin Mei's blush deepened. ""He kept coming to the gardens to buy spirit herbs, but his technique for essence extraction was terrible. Absolutely wasteful. So I offered to teach him...""

""And I offered to teach her about resource management in return,"" Wei Lin finished. ""One thing led to another...""

""He means I got tired of his horrible attempts at flirting through business metaphors and kissed him to shut him up.""

I couldn't help but laugh at that. It was so perfectly *them* – Wei Lin trying to turn everything into a transaction, Lin Mei cutting straight through it with practical action.

""I should have noticed sooner,"" I admitted. ""Been a bit wrapped up in my own cultivation lately.""

Lin Mei's expression softened. ""You've had good reason to be. We all saw what happened at the arena."" She exchanged a look with Wei Lin. ""Actually, we've been worried about you. You've barely left that training ground of yours except to eat.""

""Speaking of which,"" Wei Lin cut in, apparently eager to change the subject, ""what brings you to my humble abode at this hour? Usually when you show up unannounced, it means you need something... interesting.""

Right. Business. I could tease them more later.

""I need some elemental essences,"" I said. ""Pure ones. Earth, Air, and Water.""

Wei Lin's expression shifted from embarrassed to confused. ""Elemental essences? But those are for..."" He trailed off, frowning. ""Those are materials for Elemental Realm cultivation. Why would someone at Qi Condensation need pure elemental essences?""

I shrugged. ""The World Tree Sutra is complicated.""

""It's always complicated with you."" Wei Lin ran a hand through his hair. ""Do you have any idea how expensive those materials are? You'd need at least a thousand spirit stones for even the lowest grade suitable for foundation building. That's..."" he did some quick mental math, ""about fifty times your monthly stipend as an Outer Disciple.""

""Is there no way to get them?"" I asked. ""I'm not picky about the source.""

Lin Mei looked concerned. ""Ke Yin, if you're thinking about some of the less... legal trading houses in the city...""

""Those wouldn't work anyway,"" Wei Lin cut in. ""The black market dealers water everything down. Using impure elemental essence for foundation building would be suicide."" He scratched his head thoughtfully. ""Though maybe...""

I recognized that expression. It was the same look he got when working out particularly complex trade routes.

""Let me put on a proper robe,"" he said finally. ""We need to make a few visits.""

""At this hour?""

""Best time for it, actually. Fewer eyes watching."" He disappeared into his quarters, returning moments later fully dressed in his Outer Disciple robes.

Lin Mei caught his arm as he stepped out. ""Be careful,"" she said quietly. ""Both of you.""

Wei Lin's expression softened as he looked at her. ""Always am. Don't wait up - this might take a while.""

""I know better than to wait up when you're making 'business calls,'"" she replied with a slight smile. Then she turned to me, her expression serious. ""Watch his back? He takes too many risks sometimes.""

I nodded, touched by her concern for both of us.

I waited while Wei Lin got dressed properly, my mind already running through possibilities for payment. I had some spirit stones saved up, but probably not enough for what he was suggesting.

""Right,"" Wei Lin said once he'd made himself presentable. ""Let's go meet some people who officially don't exist.""

As we walked away from Wei Lin's quarters, I couldn't resist asking, ""So...you and Lin Mei?”

""I like her."" Wei Lin smiled, then his expression turned serious. ""She's different, you know? Not like the others who just see me as a walking spirit stone purse. She actually cared about teaching me, even offered to do it for free.""

""The horror,"" I said dryly. ""Someone helping you without expecting payment?""

""I know, completely against proper business practices."" His joke fell a bit flat, and he sighed. ""Look, I know my family's reputation. The Wei clan isn't exactly known for putting relationships above profit. But with her...""

""You don't have to explain,"" I said quietly. ""I get it.""

Wei Lin led me away from the disciple quarters, taking a winding path that seemed designed to lose any potential followers. We passed through three different formation arrays that I knew were meant to detect spiritual energy, but Wei Lin had clearly done this before – he showed me exactly where to step to avoid triggering them.

""The sect actually encourages this sort of thing, you know,"" he said as we walked. ""Oh, they'll punish you if you get caught, but they want disciples to learn how to navigate underground networks. Can't be a proper cultivator without knowing how to work in the grey areas.""

""Is that what your father taught you?""

""Among other things."" He grinned. ""The cultivation world runs on resources, and official channels can only provide so much. Someone has to handle the rest.""

We ended up in a part of the outskirts of the sect I'd never seen before – a maze of old storage buildings that looked abandoned at first glance. But I noticed subtle signs of use – worn paths between buildings, recently oiled door hinges, the occasional flash of concealment formations.

""The thing about elemental essences,"" Wei Lin continued as we walked, ""is that they're actually fairly common. You can find traces of them anywhere. The problem is getting pure samples – ones concentrated enough to use for cultivation.""

He stopped in front of a particularly decrepit-looking building. ""Most disciples think they need to find natural sources – spirit veins, ancient springs, that sort of thing. But there's another way.""

""Artificial refinement?""

""Exactly. It's technically forbidden because the process is dangerous and the results are sometimes unstable. But if you know the right people...""

He knocked on the door in a complex pattern. There was a long pause, then the sound of multiple locks disengaging.

The door opened to reveal a young woman in servant's robes. But the casual way she wore them, combined with the calculating look in her eyes, suggested she was anything but a servant.

""Young Master Wei,"" she said with a slight bow. ""An early visit. And you brought a friend?""

""Someone interested in your master's special products,"" Wei Lin replied smoothly. ""Is he receiving visitors?""

She studied me for a moment, then nodded. ""Follow me. And remember the rules – no spiritual sense, no techniques, no recording devices of any kind. Break these rules and..."" She smiled, showing teeth that seemed just slightly too sharp. ""Well, let's just say the sect won't be able to find enough pieces to identify the body.""

I kept my expression neutral as we followed her inside. The building's shabby exterior was a perfect cover for what lay within – a sophisticated alchemy lab filled with equipment I'd never seen before.

Various workers moved between stations, their movements precise and practiced. None of them wore sect robes or cultivation equipment, but I could sense suppressed power in many of them. Former disciples? Rogue cultivators? It was probably safer not to know.

Our guide led us to a back room where an elderly man sat behind a desk covered in jade tablets and spirit stones. His appearance was completely ordinary – the kind of person you'd pass in the street without a second glance.

Which probably meant he was the most dangerous person in the building.

This is what I'm reading the week of 2025-01-11. I only included the ones I've added to my bookshelf to continuous reading.

**You can see my previous reading lists Here:** [**www.chaosdrifter.cc**](http://www.chaosdrifter.cc)   I'm native Chinese speaker so I read the raw from Qidian. you can try finding the English translation on [NovelUpdate](https://www.novelupdates.com), [LnCrawl](https://lncrawler.monster) or try places like [ReadOMNI](https://app.readomni.com) where Advanced LLM models are used for MTL that should be more understandable and consistent than google translate. OR you can use Chatgpt/Gemini/Claude with the chrome plugin [immersive translate](https://immersivetranslate.com/en/) (just sign up and get your own API key for the cloud LLMs)

 [**从栽下菩提树开始成神**](https://www.qidian.com/book/1040794052/) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ **(Becoming a God: Starting by planting the Bodhi Tree )** 

 **(no system, no romance, no harem, High Martial, modern world, multiverse)** 

 Imagine you are born with a rare genetic disease that inflict you with such severe pain as if your teeth are been pulled out one by one. Imagine such pain just happens randomly through the day, making it impossible to have a normal life. Imagine been the parents and having to decide wether your 1 year old son should suffer such fate, or be peacefully put out such misery without any moral judgement or legal consequences as it is sanctions by the government. and Now image you are the baby and your parents decided to keep you alive and now you've grown up to be 16 years old. and with the help of a medicine that controls the pain to only happen between 6am to 8am so you can have a ""normal life"" the rest of the day. that's the MC at the start of the novel. He has suffered through hell each day for the past 16 years, and finally he is been rewarded when he was given access to a rare Martial Visualization Map  of ""hell on earth"". The more pain one overcame, the higher power one gets. Naturally MC gets the highest reward from the Map and plants a Bodhi tree and a small plot of lands surrounded  by hell fire. This world is a modern world, but it is ruled by the High martial masters. and your mental abilities are just as powerful as the physical forces. The book is about how MC progress through the martial ladders to be the best, so read on if you like power progressions. He'll work hard for each progression. There isn't much other plots. still a good read, some philosophy stuff in it, and can be inspirational at times as well. I like the power system. 

   [**这个明星太有节目效果了**](https://www.qidian.com/book/1042016875/) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ **(This Star has so much entertainment Show Effect )**  **(Chinese entertainment, urban, system, funny, unconventional)**  

MC has a system that'll grant him things like ""more charisma, +1 to piano, the ability to always hold attention, a card to boost the popularity of a movie, this popular song from earth"" etc. etc. The rewards are earned when he surprises people with unexpected acts or answers. and he stars in a real life dating showing, so expect a lot of unexpected interactions.  Like when he finished performing a very romantic song for his partner, and people were expecting him to propose, but he just recited the lines for the show's sponsors....... There are many events and people in it that has parallel in the real Chinese entertainment world, and the songs and other stuff are not the most popular and overused ones in such novels. So far it is different enough that kept me going.

[**这个领主过于忠诚了**](https://www.qidian.com/book/1041849092/) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ **(This Lord is too Loyal)** 

**(no system, medieval, magic, modern technology, revolution, kingdom building, no harem)** 

MC is a small lord in a world set in the dark middle ages. Lords and the nobels are corrupt and treat the peasants like dirt. Priests are corrupt as well, colluding with the lords to take all the money from the poor and embezzling donations.  All in the name of the Divine Goddess who just want to help everyone. MC happens to be able to communicate with the Divine Goddess through a system like interface where she rewards him for helping the poor and destroying the corrupt aristocrats.  The rewards from the system is that MC can ask the Goddess to perform miracle things, like making gun powder, or enhance his knowledge of steam engines, etc. etc. basically a gold finger that allows him to start an industry revolution. Read if you like watching a small lord slowly build up to be the king of the world, and the Pope.(The Loyal in the title refers to the MC's loyalty to the Goddess as in he is the true believer of the Goddess's mission to help everyone)

 [**家父儒圣，系统非逼我做粗鄙武夫**](https://www.qidian.com/book/1042164464/)  ⭐️⭐️⭐️ 

**(Father is a Confucius Saint, System forces me to be a brute martial man)**  

**System, Confucius cultivation, High Martial power, scheming MC. no harem** 

MC is in an ancient world *like Ming Dynasty*. He is the second son of the governor of a state, and also a Confucius Saint. MC has a system that rewards him with Abilities, enhancements, artifacts, wonders, techniques whenever he levels up. But all the rewards are related to martial arts and not the Confucius Dao. So the MC then can dual advance both the Confucius track, and the martial art track, getting double rewards along the way. The book actually has a lot of plot twists and setups, MC is intelligent, but also brute force as well. Maybe a bit too much scheming for me.

[**穿甲弹不相信碳基怪物**](https://www.qidian.com/book/1042715250/)  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 

**(Armor Piercing Round doesn't believe in carbon based monsters)** 

**Post Apocalypse, sci-fi, military, no system, group** 

Imagine Fall out 4, but set in China. 4 elite special forces personnel found themselves transmigrated about 400 years later, to a world filled with monsters and human factions. Thankfully they still got their full military tactical weapons and gears, Like surveillance drones, Sniper Grenade launcher, rifles, pistols. And they are surprised to find archived military gears in deep buried vacuum depots that only the know how to use, as the knowledge had been lost. Again, I got lured in the by title. Most of the military equipment mentioned are Chinese made, and there are some cultural references to military memes. but over all, if you like military actions, it should still be enjoyable. Be noted that this is a new novel, so it only has like 20K words. Normally I would read such short books, but with the title, I just gotta see if it is any good. **spoiler alert**  They are about to detonate a tactical nuclear warhead in the latest chapter.

I have so much backlog of novels to keep up (as one can see from my weekly post) so I won't be adding too many new books.

If you've went this far, please also consider taking this AI translation Survey to help me find the best LLM model for MTL.

(MENTAL RELIEF AT LAST) Letter-to-self I wish I had when I was in candida pits of despair. SUMMARY AT BOTTOM - hope it helps anyone who is currently in the desperation of die-off. ,Candida,1i0majm,2025-01-13 14:29:24,44,0.97,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Candida/comments/1i0majm/mental_relief_at_last_lettertoself_i_wish_i_had/,hollypolly1993,,"Four months ago I started my journey through hell and back as I began to fight the gaslighting monster that is candida.I’ve dreamed of the moment I could say this…I have found relief.

If you are in the pits of despair right now, I am here for you.

I know you are probably feeling like you are a shell of yourself and questioning if there is any possibility for a brighter reality. This fungal overgrowth wrecks your mind. It made me irrationally angry. It made me impulsive and dopamine crazed. All the while your brain tricks you into thinking that you're just naturally becoming a horrid version of yourself.

I'm here to tell you, I am only one month into relief and my real self has RETURNED. I feel levels of cheerfulness and optimism that I hadn't in *years*. Most importantly, I feel immense *gratitude towards myself* for trusting that I actually had this controversial illness. *I changed my life.* It's extremely difficult, tedious, and slow but I stayed the course until I found my formula. You are changing your life as we speak. **Persist.**

 

NOTE: This post is more about the **mental effects of Candida,** see my other post for details on supplement/anti-fungal specifics and see brief bullet points at very bottom of regimen. Feel free to comment or dm me.

This is a letter to myself to my past-self based on 4 months of experience.

See summary at bottom if you don't want to read my novel.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Dear self,

These are going to be some of the hardest months of your life so far. Physically, you're going to  
battle migraines, fatigue, and most significant of all, a feeling of being *absolutely alone and hopeless* in your health journey. You will wake up countless nights with your ears ringing, heart beating fast, and mind racing. You will question if this is just a forgotten trauma reaction, if it's""quackery,"" and at your worst, if this is some hidden terminal  
illness.

Despite it all, you must firmly BELIEVE that you will get better or else it is not possible. Even on your worst  
days, tell yourself “This is horrible, but I will figure this out. I will get better.” Many, many people abandon their reddit posts because they GOT BETTER. After your second month of continued bouts of die-off you will feel it’s hopeless but it is NOT. PERSIST.

No one is going to understand what you’re going through. You need to immediately **lower your expectations for empathy**. Feel empathy for yourself and make a resolve to do what is needed. Say no and no and no again, without guilt. Most times they won't understand why you need to cancel, or you won't go on a certain trip, but you *don't need to explain yourself.* Just do what you need to do...the rest of  
**your life depends on these months.**

**Reddit threads will become the most encouraging resource you have.** Reading about others people's extremely similar symptoms and their healing journeys will push you into not gas-lighting yourself and remind you that this isn't a phantom mental illness, it's ***real.*** You will feel like a horrible friend, you will be worried your partner is going to leave you, and you will question if you're turning into heartless bastard sometimes... it's all OKAY. You are not a bad person, you are just *fully prioritizing yourself* for a time so you can put all your resources into healing. This isn't forever, and people will forgive you for retreating into your own isolated hole WAY quicker than you think.

Doctors (traditional) are not going to be your solution for this. The solution is taking the time to **get to know your body and your gut** ***intimately***. Your GP doc will tell you the solution is to *start to journal your menstrual cycle* every month. Give her a soft smile and resist the urge to scream.

**You are not a weak, victim-centric, neurologically screwed-up person.** Your brain is inflamed (fyi both before and after treatment as candida causes inflammation and treating it causes all your defenses to ramp up). Who knows how long you’ve been pushing through and operating on strained brain capacity. In a couple months you will realize you’re becoming yourself again.

Mentally, you must, must, must **fully commit to healing.** This needs to be the most **important thing in your life.** Everything else, aka your career goals, the state of your marriage, your ability to go and  
feel alive at a concert, your ability to travel and experience new places, your ability to harness your creativity, your ability to have fulfilling friendships, your ability to have an actual good night of sleep again....ALL depends on your healing.

You will have to have **to cut sugar. And coffee. And most carbs. And alcohol.** Constantly remind yourself that sugar feeds all cancers, inflammation and so if it means it will help you think clearly and be happier again...it's WORTH IT. The dopamine hit is not worth it. If you want to go to live shows, have casual drinks with friends, and enjoy a fancy dessert in the future, *you have to sacrifice for this time period.*

You will in fact spend hundreds of hours reading, researching, listening to youtube videos and basically becoming your own functional health expert. Every word you read (with the exceptions of rabbit-hole theories *see below*) will ***help***. You will become an expert analyzer of your stool consistency (and urine too). You will see both candida AND biofilms in your stool and you will get giddy knowing that you're  
*not crazy.* You will fight revulsion as you look at others' stool pics online but then feel relief when you see pretty much *exact* matches to what you're dealing with. The **physical proof does not lie.**

You will get ***paranoid*** about many things, including but not limited to parasite infestation, mold-exposure, autoimmune disease, covid-vaccine reaction, MCAS genetics, cancer, ptsd, and you will get a bit obsessive. This is part of the mental die-off effects. Your brain is so desperate for answers it's acting like a stimulated wild rabbit that clings to any possible explanation. Take deep breaths, *do not* discuss your dozens of theories with other people (lol), and remember there is no ***quick solution*** to anything in life. This will be a multi-month/maybe year(s)-long trial and error process that your life depends on.

Try many supplements BUT try and refrain from ordering ***anything*** when you are in the pits of a die-off episode. You will have 20-30 different supplements now sitting unused on your shelf that you ordered when your brain was in a fog of drunk-candida haze and die-off pain. Don't complicate it too much. W**rite out your symptoms constantly**  your brain starts to recognize the 3 or 4 MAIN symptoms and directs your attention towards the right reddit posts, medical studies, etc.

Calm your nervous system **throughout the day.** You mind will be so overwhelmed and inflamed that  
meditation will feel almost impossible. Reading mindfulness books for 10 or 20 minutes a day will provide a bit of grounding. Lay down for 10 minutes throughout day and deep breathe. Go outside and talk a walk. Listen to soft music. You MUST do everything you can to calm your nervous system during this time as your inflammation and emotions will be a rollercoaster.

Do not expect ***to feel happy and yourself.*** Do not expect yourself to be productive, to get extra projects done, to have a clean and organized house, to host people like usual. Your body and mind are in a BATTLE. ***Accept*** that you’re in a hard place, take care of yourself and KNOW that it’s just temporary. The cheerfulness, optimism, and general positivity for life that you vaguely remember WILL come back. (from current day self….it’s back baby).

After months of trying everything, dozens of supplements and vitamins, experiencing harsh die-off effects, you will finally find a formula that give you sweet, sweet RELIEF. You will feel joy almost immediately and you will be able to eat a variety of things again. You had to put in the work to find what works for your gut/body specifically. But you did it, and now your life is starting to *return to a normal you forgot existed.* Your sex drive is returning, you're not over stimulated as easily, your tolerance for loud noises and people is expanding, your gratitude and curiosity for life is increasing with every day. People will even tell you that you look better, *more awake.*

 

SUMMARY (lol this “sum up” is longer than I intended but I tried):

1.     You must BELIEVE that you will get better or else it is not possible. Even on your worst days, tell yourself “This is horrible, but I will figure this out. I will get better.”

2.     Don’t expect empathy. You need to show empathy to yourself and be strong in your resolve to put yourself first for a period of time while you figure this out.

3.     Read reddit threads. They will become the greatest resource to believe in you intuition about this illness (so you don’t gaslight yourself) and your ability to believe in healing.

4.     Doctors (traditional) will disappoint you and write off your symptoms as mentally fabricated. Don’t get discouraged and stay dedicated to taking accountability for your own health. When you start to heal you’ll think back and know you were RIGHT.

5.     Get to know your body and your gut *intimately*. Pay attention to all triggers (things like food, caffeine, even body lotion etc.) You’ll begin to notice things you always blocked out (such as histamine intolerance) and you’ll begin to trust your bodies alarm signals.

6.     You are not a weak, victim-centric, neurologically screwed-up person. Your tired brain will bully you and weaken your self-esteem. Remember who you used to be and *trust* that you will be that person again just not right now and it’s OKAY (you may even be better than you were before as you might have been unknowingly battling this for *years*, even decades). You’re not an angry person that’s just angry candida dying off. Try not to react to the people around you during this time.

7.     Healing must become the most important thing in your life for this time period. Don’t get distracted by a dream trip, a seemingly complicated marriage, a new restaurant that opened up, remember that you need a strict temporary lifestyle to beat this thing. Don’t expect to feel happy or like yourself for awhile. *Accept* this is a low point but it’s necessary for you to become yourself again.

8.     Calm your nervous system in any way that you can. Music, deep breathing, walks in nature. It helps so much more than you think to aid the supplements/anti-fungals to do their thing.

9.     It’s all worth it. You found your magic formula. Every sacrifice you made brought you to this day. Your life can start to begin again.

Diving into the Liquidity Pool: Week 35,ethtrader,1i09llu,2025-01-13 03:33:34,5,0.65,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1i09llu/diving_into_the_liquidity_pool_week_35/,DBRiMatt,Donut,"Here are two other sources I find helpful for those wanting to understand a bit more on how and why liquidity positions change.

[Impermanent loss, text explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12dducc/impermanent_loss_simple_explanation_liquidity) | [Binance Academy, video explanation](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained)

**Current state of the pool & the last week of trading**

Total Value locked in [Sushi.com](https://sushi.com/) is $ 38.76 k

* 3.36484 ETH
* 8198240 DONUT
* Trading Volume in last 24 hours = **$** **446.14**
* Trading Volume in last 7 days = **$ 3.23k**
* In the last 7 days ETH is has moved **-12.8%**
* In the last 7 days DONUT has moved **-20.5 %**
* Last week 1 ETH = **880.93k** **DONUT**
* Today 1 ETH = **972.46k** **DONUT**
* **4852.24** **DONUT** per day distributed amongst all in range positions.

The sell-off has continued into this week, with the DONUT/ETH price ratio briefly hitting 1 Million DONUT per ETH. A few buy orders since has seen the current price ratio of 972k DONUT per ETH.

For those who have previously sold, now could prove to be a great time to buy back some of that governance power, restoring full governance weight while still walking away with profits. 

For those hoping to sell, with such an imbalance left in the assets in the pool, higher levels of slippage will be experienced.

2024 saw some major developments as well as major funding spent on dev work which included things such as the migration to Arbitrum, bridging assets, completely overhauling the DAO rewards from upvotes to tips, topic limiters and all sorts of coding for Donut-Bot.

2025, all these expenses are behind us, so, let's see where the next leg of the journey takes us!"

"First time trying Innotox, 36 hrs later",DIYCosmeticProcedures,1hzy5bz,2025-01-12 16:56:59,29,0.95,16,https://i.redd.it/lpdo1rxaxmce1.jpeg,Individual_Skin_9517,Botox ,"Hello everyone! 

I’ve been lurking here for a bit and felt confident to try Innotox. I’m already seeing some changes and it looks like they’re in the right direction. I am still a novice at diy for this and wondering if there’s anything starting I should watch out for that I’m not seeing. I know it will take a few more days to see full results, but was really impressed with what’s happening thus far. The top photos are before, the bottom photos are 36 hrs later. 

I prefilled 24 syringes with 2 units each. I meant to start with 1 but realized after the first round of 6 injections I’d actually filled with 2 (🤦🏻‍♀️ lesson learned) so I did the remainder with 2 units as well. I used a face map I found on this subreddit, and I watched about a dozen total YouTube videos demonstrating each area. I did 7 injections in the frontalis, 5 injections for the glabella, 4 injections in each obicularis oculi, and 2 injections for the dao muscles. 

I can see relaxing beginning in all the parts, and I am especially pleased to see the subtle difference in the dao muscles. I was worried about that spot as it seems to be an easy one to mess up. I had to really strain to try to get my mouth corners down in the after photo. 

Thanks for reading and any feedback ☺️"
Perfumelab.me order review,DesiFragranceAddicts,1hzpek1,2025-01-12 10:44:24,59,0.94,22,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hzpek1,zazozy,Review :7_Review:,"So I bought a 999rs set of 24x 9ml edp perfumes from perfumelab.me. Here's my amateur review-


It takes them about 2 weeks to deliver my order... Shitty delivery service by xpressbees. But it's fine I guess.
So in the box, I had 4 bundles of 9ml glass bottles, which were adequately packed, and one acrylic stand for them.
Here is what I thought about them- 


Creed Aventus - Definitely nothing like the original. No signature pineapple note at all. Not. Fruity or sweet enough. Very mildly spicy instead. Not bad smelling, but just not Aventus. 6/10


Seductiva Men by Roja - I don't know what this perfume is. Couldn't even find it on fragrantica. Veryyy sweet, almost borderline cloying, beast performance, smells like chocolate cookies (imagine chocolate jim jam) but even sweeter. Should've been a bit milder, then it would've been a great scent. Particularly for women. 6/10


Dior Sauvage - I've ordered this tester from them about 3 times now. I didn't really want it this time, but they included it in the set so... whatever. Good performance, nice consistent smell throughout all my past orders. Woody, smells better in dry down, but I don't really like this DNA...it's become a bit too common for me. Still my friends like this one. 7/10


Allure Homme Sport by Chanel - one of my personal favourites from this website. I've ordered a 55ml bottle once before. Very very nice clean smell. This is what like a clean sophisticated, successful man must smell like lol. Performance is decent enough great for office. 8.5/10 Nice buy.


1 Million by Paco Rabbane - Citrusy fruity bitter orange, mildly sweet type opening. Nice and mild. Turns into green-ish later on... Performance doesn't seem all that great 6.5/ 10


Hugo by Hugo Boss - Nice Aromatic, slightly spicy and fresh as well. Blends well. Very normal perfume-like-perfume. Performance seems average at best. 7/10


Hugo Man by Hugo Boss - I hate this one. It smells like Jalapeño Nachos from movie theatres lol. Spicy, medium longevity. Drydown is better, but I would not wear it anywhere. Ive also previously bought this one as well, and it does get exponentially better after a couple of months. But i still don't like it well enough.
5/10


Legend by Mont Blanc - I just cannot figure out the scent. Its not bad, but it's nothing noteworthy as well. It's ""clean"". Nothing more nothing less. Nothing fruity or sweet about the opening as well as people say about it... Might do well for office wear, but lasts like a few hours on clothes at best. Also doesn't project anything. 5.5/10


Individuel by Mont Blanc - Absolutely 0 performance... Doesnt last more than 15 minutes. Smells very similar to Legend, but just the overall worse in everything. Even fainter scent. 2/10


Tobacco Vannile by TF - It's just what its name suggest. Tobacco notes and sweet vanilla notes both at once. Very linear. Nice overall. Though some might feel the vanilla to be a bit extra sweet and dominant in the dry down (not in a good way). Might be very good for evening wears. 7.5/10


Sensual Whisper by Frederic Malle (or whatever it's called) - straight up fevicol. Better in the dry down. I couldn't even find what this is supposed to smell like. 2/10


Wanted by Azzaro - Nice. Quite nice. Aromatic opening, slightly spicy, slightly citrusy. Becomes a teensy bit sweeter soon. Decent performance. 7/10


Acqua Di Gio by GA - As expected. Fresh, marine, aquatic notes, slightly green, my first aquatic scent so I might be biased. Quite great for Summers, longevity a bit average. 8/10


Aqva Pour Homme by Bvlgari - Better opening than ADG, a lot more greenish and musky in the drydown. Also quite good. 8/10


Polo Blue by Ralph Lauren - Nice Blue ozonic,  aromatic scent. Longer lasting as well. Good for casual wear and office wear. A proper ""manly"" scent, similar to fragrantica notes. 7/10 


Bleu de Chanel - Another repeater in my orders. As expected, clean nice smell, nothing extraordinary, haven't smelled the original, but it's nice. But there's a problem in consistency. In my 1st order it smelled so fricking good that I ordered a 110 ml bottle. But then the 110 ml bottle juice was not as great. It was underwhelming. Now this 9ml also seems decent enough.7/10


Blue Jeans by Versace - citrusy aromatic opening, flowery dry down, good balance. Seems to check out on fragrantica. Nice. 7.5/10 might buy another one sometime.


Tam Dao by Diptyque - Opening very fresh, and green. Like freshly cut vegetables for some reason. My first impression was veggie prep for a bhel like coriander and onion lol. Drydown smells really nice and aromatic. Not that special though. 6.5/10


Ultra Male by JPG - Opening is sweet. Smells fruity and like some berries I don't know. Stays similar throughout, though the berry fades and vanilla stays. Nice for dates ig (if u got them.. plus you can say I smell like Ranbir Kapoor tonight 🫠) 7.5/10


Oud Wood by Tom Ford - Smells nice Oudy Woody 😂.. slightly more sweeter than i would've liked. Quite long lasting. There are definitely better Woody scents out there. 7.5/10


CK One - citrusy green, fresh, clean, aromatic. One of the best in the lot. Quite long lasting as well. Nice for daytime and casual wear. 8/10


L'eau d'Issey Pour Homme by Issey Miyake - like ck one but better. More depth, slightly darker, very good. Will definitely order a big bottle in summer. 8.5/10


Coolwater by Davidoff - it's coolwater. Anyone can make a clone of it now... Just get one from your nearest attar shop. It's nice only.7/10


Baccarat Rouge 540 by MFK - Sickeningly sweet. Caramel plus rosey notes. Avoid unless you can handle the sweetness. Otherwise good. Beast performance...doesn't wash away even after using soap water. 6/10


Honourable mentions from previous orders-

Le Male by JPG - Very nice coconuty Vanilla. Fell in love with the original at the first sniff, the clone is also very nice. Currently using it.

Libré by YSL - Stunningly similar to the original EDT. Long lasting as well. Very nice. Will recommend getting it to the ladies here.

Boss Bottled - Very nice Woody scent, great for all time use. Later dries into a nice vanilla. Pretty great.

Lemme know what you guys think.

RPGs that play well on console,gaming,1hznmvm,2025-01-12 09:19:34,0,0.46,216,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hznmvm/rpgs_that_play_well_on_console/,Pyro1934,,"Looking for suggestions on games that play well and smoothly on console that are very RPG immersive (I don't really know all the subgenres)
- BG3: amazing game but was pretty clunky with menus and inventory so I ended up quitting on console and buying on steam. First game in a decade that got me to play on PC
- Dragon Age Veilguard/Hogwarts Legacy: solid games, but the combat was way too timing based for what I enjoy. I'm not a Souls type or games that require specific timing on blocks/parrys/dodges. I prefer slower play such as...
- Dragon Age Inquisition: lots of RPG elements and immersiveness, but not as much as Origins which was amazing. The combat and gameplay felt very natural and fluid on console however and the slower combat is much more what I'm looking for than DAV or Hogwarts or Souls
- Elder Scrolls games (recently ESO): again good mix of RPG elements and smoothness, though a bit light on RPG recently. Combat and gameplay is great though.
- DA Origins: Pinnacle of what I'm looking for, the RPG elements were deep and amazing, yet the gameplay and were both relaxed enough for me to enjoy and very smooth playing on console (I think, it's been ages).


I prefer fantasy settings but not terribly opposed to sci-fi or something. Looking for something that utilizes all/most my controller buttons and maybe a few simple button combos (shortcut + button type thing) but is not overly complex. Gameplay and combat I really want something more strategic or chill, I don't play games to worry about constant timing stuff turn based is fine tho I do enjoy a mix of tactical/action like DAO and DAI had. Build and party complexity are a huge plus for me!


Thanks for suggestions!"
Modern Bitcoin Portfolio Management: Leveraging the Staking Ecosystem,u_Hungry_Fix_3994,1hzmfpj,2025-01-12 08:16:14,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Hungry_Fix_3994/comments/1hzmfpj/modern_bitcoin_portfolio_management_leveraging/,Hungry_Fix_3994,,"The landscape of Bitcoin portfolio management has undergone a remarkable transformation in 2024. With institutional holdings exceeding $160 billion and the emergence of sophisticated staking infrastructure, portfolio managers now have access to a diverse range of yield-generating strategies while maintaining Bitcoin's core value proposition.

# The Evolution of Bitcoin Asset Management

Traditional Bitcoin portfolio management focused primarily on buy-and-hold strategies or basic lending. Today's landscape offers far more sophisticated options through the emergence of robust staking infrastructure. Base layer protocols including Babylon Chain, Avail, SpiderChain, and Mezo have established the foundational security necessary for institutional-grade staking services, enabling portfolio managers to explore new yield-generating opportunities without compromising on security.

# Infrastructure Layer Innovations

The development of comprehensive staking infrastructure has revolutionized portfolio management approaches. Arqos's Value Alignment Vaults represent one approach to customizable staking strategies, while BitDAO's Mantle network focuses on building a complete ecosystem around their mBTC token. Avail, through their Fusion protocol, offers another perspective on Bitcoin staking integration, particularly appealing to institutions seeking robust security guarantees.

# Liquid Staking Integration

Major institutional players have recognized the potential of liquid staking tokens (LSTs) in portfolio management. Coinbase's cbBTC on Base network, Kraken's kBTC, and Mantle's mBTC each offer unique approaches to maintaining liquidity while generating yields. These solutions enable portfolio managers to maintain necessary liquidity while participating in staking activities.

# Managing Liquidity in Staking Portfolios

Liquidity management has evolved significantly with the introduction of unified liquidity solutions. Arqos's MeldBTC initiative aims to create a comprehensive liquidity hub, while platforms like Avail's Fusion and SpiderChain are developing their own approaches to liquidity management. These solutions help portfolio managers balance yield generation with liquidity requirements.

# Risk Management Framework

Modern portfolio management must consider the unique characteristics of staked Bitcoin assets. The emergence of various staking protocols offers different risk-reward profiles. Base layer protocols like Babylon and Mezo provide foundational security, while built-on solutions offer additional features and potentially higher yields with corresponding risk adjustments.

# Yield Optimization Strategies

Portfolio managers now have access to multiple yield sources through various staking approaches. Each protocol offers unique advantages: Babylon Chain provides base layer staking capabilities, Arqos enables customizable vault strategies, and SpiderChain focuses on specific yield generation mechanisms. Understanding these differences allows for sophisticated yield optimization strategies.

# Cross-Chain Portfolio Management

The ability to manage Bitcoin exposure across multiple chains has become increasingly important. Solutions from established players like Coinbase (cbBTC) and emerging platforms like Mantle (mBTC) enable portfolio managers to optimize their Bitcoin allocation across different blockchain ecosystems while maintaining underlying Bitcoin exposure.

# Institutional Considerations

For institutional investors, the selection of staking infrastructure requires careful consideration of several factors. The security track record of base layer protocols like Babylon and Avail, the sophistication of middleware solutions like Arqos, and the market acceptance of LST solutions all play crucial roles in portfolio construction decisions.

# Future Portfolio Innovation

The continued development of Bitcoin staking infrastructure suggests further innovations in portfolio management strategies. The expansion of protocols like SpiderChain and Mezo, combined with sophisticated liquidity solutions, points toward increasingly flexible and efficient portfolio management options.

# Strategic Portfolio Allocation

Modern Bitcoin portfolio allocation must consider the entire ecosystem of available solutions. This includes base layer staking through protocols like Babylon and Avail, liquidity provision through unified solutions like MeldBTC, and strategic use of LSTs from established platforms like Coinbase and Kraken.

# Conclusion

The evolution of Bitcoin portfolio management reflects the maturation of the broader Bitcoin financial ecosystem. Through the development of sophisticated staking infrastructure, from base layer protocols to comprehensive platforms, portfolio managers now have access to a diverse range of tools for optimizing Bitcoin holdings while maintaining security and liquidity.

As the ecosystem continues to develop through innovations from both established players and emerging protocols, we can expect to see increasingly sophisticated approaches to Bitcoin portfolio management that leverage the full potential of these new financial primitives.

Bitcoin and Traditional Finance: The Convergence of Two Worlds,u_Hungry_Fix_3994,1hzmf9g,2025-01-12 08:15:29,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Hungry_Fix_3994/comments/1hzmf9g/bitcoin_and_traditional_finance_the_convergence/,Hungry_Fix_3994,,"The integration of Bitcoin into traditional financial systems represents one of the most significant developments in modern finance. As we progress through 2024, this convergence has accelerated, driven by institutional demand and the development of sophisticated infrastructure that bridges the gap between digital and traditional assets.

# The Evolution of Institutional Bitcoin Integration

The landscape of institutional Bitcoin adoption has transformed dramatically. With corporate treasuries now holding over $160 billion in Bitcoin, the focus has shifted from simple custody solutions to sophisticated financial instruments that generate yield while maintaining security. This evolution reflects growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin's role within the broader financial system.

# New Financial Primitives

The emergence of innovative financial infrastructure has been crucial in bridging the traditional finance gap. Base layer protocols like Babylon Chain, Avail (through Fusion), SpiderChain (from Botanix Labs), and Mezo have established the foundation for secure Bitcoin financial services. Building on these protocols, comprehensive platforms like Arqos are developing sophisticated staking infrastructure, while projects like BitDAO's Mantle network are creating robust ecosystems around their Bitcoin-backed tokens. These developments create familiar financial primitives while preserving Bitcoin's unique characteristics.

# The Role of Unified Liquidity

Liquidity fragmentation has historically been a significant barrier to institutional adoption. The development of unified liquidity solutions addresses this challenge directly. Arqos's MeldBTC initiative aims to create a unified liquidity layer, while platforms like Avail's Fusion and SpiderChain are developing their own approaches to liquidity management. These various solutions work to create efficient liquidity pools and reduce friction between different Bitcoin-based assets, making Bitcoin more accessible to traditional financial institutions.

# Institutional Access Points

Major financial institutions have developed various approaches to Bitcoin integration. Coinbase's introduction of cbBTC on the Base network represents one approach to bridging traditional and digital finance. Similarly, Kraken's kBTC and Mantle's mBTC offer different solutions for institutional Bitcoin exposure, each catering to specific market needs and regulatory requirements.

# Risk Management Evolution

Traditional financial institutions require sophisticated risk management tools. The development of Bitcoin staking infrastructure has introduced new ways to manage risk while generating returns. Value Alignment Vaults, in particular, offer customizable risk profiles that align with institutional requirements while maintaining the benefits of blockchain technology.

# Regulatory Framework Development

The regulatory landscape has matured significantly, providing clearer guidelines for Bitcoin's integration with traditional finance. This clarity has enabled the development of compliant financial products and services, from regulated custody solutions to yield-generating instruments that meet institutional standards.

# Cross-Border Settlement Innovation

Bitcoin's role in cross-border settlements has evolved beyond simple transfers. New infrastructure enables more sophisticated international transactions, with staking and liquidity solutions providing additional utility for institutions operating across borders. This development addresses long-standing inefficiencies in traditional cross-border settlement systems.

# Yield Generation in Traditional Finance

The integration of Bitcoin yield generation into traditional financial services represents a significant evolution. Through sophisticated staking infrastructure, institutions can now offer Bitcoin-based yield products that compete with traditional financial instruments while maintaining necessary security and regulatory compliance.

# Market Structure Advancement

The market structure supporting Bitcoin's integration has matured considerably. Professional trading venues, institutional-grade custody solutions, and sophisticated liquidity management tools now provide the infrastructure necessary for meaningful institutional participation.

# Technology Integration Challenges

While significant progress has been made, challenges remain in integrating Bitcoin with legacy financial systems. Solutions like Value Alignment Vaults address many of these challenges by providing familiar interfaces and risk management tools while maintaining Bitcoin's core benefits.

# Future Integration Pathways

The future of Bitcoin's integration with traditional finance appears increasingly interconnected. The continued development of sophisticated infrastructure, including staking and liquidity solutions, suggests a future where the boundaries between digital and traditional finance become increasingly blurred.

# The Role of Financial Innovation

Innovation in Bitcoin financial infrastructure continues to drive integration with traditional systems. Platforms developing comprehensive solutions for staking, liquidity, and yield generation are creating the bridges necessary for deeper institutional adoption while maintaining Bitcoin's fundamental value proposition.

# Conclusion

The convergence of Bitcoin and traditional finance represents a fundamental shift in how financial services are delivered and consumed. Through the development of sophisticated infrastructure, including staking solutions and unified liquidity mechanisms, Bitcoin is becoming increasingly integrated with traditional financial systems while maintaining its core characteristics of security and decentralization.

As this integration continues, we can expect to see further innovations in how Bitcoin interacts with traditional finance, driven by continued development of infrastructure that bridges these two worlds while preserving the unique benefits of both.

How to Tokenize Bitcoin Assets for DeFi Use Cases,u_Hungry_Fix_3994,1hzmann,2025-01-12 08:08:19,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Hungry_Fix_3994/comments/1hzmann/how_to_tokenize_bitcoin_assets_for_defi_use_cases/,Hungry_Fix_3994,,"The tokenization of Bitcoin assets has emerged as a crucial development in the evolution of decentralized finance, enabling Bitcoin holders to participate in the broader DeFi ecosystem while maintaining exposure to Bitcoin's value proposition. With over $160 billion in Bitcoin held by companies alone, the potential for tokenization to unlock this liquidity is substantial.

# The Evolution of Bitcoin Tokenization

The journey of Bitcoin tokenization began with simple wrapped tokens but has evolved into a sophisticated ecosystem of financial instruments. Today's tokenization solutions offer varying degrees of decentralization, security, and utility, catering to different user needs and risk preferences.

# Understanding Modern Tokenization Methods

# Wrapped Bitcoin Solutions

Traditional wrapped Bitcoin solutions like wBTC provided the first bridge between Bitcoin and DeFi ecosystems. However, these solutions often require centralized custody, creating potential security risks and trust requirements.

# Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)

The emergence of liquid staking has introduced a new paradigm in Bitcoin tokenization. Major players are rapidly entering this space - Coinbase has launched cbBTC on Base network, Kraken offers kBTC, and Mantle network is deploying mBTC with significant traction in Eastern markets. Through base layer protocols like Babylon and middleware solutions like Arqos, users now have multiple options to stake their Bitcoin while maintaining liquidity through LSTs. This expanding ecosystem offers several advantages:

* Maintained exposure to Bitcoin's value
* Generated yield through staking
* Enhanced liquidity through tradable tokens
* Reduced counterparty risk through decentralized infrastructure

# Implementation Considerations

# Technical Architecture

When implementing Bitcoin tokenization, several key factors require attention:

First, the choice of underlying infrastructure is crucial. Base layer protocols provide the security foundation, while middleware solutions like Arqos offer the tools needed for flexible token implementation and management. This layered approach ensures both security and usability.

Second, the vault structure must be carefully designed to accommodate different use cases. Some users might prioritize liquidity, while others focus on maximizing yield. Modern middleware solutions like Arqos enable customizable vault configurations, while platforms like BitDAO's Mantle network and Coinbase's Base focus on building comprehensive ecosystems around their tokenized Bitcoin offerings. This diversity in approaches provides users with multiple options based on their specific needs and risk preferences.

# Risk Management

Proper risk management is essential in tokenization implementations. This includes:

* Regular security audits of smart contracts
* Clear documentation of risk factors
* Transparent reporting of vault activities
* Multiple security layers for asset protection

# Use Cases in Modern DeFi

# Yield Generation

The most immediate application of tokenized Bitcoin is yield generation. Through liquid staking solutions, Bitcoin holders can earn returns while maintaining exposure to Bitcoin's price movement. Platforms like Coinbase's cbBTC and Kraken's kBTC have made this accessible to institutional investors, while middleware solutions like Arqos are working to expand these capabilities to a broader range of users and use cases. This has become particularly relevant as institutions seek ways to generate yield on their Bitcoin holdings, with platforms like Babylon Chain providing the underlying security infrastructure.

# Collateralization

Tokenized Bitcoin serves as valuable collateral in DeFi protocols. The integration of LSTs into lending platforms creates new opportunities for leverage while maintaining the security benefits of the underlying Bitcoin network.

# Future Developments

The Bitcoin tokenization landscape continues to evolve rapidly. The development of more sophisticated infrastructure and middleware solutions suggests a future where Bitcoin's massive liquidity becomes increasingly accessible to DeFi applications while maintaining security and decentralization.

# Practical Implementation Steps

For organizations looking to implement Bitcoin tokenization:

1. Evaluate your specific needs and use cases
2. Choose appropriate infrastructure partners
3. Implement necessary security measures
4. Design user-friendly interfaces
5. Establish clear risk management protocols

# Conclusion

Bitcoin tokenization represents a crucial bridge between traditional Bitcoin holding and modern DeFi capabilities. Through careful implementation and the use of appropriate infrastructure and middleware solutions, organizations can unlock new value while maintaining the security and trust characteristics that make Bitcoin valuable.

As the ecosystem matures through developments in base layer protocols like Babylon, middleware solutions like Arqos, and major institutional platforms like Coinbase's Base and Kraken's infrastructure, we can expect to see increasingly sophisticated tokenization solutions that maintain security while enabling new financial primitives. The growing Multi-BTC ecosystem, supported by various approaches to tokenization and yield generation, suggests a future where Bitcoin's liquidity becomes increasingly accessible and productive while maintaining its core value proposition.

Thoughts on Veilguard (spoilers),DragonAgeVeilguard,1hyphy4,2025-01-11 00:58:49,0,0.29,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/DragonAgeVeilguard/comments/1hyphy4/thoughts_on_veilguard_spoilers/,Serraphym,,"Hi guys! I just finished my first PT of DAV. Just for fun, I thought I'd do a brain dump.   
SPOILERS AHEAD!  
  
My Rook: Female Mage. Veil Jumper. Spellblade. Romanced Lucanis.   
  
The beginning was slow. As with all games, but this one felt rather painful. I reached a point around Lvl 12 or so where I just stopped playing for a while as I found the combat very repetitive. Eventually, I picked the game back up and overall, I'm glad I did!  
  
It was a fun game. Beautiful, dynamic, and very cute and heartwarming at times. Overall, I do feel like it lacked the ""soul"" that many Bioware games have had in the past. Although the companions were overall very dynamic and had their own personalities and hobbies, I didn't feel as connected to them as I have ones in DAO, DA2, or even DAI (or the Mass Effect games, but I'll focus on Dragon Age for this). 

Maybe it was (what seemed to me) the lack of banter. Admittedly, I didn't start stopping by the Lighthouse routinely until mid-late game, so I think I missed out on quite a bit of chatter. However, although I overall enjoyed each character, something about how they interacted with my Rook seemed overall dry. 

I enjoyed their individual quest lines (admittedly some more than others), however it seemed that some choices you could make, or convince them to make, seemed much more impactful than others (>!like Emmrich's lichdom vs Bellara's keeping the archive.!<) I did, however, very much like the fact that each companion's individual choice then affected their abilities and gear. It gave it a very nice extra depth. 

Romance-wise, and I realize now that Lucanis was probably one of the more tame options, I'm personally rather unsatisfied. I feel like as the ""angsty-but-sweet demon-possessed assassin who is married to his work"" there was *a lot* of missed potential for Lucanis's romance. Not enough angst. Not enough tension. And hell, not enough of him cooking dinner for Rook. Next PT I'll probably go Team Emmrich. 

I know this game gets a lot of hate for being ""too woke"", and while I think that's a bit of an overreaction, I guess I see where they're coming from. Taash's non-binary story line was sweet, but it did seem a little forced and out of place at times. I still enjoy Taash as a character, but something it just seemed like the whole NB issue was tacked on haphazardly.

Personally, I prefer when companions have sexual preferences. To me it makes them more human instead of a blanket pan mentality. However, I see that for a game, it makes things much easier. 

Although DAV did have some choices the player could make, overall it felt much more linear than say, DAO or DA2. No matter what, the outcome was pretty much the same. Which, again, isn't bad as a videogame, but Bioware's past ""choices matter"" has set the bar pretty high for me. 

It was a bit of a immersion-breaker to be running around in the final battle looking for chests, loot, and Codex entries. Overall not a huge issue, but if I'm speeding on my way to fight Gods, I personally don't want to have to worry about whether or not I've checked every nook and cranny while the castle is falling down around me. 

The finale was both amazing and disappointing. Visually stunning. The feeling of running against the clock to fight the Old Gods was pretty well captured, and I very much enjoyed seeing >!Solas tussle with the Arch Demon!< as my team and I ascended. The final battle against Elgernan, however, seemed a bit anti-climactic.  it was fun, sure, but almost a bit *too* easy (played on highest difficulty). Admittedly, I chose the option to talk to >!Solas with Mythal's essence!< , so I may have robbed myself of some game there.  Also, that twist at the end with >!Varric!< was 10/10, but a great ending to a character who has seen us through >!three different games.    !<

Finally, it was a little disappointing knowing that I couldn't load my game and just go wander around the now saved world, or that NG+ wasn't an option. Maybe in the future they'll add it, but I doubt it. Overall, I'd give DAV a 7,5/10 as a game, but maybe a 6/10 as a Bioware legacy. "

Endgame Gear OP1 8K Purple Frost,MouseReview,1hycu2p,2025-01-10 14:36:16,50,0.89,40,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hycu2p,Kozmoos,Endgame,"Hey guys, I finally managed to get my hands on a op1 8k purple and I want to post my first review. Any tips for future posts are welcome. I'll also take some inspiration from u/Burak887 with this post.

***Me:***

* Hand size - 19x10cm
* Grip style - Palm/Claw Grip
* Previous mouse - Dav3

***Specs:***

* Weight - 51.5g
* Sensor Model - PixArt PAW 3950
* Polling Rate - 1000 / 2000 / 4000 / 8000Hz
* Lift Off Distance - 0.7mm / 1mm / 2mm
* Wheel Encoder - TTC silver
* Primary Mouse Button - Kailh GX switches
* Side Button Switches - Kailh GM 2.0 switches

**Unboxing and Design:**  
The packaging is sleek and minimal, which I personally like. The mouse comes with the small skates preinstalled and an additional set of full skates (I believe both are 99,5% PTFE), grip tape and a screwdriver.

**Comfort/Shape**:  
I was a bit scared of buying it as I was previously palm gripping a Dav3 and it would've been the first small mouse I would own, but it turned out to be the best shape I have used yet, being able to have the same grip consistently, unlike with a gpw or dav3. True endgame for me.

**Build Quality:**  
The mouse feels exceptionally solid in hand. Slight creaking when squeezing it from the sides but that's expected as it is frosted, not noticeable at all in-game. 

**Coating**:  
The coating is amazing. feels dry, smooth but not slippery,  becoming more grippy as your hands warm up. Might notice a few fingerprints but a quick wipe with a microfiber cloth and it's gone.

**Cable**:  
The cable is very thin and using a mouse bungee, the Camade in my case, it is barely noticeable. It's noticeable only when it touches the mousepad, more pronounced on vertical movements. I believe it might be due to me using it on a aqua control zero which is rather rough, as it feels better on a smoother pad like the Tang Dao X. Probably using it on a glass pad or a very smooth pad would be ideal.

**Skates**:  
The skates that came preinstalled feel very good, I would consider them balanced in terms of speed. I still use them and they are thick enough to not scratch the Tang Dao X, which is 6mm thick. Can't say anything about how they feel on glass as I currently don't own any glass pad but hopefully will in the future.

**Clicks**:  
They feel incredibly good, pretty light and easy to spam, no pre/post travel, wobble or grinding at all on my copy. The Kailh GX Switches are the best performing switches available with the fastest actuation, but the ms difference isn't something everyone will notice.

**Side buttons:**  
No pre travel, minimal post travel, without any wobbling. Very tactile but a bit heavy for me.

**Scroll wheel:**  
Feels great, pretty light and defined steps, some say it is too small but I find it perfect for me.

**Sensor:**  
The main difference between the 3950 and 3395 is that the 3950 supports motion sync at 8k which I don't use either way, but the overall performance feels incredible. Personally, it feels better than the dav3.

**Conclusion:**  
Amazing mouse for the price (paid 80usd for mine), the only downside being the cable and creaking which is only noticeable when purposefully squeezing it from the sides. Except that, it is the fastest in terms of sensor and click latency and is great in every other aspect. Perfect shape for me, if you have similar or smaller hands I would definitely recommend trying it out. As u/Burak887 said in his review, if you're not willing to go back to wired, you can buy the op1w 4k, which has the same shape and everything except it has max 4k polling rate, the PixArt PAW3395, is 7g heavier, and is wireless.

Thanks a lot if you've read all the way, and sorry in advance if there are some spelling or expressing mistakes. As I said in the beginning, any tips for future posts would be awesome !"
"How to deal with a Jerk: Zhuangzi Chapter 4, passages 1 & 2 commentary",taoism,1hy15y9,2025-01-10 05:02:47,17,0.95,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/1hy15y9/how_to_deal_with_a_jerk_zhuangzi_chapter_4/,MaximusCapacitance,,"Much of the Zhuangzi book up to Chapter 4 dealt with situations that relate more towards our inner thought process. Chapter 4 however, places us right amidst the turmoil of society. Thus it is titled ""Man in the World"". This makes it one of the most helpful chapters in this book.

While I'm sure many people would love to find some sustainable way to be a hermit in the forest, the reality is that most of us are living in a society among other people, and many of those people commit harmful acts against themselves and others because they do not view things with clarity. In Chapter 4, Zhuangzi takes us out of the temple in the mountains, and sends us to the court of a tyrannical ruler. Can his mind-opening approach to life be helpful in a place like that? Let's find out.




""Yan Hui went to see Zhongni, and asked leave to take his departure. 'Where are you going to?' asked the Master. 'I will go to Wei' was the reply. 'And with what object?' ""



Yan Hui tells Zhongni that he is leaving to Wei. Zhongni asks him what the purpose of the trip is.



 "" 'I have heard that the ruler of Wei is in the vigour of his years, and consults none but himself as to his course. He deals with his state as if it were a light matter, and has no perception of his errors. He thinks lightly of his people's dying; the dead are lying all over the country as if no smaller space could contain them; on the plains and about the marshes, they are as thick as heaps of fuel. The people know not where to turn to.""



Seems the ruler of Wei is a bit of a know-it-all, and yet lets his state fall apart without taking any fault for it. While this passage deals with a ruler, it's safe to say that most people have ran into a person or two like this. It's just that in the case of a ruler, the consequences are more widespread.



"" I have heard you, Master, say, ""Leave the state that is well governed; go to the state where disorder prevails."" At the door of a physician there are many who are ill.""



Zhongni's advice to Yan Hui is essentially same as the modern adage ""don't try to fix what isn't broken"", and the inverse of that.



""I wish through what I have heard (from you) to think out some methods (of dealing with Wei), if perhaps the evils of the state may be cured.' ""

​

Yan Hui believes that employing Zhongni's teachings could help ""cure"" the problems in the way Wei is ruled, and therefore its tyrannical ruler. Zhongni himself is not so convinced.

​

""Zhongni said, 'Alas! The risk is that you will go only to suffer in the punishment (of yourself)! The right method (in such a case) will not admit of any admixture. With such admixture, the one method will become many methods. Their multiplication will embarrass you. That embarrassment will make you anxious. However anxious you may be, you will not save (yourself). ""



Zhongni warns Yan Yui that there is a good risk of getting punished in this pursuit. He advises not to add anything extra to the ""right method"". If we are to go off the writing in this book up to this point, that ""right method"" is likely the way of following the Dao.

Now, the way of the Dao is could be described as an adaptive responsiveness that permits no bias or rigid attachments to beliefs and ideas that might blemish the clear view of a situation. It isn't any particular method.

If you add anything extra to the way of the Dao, likely that means you are attaching to a more fixed notion of how to do things, and this can lead you in circles and compromise your clear view of the situation. You may find yourself struggling to adapt to a changing situation, and in the case of trying to change a tyrant this is at the least embarassing and at worst dangerous.



""The perfect men of old first had (what they wanted to do) in themselves, and afterwards they found (the response to it) in others. If what they wanted in themselves was not fixed, what leisure had they to go and interfere with the proceedings of any tyrannous man?""

​

This is to say, ""you cannot help others until you have already helped yourself"". You have to know what you're doing and be steadfast in your efforts, otherwise your efforts to help others will be hampered by your own folly.

""Moreover, do you know how virtue is liable to be dissipated, and how wisdom proceeds to display itself? Virtue is dissipated in (the pursuit of) the name for it, and wisdom seeks to display itself in the striving with others. ""



This is to say, that if you are being virtuous just so that others will see you as virtuous, then you are not being virtuous in a geniune manner. Furthermore, going out of the way to exhibit how wise you are to others often undermines the very wisdom itself... particularly the wisdom of the Dao, which is unconcerned with name and image.



""In the pursuit of the name men overthrow one another; wisdom becomes a weapon of contention. Both these things are instruments of evil, and should not be allowed to have free course in one's conduct.""



He warns that using wisdom to boost your name among others makes it more like a weapon to one-up people rather than a resource to better yourself, which is no good for anybody.



""Supposing one's virtue to be great and his sincerity firm, if he do not comprehend the spirit of those (whom he wishes to influence); and supposing he is free from the disposition to strive for reputation, if he do not comprehend their minds;-- when in such a case he forcibly insists on benevolence and righteousness, setting them forth in the strongest and most direct language, before the tyrant, then he, hating (his reprover's) possession of those excellences, will put him down as doing him injury. He who injures others is sure to be injured by them in return. You indeed will hardly escape being injured by the man (to whom you go)!""

This is one of the most important warnings in the Zhuangzi text. While the Daoist philosophy can be life-changing and there are many Daoists who are sincere in their ideas without employing them for reputation's sake, if you go around preaching Daoist ideas to everybody then some of them may resent you for it, assuming you are trying to come across as better than them and therefore slightling them. A tyrannical personality may particularly take issue with such a presentation, and in the worst case may even lash out of you.

This doesn't just apply to trying to convince a tyrant to chill out. It can happen in the workplace, at school, or even at home. So it's good to remember that you can walk the way without making a big show out of it, and people might respect you more for it.

​

""Further, if perchance he takes pleasure in men of worth and hates those of an opposite character, what is the use of your seeking to make yourself out to be different (from such men about him)? ""



This is another warning. It isn't just that some people might be slighted by preaching of the Daoist way, or making a show of practicing it. It's also a fact that many people are diametrically opposed to the Daoist mindset and surround themselves with similar company. These people don't just have a few rigid beliefs or attachments... they are immersed in them, and will defend them with force if necessary. Thus, it wouldn't be wise to make a show of your lack of such things.



""Before you have begun to announce (your views), he, as king and ruler, will take advantage of you, and immediately contend with you for victory. Your eyes will be dazed and full of perplexity; you will try to look pleased with him; you will frame your words with care; your demeanour will be conformed to his; you will confirm him in his views. In this way you will be adding fire to fire, and water to water, increasing, as we may express it, the evils (which you deplore).""



When trying to change somebody in a position of power who is self-righteous and tyrannical, you are often stopped before you begin. Such people can often be very coercive, and as a result you may find yourself actually conforming to such a person's false beliefs and actually making them worse. This can even apply to a typical bully.



 ""To these signs of deferring to him at the first there will be no end.""



Give an inch and they take a mile.



 ""You will be in danger, seeing he does not believe you, of making your words more strong, and you are sure to die at the hands of such a tyrant.""

​

In response to being essentially bullied into going along with a tyrant, you might become tempted to express your true views in a more aggressive manner. Even an aspiring sage trying to change the world can be pushed too far... and in the case of a tyrant this means you may be executed.

The broad lesson here seems to be that when dealing with rigid and difficult people you neither want to preach at them nor give into them out of fear. Either one of these approaches can lead to being a target in the end.



""And formerly Jie killed Guan Long-feng, and Zhou killed the prince Bi-gan. Both of these cultivated their persons, bending down in sympathy with the lower people to comfort them suffering (as they did) from their oppressors, and on their account opposing their superiors. On this account, because they so ordered their conduct, their rulers compassed their destruction - such regard had they for their own fame. ""



Even those who would like to be in the good favor of the people and thus sympathize with them openly can meet punishment if those people are ruled by a tyrant. Sometimes you can do more good from the inside than from attempting to oppose the status quo. At least in one case you're still around to help the best you can. 



""(Again), Yao anciently attacked (the states of) Cong-qi and Xu-ao, and Yu attacked the ruler of Hu. Those states were left empty, and with no one to continue their population, the people being exterminated. They had engaged in war without ceasing; their craving for whatever they could get was insatiable. ""



​In this demonstration Zhongni points out that rulers who crave more and more often drain their population and lose hold of their state. It's also a common Daoist teaching that insatiable striving can tax the body and lead to an earlier death, so perhaps it can be seen in this manner as well.



""And this (ruler of Wei) is, like them, one who craves after fame and greater substance - have you not heard it? Those sages were not able to overcome the thirst for fame and substance - how much less will you be able to do so!""



He points out that many sages have tried to change a tyrant's mind, and were unsuccessful. How then, is Yan Hui to help the ruler of Wei see things in their proper light?



""Nevertheless you must have some ground (for the course which you wish to take); pray try and tell it to me.' ""

​

Having laid out his warnings, he asks Yan Hui his plan for this endeavor. 

​

""Yan Hui said, 'May I go, doing so in uprightness and humility, using also every endeavour to be uniform (in my plans of operation)?' ""



Yan Hui outlines a plan where he will be humble, proper, and use his every action towards his plan of changing the ruler of Wei's mind.



"" 'No, indeed!' was the reply. 'How can you do so? This man makes a display of being filled to overflowing (with virtue), and has great self-conceit. His feelings are not to be determined from his countenance. ""



Zhongni objects that simply being humble and upright to show the tyrant the way wouldn't work, since the tyrant already believes himself to be overflowing with virtue of his own and is conceited. He also warns Yan Hui that he cannot assume how the tyrant feels from his outward demeanor alone. There is great vanity hidden under the surface.



""Ordinary men do not (venture to) oppose him, and he proceeds from the way in which he affects them to seek still more the satisfaction of his own mind. ""



The people do not try to oppose this tyrant out of fear, and so he believes he is right in what he does and even seeks more out of them for his own satisfaction.



""He may be described as unaffected by the (small lessons of) virtue brought to bear on him from day to day; and how much less will he be so by your great lessons?""



Every day has many small lessons to learn from, particularly if you are doing things in a way that isn't working. The consequenses of such mishandling are the lessons, but this tyrant isn't concerned by these consequences. Much less, the great lessons from a humble sage.



""He will be obstinate, and refuse to be converted. He may outwardly agree with you, but inwardly there will be no self-condemnation - how can you (go to him in this way and be successful)?' ""



Zhongni makes a good point here. Sometimes selfish people who do not learn from their mistakes might come across as if they agree with you on certain virtues, but it's just an act so they can be liked and feel better about themselves. Inwardly they still feel like they can do no wrong.



""(Yan Hui) rejoined, 'Well then; while inwardly maintaining my straightforward intention, I will outwardly seem to bend to him. I will deliver (my lessons), and substantiate them by appealing to antiquity. ""



Yan Hui adjusts his plan to Zhongni's advice, proposing that he will be inwardly determined to change the tyrant yet outwardly subservient to him, and give lessons to the tyrant by ""appealing to antiquity"". This would be sort of like reading a verse from this very text to an argumentative person so that you could say it is ancient wisdom rather than criticism for them from you yourself. 



""Inwardly maintaining my straightforward intention, I shall be a co-worker with Heaven. When I thus speak of being a co-worker with Heaven, it is because I know that (the sovereign, whom we style) the son of Heaven, and myself, are equally regarded by Heaven as Its sons.""



In the Daoist tradition, ""the way"" is often seen as the way of ""heaven"". He is saying that both him and the tyrant arose from this heaven or the Dao, and that by inwardly keeping his intent to set this ruler on the way of the Dao he is being a coworker to heaven.



""And should I then, as if my words were only my own, be seeking to find whether men approved of them, or disapproved of them? In this way men will pronounce me a (sincere and simple) boy. This is what is called being a co-worker with Heaven. ""



If he tries to find out if men approved of his lessons or not by stating them as if they were merely from himself only, then they would consider him sincere but childish.



""Outwardly bending (to the ruler), I shall be a co-worker with other men. To carry (the memorandum tablet to court), to kneel, and to bend the body reverentially - these are the observances of ministers. They all employ them, and should I presume not to do so? Doing what other men do, they would have no occasion to blame me. This is what is called being a fellow-worker with other men.""



Yan Hui plans to carry out his duties for the tyrant of Wei as if he was any other ordinary joe in his state, relinquishing himself of any sort of conflict with the ordinary people.



""Fully declaring my sentiments and substantiating them by appealing to antiquity, I shall be a co-worker with the ancients. Although the words in which I convey my lessons may really be condemnatory (of the ruler), they will be those of antiquity, and not my own. In this way, though straightforward, I shall be free from blame. This is what is called being a co-worker with antiquity. May I go to Wei in this way, and be successful?' ""

When he tries to teach the tyrant the way, he will disguise his criticisms as ancient wisdom to bypass being condemned by him.

 "" 'No indeed!' said Zhongni. 'How can you do so? You have too many plans of proceeding, and have not spied out (the ruler's character). Though you firmly adhere to your plans, you may be held free from transgression, but this will be all the result. How can you (in this way) produce the transformation (which you desire)? All this only shows (in you) the mind of a teacher!' ""

Zhongni is still not convinced, pointing out that Yan Hui really knows nothing about this tyrant's character and yet has many convoluted plans on how to deal with him. He concludes that the most he will get from his endeavor is not to be condemned for his lessons, but nothing more. He will just be seen as a teacher rather than somebody to be inspired to change by. This is a good lesson to apply when dealing with people in everyday life; people rarely really take what you're saying in if they think you're trying to ""teach"" them.



""Yan Hui said, 'I can go no farther; I venture to ask the method from you.' ""



Yan Hui finally concedes that he doesn't have a solid plan to change this tyrant. 



""Zhongni replied, 'It is fasting, (as) I will tell you. (But) when you have the method, will you find it easy to practise it? He who thinks it easy will be disapproved of by the bright Heaven.'  ""



Zhongni states that ""fasting"" is the method for Yan Hui to convert this tyrant, and that it isn't an easy skill to practice.



""Hui said, 'My family is poor. For months together we have no spirituous drink, nor do we taste the proscribed food or any strong-smelling vegetables;-- can this be regarded as fasting?' ""

Yan Hui takes this perhaps a bit too literally, asking if his literal fasting of food is the correct type he is talking about.



""The reply was, 'It is the fasting appropriate to sacrificing, but it is not the fasting of the mind.' ""



Turns out that this is a 'fasting' of the mind, not the stomach.



"" 'I venture to ask what that fasting of the mind is,' said Hui, and Zhongni answered, 'Maintain a perfect unity in every movement of your will, You will not wait for the hearing of your ears about it, but for the hearing of your mind. You will not wait even for the hearing of your mind, but for the hearing of the spirit.""



Zhongni is saying to make every aspect of action towards his intention unified towards that intention. Instead of allowing his thoughts to interfere with his perception of the situation, he should just take in what is going on as it is, thus only receiving the ""hearing of the spirit"". 



""Let the hearing (of the ears) rest with the ears. Let the mind rest in the verification (of the rightness of what is in the will). But the spirit is free from all pre-occupation and so waits for (the appearance of) things. Where the (proper) course is, there is freedom from all pre-occupation; such freedom is the fasting of the mind.' ""



The ears and mind may have their own derivative notions of what is going on and the proper course to take, but the spirit isn't attached to anything except what is actually happening without anything filtering that reality. The pre-occupied thoughts of the mind can be blurred lenses of the reality the spirit recieves, and this blurring of reality can lead to misjudgement of something such as a tyrant's character. Thus, thoughts are the food that the mind must fast from in order to be free enough to take the proper course of action.



""Hui said, 'Before it was possible for me to employ (this method), there I was, the Hui that I am; now, that I can employ it, the Hui that I was has passed away. Can I be said to have obtained this freedom from pre-occupation?' ""



In other words, the fasting of the mind requires you to diminish your biased ego, notions, and sense of prescribed identity to the point that it is as if you have ""passed away"". Yan Hui having achieved this level of ego-reduction asks if he is now free from pre-occupations.



""The Master replied, 'Entirely. I tell you that you can enter and be at ease in the enclosure (where he is), and not come into collision with the reputation (which belongs to him). If he listen to your counsels, let him hear your notes; if he will not listen, be silent. ""



This is to say that with the fasting of the mind Yan Hui will be able to be at ease even in the palace of a tyrant without challenging his reputation. Zhongni advises him to pick and choose when to give the tyrant lessons by being adaptive and flexible. In modern terms, ""time and place"". 



""Open no (other) door; employ no other medicine; dwell with him (as with a friend) in the same apartment, and as if you had no other option, and you will not be far from success in your object.""



Furthermore he advises Yan Hui to even be a friend to the tyrant as if this was his only option in life as he sticks steadfastly to the fasting of his mind from pre-occupied thoughts.



""Not to move a step is easy; to walk without treading on the ground is difficult. In acting after the manner of men, it is easy to fall into hypocrisy; in acting after the manner of Heaven, it is difficult to play the hypocrite. I have heard of flying with wings; I have not heard of flying without them. I have heard of the knowledge of the wise; I have not heard of the knowledge of the unwise.""



People who profess what they think is the one and only true way often fall into hypocrisy, but since the way of following the Dao presumes no single ""right"" way, it is difficult to be hypocritical. He likens such hypocrisy to ""flying without wings"" and ""the knowledge of the unwise"". In other words, it's talking without saying really anything at all. 



""Look at that aperture (left in the wall); the empty apartment is filled with light through it. Felicitous influences rest (in the mind thus emblemed), as in their proper resting place. ""



Felicitous means ""well suited to the circumstance"". Felitous influences are inherently in our mind and rest there, so when we clear our mind of pre-occupied thoughts we can figure out the right thing to do at the proper time and place. Sort of like how when a window isn't dirty the sunlight can shine clearly through it without impediment and light up the room.



""Even when they do not so rest, we have what is called (the body) seated and (the mind) galloping abroad. ""



Even when the thoughts in your mind are galloping around, you can still keep your body ""seated"" and ground yourself. This could be done by simply sitting, shutting your eyes, and taking deep breaths. 



""The information that comes through the ears and eyes is comprehended internally, and the knowledge of the mind becomes something external: (when this is the case), the spiritual intelligences will come, and take up their dwelling with us, and how much more will other men do so! All things thus undergo a transforming influence.""



This is where it gets cool. Zhongni (therefore Zhuangzi) is saying that when you can properly practice fasting of the mind and clear your pre-occupied thoughts away, the outer world and inner world become as if they are one in the clarity of our perception. This unity can bring about spiritlike perceptiveness and a way of being that will attract other people to you without you even striving to do so because you are seeing and acting in harmony with true reality. This can have a transformative effect on your environment, and eventually the world. This is quite a radical message if you think about it, but it also makes sense considering that every viral trend started with one person and spread to the rest of the world. In other words, you must shine so bright that the light goes viral.



""This was the hinge on which Yu and Shun moved; it was this which Fu-xi and Ji-qu practised all their lives: how much more should other men follow the same rule!' ""



Yu and Shun are former rulers in China who were noted for their compassionate characters and resourceful nature. Fu-xi is actually considered a Daoist diety in some traditions. Zhongni attributes their achievements to following the way, keeping their thoughts centered on reality rather than wandering about from one preoccupation to another. This way is also referred to as the ""hinge"" of the Dao.

Model 15-3 Single Action Restoration,Revolvers,1hxxc4i,2025-01-10 00:27:25,190,0.99,1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hxxc4i,PzShrekt,,"Had an ex-LAPD (I suspect it’s LAPD or some other SoCal PD) model 15-3 I had for a while that was double action only. Non-bobbed hammer but had the single action engagement surface filed off from the factory as was standard practice for police guns of the day.

Today I finally got a replacement k-frame hammer, and with a swap of the DA sear from my old hammer, I managed to restore the single action function again, and retained the DA function.

If you have an ex-PD gun that’s DAO and are interested in restoring the SA at home, I suggest you do some reading on it before hand to understand the mechanics of the DA and SA relationship, as whilst these parts should just drop in, sometimes you need to do a bit of stoning.

KEEP IN MIND: The DA sear is a specially fitted part individualized to every gun, so you may need to do some stoning and filing work to shorten it, that is usually outside the scope of anyone’s abilities, SW What or any gunsmith specialized in revolvers can do that for you.

Safety checks:
- Ensure no hammer push off in full cock in SA mode with high thumb pressure (rock solid)
- Ensure trigger pull in SA is not lighter than weight of gun itself (read 5.2 lbs roughly). If you don’t have a trigger weight scale, pull the hammer back and place your finger on the trigger. Let the weight of the gun fall onto your trigger finger whilst keeping your thumb on the hammer spur for balance, if the hammer doesn’t fall, you can be sure that the SA pull weight is not lighter than the gun itself and should be safe."
Lotus Pier Discussion Conference,MoDaoZuShi,1hxuf44,2025-01-09 21:42:28,15,0.89,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoDaoZuShi/comments/1hxuf44/lotus_pier_discussion_conference/,Queasy_Answer_2266,Discussion,"The discussion conference at Lotus Pier following the Second Siege of the Burial Mounds is the point of no return for Jin Guangyao's reputation. With the double blow of Sisi's and Bicao's revelations coming so soon after Jin Guangyao tried to massacre all the clans, the cultivators at Lotus Pier make an about-face: Not only are they willing to accept Wei Wuxian's claims and firsthand testimonies to Jin Guangyao's crimes, they themselves begin wildly speculating about everything else Jin Guangyao might have done wrong with very little evidence. Since the text explicitly compares these to the many unsubstantiated rumors concerning Wei Wuxian, there are some who argue that we can dismiss out of hand all the accusations made against Jin Guangyao in this scene, even when he confesses to them later on. However, a closer examination of the claims made in this scene may show that they cannot be so easily ignored.

The first such claim comes immediately after Sisi's testimony, when Wei Wuxian asks whether she has any proof to back up her claims \[Chapter 85\]:

>“Do you have any evidence to back up what you’ve said?” Wei Wuxian asked.

>Sisi hesitated for a moment, then said, “No. But if I told a single lie, let my corpse rot without even a mat to wrap it in!”

>Sect Leader Yao immediately piped up. “She spoke in such clear detail. She’s definitely not lying!”

Let us recall the contents of Sisi's story again. She claimed that Jin Guangyao hired twenty prostitutes including herself to rape his father to death. Fine. That is fairly plausible. Then, Jin Guangyao killed all of them but left her alive. Why? That makes no sense. Jin Guangyao would never hesitate to kill someone if it was necessary to protect such an important secret, and Sisi claimed that he actually did kill all twenty other prostitutes. It sounds like Sisi forgot to prepare an explanation for how she survived to testify about her (presumably fake) story and came up with something very unconvincing on the spot. And then this mysterious man rescued her just in time for her to accuse Jin Guangyao of patricide when everybody was beginning to turn against him. Who is this mystery man? How did he find Sisi? Did he know about the siege in advance? This story has more holes in it than Jin Zixun.

And then Sect Leader Yao jumps in to argue for the veracity of Sisi's claims because she ""spoke in such clear detail""—i.e., she included enough sensational details to inflame the emotions of anyone who did not notice the many inconsistencies in said details, while also being careful not to give any details concerning the location or anything else that could allow her story to be confirmed. So clearly, she is telling the truth. Perceptive as always, Sect Leader Yao. Yet it is a fact that every word Sisi said was the truth. Not even the most flagrant deniers will dispute this. So how do we resolve the apparent contradiction? Quite simply, just because Sect Leader Yao is an idiot does not mean that everything he says is wrong. He is equally likely to stumble upon the truth by accident as he is to stumble upon a falsehood. And it is not for nothing that MXTX puts a true statement in Sect Leader Yao's mouth at this point in the narrative specifically.

After Bicao's testimony, we get a few more accusations. First, Jin Guangshan is accused of raping Qin-furen, which he definitely did. Next, someone notes that Jin Guangyao had to marry Qin Su to gain the support of Qin Cangye, which would allow him to advance in the ranks of the Jin Clan. Whether he ""had"" to gain Qin Cangye's support is debatable, but this certainly would have been a motive in Jin Guangyao's decision. He is also described as a ""maniac without equal in all the world,"" which is . . . fairly accurate, actually, if a bit of an exaggeration. Then, of course, we have Sect Leader Yao's accusation that Jin Guangyao murdered his son. Since asserting that this is an example of a true rumor would be begging the question, I will confine myself to noting that this claim did not originate with Sect Leader Yao but rather with Qin Su. If MXTX really wanted us to take Jin Guangyao's murder of his son as just another one of Sect Leader Yao's silly theories, then why would she have introduced it through someone much more trustworthy?

Next, Wei Wuxian begins questioning Bicao, and I want to call attention to a specific part of their conversation:

>“You guarded this secret for so many years,” Wei Wuxian said. “Why did you decide to tell her so suddenly? And why the equally sudden decision to reveal it to us?”

>. . . Wei Wuxian smiled. “But did you never consider the blow you would deal her by revealing the truth to her? Or are you really that clueless? Qin Su committed suicide specifically because you told her about this.”

That last sentence is false, and Wei Wuxian knows it. While in the paper body, he saw Jin Guangyao gaslighting Qin Su into thinking that he was the victim and that the incestuous marriage was her fault, and then threatening her with torture if she did not tell him who sent the letter. Shortly afterwards, he waved a dagger full of resentful energy in her face, with which she proceeded to stab herself. Obviously, learning of the incest made Qin Su particularly vulnerable to these manipulations, but it is unfair to accuse Bicao of being the sole reason for Qin Su's suicide, or even the primary one. The reason why Wei Wuxian does so is because he has no interest in further establishing Jin Guangyao's guilt. Sect Leader Yao is doing a good enough job of that. Instead, he wants to question the testimonies of Bicao and Sisi so that the other cultivators will actually think for once and stop accepting all these unsubstantiated rumors as facts. Needless to say, he was unsuccessful.

More generally, I think that many people look at the way Wei Wuxian talks about Jin Guangyao in this scene and say, ""Well, Wei Wuxian is arguing in Jin Guangyao's favor, so we should too."" The reason Wei Wuxian is questioning Jin Guangyao's guilt is not because he suddenly changed his mind and decided that Jin Guangyao is a good guy after all. In fact, immediately after this scene, he goes to Yunping in order to catch Jin Guangyao and bring him to justice. So why does Wei Wuxian speak out in this scene? Because he is annoyed by how idiotic the cultivators are being and criticizes their reasoning, or lack thereof—yet he does not disagree with their conclusions. And it is interesting that those who use this statement as evidence that Jin Guangyao was not responsible for Qin Su's death ignore that Wei Wuxian accuses him of manipulating her into committing suicide twice in Chapter 50. Nor is there any reason to think that his views on the matter have changed since. He is simply providing a counterweight to the prevailing opinion, as he is wont to do, and not actually trying to exonerate Jin Guangyao.

A bit later, we have another interesting accusation:

>“In the past, Jin Guangyao climbed to the top, one step at a time, only by ingratiating himself with Chifeng-zun and Zewu-jun. How else could the son of a prostitute sit in his seat today? To think he would murder Chifeng-zun so viciously! And Zewu-jun is in his clutches right now—I just hope nothing bad happens to him!”

The first part is true insofar as having the political support of two clan leaders was instrumental in Jin Guangyao's rise to power, though perhaps saying that it was ""only"" because of their support is inaccurate. But I want to focus specifically on the second part of this statement. Remember that Nie Mingjue died in public of a qi deviation, in the exact same way that every clan leader of Qinghe Nie had died before him. As far as nearly everyone in the Jianghu knows, there is no cultivation technique capable of artificially inducing a qi deviation. Wei Wuxian did mention the spirit turmoil music during the Second Siege, but no one knows that it was used to kill Nie Mingjue, or that it is capable of permanently damaging someone's qi. To take a modern analogy, it would be as though Nie Mingjue had died of a terminal disease from which he had suffered all his life, and that had killed all his ancestors, and whose symptoms could not be confused with poison or anything else, and then someone claims that he had been murdered. It makes no sense to say that Jin Guangyao had killed Nie Mingjue, yet it is true.

The speaker then observes that ""Zewu-jun is in his clutches right now,"" which, again, he has no way of knowing. Jin Guangyao could have been the victim of an actual assassination attempt (he clearly has a determined enemy), and Lan Xichen only went there to help him recover. Yet this man asserts, without evidence, that the supposed assassination attempt was faked and that Jin Guangyao used it to take Lan Xichen hostage. As we learn a few chapters later, he was entirely correct. Knowing Jin Guangyao's cunning and deceptive nature, he surmised that it could not have been a coincidence that he was incapacitated just in time to prevent him from attending the siege that would destroy all the clans, and that he would not have hesitated to take even his best friend hostage to protect himself from potential retribution. Is it so wrong, then, to accuse Jin Guangyao of other crimes based upon his canonical characteristics?

Next, someone accuses Jin Guangyao of killing all of his illegitimate half-brothers other than Mo Xuanyu to ensure that he would have no competition as Jin Guangshan's successor. Since we know nothing about these people, we have no way of confirming or refuting this claim. However, we do know that Jin Guangyao was involved in Mo Xuanyu's disgrace, and there are many reasons to suspect the widely circulated account of these events (see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoDaoZuShi/comments/1fn8hz9/mo_xuanyu_and_jin_guangyao/) for an elaboration). What is more, we *can* verify the next accusation, that ""he must have had something to do with Jin Zixuan's death too!"" Whether or not one holds Jin Guangyao to be responsible for Jin Zixuan's murder or not (and I would be very much in favor of the former), it is clear that he had ""something to do"" with it, since he was the one who plotted the ambush and deliberately lured Jin Zixuan there. Given Jin Guangyao's rather liberal attitudes towards fratricide, I see no reason to dismiss the claim that he killed his other brothers out of hand, though it cannot be taken as canon either.

The accusations then shift to the subject of Xue Yang:

>“Anyone here still remember Xiao Xingchen? Bright moon, cool breeze, ever-distant Xiao Xingchen. And the case of the Chang Clan of Yueyang? Lianfang-zun was the one who did all he could to preserve the life of the culprit, Xue Yang.”

This is correct. According to Lan Wangji's account, when Nie Mingjue stormed into Jinlintai to demand Xue Yang's execution, when none of the other clans made any objection, when even Jin Guangshan was to ashamed to protest, Jin Guangyao was the one who begged Nie Mingjue to stay his saber. When arguing with Nie Mingjue shortly afterwards, he did not even attempt to conceal the fact that he was helping Xue Yang escape justice, only ""justifying"" his actions by appealing to his own ambitions. Another speaker theorizes that the Lanling Jin Clan may have resented Xue Yang for rejecting their offer to join them as a guest cultivator, which would have been one of their motivations in turning down his appeal to have Xue Yang executed. This is also a possibility—Jin Guangshan would have been petty enough to hold a grudge over something like that—though we cannot say for sure. It is also claimed that Jin Guangyao proceeded to get rid of Xue Yang, which happens to be false, though not for lack of trying. And it is interesting that the one time that the cultivators at Lotus Pier actually attribute a good deed to Jin Guangyao, it turns out that it never happened.

And then with regard to Jin Guangyao's tenure as a spy in Qishan:

>“I heard Jin Guangyao didn’t go undercover in the Wen Clan of Qishan with honest intentions. He planned to stay with the Wen Clan if the Sunshot Campaign did not go well, being Wen Ruohan’s toady and helping him do his evil deeds. But if the Wens fell from power, he would double-cross them and play the hero.”

>“Wen Ruohan’s probably rolling in his grave. He considered Jin Guangyao his trusted aide and trained him as such. Most of Jin Guangyao’s sword techniques were taught to him by Wen Ruohan!”

As for the first claim, we have no idea what Jin Guangyao planned to do if the Sunshot Campaign failed in spite of the intelligence that he provided. He might have planned to stop spying and side fully with the Wens, or he might have planned to continue resisting them as best as he could. However, it is not entirely unreasonable to suggest that he would have been fine with serving a murderous tyrant, seeing as he did not even wait for Wen Ruohan's body to cool down before he helped install another murderous tyrant. The second claim is demonstratable true based on what we know from the empathy session (and again, something that the speaker here had no way of knowing). In contrast to all the other servants, Jin Guangyao alone was granted permission to stand in Wen Ruohan's presence, even to the point of casually conversing and joking with him. The fact that Wen Ruohan was willing to turn his back on an armed man who had once served a clan that was currently fighting a war with him speaks for itself.

The next accusation is that Nie Mingjue was only captured by Wen Ruohan because Jin Guangyao deliberately provided him with fake intelligence. We hear in Chapter 49 that ""Nie Mingjue received intelligence that led him to launch a surprise attack in Yangquan,"" and given that Jin Guangyao was the main source of his intelligence during the Sunshot Campaign, it is reasonable to assume that he provided this information also. Was it intended to lead Nie Mingjue into a trap? Again, we do not know for sure. But if we assume that the answer is yes, it would seem that Jin Guangyao planned out the entire sequence of events in the Scorching Sun Palace in advance, luring Nie Mingjue there so that he would have a diversion to allow him to kill Wen Ruohan, which actually casts him in a more positive light.

Now, regarding the watchtowers—I have written quite a lot in this subject, but for now I will confine my remarks to observing that while pressuring all the other clans in pouring their financial and human resources into building the watchtowers, Jin Guangyao was happy to entrust Xue Yang with the Yin Tiger Tally and to make sure that no watchtowers would be built in Yi City so that he could commit mass murder with impunity. By Wei Wuxian's estimate, tens of thousands of lives were lost during Xue Yang's reign of terror. So the cultivators at Lotus Pier were completely correct in saying that ""all our good faith's gone to the dogs,"" though I would question how much good faith they had to begin with. Whether Jin Guangyao actually embezzled some of the money that had been contributed to the watchtowers is impossible to say for sure, but we can be quite confident that his motives for putting all the other clans to such trouble, and even slaughtering an entire clan whose opposed him, were not purely altruistic.

Finally, in summary, we have the following list of Jin Guangyao's crimes that had been ""proven"" by the mob at Lotus Pier:

>“So it seems that this Jin guy killed his father, his brothers, his wife, his son, his master, his friends…and even committed incest. How terrifying!”

It may seem implausible that one man could have so much blood on his hands, but the fact is that Jin Guangyao confesses to every one of these crimes in his final moments \[Chapter 108\]:

>“Lan Xichen! All my life, I’ve lied to countless people and I’ve harmed countless others. It’s just like you said. I killed my father, killed my brothers, killed my wife, killed my son, killed my teachers, killed my friends—I’ve committed every crime there is!”

Those who doubt the veracity of this confession, as it happens, are among those who lay great emphasis on the relationship between Jin Guangyao and Lan Xichen, who insist, as Jin Guangyao says in the following sentence, that ""Never have I ever wanted to hurt *you*!"" But if we assume that, for once, Jin Guangyao is expressing his true feelings without any filter, that what he is now describing represent his true feelings about Lan Xichen—is it really fair to say that he was perfectly willing to lie just a few seconds ago, but now he is speaking all the truth and only the truth? This short passage is the one and only time in the book when Jin Guangyao own up to the enormity of his crimes, the one moment he confesses without any of his ""I had no choice"" and ""they made me do it"" nonsense. Shall we disbelieve him even now? Xue Yang said it best: “Who woulda thought—you bought every single lie, but now that I’m telling the truth it’s a no-sell?”

In conclusion: The cultivators at Lotus Pier accuse Jin Guangyao of numerous crimes without any proof, in many cases even contrary to the available evidence, yet most of what they say is verifiably correct. The rest of their claims, with one or two exceptions, cannot be corroborated or refuted. The assertion that every accusation against Jin Guangyao during the discussion conference is false is objectively wrong, as is the claim that Jin Guangyao could not possibly have killed his son because Sect Leader Yao says that he did. Just because Sect Leader Yao is an unreliable source for truth does not make him any more reliable as a source for falsehood. The reason that Wei Wuxian criticizes the gossipmongers is not because he thinks that they are wrong about Jin Guangyao, but because they are being idiots and acting as though whatever random accusation they make up is gospel truth. But we, the readers, have evidence for these crimes, and it is not unreasonable at all to agree with some of the accusations made by these people even when we disagree with their methods.

Above, I mentioned that Wei Wuxian compared the rumors that were spread about Jin Guangyao in this scene to those that were spread about him near the end of his first life. I think that this parallel is actually quite informative, since if we consider what the gentry say about Wei Wuxian—most of it is actually correct. At the discussion conference in Jinlintai and at Nightless City, they accuse him of desecrating corpses, of killing indiscriminately during the Sunshot Campaign, of killing the overseers in the concentration camp, and of killing three hundred people in Qiongqi Path including Jin Zixuan. Wei Wuxian did all of those things.  Of course, Sect Leader Yao and his friends omit crucial pieces of context, such as the fact that everybody at Qiongqi Path (besides Jin Zixuan) was actively trying to kill him, but the accusations themselves are not wrong. Regarding Jin Guangyao's actions too, these cultivators are missing context—but the context is that he committed these crimes out of self-interest, in precise opposition to Wei Wuxian.

I specified the rumors that were being spread about Wei Wuxian by the gentry, since we do see entirely absurd accusations made about him, but only among the common people. For instance, in Chapter 113, Wei Wuxian mentions the claim that he would kidnap thousands of virgins and dual-cultivate with them in his cave in the Burial Mounds. The proper parallel to these rumors is not what happens at Lotus Pier, but rather what Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji overhear in the tavern:

>“How would you know if he was being stupid? He was Jin Guangshan’s spawn, maybe he was promiscuous too. Maybe he had unique tastes. Maybe he had…heh, a special relationship with Sisi?”

>“Ha! I agree, but don’t the rumors say that Jin Guangyao was so frightened by his sinful fornication with his blood sister that he wound up with a certain…unspeakable affliction? Even if he had the intent, he didn’t have the power, know what I’m sayin’? Ha ha ha…”

This is completely ridiculous, and we can safely dismiss it as a fiction, and not a very good one at that. It is also interesting to note that both of these rumors concern purported sexual impropriety, which in some sense in the ultimate disgrace (and I think this theme also plays into the question of what Mo Xuanyu really did to Jin Guangyao, where we see a similar sort of rumor). All three of these are variations of a single template that can be used to disparage anybody no matter the particular circumstance. By contrast, the mob at Lotus Pier only accuses Jin Guangyao of crimes which he would have had a reasonable motive to commit, and while they are certainly not right to make these claims without proof, it is equally wrong to say, ""Well, Sect Leader Yao said XYZ, which proves that they never happened."" One could just as easily argue that Sisi must be lying and that Jin Guangyao could not have killed his father because Sect Leader Yao argued that she was telling the truth.

The ""argument from Sect Leader Yao,"" as I like to call it, is most commonly used as evidence that Jin Guangyao did not kill his son, the proposition to which it is perhaps least applicable. Long before the discussion conference at Lotus Pier, Jin Guangyao said that Jin Rusong ""had to die""—and coming from a mass murderer, that statement is tantamount to a confession. After the discussion conference, Jin Guangyao explicitly confessed to the murder twice, and while making every flimsy excuse he could think of to justify his actions, did not protest at all when Lan Xichen accused him of killing his son with his own two hands. If Sect Leader Yao had never addressed the subject, we could be quite confident of Jin Guangyao's guilt, and the fact that he did does not make this evidence any less convincing, nor does it mean that anyone who agrees with his accusations is equally idiotic, as Jin Guangyao's defenders so often claim."

Kristijan Iličić odgovara na prozivke o sebi,croatia,1hx89j1,2025-01-09 03:20:47,69,0.83,153,https://www.reddit.com/r/croatia/comments/1hx89j1/adrian_kolak_aka_kristijan_iličić_odgovara_na/,dontsrachtoomuch,💬 Kmečanje,"Donosim Kikijev (tj. ""Kikijev"") odgovor na post na fejsu u kojem mu je netko spočitnuo da je ljiga i gdje je bio prozvan za stvari koje su se već dosta puta spominjale ovdje, između ostalog i ono kad je izjavio da je prvu lovu za putovanja zaradio flipajući burgere na work&travel programu, a prešutio je da je namaknuo milijune prodajom Croportala u ranim 20-ima (btw. netko je bio spomenuo da je u procesu usput preveslao frenda). Budući da je dotični tad taman bio u Šri Lanci zauzet trodnevnim partijanjem povodom ""osvajanja"" zadnje, 197. države svijeta, kao i činjenice da je post bio objavljen u 4 ujutro po šrilankanskom vremenu, vjerujem da ovo nije pisao osobno nego je generički proizvod njegove PR mašinerije. Bilo kako bilo, izvolite:

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Idemo redom razjasniti sve te ""mitove"" koje ste odlučili podijeliti. Nemam problem s tim da me ne volite i da sam vam ljigav, stvarno. To je vaše pravo. Ali ako ćete već odvojiti vrijeme da pišete kilometarske komentare o meni, mogli biste barem provjeriti što je istina, a što ne. I to je već sada ne znam koji put da vidim vaše vrijeđanje u grupama u kojima sam aktivan.Prvo da riješimo jednu stvar – negativni komentari na društvenim mrežama nisu okej. Vrijeđanje, omalovažavanje, širenje laži – sve to više govori o onome tko piše nego o onome na koga se odnosi. No, iskreno, mene osobno ne dira. Kad ste u ovom poslu dovoljno dugo, shvatite da svatko ima mišljenje, pa i oni koji ne znaju ništa o vama. Slobodno pišite što god želite – to je vaše pravo, ali moj život ide dalje i bez vaše stručne ""analize"".E sad, ajmo na vašu listu mitova:

1. ""Burgeri vs. milijuni"" Da, zaradio sam milijune s 18 godina i isto tako sam ih odmah ""izgubio"" sve lošom investicijom. Nakon toga radio sam za plaću 10 godina, kao što radi većina ljudi. Kad sam dao otkaz, otišao sam u Ameriku, a Andrea je tada radila na Work&Travel programu. Ja nisam bio dio tog programa, ali sam FLIPAO BURGERE u Jacksonhole u Wyomingu i od toga platio cijeli road trip po Americi. Znam da bi ljudi više voljeli priču da mi je lova pala s neba jer si onda tako lakše mogu objasniti neke stvari.
2. ""Afganistan i dijete""Da, snimio sam video nakon što smo spasili cijelu obitelj iz prevrnutog auta. Njih 7 točnije. Nisam u tom trenutku razmišljao: ""Wow, bit ću junak interneta"". Pomogli smo ljudima jer smo mogli i trebali. Vi to možete vidjeti kako god želite, ali snimanje tog trenutka nije bilo radi ""samohvale"" i taj trenutak snimanja se dogodio tek kasnije kad su svi bili izvan auta i spašeni. Sa mnom su bili moji vodiči i vozač koji mojim grupama u Afganistanu pričaju događaje s putovanja. U Afganistanu je bilo vec preko 30 ljudi preko moje agencije i bilo bi zaista smiješno da vodič priča drugačiju priču Snimam gotovo sve što mi se događa na putovanjima jer je to moj posao i sada ovo ne bih trebao snimiti? Ako vama smeta što dokumentiram takve stvari – žao mi je, ali ja to ne radim da bih zadovoljio vaš ukus.
3. ""Lažno ime""Nisam krivotvorio ništa niti sam se prijavio pod nikakvim lažnim imenom. Rođen sam kao Kristijan Iličić i kasnije sam legalno promijenio ime u Adrian Kolak. Sve papire u Srbiji sam dobio legalno, sve je bilo po zakonu. Da je bilo nešto ilegalno, mislite li da bih danas pisao ovo, ili bih sjedio u zatvoru? Vjerujte da novinari u roku od 3 sekunde mogu iskopati kako i zašto sam dobio putovnicu i da bi svuda pisalo. Malo više razmišljanja prije takvih optužbi ne bi škodilo.
4. ""Talibani i bacha bazi""Još jedan primjer kako netko uzme pola informacije, pa složi priču. Da, napisao sam da su talibani stali na kraj jednoj užasnoj tradiciji – bacha bazi, tj. sustavnom zlostavljanju i silovanju dječaka. To je činjenica. Napisao sam da je to pozitivno što su talibani napravili. Nisam rekao da opravdavam njihovu ideologiju ili metode za sve ostalo. Sve sam jasno napisao i objasnio i ti svi postovi postoje na mojim društvenim mrežama, ali vama je valjda zabavnije izvući to iz konteksta i napraviti vlastitu verziju priče. Također sam za talibane rekao da je užasno što rade ženama i sve ostalo vezano za njihove nenormalne zakone, ali eto ljudi vide samo kako ja sjedim s njima i pijem čaj, kao da su svi talibani loši ljudi i sve ih treba pobiti. Priču ne gledate iz šireg konteksta, ali kako bi i mogli kad nikad niste bili u Afganistanu pa je teško za shvatiti i da su talibani obični ljudi koji slušaju i pokoravaju se vodstvu koje donosi takve zakone. Čak mi je jedan taliban rekao da ima 4 kćeri i da želi da se školuju, želi promjene, ali da on ne može ništa jer je samo običan vojnik. I pritom govorimo o ljudima koji su neobrazovani i potlačeni zadnjih 40 godina. I uopće u jednom komentaru objasniti talibane je suludo pa stajem...Na kraju, razumijem da imate svoje mišljenje i da volite o meni pisati, ali ako već ulazite u moj život na ovakav način, bilo bi fer da bar koristite činjenice, a ne izmišljate stvari. Nitko ne kaže da morate voljeti ono što radim ili mene osobno, ali ovo što radite je više kao neka fikcija nego realna kritika.I da završim – slobodno nastavite s negativnim komentarima, to je ""vaše pravo."" Moji prijatelji, obitelj i svi bliski ljudi znaju tko sam i što radim, a to mi je jedino važno. Vi ako imate vremena trošiti na ovakve komentare – samo naprijed. Ja ću nastaviti raditi ono što volim, putovati svijetom i snimati sadržaj. Lijep pozdrav!"

Lik i (ne)djelo Primorac Dragana (clanak iz 2009.),croatia,1hwh0lq,2025-01-08 05:23:26,456,0.99,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/croatia/comments/1hwh0lq/lik_i_nedjelo_primorac_dragana_clanak_iz_2009/,MrSmi,:Hrvatska: Predsjednički izbori 2024.,"Pise: MARTIN RELJA

Nakon predstavljanja predsjedničkih kandidata u petak 20.11 2009. na prvom programu HRT-e ostao sam zabrinut za svoju domovinu te imam potrebu podsjetiti na jednu zanimljivu pricu prema kojoj cak i prica o Eviti Peron izgleda bljedunjavo. To je priča o predsjedničkom kandidatu Draganu Primorcu bivšem ministru u vladi Ive Sanadera.

1991 u kolovozu u jeku napada na Vukovar, mladi splitski doktor putuje u SAD. Ali on nije počeo svoju karijeru u Splitu. Kako nije položio prijemni ispit na medicini on je upisao stomatologiju u Sarajevu, zatim stomatologiju u Zagrebu pa se preko komunjarskog direktora Medicinskog fakulteta u Zagrebu dr. Škrbića prebacuje se u Split na medicinski fakultet ( !!!! ). U tome mu je pomogla politička podobnost-član SKJ od 16 -te godine.
Diplomira sa prosjekom 3 i prof Marušić ga pošalje u Conecticat, New Harford, nakon što je netko drugi odustao od tog mjesta. Inače tokom studija je uredno pomagao ženi prof. Marušića nositi kufere na kolodvor u Splitu.

I tako mladi doktor odlazi u SAD gdje je pod nadzorom dr. Dubravka Pavlina, zubara i protestantskog ""pastora"" koji je vidio da je protestantizam popularniji u SAD nego katolicizam. Tu se mladi doktor priključuje protestantskoj grupi pickastog i izfeminiziranog dr. Pavlina. I to je početak jednog krasnog prijateljstva, odnosa učenik-učitelj u kome će jednog dana učenik nadmašiti svoga učitelja. Baš kao u ruskim bajkama.

Od 1991-1995 mladi doktor nije objavio niti jedan znanstveni rad kao prvi autor. Najveći uspjeh je drugi autor u članku u Journal of Clinical Investigation. Pokušava nostrificirati diplomu ali pada 7 puta na step 1 USMLE i gubi pravo polaganja. Nako toga se 1996 vraća kući u Split gdje daje silne intervjue o svojim velikim uspjesima u SAD u časopisima kao Arena, Slobodna Dalmacija i naravno pokoji intervju za TV. Upucava se lokalnom HDZ-u, povezan je sa dr. Šimom Anđelinovićem, sudskim patologom iz Splita i dobiva poziciju na fakultetu i stan od grada Splita.

Oko 1998 počinje specijalizaciju iz pedijatrije kod tadašnjeg šefa pedijatrije na Firulama, prof. Livia Ballarina. To se naravno radi fakultativno obzirom na silne obaveze na fakultetu i državnim komisijama.

U SAD je povezan sa kontroverzom oko nestanka para od donacija za HR. Nikad nije zaradio više od 25 000 $ godišnje u SAD, ali unatoč tim skromnim primanjima po povratku kupuje sebi Mercedesa, a bratu ( Predsjednik Splitskog suda sa 24 godine, prosjek ocjena na pravu 2) jeepa. Polaže specijalistički u Zagrebu pred komisijom koju čine profesori koji su oduševljeni lijepim poklonima koje je mladi pametni doktor njima dao. Svaki profesor je dobio laptop. Uliziva se prof. Slobodanu Vukičeviću. O detaljima tog lijepog prijateljstva i kako je počelo neću pisati jer se nadam da se mnogi djelatnici fakulteta sjećaju kako je počelo i u kojima ssu osobno sudjelovala.

I nakon što komunjare dolaze na vlast 3. siječnja 2000. godine seli se u Zagreb,. Prodaje državni stan u Splitu i kupuje stan u Zagrebu. Postaje ravnatelj bolnice Svetog Duha 2. Umješan je u aferu privatizacije hemodijalize koja je prodana Izrelskoj tvrtki i što je ispitivao USKOK. Ali ezultati istrage niada nisu poznati javnosti dok je predsjednik vlade bio Ivo Sanader. Bilo bi dns zanimljivo znati zašto ???

Po povratku u HR druži se intenzivno sa klerom koji je oduševljen ovim mladim pobožnim katolikom koji je tako dobro educiran.

Šest mjeseci pred izbore 2003 intenzivno se druži sa Miomirom Žužulom koji ga dovodi Sanaderu za ministra. Ministar Primorac je inače odlikovan brojnim ratnim odlikovanjima uključujući spomenicu domovinskog rata.

On u principu ne zna ništa raditi, ni pedijatriju, ni znanost, ni sudsku medicinu. Ali zato obmanjivanje masa, laganje, krada, ulizivanje su vještine koje je on razvio do perfekcije. Dok je bio ministar najveći ""thrill"" mu je izaći na TV i pomoću 20 izvježbanih laži i fraza praviti idiote od novinara i gledaoca.

Inače na medije se nevjerojatno pali. Instinktivno je osjeća opasnost od prof. Radmana, pa ga lukavo neutralizira sitnim podvalama i lažima koje nemaju veze sa mozgom. Supruga Miomira Žužua Tatjana Žužul je govorila ""Dragan je savrsen"", ""Radman je smotani znanstvenik za razliku od Dragana koji je veliki i znanstvenik i menadžer"", ""Di se može mjerit smotani Radman sa Draganom"". Bilo kakva usporedba znanstvenih kvaliteta Primorca i Radmana je kao usporedba plovnih karakteristika kutije za sapun sa ruskom nuklearnom podmornicom. Ali to nema veze. Kod nas sve može kada s podobni.

O Draganovoj općoj kulturi da ne govorim. ""Rat i mir"" je vidio izdaleka baš kao i domovinski rat od koga je pobjegao. ""Braća Karamazovi"" su vjerojatno vlasnici nekog kafica u Splitu. Na drini ćuprija ""da čito, pišo sa nje «. ""Lovčeve zapise"" nije nikad čuo za njih ali zato piše zbirku ""Lovačkih priča za idiote"" kojoj se cijela Hrvatska divi.

Njegove priče o tome da je profesor na Američkim Sveučilištima su jednako istinite kao i priče od Vesne Pusić. Održati seminar pred malom grupom ljudi na nekom Američkom Sveučilištu je stvar koja se može vrlo lako urediti, bit profesor je nešto sasvim drugo. Njegovo članstvo u Američkoj Akademiji za Sudsku Medicinu se ostvaruje registracijom na nekom od seminara i uplaćivanjem članarine od 100 $. Naravno, to besramno lažljivi bivši ministar prikazuje medijima kao dostignuće tipa ""Deus ex machina"".

I mene ljudi pitaju zašto mi je ministar simpatičan. Pa kako mi ne bi bio simpatičan. PRAVI MAJSTOR SA MORA. On i njegova karijera nisu aberacija, oni su odličan indikator moralne situacije u Hrvatskoj, sustava vrijednosti i kriterija koji se primjenjuju u državnim institucijama. Kao bivši ministar on odlučuje o alokaciji fondova za znanost. Njegova i prof. Pavelića privatna klinika u Istri sigurno je bila adekvatno subvencionirana, poznavajući koliko je konflikt interesa vazan u HR. 

Šest milijuna dolara kredita uzeto od Svjetske banke za povratak znanstvenika iz inozemstva utrošeno je u njihov privatnu kliniku. Osamdeset milijuna eura uzeto je od Svjetske banke za modernizaciju hrvatskog školstva u njegovu prvom ministarskom mandatu. Kako su i zašto potrošeni toliki milijuni eura zna samo Dragan Primora i njegov savjetnik akademik Vladimir Paar.

Akademik Paar bio je savjetnik za nuklearnu energiju u CK SKH-e. Da bi njegovi sinovi mogli raditi na odjelu za fiziku PMF-a u Zagrebu staljinističkom metodom pod vodstvom Načelnika odjela za fiziku PMF- u Zagrebu prof. Miroslava Furića protjerani su neki stručni ljudi s obrazloženjem da poslije doktorata nisu bili u inozemstvu kamo inače « fizičarska elita « šalje svoju djecu ne po stručnim sposobnostima nego po njihovim osobnim prijateljskim vezama.

$231 shipped from centerfire systems during a 47% off sale. I posted the deal on r/gundeals as well as on here. Received quite a bit of pushback over there for posting “old beat up guns” instead of new Colt Pythons, HKs, CZs, Glock magazines and ARs. 


No dash, pinned barrel, serrated trigger. Best I can figure it’s made in 1970-71. Never been too obsessed with the older ones, I’m fine with the frame mounted firing pins, shrouded barrels (even tho I don’t have one), and the frame lock just means it’s cheaper for me since everyone obsesses over it and actively wants one without the lock. 


I received it a day after my birthday and was surprised how heavy it is. No grips (stocks), broken hammer spur and dry as a bone, the cylinder barely spun. Got it home and immediately ripped it down to the guts and was pleasantly surprised how clean it was, both inside and out. Wasn’t anywhere near spotless but in REALLY good shape considering it’s well over 50. I’m guessing it spent its entire life sitting in a drawer somewhere. All the pics you see are BEFORE I cleaned it. 


Gave it the same treatment I gave my S&W Model 64. Gut it, clean EVERY part separately, wet sand and polish that I’ll probably do today. I’ll be grinding down the hammer spur and it’ll effectively be DAO (replacement hammers are a bit pricey and this ain’t a target gun), though I won’t be messing with the sear and trigger engagement. 


The grips should be on the way and I’ll post pics again when it’s complete and polished. "

Around a bit more than a year ago I had a tick bite with a rash, which made me feel super sick (fever, chills, couldn't properly move my hands ...) The doctor then diagnosed Lymes disease and gave me 3 weeks of doxycycline. I reacted SUPER bad to the antibiotics. I almost passed out, had to puke and got flu like symptoms. After the treatment most of the Lyme symptoms were gone but I still felt off and I guessed my whole digestions system was completely destroyed. 

They found out I got a exocrine pancreatic insuffiency which was most likely induced by the borrelia because the couldn't find another cause that would explain it. Also they diagnosed me with Post Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrom and CFS.

I had a Colonoscopy and Gastroscopy which both were fine but a little Gastritis. They tested me several times for SIBO which was negative (3 times), I got a colonoscopy and the one where they check your stomach, both were not significant. I had to take 3 months of PPIS because they thought I am having a gastritis. I even got a complete analysis of my gut microbiom which was a bit off but I couldn't interpret it properly on my own. They also checked fungal overgrowth which also didn't seem to be the problem. I also tried taking nystatin for a while which changed nothing.

I even tried several long term probiotics which changed nothing. I have also tried all the big dietary changes. Since this all started I feel like I can't eat gluten, corn, soy and milk products anymore.

They checked my 24 hour histamine in my pee and the DAO in my blood to rule out histamine problems and MCAS.

The only siginificant thing beside the pancreas thing was super low zinc, iron and selen in my blood, which probably happened in this year due to the insufficiency.

Tested TCM (accupuncture and chinese herbs) and so far I didn't feel any siginficant change.

My LLMD confirmed persisting / chronic Lyme (ELI-Spot high + CD57 being super low) + Ehrlichia + Chlamydia + Toxoplasm.



I am wondering could all these gut issues actually be from the lyme disease or is it persisting damage from the antibiotics I had to take? I would like to make sure what I am doing before I start Lyme Treatment, which are again a lot of antibiotics and I would like to start whatever treatment soon because I feel like I am slowly getting worse.



**My symptoms now:**

\- vertigo

\- nausea (espescially in the morning)

\- insane fatigue

\- pem

\- neck pain

\- light muscle and joint pain

\- anxiety

\- 'heavy head'

\- slow thinking



**-> is it actually possible to heal?**

i think this novel isn't known enough,MartialMemes,1hvcv2o,2025-01-06 18:12:28,9,0.81,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MartialMemes/comments/1hvcv2o/i_think_this_novel_isnt_known_enough/,Contrazoid,Dao Conference (Discussion),"[worlds' apocalypse online](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/worlds-apocalypse-online/) 

slop title i know, it was ""the thing"" for titles back when it got started being written, DO NOT READ THE MANGA/MANHUA, there's so many details lost, READ THE NOVEL (cultivate the dao of the seven seas if you have to), there's almost no filler between plot arcs (i think the author hates slice of life, me too), at most it's just 1-2 chapters of the characters finally dealing with ""the apocalypse"", kicking back and relaxing (there's another disaster knocking at the front door), it's one disaster after another because it's an apocalypse, makes for an entertaining read, a bit of spoilers, there are 999 million galaxy layers in the ""outer layers"" (the entire 999 million of it is the outer layer), where earth is, so yes, the novel is not just limited to modern earth setting and cultivation setting, other worlds have their own path to power that the cultivator protag meets

the dialogue between characters is also written pretty realistically, each character talks like how that character with that kind of background will talk, including non-humans, they have their own culture in their own world, of course they're going to have a different mindset and priorities,

fights where the protag has the advantage in raw power is not often, but as long as the gap isn't ""too big that his attacks no longer have an effect"", he subscribes to the school of thought of suicidal aggression in general and it reflects on his swordstyle, because he was a lone cultivator (he can't expect to have back up) and a sword cultivator at the same time (his defense might as well be nonexistent) so his fighting style eventually developed to ""do not let the enemy have the opportunity to fight back or there's a chance i die""

or if his opponent is so strong (happens a lot of the time) that a direct confrontation will turn him into a red smear in the ground with a casual strike, he immediately starts setting up a plan of mind games, lies, and deceit, setting up his own advantages, taking up multiple chapters of planning so he can take advantage of the opponent's weakness as hard as he can (his fighting style), it's not told to the reader that ""this is the plan"", but details of the plan is there in plain sight for you to read and connect with each other, it's so peak

i think the problem with ""smart protagonists"" is that the author also needs to be smart to actually write a character who is supposed to be smart, this novel does not have that problem,

i binge read this peak fiction until i get burnt out (around 800-1200 chapters), stop reading for a few months, forget details, try to get back into the story, fail to remember minor details, give up trying to remember, and binge read it again from the start, i've done this cycle four times now (once a year), each going deeper into the novel than the last, every chapter is just that entertaining to read, and i think i'm going to start on the fifth cycle because i just ran out of stuff to read, i'm doing this binge cycle because i don't want to reach the ending"
Possible rapid weight loss ,HistamineIntolerance,1hv6yj7,2025-01-06 14:09:11,5,1.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/1hv6yj7/possible_rapid_weight_loss/,No_Scientist9241,,"Sorry for so many posts. I have lost a lot of weight very fast in the past month without trying. I remember my weight was nearly 140 lbs when this all started in late November. Now I’m at 125. Only a week ago I was 129 I assume due to my period. I know weight loss is always seen as a good thing but I am worried about this as I’m losing it fast and unintentionally too. 

I thought dao supplementation and eating more would slow it down a bit but I guess not. The only hope this gives me is that it might not be MCAS as I know that typically has the opposite problem (weight gain). Has anyone else experienced this? I assume it’s good for those that are overweight but I wasn’t an unhealthy weight before and I don’t want it getting too low plus mostly worried about a possible health implication. 

I’ve already seen a gastro and allergist which didn’t lead anywhere. I’m wondering if this is worth getting a second opinion? I don’t know if i’m going to plateau at all or when. Actually im not sure if it is too fast but it’s very unintentional and eating more plus symptoms getting better isn’t slowing it down. "

MASSIVE YS Review (Wide Variety),tea,1hsw9u5,2025-01-03 15:33:10,77,0.96,47,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hsw9u5,chemical_musician,Review,"*In 2024 I placed two fairly large orders from YS to try a variety of different teas (28 total) under most of the major tea categories; of course some categories are so broad and some I favor more than others, so some are a little lacking in variety. I also did a large amount of research on YS before both of these orders as they have such a massive selection that many of their teas are purportedly average/bad and I wanted to sift through those to get as many “gems” as possible while taking the gamble on such large/varied orders from a single vendor. I think all the extra research on various forums was worth it, though tedious, as overall I am very pleased and will go into detail below.*

*Of the 28 teas, the vast majority ranged from good to wonderful, with only a few duds. For context: I tend to appreciate any drink or food I’ve ever had in my life when it comes to different tastes/flavors, and only tend to dislike something when the quality is bad. All of these were brewed gongfu style with a gaiwan. Here is a brief overview of every tea along with a rating from 0-5. 0 = undrinkable, 2.5 = just “meh” / wouldn’t order again, and 5 = something I loved and need more of. Anyway, here we go:*

**Red(Black) Teas:**

Black Gold Bi Luo Chun: 4/5
*Malty aroma and taste, natural sweetness and notes of chocolate. Very enjoyable and quite stimulating. My 2nd favorite of the 4 dianhongs here and a good go to for a “daily-driver” option in this category for the price.*

Imperial Mojiang Golden Bud: 5/5
*The best dianhong in my order, similar to the one above in it’s profile but even better; just so incredibly smooth and clean. Understandably pricier so i save it for special occasions, it’s also a very beautiful looking tea.*

Imperial Golden Needle: 3.5/5
*Very solid; it has a “brighter” flavor profile than the other dianhongs and a note of sourness not unlike an aged white, along with the usual malty-chocolate note it kind of gives me a hint of that flavor combo chocolate+orange. This is also possibly the most stimulating tea across both orders, almost too much so, as if I took a bump if im not careful and drink too much lol.*

Sweet Potato Zheng Shan Xiao Zhong: 5/5
*Incredible. While this is not a smokey lapsang and I i love all things smokey, this is wonderful in it’s own way. Maybe I have been placebo’d, but it really does have a sort of “roasted yam” profile to it in the flavor and aroma, with some very nice natural sweetness if not over-brewed. Ive shared this one with quite a few people who were very pleased.*

Yunnan Black Gold: 3/5
*This one is fine, the least favorite of the 4 dianhong i ordered and it was actually thrown in as a free sample. Theres nothing wrong with it, but it’s not as smooth or unique as any of the other three and more like a baseline if that makes sense. Similar flavor/aroma profile but less distinct. Still nice though, it’s more that im just comparing it to the others.*

**White Teas:**

2013 Shun Ming Dao “Shou Mei” Fuding Cake: 5/5
*Was my first time having an aged white that was this old, and i really loved it, so much so that I ordered a whole cake in the second order. To me, it really smells and tastes a lot like dried apricots; sweet and sour with a nice amber color and it lasts easily up to 15 sometjmes even 20 steeps. This is also the only tea across all the orders that i would describe as almost purely relaxing without stimulation which is interesting.*

Fuding “Bai Hao Yin Zhen” Silver Needle: 2.5/5
*This is just okay I guess, its a Yunnan silver needle which IMO is more akin to a green tea than any other silver needle i’ve had both in how it tastes and how it’s best brewed. Ive had far more enjoyable silver needle, though i wouldnt say this was terrible or anything, moreso forgettable.*

Wild Tree Purple Moonlight from Jiggu: 4.5/5
*This has become my favorite non aged white tea, and was my first time trying wild tree purple varietal. The dry leaf alone smells incredibly sweet like icing and flowers, and even moreso when wet. The taste is floral, crisp, and has an impressive amount of natural sweetness. This is great to share with someone who would normally put sugar in their tea if they wanted to try a tea without adding things. Very pretty green/purple color and nice energy.*

**Oolongs:**

“King of Duck Shit Aroma” Dan Cong: 4/5
*Very nice, super floral and with a juicy honey-fruit note as it opens up. I’d say that overall YS is not the way to go for oolongs as most are just okay, but ive enjoyed the 2 dan congs ive had from them. Brewing these with the chaouzhou technique is crucial imo. Strong energy for an oolong as well.*

Middle Mountain “Saturn Peach Aroma” Dan Cong: 5/5
*Even better than the king of duck shit, which the price reflects. It really does smell like peach pits, and has a wonderful smooth taste to it while enjoying that aroma. The best oolong from these two orders hands down even though yancha is my favorite type of oolong. Really good stuff*

13-year aged Da Hong Pao: 3.5/5
*Da hong pao is a tea i drink often as my local tea shop sells it, and unfortunately this one was not quite as good overall. It has that wonderful roasted mineral taste to it and for a steep or two I thought i liked it even more than the one I usually drink, but it really thinned out in flavor, color and aroma fast, only 2 or 3 really good steeps before it becomes disappointing. If it maintained how it tasted in that 2nd and 3rd steep i’d rate it higher.*

Shii Jin Gui “Golden Water Turtle” Wu Yi Rock Tea: 2.5/5
*Pretty much the same as above, but not quite as tasty even in that 2nd/3rd steep, and it thins out just as fast. As a big fan of yancha, i wouldnt recommend that category of oolong from YS.*

Anxi “Hairy Crab” Mao Xie Fujian: 2.5/5
*Very very light. More of a green oolong, with some subtle floral aroma and a note of honeysuckle, but incredibly light. It’s fine and can be enjoyable, but not very flavorful or “exciting” for me so i tend not to drink it too often unless im specifically feeling like tasting something so light.*

Bittermelon Stuffed With Roasted Tie Guan Yin: 3.5/5
*I enjoy this one, in a way it was more akin to the yancha (in flavor ofc, not appearance) that im used to from my local shop to than the actul yancha in this order as it has a very robust charcoal roasted taste and goes for a very solid amount of steeps. Im not sure how subtle the bittermelon is as theres a hint of fruity sweetness in the aftertaste, but that could just be the tea itself? Either way, pretty nice for the price and convenient.*

**Shou Puer:**

1999 Basket Aged Loose Leaf (Menghai): 4/5
*Really interesting and unique, it has the strongest aged taste/aroma of any tea i’ve ever had and is the oldest tea i’ve drank so that makes sense. It is like drinking and smelling an old book from a basement library (which i enjoy) along with a relatively simple/less-complex earthy shou profile. It also only lasts about 5-6 steeps before thinning out unlike most other shou i’ve had. Not for everyone but definitely worth a try, i save it for special occasions as i don’t have a ton of it.*

2018 Yunnan Sourcing “Hui Run” Cake (Bu Lang Mountain): 5/5
*This officially became my favorite shou when trying the sample in the first order and it was a no brainer to get a whole cake in the second order. Notes of bitter dark chocolate and dark sour fruits behind the usual earthy taste of a good shou; it also has a subtle vanilla thing going on in the first steep before it really opens up. It’s complex and makes my mouth literally water and tingle after sipping. One of my go-to teas when i cant figure out what i want to drink some days. Very nice energy to it too, quite stimulating but without as much of a jittery edge to it like some of the dianhongs had. It lasts a lot of steeps too.*

15-years aged Golden Melon: 2.5/5
*I initially thought i would have to give this one a 0 and not even try it as the mini-tuo was incredibly fishy smelling, but i decided to take it out of its package and just let it sit in it’s paper on a counter in my house for a week or two and when i came back to it the fishy smell was entirely gone and did not reappear. What remained was a pretty average shou with a good bit of “creaminess” to it but other than that nothing too special, but it wasn’t bad at all either.* 

2024 Yunnan Sourcing “Gold Label” Ripe: 2.5/5
*Included as a free sample; nothing wrong with it and very drinkable but nothing special either, it was very one note and had a bit more astringency than what im used to from shou, i imagine due to it not having any age yet.*

**Sheng Puer:**
*(I should note that I am new to sheng and dont have much to compare these against aside from each-other)* 

2014 Yunnan Sourcing Impressions Cake: 4/5
*Complex and varied, it’s a very interesting tea to drink and think about while drinking. It goes from a slight hint of smokey, to bitter and savory, to floral and green, to stone-fruity and sweet, and back again throughout the various steeps, and no two sessions with it have been the same. Apparently this is due to the wide variety of material it’s made from and different amounts of different teas end up in each chunk. It has a very “floaty” and stimulating energy to it, almost a little euphoric? It’s not exactly my favorite tea or even my favorite of these shengs, but once again i found it very interesting.*

Smokey Mushroom Tuo (Aged): 2.5/5
*A more aged and less varied sheng than the one above, yet somehow more astringent unless flash steeped. It does have a primarily savory roasted zucchini sort of thing going on with the flavor that i actually enjoy a lot, but the main reason i got this tea was i expected it to be smokey and was very disappointed in that regard. Only slightly smokey in aroma and hardly at all in taste beyond the initial steep. If smokey wasn’t in the name id give it at least a 3. Lasts a lot of steeps and has strong energy but less floaty and moreso just straight up stimulation.*

2018 Bao He Xiang “Yan Yun” Raw Pu-erh: 4.5/5
*Now THIS is what i was hoping for when i ordered the smokey mushroom. This one actually has a decent amount of smokey aroma and flavor to it, and behind that is a nice balance of savory, bitter, and a touch of sweet. Probably my favorite of the 4 Shengs here, but that may just be because im a sucker for anything smokey. Strong stimulation as well but with a bit of a jittery edge if i have too much. Lasts a decent amount of steeps.*

Jinggu Aged (2006) Mini Coins: 3.5/5
*This is the most heavily aged sheng of the bunch by a good degree and quite different from the others as a result; it has a dark color to it and tastes (and looks) like some sort of middle ground between sheng and shou which makes sense given the history behind shou. It has an earthy, vegetal flavor, grasay with a bit of aged aroma and some stone-fruit notes especially in later steeps. Less bitter and less astringent than the others, but also more one-note. The energy is powerful, very stimulating and has that “floaty” feel going on like the impressions had. Lasts a very large amount of steeps. The thing is, i feel like id rather enjoy a younger sheng, or just go full on to enjoy a shou, than drink this “missing link” if that makes sense, but that’s just my taste; and maybe id change my tune if i tried more sheng of a similar age.*

**Dark Tea (Non-Puer Hei Cha):**
*(It should be noted I was entirely new to this category, and went with one of each of the “4 major sub-categories” within it; while i don’t have much basis for comparison as a result, i really enjoyed all of these, moreso than the other category i was new to, which leads me to think YS must just be a good place for Hei Cha and i made some lucky choices. It might be my new favorite category of tea in general)*

2021 Cha Yu Lin “Gao Ma Village” Wild Tian Jian (from basket): 5/5
*This almost instantly became one of my favorite teas period. Incredibly smokey aroma (which i didnt see coming and once again, im a sucker for smokey). It smells and tastes smokey in a way like bbq. Lighter in color than the other hei cha i have but powerful rich savory flavor; sweet meat and wood smoke, probably my favorite smokey tea regardless the category. bold energy that is quite strong in the chest but in a good way. lasts a decent amount of steeps. I plan to get much more.*

Farmer Smoked Raw Liu Bao (Aged from 2016): 4.5/5
*Really good. Unlike the previous one i expected this one to be smokey given the name. It is smokey in taste and smell in a more strictly wooden/vegetal way and almost grassy like a sheng pu erh, but also a bit musty (in a good way) with aged taste like some shous ive had. equally as smokey as the tian jian but a different character of smoke without that bbq savory element and almost a dark fruit sort of note behind all that woody aged smokiness.*

2017 Mojun Fu Cha “Fu shen” Brick: 4/5
*What a unique and interesting tea, im glad i have a brick of it. Full of golden flowers, and once wet it unleashes an intense aroma of raisin bread and dates, and the flavor follows suit. Im not even talking about “notes” here, if my eyes were closed and didn’t know someone was brewing this tea i could be fooled into thinking someone had just baked some raisin bread lol. Has a really nice energy to it too, pretty stimulating but comforting at the same time. Lasts plenty of steeps and for the price i cant believe how much i enjoy it, i got it under one of the BOGO deals. In the future i’d wanna try other Fu to compare, but this was a nice first exposure.* 

2012 Gao Jian Shan “Qiang Liang Cha” Hunan Tea: 4.5/5
*This stuff is awesome and i definitely plan to get more. Smells and tastes very woody (im sure due to the bamboo its compressed and aged in) in a very comforting, pleasant way with subtle notes of various warm spices akin to 5 spice. While its a little dry in the mouth at first (not astringent necessarily, just “dry”) it also does this unique thing for me where it causes the tip of my tongue to tingle after sipping in the same way black peppercorn would, which is very enjoyable. Incredible with food and has some potent energy to it.*

**Green Teas:**
*(I only got two green teas, for one because as i understand it YS doesnt have the best offerings in this category, but also because while i certainly like them, greens are probably my least favorite category)*

Imperial Grade Dragon Well (Zhejiang) Longjin: 4/5
*This was pretty damn good; extremely nutty flavor and aroma. Tastes of chestnuts and soybeans. Relaxing yet stimulating energy. Was surprised how good this one was and was glad i grabbed the Imperial grade as i imagine the other grades are not nearly as well processed. This had almost no astringency and was pretty forgiving to brew for a green. Someone i know who actually dislikes greens (they are thinking of more vegetal/grassy greens) really liked this too.*

First Flush “Mao Feng” (Yunnan): 1.5/5 (2.5 if cold brewed)
*And here we are, last but least lol. When i opened this one the smell of the dry leaves reminded me of the longjin from above and i was expecting it to be good, and ive also seen people claim this one is good, so maybe i got a bad batch or it got messed up in transit. Ive tried brewing this at various different temps and no matter what its either an astringency bomb, or almost flavorless. The tiny amount of flavor that is there reminds me of greenbeans, which i would enjoy if it wasnt so watered down tasting. The only way to pull out more of that flavor was either with higher temp or shorter steep, both of which resulted in intense astringency. This tea came out astringent as hell with as low as 160 degrees (Fahrenheit) with flash steeping to boot. I really dont think it’s a matter of brewing error with how many different ways i tried to get something good out of it and it must have been processed poorly. The only sort of good result i found as a last ditch attempt to not waste it was overnight cold brewing, and even then, it was just “meh” despite the slight improvement.*

Well, thats all of them; I hope you all find this useful though keep in mind we all have different tastebuds, these are just my opinions. Overall im very happy with YS (not to mention both of these orders arrived within like a week of ordering which was great). I would say the best categories from YS would be their Hong Cha (especially dianhong), Hei Cha, and Shou Puers, with an honorable mention to some of their white tea. For green tea and oolong i’d probably look elsewhere aside from some of the dan cong oolongs. 

Cheers!"

So if you haven't had a chance to read that, we did publish it to our [Medium](https://medium.com/@SaucerSwap/saucerswap-2025-beyond-4bd55aed767e). It's also in our documentation, so [docs.saucerswap.finance](https://docs.saucerswap.finance/roadmap). So go and check that out.

The big story is that 2025 and Beyond roadmap. It is a comprehensive look at how we plan to scale DeFi on Hedera. It covers things such as refining our reward initiatives and some highly requested features like on-chain limit orders, which I think is actually our most requested feature. We also have items such as launching a dedicated mobile app both for iOS and Android. We are also currently working on completely overhauling our UI. We also have, I believe in the near term, permissionless SauccerSwap Version 2 pool creation. And in the future, some really big endeavors, like eventually launching SaucerSwap Version 3 and Perpetual Futures.

So we have come a long way since our Version 2 launch, which was in November two years ago now and 2024 laid a solid foundation for everything we're ready to accomplish in 2025 and beyond. So this AMA is great venue to take your questions, which have a lot to do with our roadmap. Some of the things that are asked almost every AMA, including Community Pools, limit orders, we can get into more specifics there and share a detailed vision. We will cover some key pillars like user experience, new features, and ecosystem growth including Axelar and LayerZero Bridge integration.

Stay tuned. We do have a lot to cover. This is going to be probably one of our longer AMAs, so let's just jump right into the questions. 

\---

Pine\_apple 

Thanks for the highlights. So starting off is a question from Anon, which really just gets to the meat of this AMA. Are the key milestones you hope SAUCE will achieve by Q2 of 2025? 

Peter 

Cool. Yeah. And the way I am interpreting this question is SaucerSwap specifically. So we have actually recently been going through a qual-quant evaluation to be able to track our growth. So we evaluate success through a few key metrics. On one side, the quantitative side, we track the following primary KPIs: it's user growth, trading volume, TVL across Version 1 and Version 2, and transaction success rate. We think those are the four primary KPIs for building a successful platform - in that order as well.

And then qualitatively, we focus on maximizing user experience through a few things. One is consistency, which is something that we've wanted to improve on for a while. So no matter where you are in the world, you can have a fast and reliable experience on SaucerSwap. And I'll get to that a little bit more later about multi-availability zone and fall backs. That's one thing that we are working on in the backend. Tied to that platform reliability. Support ticket resolution and community feedback. So all of that qualitative feedback is really important and it comes from social media mostly and then our support tickets as well.

So by Q2 2025, we hope to achieve some following concrete deliverables. One that we're currently working on is, as I mentioned before, a complete web app redesign. It'll still be the familiar SaucerSwap flow, but it will be better pretty much in every way. So we're really excited about that. It also steps forward into a little bit more of a mature branding, which we're still going to keep our brand alive, but it is kind of the time to to step forward into something more mature, especially as we're getting up into 130 million plus TVL.

Another thing that we are working on supporting on the backend first before we upgrade our chart library is high fidelity charting with technical indicators, specifically for the most traded tokens. So getting some intra-minute price data and being able to make faster decisions I think is really important for serious traders.

Another thing is realigning the LARI reward calculation. There has been some feedback about whether it's totally optimized to be fair to liquidity providers based on all of their different behavior metrics. So time in a pool, the amount of liquidity they put in that pool, the exposure to potential volatility. All of that does already factor into our calculation, but we want to be more data-driven and incorporate more feedback just to make sure that our overall system is really operating is really optimized to reward liquidity providers effectively.

We also, by Q2 2025, aim to complete the code for Community Pools and submit it for audit and I will get to that a little bit later. Also, if you just want to skip ahead, if you're one of the users who really is looking for Community Pools, check out the [Medium article](https://medium.com/@SaucerSwap/saucerswap-2025-beyond-4bd55aed767e). We actually have a whole section just on Community Pools to give you an update there.

We also hope to have the iOS and possibly Android mobile app developed. That is a very ambitious goal, but we think that is one of the best things we can do for user growth, which is pretty much our primary KPI on the on the quantitative side.

That's not a complete list. There are more items on our immediate term roadmap, but the overall point is that all of these developments support those end targets I talked about before in our qual-quant growth strategy. 

\---

ABFTFTW 

Harder, better. Faster. Stronger. I like it. Umm, next question. So the team mints 1.5 Million SAUCE per week, generates big fees, and we're in a bull run. Why no marketing? The team can easily afford. What do you say to that, Peter? 

Peter 

Yeah. So to clarify this question a bit. So protocol fees and emissions serve distinct purposes, a significant portion of revenue goes directly to pay for software development and infrastructure costs. It is quite expensive. We have paid for marketing services as well, but in the past, we have generally shifted our budget more towards development rather than marketing. We have always held the belief that marketing should articulate and highlight protocol developments and building a good platform and a good user experience is our number one goal.

There's a saying that goes something like marketing attracts and the product delights. It's pretty self-explanatory, but basically saying that you can get people to click links, visit the site with marketing, but if the experience isn't good, retention won't be there and users can then form a bad relationship with the product and that's a form of negative marketing. So we did try to avoid that, especially in the early days when the protocol was still under some fundamental development.

But now that we have a well functioning product, although there is still a lot of work to do on the product side, we do plan to do two things starting this month and going forward with our marketing plan. Number one, yes, increase our marketing spend. Number two is create a better internal system for adhering to a posting schedule to maximize reach and gain impressions on social media from new users. We think that driving users to the site now is good. User experience is good. Product is good. Umm, so we're on the same page there.

We still do hold the same philosophy that product leads and marketing follows. We do have some items on our roadmap that follows from that. Just to name a few,  we have a - and this will be I think pretty welcomed by token issuers - we have an overhauled token classification system in development which will provide a more frictionless and automated way for token creators to quickly and easily get their token trading on SaucerSwap with all the relevant information, icons, without needing to go through a cumbersome process. That has been one of the main pieces of feedback from token creators. It is a little bit difficult to get a token issued quickly on SaucerSwap.

And then of course the iOS and Android Mobile app is a great form of marketing, just increasing accessibility. And then also cross-chain integrations. So we have Axelar, which the latest update we have is that the integration on Mainnet should be done this month January 2025, and then the bridge that is powered by Axelar, Squid router, should be on Mainnet shortly thereafter.

So I know it's a long answer. So just coming back to the \[team\] spend, realistically, budgets are finite, decisions do need to be made. We have always prioritized product and the user experience above all else. So far, that approach has worked out well. We will continue doing that, but also double down on marketing efforts through some increased and focused spending and reorienting some internal processes to stay consistent and commutative on social media. 

\---

Pine\_apple 

Twitter Fingers. Thanks for that, Peter. Another question from Anon. Do you have any updates on the Coinbase and Binance applications? Is there a possibility of submitting a Robinhood or Uphold application in 2025? 

Peter 

So, umm, we've changed our policy a little bit on how we communicate about this. Right now,  we have a policy to not comment on potential exchange listings because at the end of the day, it is outside of our control. We don't want to say something and then a third party changes their mind and then  look like fools. So our focus right now is on protocol development, infrastructure improvements as outlined in a roadmap. Listing decisions ultimately rest with the exchanges themselves.

With that being said, we have remained in contact with the HBAR Foundation, exchanges and other third parties in order to broaden access to Hedera DeFi and SaucerSwap's ecosystem in particular via additional listings. But we will only make announcements on that front when we have substantive and definitive information to share. 

\---

ABFTFTW 

That makes perfect sense to me. The next question. Why do you think the value of SAUCE is lagging so far behind HBAR, especially considering that nine months ago, SAUCE was valued at a 2-to-1 against HBAR? 

Peter 

Again, just policy to remain compliant, we don't talk about token price comparisons in general. Focusing on short timeframes doesn't really fully capture protocol development and utility, so our focus is to build the best product in the market and create lasting infrastructure by virtue of SAUCE serving as the protocol token for SaucerSwap. That focus expands SAUCE's utility and supports the overall project growth. So our roadmap prioritizes sustainable growth and reliable KPIs that I talked about before rather than more capricious targets like short term price movements. 

\---

Pine\_apple 

Awesome sauce. Thanks for that explanation, Peter. The next one is also from Anon. Are there any features from other DEXs that you would like to see integrated into the SaucerSwap DEX in the future? 

Peter 

Yeah absolutely. This is one of the fastest, fastest moving spaces. There's always new developments and we are always looking at other top DEXs to get ideas for SaucerSwap. I start some my days by going through the [DeFi Lama DEX leaderboard](https://defillama.com/protocols/Dexes). By the way, I think we're #19 or #20 last time I checked. And yeah, there's there's always cool developments.

One of them that is available on some DEXs is on-chain limit orders. That is an obvious development that would immediately provide substantial benefits to users. It is also one of our most frequently requested features to develop.

Another one, although we think we can do it better, we did see a cool feature that served as an auto DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) tool on another DEX. And on paper, we think that is awesome. We didn't really like the implementation, but we do want to build this feature for you guys as well. I think it would be awesome to just set aside - to plug in some configuration for DCA strategy and just have it work. That would be really cool.

Another one that immediately comes to mind is an auto router with split routes. This has been incorporated on other DEXs as well. This is a low hanging fruit for us. It immediately gives users even better quotes on trades. So SaucerSwap already consistently offers the best quotes across any trading platform on Hedera, but split routes via an auto router, along with auto slippage would just be the cherry on top. We would fully be able to take advantage of the currently over $130 million of liquidity in the SaucerSwap protocol. Better capital efficiency is better trading experience, So that one is pretty high up on the list. 

\---

ABFTFTW 

Rather saucy indeed, Sir. Next question from Anonymous Again, are there plans for limit orders this year? 

Peter 

The answer is yes. We plan to develop and launch limit orders this year. 

\---

Pine\_apple 

Awesome, limit orders it is. So switching gears. Do you have any updates on the Axelar bridge? Also, do you plan to integrate any bridges seamlessly with SaucerSwap UI? 

Peter 

Yeah. So as mentioned in the intro or first question, Axelar is expected to be live on Mainnet in January 2025 this month. We are ready to support their native bridge, this Squid router, at launch. Already completed the UI integration work, I want to say two, maybe three months ago, to ensure a seamless user experience bridging to and from Hedera. So that work is done. We have nothing else to do on that front. We're just waiting for the integration to be done on their end. 

\---

ABFTFTW 

Absolutely, that sounds pretty awesome. Can't wait for that to go live. Next question from Anonymous. What are the reasons V1 Pools can be created by a user but V2 Pools use governance? 

Peter 

Yeah, this is an excellent question, and you'll see that on the roadmap we have permissionless Version 2 Pool creation as an item. Let me quickly explain this. There are two main considerations behind the decision to make V2s Pool creation governance based. So the first is Version 2 has multiple fee tiers:  there's a 0.05% fee tier, 0.15%, 0.30% and 1.00%. Those fee tiers require careful consideration to avoid liquidity fragmentation. So if you have duplicate pools with different fee tiers, it can also create confusion for liquidity providers. If you are a liquidity provider who wants to put your HBAR and USDC tokens to work, then which pool are you going to choose, the 0.30% pool or the 1.00% pool? Maybe the APRs switch back and forth and the strategy isn't as aligned, plus you get some liquidity fragmentation between those two pools. That's the main point.

The second point is that not all token pairs benefit from Concentrated Liquidity. So if you have a highly volatile pair, for example like a meme coin and HBAR paired together, that's often better suited for Version 1 with a constant product formula, which is X\*Y equals K, due to the higher volatility risk. While something like a stablecoin pair or something that's loosely pegged like HBAR-HBARx, benefits far more from Version 2's Concentrated Liquidity. So we do plan again to make Version 2 pool creation permissionless this year, but we want to implement it thoughtfully and maintain a good user experience, prevent liquidity fragmentation, and prevent user confusion.

I will just also add a quick addendum to those two points that the auto router split routing could help with the issue of liquidity fragmentation and multiple fee tiers. It would basically split up one trade - instead of taking one path, it could split up 60% into one path, 30% into another, 10% into the last, - to find the best output amount. That is somewhat of a prerequisite for a seamless transition to fully permissionless V2 pool creation. We don't want to rush out permissionless V2 pool creation at the expense of capital efficiency and user experience. 

\---

Pine\_apple 

Wow, thanks for the insight, Peter. That's very useful information, so moving towards more of the DAO governance, one user is asking successful elections requiring over an X amount worth of SAUCE centralizes voting power, allowing a few wallets to influence or control votes. How can this improve? 

Peter 

Yeah. So we do understand this concern, but elections have successfully passed despite the threshold, indicating that the system is functioning as designed. The correct threshold exists somewhere between two extremes. One of those is that if every election passes, the system isn't working, and if every election fails, the system isn't working. You want some elections to pass and some of them to fail. And SAUCE, and by xSAUCE through single-sided staking, simply serves as SaucerSwap's governance token, so having a greater balance naturally confers more voting power, which is a fundamental utility of the token.

We do expect the pass rate of elections to improve further with increased hardware wallet support for Hedera tokens and consensus service transactions from projects like Citadel Wallet and Ledger in the future. We do know that some users sit out from elections because they don't want to move their tokens from their hardware wallet. Once we have that support, we do expect participation and pass rate to improve. 

\---

ABFTFTW 

Well stated, Peter. Next question from Anonymous. Is there a possibility of a SaucerSwap app being developed in the future to complement the web browser plugins? 

Peter 

Yes, that is on our roadmap. Dedicated mobile app is included in the near term category. So rather than just replicating the web interface, we want to design a mobile first experience with optimized transaction flows, tailored performance for mobile device. Development will begin on that after completing immediate term priorities like the website redesign, which I mentioned and transaction flow optimization. 

\---

Pine\_apple 

Yay, awesome sauce. Now users can snag that special token on the go. I'm so looking forward to this.  So the next question is actually not from Anon, and it's from one of our community members, Celestial Being. And they're asking when will the new roadmap be announced or updated? 

Peter 

Yeah. So for those joining late, we republish our new roadmap for this year and beyond. It outlines development priorities across three categories: immediate, near term, and future. You can find it in our documentation at [docs.saucerswap.finance](http://docs.saucerswap.finance) and it focuses on some key pillars that we've been talking about. Infrastructure, User experience, and an ecosystem growth initiatives, as well as just project features. 

\---

ABFTFTW 

Celestial being has a follow up. Some platforms have deployed a long term token lock up period. 60 days, one year, etcetera. Should we consider something similar long term SAUCE or xSAUCE lock up? 

Peter 

Yeah. So this is an interesting one. We have talked about this before. We have considered various token locking mechanisms. In the early days, we had an idea for like gamified farming, which was you could lock into a farm for a certain period of time. Looked at the same thing for single-sided staking, but we have kind of shifted our focus. We want to expand SAUCE utility through features that provide real value to the DEX, and not implement artificial lock up, which is kind of just like a perpetual motion machine in its most extreme form. We're not really interested in that at all.

Single-sided staking already provides a sustainable yield through protocol fees, HBAR staking rewards, and supplemented by farm emissions. Our upcoming Community Pools will add another layer of utility over that by allowing xSAUCE holders to earn new project tokens. I also just think our users, from a lot of feedback, appreciate the ability to unstake their SAUCE at any time. So on this issue, we follow the idea that sometimes the most simple solution is the best one. 

\---

Pine\_apple 

Thanks for that, Peter. So these next questions are all related, so I'm just going to read them in order. So firstly by Anon, since launch in 2022, Community Pools and NFT staking were promised soon, and 2025, these remain unfulfilled. What steps will you take to speed up development? Following that from PayPay47, are there any upcoming future perks for members who still hold the Planck Epoch Collectible NFTS? And then lastly from Dante Rodriguez. I really like how other websites have NFTs that boost liquidity or farming. Do you all expect to incorporate anything similar? 

Peter 

Yeah. So Community Pools were initially delayed as we prioritized other features like SaucerSwap Version 2. This turned out to be worthwhile. At the time, it was a fruitful re-prioritization. However, with Hedera DeFi ecosystem expanding now with some projects like [memejob.fun](http://memejob.fun) and more projects going through launch pads, we have outlined a clear vision for Community Pools in our roadmap.

So the next phase of single-sided staking is Phase 2 and that involves getting the xSAUCE that you get from staking SAUCE in Phase 1, and you can stake the xSAUCE in Community Pools to earn project tokens, and Phase 3 is the Saucelings NFTs providing a reward multipliers. As stated before, those legacy Planck Epoch Collectible NFTs will be redeemable for Sauceling NFTs, so that bridges are earliest supporters into this new rewards ecosystem.

We have reimagined what Community Pools can be by seeing projects like [memejob.fun](http://memejob.fun) and other launchpads operating on the network. Before, there just weren't enough new projects launching to support a feature like Community Pools. That has changed. Community Pools should support the community and the broader community at that. So we are actually really excited about this new envisioned system that eliminates any single ecosystem dependency, and supports the entire ecosystem and broader HTS economy.

So if you are interested in that new vision, it's in our [Medium article](https://medium.com/@SaucerSwap/saucerswap-2025-beyond-4bd55aed767e). The long and the short of it is basically that we want to make Community Pools more democratized. Make it easier for projects to launch Community Pools. Make it more permissionless, rather than having just one track to create a Community Pool, which I think was a design flaw from before. 

\---

ABFTFTW 

Indeed. Next question. The liquidity is the lifeblood of a DEX. How to attract more project parties through reward mechanisms, partnerships, etcetera? 

Peter 

Yeah, another great question. So far we have done well with liquidity. We actually think that the main thing to focus on is putting that liquidity to work and maximizing volume. There is a flywheel effect that occurs when volume increases, it generates more fees for liquidity providers, and that leads to higher APRs in those pools, leading to more liquidity. So volume is kind of the leading metric.

Beyond that though, there are ways we can optimize for liquidity growth per say and our approach is multifaceted. It's also outlined in our roadmap. Some items in the immediate term are a LARI system refinement data-driven reward optimization. I talked about that before. Overhaul token classification system for seamless project onboarding. Talked about that as well. Improved analytics for liquidity providers so they can see more insight into how their positions have done in the past are doing now. And also cross-chain integrations to bring in more liquidity from other networks. That one should probably be at the top of the list. Honestly, that is that's the most important.

After that in the near term, we have Community Pools launching to incentivize new project participation that in turn will grow liquidity. Auto DCA tools for more efficient capital deployment, and further cross-chain integrations with projects like LayerZero can support even more interoperability with other networks. Again, super important and that will act as a vehicle for more users and more liquidity to migrate to Hedera.

So the key here for optimizing for liquidity growth in particular is building infrastructure that makes liquidity provision both efficient, rewarding and accessible, say through the interoperability. 

\---

Pine\_apple 

Thanks for that, Peter. We are living through exciting times. Next one is also from Celestial Being. Are there any key performance indicators that the team is going to focus on this year? 

Peter 

So yes, I did touch on this. So I did just wanna mention, we talked about this before but it is quantitative and qualitative metrics. Really quick, just going through it. Quantitative KPIs is our user growth, trading volume, TVL across Version 1 & Version 2, and transaction success rate. And then qualitative \[metrics are\] user experience consistency, platform reliability, support, ticket resolution and community feedback. So those are the metrics we track to ensure that our development priorities align with actual user needs. 

\---

ABFTFTW 

Alright. Has the team considered using some of the rewards or revenue generated to buy USDC and bring more USDC into the platform? 8BitTrade says what steps can be taken to maintain the Hedera USDC peg and keep it within a tight trading range of USDC \[hts\] and USDC on other chains? 

Peter 

Yeah. So USDC stability on Hedera involves understanding the distinction between native USDC and USDC \[hts\]. Our focus to support stablecoin growth on Hedera relies on a few items. Number one is maintaining an efficient bridge. Actually, setting up that efficient bridge is the first item and then maintaining it. For example, this was mentioned in the [last AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaucerSwap/comments/1h51oyj/unofficial_transcript_of_saucerswap_ama_2024/), but it is a really big feature of the upcoming Squid router via Axelar integration and that is USDC from other networks will come across on Hedera as Hedera native USDC rather than USDC \[hts\]. So we hope to see more homogeneity of stablecoin liquidity rather than kind of two versions of USDC on SaucerSwap.

And specifically, the DAO can support deep liquidity in USDC pairs, and this is a governance matter. It can be initiated at any time by any user through the appropriate governance processes outlined in our documentation. So aligning incentives to grow USDC on SaucerSwap once that USDC is in the ecosystem, is kind of Step 2.

And the third thing here is implementing the optimal fee tiers for stablecoin pools. This does relate to the earlier question around making Version 2 pools fully permissionless and not mediated by a governance process, and some of the challenges surrounding that. So just with regards to the peg, that is primarily maintained through arbitrage opportunities and market efficiency rather than direct intervention. Our Version 2 Pools do have minimal slippage with the 0.05% fee tiers and very tight liquidity.

So to grow USDC on Hedera, it's kind of getting the USDC into Hedera first here, minting it natively or having bridges to allow users to bring in USDC from other networks that mints Hedera native USDC and then aligning incentives on SaucerSwap to grow that liquidity within Liquidity Pools. 

\---

Pine\_apple 

Thanks so much for that, Peter. So we have Axelar integration, limit orders, permissionless V2 Pool creations up on the roadmap. So Anon is wondering how can individual community members promote SaucerSwap? 

Peter 

Yeah. So the most effective community promotion comes through education and authentic engagement. Community members can help answer questions in our Discord, share their experiences. One of the best ways is just complaining to us about things that you don't like about SaucerSwap. It really helps that feedback is super super valuable from a qualitative evaluation point of view. That is a great way. It's not direct promotion, but it helps refine the product, which is an indirect way to promote the product.

We've also seen some community members create educational content if they have the means and interest to do. That is a great thing as well. Seeing some tutorials pop up on YouTube, for example from users is really cool to see and seems to get some good traction.

We actually also have a monthly award for this very purpose. Every month, we reward a user who has gone above and beyond in either promoting SaucerSwap, helping users, stuff of that nature, and we send them some SAUCE tokens. It's a award we call the Dog Star award. It's basically a Community participation award.

In any case with promoting SaucerSwap, we believe organic grow through informed users creates the strongest network effects rather than artificial promotion. We do try to limit how much we just kind of throw to just kind of unfocused marketing spend. I think is a pretty poor use of a marketing budget. We want to empower users instead. I think that's pays dividends in the long run. And in 2025, I think most people see through artificial growth anyway. You see like a video just really highlighting one project in particular. And I think people see that and I think it hurts the brand integrity for that product. We strongly prefer organic growth. 

\---

ABFTFTW 

So in other words, don't forget to like, comment and smash that subscription button. Alright, next question. Are you concerned that the success of the PACK coin might diminish SAUCE's market cap? Is there any concern that HashPack might evolve into a fully fledged DEX in the future? Uh oh. 

Peter 

Not at all. We are not concerned about that one bit. We view ecosystem growth as positive for all participants. I mean HashPack has been a super valuable partner to us and just Hedera DeFi development. They've played such an instrumental role and their success contributes to broader ecosystem adoption. That's really what we're aiming for. That's the most important thing we can achieve.

HashPack leverages SaucerSwap liquidity pools for their in-wallet swaps, And this provides value both for HashPack users, having accessibility and convenience to swap within their wallet, and SaucerSwap users like liquidity providers who benefit from the increased trading volume.

So our focus remains on building the best DEX possible. We think HashPack is an excellent wallet. Just speaking personally, it's the best wallet I've ever used. The key point is different projects can coexist, while serving distinct purposes in the ecosystem. SaucerSwap and HashPack's relationship is about as symbiotic as a partnership can get, in my opinion. 

\---

Pine\_apple 

I absolutely agree. Another one from Anon. Would SaucerSwap ever consider implementing a fixed 6% APR for staking, similar to HashPack PACK staking?

Peter 

So short answer, probably no. Our yield mechanism for single-sided staking is - we really like it. Combines protocol fees, HBAR staking rewards, and some supplemental farm emissions. It is designed to be sustainable, activity driven, rather than fixing a rate from emissions. We're not trying to knock that approach, we just like our approach. Our approach does ensure that yields reflect actual protocol usage and performance, rather than arbitrary targets. It also reduces any reliance on inflationary tokenomic models for the sole purpose of rewarding stakers, which is a dangerous model for a DEX to commit to in the long term. Again, we're not trying to knock that. We think PACK stacking is awesome. We're really happy with our SAUCE staking architecture. 

\---

ABFTFTW 

And not to mention that Joseph would be really sad that we didn't think he had beautiful mind anymore. Next question comes from 8BitTrade. Does at Iron\_NZ speak in any official capacity for SaucerSwap? I've been around in circles many times with him and other accounts on X on certain issues. 

Peter 

To clarify, only team members listed in the official documentation [docs.saucerswap.finance](http://docs.saucerswap.finance) speak in a official capacity for SaucerSwap Labs. So while we do appreciate community engagement, discussions by community members on social media should not be considered official statements. That is kind of a general disclaimer.

We have worked on a contractor basis with Iron on a number of development projects like the Discord Price Bots and our developer documentation. He is an incredible asset to the Hedera community. I also don't think he would ever pretend to speak in an official capacity on behalf of SaucerSwap Labs or anyone else for that matter. Iron is a super nice guy, great software engineer to boot. So we have had a great working relationship with him. 

\---

Pine\_apple 

Yeah, Iron's pretty awesome. So another question from Anon. Is there anything the SaucerSwap team or project could have improved upon in 2024? 

Peter 

Yeah, there are a lot of things we could have done better in 2024 and I think it's an important question and we should answer it honestly. I think in 2024, one thing is that we could have had better, more frequent communication about development progress and better communication in general. While we did put out several development updates, there was a lot of work being done in 2024 that was behind the scenes. We were scaling our systems, we were removing single points of failure in our infrastructure and those improvements should be invisible to the user. If it's not, something broke and the site goes down or something like that. Most of the time, I think actually, all of that kind of quote ""high risk work"" which can be reversed, the site can be brought back up, but we don't have any downtime for that, so it went extremely well, but it may have contributed to a sense that we weren't working on important developments because there was kind of nothing ostensibly happening, even though it was really important that we did that. So I think we could have done better at keeping everyone in the loop about backend work we did in 2024. Again that consumed a lot of our development bandwidth.

Number 2 is, despite the great progress we made last year, we always do want to develop more and faster and especially the features that the community requests. It's not great coming up to the AMAs and not having a new feature to announce or push to production. I think we did a pretty good job last year. Wish we could have implemented more community requested features. In any case, those have been reflected in our updated roadmap and we are committed to executing on that roadmap.

I think it would also have been good to have launched - a this is more for the developers but - a SaucerSwap subgraph in 2024 to allow for easier access to our smart contract event data. It would have made integrations easier, led to quicker growth. We have outlined this as a priority for 2025. So SaucerSwap subgraph. I would have loved to see that last year, but we will work on that this year.

Last one is and we get this a lot. Just a more consistent social media presence. It is important. We have not done a 10 out of 10 job on this. Sometimes it's difficult to balance putting out only posts of substance, that's kind of our ideal, with the other reality that you have to be frequently posting. So in 2025, we are reorienting our internal processes to adhere to a more consistent posting schedule. We want to maintain a social media presence even when we're heads down in developer mode. That kind of ties into our communications. So if we're working on something in the backend, we could talk more about that and keep everyone in the loop.

So all in all, I think 2024 was a great year for SaucerSwap. I mean, if you look at our metrics, it was an excellent year for volume, liquidity, user growth. All of the things we really care about and we certainly learned how to improve going into this year. So, we have noted those points of feedback. We will do better this year.

If you haven't checked it out yet, we published our multiyear roadmap. It is in our documentation. Also the latest tweet from us has a medium article where you can read all about it. So check out that post. Really, we couldn't be more excited to bring these features to life. Some of them have been a long time coming. Other ones kind of came out of left field like perpetual futures. We have not talked about doing that before, but I think that could be really exciting.

So we covered a lot of ground in this space. Of course, we had to touch on community pools, otherwise it would not be a true SaucerSwap AMA. Limit orders, mobile app plans, perpetual futures, SaucerSwap Version 3, interoperability with bridges and possible multi-chain expansion. So if you want more details, the new roadmap is live. Again, docs.saucerswap.finance.

ABFTFTW 

Yeah, this was a banger.  I don't think we've had one this long since like 2022. But anyway, we hope everyone enjoyed this AMA. Hope you learned something about our latest trajectory, what it means moving forward. But before we sign off, as usual, I believe Song has a few more words. 

Pine\_apple 

Thanks Adam. Well, that was a really action-packed AMA. There's a lot of bullish features slated to come out in 2025, and this just makes Hedera look super great and awesome in the horizon. So even though we are on Spaces, this wouldn't be a SaucerSwap AMA if we didn't award a community member a Dog Star award.

So recap for those of you who are new to the SaucerSwap ecosystem, every month or every time we hold an AMA, we award a user a Dog Star award, and those users have been outstanding and helping promote SaucerSwap and Hedera for the greater good. And this could to be through tweets, videos, insights, educational materials, or just being a positive, engaging member. So starting off in 2025, in a bullish way, congratulations to Decree Art. Thank you so much for your continued support on X. DM me with your wallet ID to claim your SAUCE tokens.

And thanks everyone, that pretty much concludes our Spaces. So thanks for tuning in.

Five (maddeningly self-indulgent) Diptyque reviews,fragrance,1hsq5gm,2025-01-03 11:19:57,53,0.97,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1hsq5gm/five_maddeningly_selfindulgent_diptyque_reviews/,KS1618,,"I’ve been a fan of Diptyque’s approach to perfumery ever since someone gifted me a small tester of 34 Blvd. St-Germain EDT a few years ago. This year, my mum surprised me with Diptyque’s holiday set of five EDP samples for Christmas! We’re working with five scents: Fleur de Peau, Tam Dao, Do Son, Eau Rose, and Orphéon. Here are some thoughts:

# Orphéon - 10/10

If I could, I’d spend the rest of my life in a sexy, dimly-lit cocktail bar, and the eponymous jazz bar which lends Orphéon its name and its olfactory sensibilities is *exactly* the kind of space I’d linger in for hours, from sunset until sunrise the following morning. 

When I think of nightclubs and jazz bars from the 70s, I think of cigarette smoke, and of ice-cold gin martinis in coupe glasses; I think of women in furs and men in heeled leather boots. I think of stolen kisses and lipstick stains. Orphéon manages to capture all of that—the romance of a fleeting glance shared by two strangers, the transgressive fantasy of a club draped in blackout curtains—in a presentation that’s both impressionistic and bitingly nostalgic. It opens with juniper berries and pepper, and the effect—cold, fragrant, spiced—is that of a briny dirty martini spilled onto a silk slip. There’s something smoky that hangs low over the fragrance, and persists throughout its lifespan; it’s narcotic and sweet, like a cigarette being lit against the chill of a Parisian midwinter. As Orphéon dries down, it moves from the bar to the dancefloor, replacing the juniper and pepper with tonka and cedarwood; the tonka’s warm, and the way it gradually bleeds into Orphéon’s foreground isn’t altogether unlike what the temperature change between two bodies feels like when they end up tangled in each other in the corner of a bar, or in the backseat of a cab. The powderiness feels a lot like makeup, yeah—but it’s louche, the way *smeared* makeup ruined by a night of recklessness and revelry is. The cedarwood, on the other hand, leans more masculine—it’s loosely reminiscent of the woody austerity that anchors most fougères. 

Orphéon is what I want every night of my life to smell like, from now until the day I drop dead. I’ve been on the search for a signature for a while now; I think I’ve found it. This is a stunning fragrance, and even its lackluster longevity and restrained projection don’t count against it. After all, isn’t getting someone to move closer to you the entire point of meeting a stranger at a jazz bar? 10/10, no notes. It’s a perfect scent.

# Fleur de Peau - 5/10

I’ve heard Fleur de Peau described as clean and soft, like freshly-laundered linens. I’ve also heard it described as mildly erotic. (Someone on this sub said it smelled like sex. And not figuratively.) Sex, as a rule, has never smelled like fresh laundry to me, so I went into this not really knowing what to expect. Imagine my fucking surprise, then, when FdP devolved, quite immediately, into boiled carrots on my skin. (What kind of sex are you people having? I’m concerned.) I know that there’s a listed carrot seed note in the opening—I *know.* That doesn’t mean I was prepared to smell like one-third of a mirepoix for half an hour. It’s not an unpleasant scent, but not something I’m looking to smell like, either. 

Given some time, though, FdP transforms into something quite remarkable. It’s difficult to negotiate a balance between “fresh laundry” and “sex,” but Fleur de Peau manages to; it smells a lot like waking up next to someone you love, but in a hotel room. Hotel rooms are almost invariably cold and sterile, until they’re shared with someone you adore—and then they feel a bit like home. Fleur de Peau manages to capture that phenomenon in the drydown: it’s soft and intimate and immediately, instinctively familiar; it’s not fresh, but it’s clean and warm. It does smell like skin, in the way that the steam that lingers in a bathroom after a shower smells like skin—a little soapy, slightly powdery, but kind of visceral, too. Ultimately, I’d hoped for the musks to pull a touch stronger on my skin—it’s all a hair *too* laundry-detergent for me—but I see this blossoming on the right person’s skin. I also can’t really get past the carrot opening. Sorry. I know this one’s a popular one; I can appreciate it for how thoughtfully-composed it is, but I don’t see myself wearing it. 

# Eau Rose - 8/10

I’ll admit that I fully expected to loathe this one. Whatever most rose-centric scents lack in subtlety, they tend to make up for in sheer obstinacy, clinging to your skin and hair and clothes like a bad habit you can’t seem to kick; I’ve never encountered a rose scent that wasn’t too cloying, or too brash, or too *obvious* for me to enjoy. I was, needless to say, more than a bit apprehensive about testing a fragrance named *Eau Rose,* which is as straightforward as a fragrance name by Diptyque gets. 

Consider me a convert. There’s nothing syrupy or saccharine about Eau Rose; despite the listed lychee note, Eau Rose feels quiet and reserved without coming across as oppressively dark or gothic. It’s an introvert’s rose—one that sits close to the skin, but asserts its presence there, and really blooms once you get close enough. There’s something slightly bitter and peppered in the background—I’m guessing that’s the artichoke—but it doesn’t feel vegetal; it does lend some real depth to a fragrance you’d expect to be rather linear, though, which I appreciate. 

The rose here’s a jammy rose, but it’s unsweetened, if that makes any sense. It’s a rose that’s about to wilt—there’s an intensity to it that can only ever come with decay. I’m not sure how frequently I could wear this one without tiring of it, but it’s a gorgeous, subversive take on rose. I loved this one.

# Tam Dao - 7/10

Oh, this one’s pretty. I’ve always loved Mysore sandalwood—I’m ethnically Indian, and it reminds me of my grandparents’ home in Calcutta—and I’m not surprised by how much I enjoyed testing this. The coriander, lime, and ginger both ground and brighten the sandalwood, and there’s none of the characteristic bite of synthetic or Australian sandalwood present here at all; I’m not sure if Tam Dao uses real Mysore sandalwood, but it’s an accord that Diptyque’s managed to approximate quite well. The scent’s rather linear, at least on me—what you get upfront is, more or less, what you get with the drydown—though the sparkling, near-effervescent ginger/lime opening burns off about an hour into wearing this perfume. I can’t describe the sandalwood note here as anything but *soft;* it’s subtly sweet, tangibly creamy, a shade fresh, and a little lactonic. I wouldn’t go as far as calling it “meditative,” the way some people do, but it’s a deeply comforting scent. It’s rich without feeling oppressive, luxurious without feeling dense, and clean without feeling sanitized. And it’s *incredibly* natural—an elusive characteristic of perfumery that I think Diptyque’s got a knack for capturing. 

Ultimately, though, my biggest knock against Tam Dao is how inoffensive it is. It is, perhaps, the platonic ideal of a workplace scent: intimate, accessible, probably universally-appreciated. Regrettably, it’s also a tiny bit boring. I do enjoy this scent, but I think I’d like it a lot more as a room spray (or on someone else) than I do as a perfume I’d wear myself. It’s altogether lacking in the drama that some of the other scents here nail.

# Do Son - 2/10

As far as “house DNA” goes, Diptyque’s lies in their consistent exercise of restraint. Their fragrances are subtle and organic; they’re rarely loud. It’d be easy for a tuberose / white-floral fragrance like Do Son to be “too much,” but Do Son’s probably the only tuberose perfume that I’ve been able to test without it having immediately triggered a migraine.

That said, “not a scrubber” is a low bar to clear. This just isn’t a profile I’m into. As a tuberose fragrance, there’s no doubt in my mind that Do Son is objectively well-composed—I see fans of this kind of scent falling for Do Son *hard.* There is, after all, plenty to like about it—it’s delicate, natural, and not unpleasant. But it feels like getting hit in the face with a bouquet. Repeatedly. I’m bloodied and covered in petals. It’s just so violently perfume-y; it almost reminds me of those little scented test-strips that used to show up in department-store catalogues.

This one’s the only sample I don’t really see myself finishing, or even reaching for again, but it makes for a halfway decent bedtime scent. I’m sure Do Son has its fans—and at least some of them are, no doubt, devoted to it—but I’m afraid this one’s simply not for me.

# PARTING THOUGHTS:

I’d consider this Discovery Set a *resounding* success. I enjoyed 3/5 of the fragrances here—and fell head-over-heels for at least one; I also plan on re-sampling Fleur de Peau, since I do really see some untapped, latent potential within it. Maybe it’s just a skin chemistry thing, but I’m hoping that giving it another shot might bump it up a few points for me. If I had to score a full bottle of any of these (which I intend to do soon!), it’d be—unsurprisingly—Orphéon, which I’m absolutely obsessed with. "
Taiji in Frankfurt am Main - recommendations,taijiquan,1hs0y1w,2025-01-02 13:43:29,3,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/taijiquan/comments/1hs0y1w/taiji_in_frankfurt_am_main_recommendations/,znorfel,,"I am moving to Frankfurt am Main in Germany for work for six months. I would like to continue my taiji practice while abroad. I was hoping someone in this sub might have a recommendation.
My personal preference is to learn taiji as a martial art, not merely as practicing forms / for the health benefits / moving meditation (although I do appreciate these aspects). I am young (29y old) and although I have a lingering foot injury from playing competitive sports as a kid/adoloscent/young adult, I am in relatively good health.
There are several schools and teachers in Frankfurt. One teaches Lee style and has the best reviews on Google. Others teach Li Zhi Chang style, which seems to be more about qi gong. There is also a Chen school a bit out of town with lineage to Chen Zhaowang. Another school teaches wushu / gong fu / taiji in the Chan Qi Dao Kong Fu tradition
Recommendations based on the above or on personal experience from living in Frankfurt are welcome. Thanks!"
"Starchaser: Beyond ~ Autumnhollow Chronicles - S03E10B - ""War Camp at the Rogue Rift (pt.2)"" ",HFY,1hrudju,2025-01-02 09:03:24,3,0.66,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hrudju/starchaser_beyond_autumnhollow_chronicles_s03e10b/,Plus-Insect6864,OC,"[<<Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hrqxky/starchaser_beyond_autumnhollow_chronicles_s03e10a/) | [Home](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1f2i3a0/starchaser_beyond_anotherrewrite_prologue/) | [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/elmir) | [Wiki](https://elmirarchhamofomega.wordpress.com/party-sheet-post-season-2/) | [Next>>](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1htglwy/starchaser_beyond_autumnhollow_chronicles_s03e11/)

**Story So Far:**

* *The Whales defeat the Lifebane Titan*
* *The expedition team rest inside a redoubt.*
* *Philia brings up the possibility of bring called to some noble's manor and being made their lapdogs.*
* *Philia suggests that Ingrid preempt them all by writing to the King of Veles for an audience since they've likely been observed by royal spies known as ""The Crows""*
* *Gwen says that only Ingrid and Cecil need to attend, when Zefir brings up the limited range of their comms devices, she tell him about the Satellites that Philia launched many years ago.*

\_\_\_

Inside the lecture hall-like chamber, the other adventurers began their round of questions with the guildsman, Rushmore on the other hand was conversing with each other.

""Any buts?"" Ingrid inquired, leaning back on her seat, her steepled fingers touching the other’s tips. ""You're making this sound too easy...""

""It won't be."" Siria replied quickly ""Honestly, it's best if they get a couple of Gold Ranks and close it down, but they're currently tied at the moment dealing with stragglers abroad I imagine. All-in-all I'd say the Rogue Rift will be forcibly closed by us adventurers within a week or two...""

""Now hold on..."" Ingrid sat up quickly ""you're implying we can go in and not burnt to a crisp!""

""Ether Quartzes, Starchaser."" Siria said, mindful of not revealing names since Cecil was probably broadcasting. ""They stabilize the Ether allowing even otherworlders like us to walk about freely within its effective range. When you start feeling your mana tingling that means it’s time to head back.""

""Quartz?” Ingrid said incredulously “Like the stuff in our wristwatches?""

""Yup."" Philia replied, spinning a knife in her hand. ""They hold ether pretty nicely as well, gotta do some magic stuff on them first, although it is naturally recurring. And no, in case you're thinking our watches could explode on us, they won't""

""We destroy the ether quartzes, it'll collapse the portal and forcibly bring us back from where we were sent."" Kvaris suggested, grinning widely and showing off her adorably sharp canines.

""I'm sure I'll be fine..."" Ingrid replied ""I can survive bumping my head on everything and the kitchen sink along the way, but the others? I don't think they'll survive that...""

""It doesn't work that way."" Kinu explained ""once the portal collapses, all foreign matter is simply warped back out. Now, if you want to grab anything, you item box it.""

""And how far are these quartz formations going to be?” Ingrid asked, turning to the Enthana sisters. “I hope it's not like finding a needle in a haystack...""

Viel joined in ""S*tachaser Actual, I can use a spell to locate these quartz formations.*""

""Also, the Rogue Rift from the other side is essentially a triangulation of all the nearby quartz formations. In other words, we'd spawn somewhere in the middle of it..."" Philia assured her, it was clear that not only was she selling the idea to Ingrid, but that she too was confident the team could handle this. ""The Ether can't pass through solid objects or liquids, which means it can be traversed one way or the other, we won't have to dig our way to the quartz or swim... mostly.""

There was some silence as Ingrid thought about this for a moment.

""Let's say we collapse a quartz formation. Boom. Its Ether-equalizing field collapses. What's stopping us from getting fried now that it's no longer shielding us?"" Ingrid asked.

""*Overlapping fields.*"" Viel spoke in reply ""*One among several conditions to be met in order to generate a Rogue Rift, that's why it's so rare. These quartz formations need to have overlapping fields with at least a couple of them. Even if we collapse one formation, it'll still require an hour or two before it loses its potency.*""

“*I can always put a protective blessing to blanket us if the need arises,*” Iohann said.

""You've done this before, Ranger-Two?"" Ingrid asked.

""A couple of times, with Gold-Ranks, with Royal Knights, with mages from a certain academy as well...""

""Sounds top-shelf."" Ingrid remarked ""We're none of those.""

""If you'll trust me, I say we can do it."" Siria assured her. ""Considering what magic we've done, we've inadvertently done our necessary warm ups.""

There were another several seconds of silence.

""I want everyone's personal take on this."" Ingrid said ""Speak freely and honestly. No one will take it against you... I'll make sure of that.""

""Overlord, you might want to bring some Geneva Suggestions."" Philia was gonna say more but Cecil suddenly interrupted her with-

""*Up! Up! And away!*"" Cecil cried as he rocketted off to the sky back to Autumnhollow.

""Spearheading into dangerous territory is what I do all the time..."" Sammy said. ""There's great rewards to be reaped in those Rift Worlds, and we need those rewards to grow stronger.""

The Enthana sisters shrugged in sync with each other ""We've spent years in the forests of the East. Part of it was a fallen city like Teth-Odin, so yes, when it comes to dealing with creatures never before seen, we're confident we’ll prevail.""

""*As for me,*"" Peanut piped in ""*My former team has collapsed a Rogue Rift once, it was a dangerous job but we persevered!*"" her voice cracked a bit at remembering her old friends.

""*The way to righteousness is not walked by simply staying in the lighted path.*"" Iohann intoned, her words sounded like she was reading from scripture ""*For what is fear but a lack of faith.*""

""Yea, though I walk through the shadow of valley and death, I fear no evil. Psalm twenty-three four."" Ingrid quipped.

""*What an interesting scripture.*"" Iohann remarked.

""I was raised Catholic. I'm of Irish descent after all."" Ingrid said.

Selphie spoke up last ""*The plants of those lands... I'm sure I can find something useful... or make them be of aid to us.*""

Johnny croaked excitedly.

""*Ermmm...*"" Cuddly murmured, there was a crunch louder than usual as the hare bit a carrot in half, indicating that he was just as determined.

“Mice?”

To Ingrid and Philia's bemusement, they began stamping their feet and squeaking a mouse-song.

""*Awkward...*"" Zefir laughed as he recognized the tune.

""What are they singing?"" Kvaris asked, her ears wiggling as Neith started playing an accompanying brass band.

""Ze mouse really vant a tank."" Philia said cryptically in a strange accent.

""Louder."" Ingrid said.

“*Bestaubt sind die Gesichter. Doch froh ist unser Sinn. Ja! Unser Sinn!”* Kaguya sang.

“*Kaguya, what the hell!?*” Arek laughed, once again logging in at the weirdest possible time.

\_\_\_

As Rushmore made its way back to the Cute Mascot team, the latter had been deluged by questions from the nearby adventurers who had listened in.

“Should we hurry back?” Philia asked as Peanut ended up being an impromptu spokesman for the group.

“No,” Ingrid said calmly, their mics were muted, so Peanut couldn’t hear. ”Our little mushroom needs to flex that PR every now and then.”

“Pee Arr?” Kvaris asked.

“Shorthand in our world for Public Relations.” Philia explained “in other words, learning how to speak on behalf of our group with others.”

“Plus, it helps keep her mind off of the grieving process.” Ingrid said.

“Mhmm…” Siria murmured in agreement. “The claws of sorrow have no grip on a busy mind, so they say.”

“Exactly.” Ingrid smiled.

\_\_\_

“W-well it’s a magic device that…” Peanut began, seeing that she was stuttering, Neith spoke up for her.

“It’s a magic device that lets us communicate with each other from a distance.” the AI spoke,making the spider raise a leg and wave it at the crowd. “My master figures that it’ll save time if the information was disseminated this way.”

“You can talk?” someone asked.

“Indeed. I’m Neith, mark-one. First of my name to put it in your words. I am a self-aware automata.” The spider leaned forward for emphasis. “I think, and I feel just like you folks. Sadly, I’m reduced to being a pack-mule.”

“You do more than that!” Peanut protested, but Neith played the sound of a braying donkey, making everyone laugh.

The mice, still nibbling away at their cheese, perked up their tiny ears as they heard Ingrid's voice. Arthur bolted up straight and squeaked sharply what was probably a loud ""TEN-HUT!"" The other mice quickly snapped into attention, their paws shooting up to their foreheads in a proper salute, their backs ramrod straight.

""At ease, men."" Ingrid said, subconsciously straightening up and her gait becoming more regal.

The crowd looked up in disbelief as it was the human, not Siria nor the Enthana girls, nor the daos-folk aristocrat that was the tamer of these unnaturally intelligent creatures.

""Wheels up at 0800."" Ingrid said, briefly glancing at her wristwatch. ""As you were. Dismissed.""

 

The human let out a sigh as she flopped down, seemingly unaware that there was nothing there for her to sit on. The onlookers collectively held their breath, anticipating that she would make a grand buffoon of herself with a humiliating fall.

To their astonishment, the slime in his flying portal darted forward and quickly retrieved a white chair from within his royal dimension.

The chair emerged from the portal just in time for Siria to seize it and deftly place it behind Ingrid, still in mid-fall. She sprawled indolently on the chair, giving the unmistakable impression she was sure it would be there for her to land on.

The audience was astonished by the seamless coordination demonstrated by the two, the slime's uncanny ability to interpret the human's intentions, and the rare spectacle of the typically aloof elf attending to, of all things, a human.

Siria stood behind Ingrid, affectionately stroking her hair.

""We're assaulting the Rogue Rift."" she told everyone matter-of-factly.

""If we find it."" Ingrid added, leaning back into her plastic lawn chair. ""...that said, once we do, we'd like to pass on the information to the rest. Who wants to hold onto a weird artifact for a while?""

The crowd was murmuring amongst themselves, Ingrid figured that they were still waiting word from their own leaders after they returned to their teams from the LO. Some of them however, looked restless, eager to act on their own if need be.

A rhino-folk, the same one who had talked to the boar earlier, approached the group.

""I'm Rhamad from the Iron Stampede, I'm sure our leader..."" a heavy hand clapped his shoulder. The rhinoceros looked back and saw a crocodile nod his head in approval. Ingrid recognized the crocodile, who she was sitting behind earlier. He had a headdress that reminded her of what an Egyptian pharaoh would wear. The rhino smiled, grunting in response before continuing.

""...we'll take the artifact. We'll stay behind and await your word.""

""Are you sure about this, Rhamad?"" Ingrid said, sitting up and leaning forward. ""It may take us hours to find it, your team may lose out on profits if we take a while, assuming we find it today.""

""We're all losing out on account of that accursed portal."" His boar companion snorted, ""The higher-ranked adventurers after all, should be in the lower sections, clearing out the scourge of the mightier beasts further below, the longer we take to collapse the portal, the further this Demon City will be plunged in chaos.""

""He makes a good point."" Philia nodded.

Ingrid and Philia looked at each other, the latter nodded and took out of her Traveller's Valise a walkie-talkie, and tossed it over to Rhamad.

""Catch."" Philia said. The rhino caught it easily.

""*Arghhh!!*” Neith said, speaking only through the walkie-talkie, using the voice of an impish cartoon villain. Many adventurers jumped and backed away as the black box began talking, but others like Rhamad and his group were unconcerned.

“*What is the meaning of this!?*” the box demanded. The confusion and anger in its voice told Rhamad that it was in no position to harm anyone.

“*You will relay our message to our friends here.*” Ingrid said flatly.

“*Silence, wench!*” The imp snapped “*When I get out this little box, I-*”

Philia burst out laughing at Neith’s funny voice.

Thinking quickly Ingrid smiled and said “You talk big now that I can’t I pound you into submission, imp. Would you like Siria to release you for a while so you can experience another?”

“*Grrrrr!*”

“Enough of this.” Siria said, joining in “Before I forget we had a deal and never release you from that box.”

“*F-fine!*” the “Imp” said. “*J-just don’t release me with Ingrid around!*”

“Apologies taken.” Ingrid said in a rather bored voice, getting up from her chair, she addressed the gathered adventurers. “If you don’t mind, I’ll be paying the Pavillion a visit. I think we’re all gonna need every blessing we need for this expedition…”

\_\_\_

**A Redoubt near the Titan Cage, Present Day:**

Soft, crackling sounds emanated from the ice formation in the shape of a blooming rose. Spiderwebs of tiny fractures raced across the crystalline fracture as little flakes of ice broke off and pelted the stone floor of the redoubt. The rose didn't fracture into large fragments that could potentially break someone's bones if they were standing too close, but carefully fell apart in small harmless flakes that further shattered into tiny shards as they hit the ground.

Ingrid stirred within, as if unencumbered by all the ice around her. With a stretch of her arms and yawn, the structure collapsed into a cascade of fragments smaller than an ice cube.

Continuing to stretch, Ingrid sleepily walked down to greet her teammates who had a late lunch going, as well greeting the guests who had taken shelter into this redoubt.

“Interesting way of rejuvenating oneself.” Rhamad remarked.

""Rhamad!"" Ingrid chirped happily ""How'd it go?""

The rhino-folk nodded in greeting, his expression dour as usual but with a hint of excitement at the prospect of assaulting the Rogue Rift. ""The Iron Stampede had a few encounters,"" he began, ""It's our first visit after the Red Moon, the lot we've encountered are definitely not for our novice friends. Bart..."" he flicked his thumb at the Valiant Orc, who waved at her ""...is right, this portal cannot stand, we must collapse it today before it brings more of its foul occupants here.""

Ingrid waved back. She saw the pharaoh-crocodile conversing with Siria, it seemed like they were discussing plans regarding the upcoming assault. The rest of the Iron Stampede were there as well, a bright-eyed owl hovered near the mice, the bow slung across his shoulder marked him as an archer of the team, and considering his elaborate weapon and how his quiver's arrow tips glowed implied that his arrows were at least enchanted. He had a friendly demeanor with the mice, showing them how to knot dough that reminded Ingrid of a cruller, a treat she hadn't had in ages. Although this treat was savory rather than sweet as the mice packed in zesty herbs and sharp vegetables before the owl obliged and laid it out on the griddle.

A serval (cat-folk with cat heads) was discussing something with Philia as she stirred a cauldron, most likely conjured or summoned by one of the Iron Stampedes. Few of the mice waddled over and tossed ingredients into the bowl, sending a delicious aroma as the fragrant herbs and fresh meat interacted with the hot broth.

""Our team has a lot of active members, you see."" Philia was saying ""I would recommend that we seek out the largest concentration of Mana Quartz to hasten the process."" She paused and frowned slightly as she noticed some residue beginning to stick. Applying a bit of pressure, she vigorously rubbed with a spatula, dislodging the accumulated crust with a satisfying scraping noise and releasing the trapped spices that had clumped together.

""Besides, we imagine that the largest concentration may have a sizable nest of whatever's basking in the quartzes' radiance."" Philia continued ""I'm confident our team, the Whales, could fight our way to the formation and still have the strength to collapse those quartz formations.""

""Very well."" the serval, Kairos spoke up. ""I'm sure that now that everyone knows you've taken down a Lifebane Titan, most would push your team towards the most dangerous assignment of all.""

Philia sighed ""The problem is, we don't even know if the highest quartz formation holds such a challenge. Suppose we end up in a cave full of wild beasts? They would attach no importance to those rocks and might end up nesting near the sparser quartz formations, which means it might be the Iron Stampede that ends up dealing with the strongest monsters in the area. We can't afford to assume that we're going to get the worst of it. Each team must prepare for the possibility of encountering the fiercest opposition.""

Those nearby paused and nodded in agreement.

""The nobles are going to hear about this deed."" Kairos said, his voice having the same feline trill that Ingrid had heard in Zefir's. ""Our boss isn't too keen on being some noble's lackeys, kills the fun of exploration if you ask me.""

""I agree."" Ingrid said, walking in and looking at the stew. It looked and smelled heavenly. She recognized the serval as the same man at the gate when the team disembarked from the wagon. ""It's no fun being an adventurer if you're on a leash."" she smiled, the irony of her status being a human was not lost to her.

""I've taken care of it, Ingrid."" Philia winked.

""How?""

Philia smiled. ""Remember the time we resealed Glamis?""

Ingrid's eyes grew wide. ""Oh, yes! I got it.""

""Glamis?"" Kairos questioned, not grasping the context.

""Ingrid, Cecil and I, aren’t from here. A long time ago, Ingrid and I were sent to an allied nation on a dire mission."" Philia explained ""The Dark Empire was invading us all, and their scouts discovered an ancient castle that could be used to unleash chaotic magic. Had they succeeded, it would have caused widespread destruction and rendered the vast, afflicted area uninhabitable for centuries. Our allies were already overwhelmed and had neither the resources nor the expertise to reseal the volatile magic within the castle. Our resounding success led the allied nations to pressure our homeland to make us knights that answered to everyone. They recanted thanks to my former familiar at the time...""

""Philia's familiar was a Nightmare,"" Ingrid elaborated. ""To put it in your terms, a Fiend. His allegiance was only to her, so any attempt to control her was, in his eyes, a justification to call upon the Nightmares to invade our realm. Nobody wanted that, so they backed off.""

""Also,"" Cecil added ""We didn't like the terms they wanted to hold us accountable. Might as well just have surrendered to those Dark Empire bastards.""

""Amen to that"" Ingrid chimed in.

""Well that makes things easier for us."" Kinu remarked, she and her sister were busy putting away the sleeping bags and related gear, as the arrival of their visitors and the team waking up from their nap was only a few minutes ago.

""I would've argued with such people that as a subject of Freid, not only am I exempt but could extend it to all I'm affiliated with."" she continued, rolling up the last of the now-deflated air mattresses. These were neatly stored in a modern zip-up bag, for Cecil to retrieve shortly.

 

""So, has anyone taken a peek into the Riftworld yet?"" Ingrid inquired as everyone began to settle in for lunch.

""The other teams are currently securing the Titan Cage."" Khovrek, the crocodile leader, informed her. ""It appears to be turning into a war camp out there already."" He chuckled, adding, ""They've set up tents and started fires. The Rogue Rift opens up at a rocky moorland, rugged moorland with uneven ground and substantial stone cliffs surrounding it.""

""There's patches of forests too."" The owl, Yakael said. ""A combination of wide open ground and places one could take refuge, or opportunities one could get ambushed, we must all be careful...""

""Once we've collected our loot and broken the quartz, we should all give a signal that we've achieved our goal."" Yakael suggested. ""Fortunately, since we'll be outdoors for a change, I can use some fireworks.""

""Agreed."" Siria replied.

""Leave that to me."" Viel chirped ""Siria should conserve her mana for the really tough battles..."" she meowed as Siria patted her head.

“The Iron Stampede won’t be seeking out the quartz."" Khorak said, ""Instead, we will seek out powerful and dangerous foes and root out all that may hinder the others. The less there are that get in the way of others, the sooner we can collapse that accursed realm and restore light and relative safety in this labyrinth...""

""Agreed."" Sammy remarked, ""We should be in the lower levels instead, rooting out old, useless dynasties that can't hold back the influx of these newcomer monsters.""

Cecil chuckled as he dipped his tendril into a basket of ribs and fished out a few ""I guess we adventurers gotta moonlight as Praetorian Guards every now and then, huh?""

 

As the two teams exited the Redoubt, Khorak gestured to a small gathering of adventurers that had stationed themselves at the adjoining tunnel.

""May I introduce you to a promising team known as the Green Fury,"" he announced ""Despite being completely new to the dungeoning business they've proven themselves reliable in the safeguarding of merchant caravans.""

The Whales nodded in greeting.

""Oh!"" Cecil said in recognition ""You guys were sitting next to us at the veranda steps!""

""Yes, we are!"" the young sorian said, waving at Ingrid happily, who returned the favor.

The mice squeaked and waved their paws, cutely waddling over to them for pets and sniffs, their disciplined marching order dissolving into a cuddle pile.

""They're so cute!"" One of the Green Fury members, a young elf girl with a bow and quiver exclaimed.

""Y-you must be the leader!"" a little kobold looked up at Ingrid with awe in her eyes.

Ingrid crouched down to meet him at eye level, and offered a gentle smile ""Yep, that's me, Ingrid Lily.""

""I'm...I'm Alster."" the kobold stuttered, his eyes darting around nervously before focusing back on her. Ingrid smiled as the dog made cute whimpering sounds, probably of excitement.

""Thanks for protecting us while we recuperated, Alster."" Ingrid purred, rubbing foreheads with him and scratching his ears. She purred louder as he put his paws on her cheeks.

""Come."" Khorak said, ""let's all convene at the war camp.""

 

As they approached the designated meeting point, a group stepped into their path. Ingrid glanced back at Cecil and Philia who couldn't help crack a smile. The adventurer team ahead looked exactly like how someone with money to burn would decorate their character just to obtain a few seconds of clout by buying overpriced cosmetics.

Khorak growled in displeasure at seeing them.

“It’s the King Hawks.” the crocodile spat.

The Enthana sisters growled quietly, which to Ingrid’s ears confirmed they were quite the unpleasant bunch.

""I don't like their ilk"" Sammy glowered, protectively pulling Viel behind her.

Even without looking at them with mana-infused eyes, Ingrid could tell they were radiating some serious battle aura. Alster started making adorable whining sounds while the rest of the Green Fury huddled behind him. The Iron stampede snorted in agitation and puffed themselves up.

""You think they want our lunch money, Siria?"" Ingrid asked, not bothering to lower her voice.

[DAV no spoilers] DAV gameplay is mediocre ,dragonage,1hrtvxn,2025-01-02 08:39:10,1,0.51,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1hrtvxn/dav_no_spoilers_dav_gameplay_is_mediocre/,Least-Spite4604,Discussion,"Listen, I’m a DAO enjoyer, but I’m not here to talk again about action gameplay vs cRPG tactical gameplay, this topic has been beaten to death. I accepted that DAV is another genre compared to past games, and I also love action RPGs: Mass Effect, Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher, Sekiro, SW Jedi, I played and enjoyed all of them. And at the end of the day I’m enjoying DAV too, but not because of the gameplay sadly.

The problem here is not that DAV is an action game, but that it is a mediocre action game.

* Since the gameplay reveal there was a big focus on how you could make combos, and i was hooked by it, but they underdelivered: Every combo leads to the same big explosion (detonation, in game’s terms), while in DAI you could frozen and then shatter an enemy doing huge critical damage, or you could inflict nightmare (panic) to an enemy combining a sleep effect and an eldritch effect. Different kind of combos had different kind of effects. Here it’s just a big boom for extra damage and cc. Boring.
* This is also detriment to the enjoyment of the different capabilities: I’m pushed by the game to choose the combo abilities (prime-detonation) whenever possible, and so to unlock abilities that contributes to combos, and their primary standalone effects become secondary. Maybe I’m wrong in doing that, I’m starting to think, but that’s where the game is pushing me frankly.
* Capabilities that are too few in number: It's ok to have a limit of max three capabilities per time in combat, but let me have a skill tree with twenty capabilities to unlock. I don't feel the progression without having new abilities to test, even if I'll end up using always the same three. Also the companions already starts with basically all of their capabilities unlocked, so no sense of progression there either.
* The enemies are very similar to one another: fighting demons is basically the same as fighting venatori. You have the ranged enemy shooting colored sphere of energy, the quick melee enemy, and the shielded melee enemy. Darkspawn are the one that feels a bit different, because they have more mob variety. It gets repetitive very quickly, it feels like an MMO. Boss fights are more fun but also less common, of course.
* I don’t understand why they didn’t implement a companion system exactly like the ME trilogy, where the companions could get KO, and so at higher difficulties it was my job to move them around to avoid that. Well, I know the answer: because they are abilities carrier, you need them to make the aforementioned combos, so having them KO would remove too much from the gameplay. The problem is that also having them as immortal minions is detrimental to the gameplay: not just because the lack of control, but as I predicted before the release, you can exploit the fact that they make tiny amount of damage but they can’t die: they killed a boss with very low health while a was dodging his attacks because I was very low health too. Very underwhelming finish for a boss fight, let me say.

I think that this game would benefit from a robust post-release support the improves and iterate on the foundation layed down, the combat system is not outright bad, is serviceable, but the gameplay needs more variety, more content, more depth. DAI gameplay improved and became more challenging in the DLC, in my opinion. Sadly they already announced no DLC, too bad.

Disclaimer: I’m playing as a mage at nightmare difficulty. I doubt that playing warrior or rogue completely changes the experience, but i'm here to listen."
Mini/Minor Jackpots: When Changing Denom Does Nothing,GamblingSitesGames,1hrodtb,2025-01-02 02:26:11,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GamblingSitesGames/comments/1hrodtb/miniminor_jackpots_when_changing_denom_does/,PaleontologistTop446,,"There’s a subset of gamblers that believe that if you bet higher on any progressive machine, you’ll have a better chance at winning a progressive. While there’s many cases this is true, not all games are created equal.

In today’s post I’m going to talk about Minis and Minors specifically. Some classes of games treats these progressives as fixed and higher bets up your chances. In other cases, the Mini and Minor change based on your denomination, so switching denominations can change your chances.

# When Bet Level Matters

There are certain classes of games that have one set of progressive jackpots that are the same and accessible regardless of bet level. Examples of games in this format are Dancing Drums, Fu Dao Le, Ulimate Fire Link and Golden Gecko. One thing that tends to be true is they’re always a single denomination game.

This last trait tends to be important as multi-denomination games tend to account for the main reason for the Mini/Minor divide, which we’ll get to in a moment.

As such, since there’s one set of progressives, generally speaking, higher bets will see better chances at them than lower bets. For games like Dancing Drums or Fu Dao Le, you simply get an increased chance at entering the progressive screen, and the weighting of the chances of winning a given progressive after that screen triggers remains the same (you just get more chances).

For games like Golden Gecko, you see more progressive chances from the gems vs. gems that drop a multiplier.

So in this case, upping your bet does up your chances.

# When Bet Level… Somewhat Matters

Now let’s compare this to another class of game. Mighty Cash, Lock it Link, Lightning Link/Dragon Link, and so forth are examples of games with progressives where the Mini and Minor change.

You’ll many times see these games in a multi-denomination configuration, which is part of the reason why they change; they will proportionally increase. So in the Lightning Link example above, if you move from penny to nickel, they’ll increase by 5x, to account for the 5x change in denomination. This can matter in terms of your ability to win them, as now the bonus is $50 for a Mini instead of $10.

Betting $5 on a penny denomination vs. a nickel will mean you’ll have 5x the chance of winning that Mini on a penny denomination vs. a nickel denomination, because the prize is proportionally smaller. So when players say they get more jackpots on a $5 bet on pennies, it’s important to remember at that bet size the Mini is now in effect a ball that is 2x the bet level; those are easy to drop at any bet level. Meanwhile, a $5 bet on nickels makes the ball a 10x ball because of its $50 value – not necessarily impossible to drop, but less likely.

Usually a hallmark of this type of machine is that they are not actually progressives at all – progressives imply the jackpots will increment. But you’ll see here they’re called a Bonus because they’re flat and change proportionally.

Meanwhile, the Major and Grand on these type of machines are generally the same across the board, so the rules regarding the increasing chance of winning based on overall bet level would still apply here.

The launch of Aristocrat’s Dollar Storm as a sequel to Lightning Link and Dragon Link does change the rules a bit as on their highest end denominations the Major changes, for instance, probably to reflect the massive difference between the penny level and the $5 denomination level. But that does mean the chances of winning that progressive will again be adjusted since the prize is a different amount entirely. But at least in that case it’s also a progressive replacing a progressive.

# Does This Really Matter?

In the end, with this class of games, your chances of winning a progressive jackpot or bonus will always depend most on the bet size you’re making and the size of the progressive relative to that (in terms of the baseline; progressives can grow and grow and sometimes become an Advantage Play because of how big they’ve built; more on that later).

But it’s helpful to know if you’re increasing or decreasing your chances for some of the smaller prizes based on your betting strategy; upping the denomination may improve your expected payout overall, while lowering your chance at some of the smaller progressives, just because they adjust with your denomination."

After laughing at the scam with my friend and playing around in the website and ""logging in"", I decided to check Virustotal to see how the website would do, the scan had 4/96 reds (2 malicious, 2 malware)

Ke Yin has a problem. Well, several problems.

First, he's actually Cain from Earth.

Second, he's stuck in a cultivation world where people don't just split mountains with a sword strike, they build entire universes inside their souls (and no, it's not a meditation metaphor).

Third, he's got a system with a snarky spiritual assistant that lets him possess the recently deceased across dimensions.

And finally, the elders at the Azure Peak Sect are asking why his soul realm contains both demonic cultivation and holy arts? Must be a natural talent.

Expectations:

\- MC's main cultivation method will be plant based and related to World Trees

\- Weak to Strong MC

\- MC will eventually create his own lifeforms within his soul as well as beings that can cultivate

\- Main world is the first world (Azure Peak Sect)

\- MC will revisit worlds (extensive world building of multiple realms)

\- Time loop elements

\- No harem

**Chapter 20: The Price of Power**

Away from the refugee groups and temporary shelters, I found a small side chamber branching off from the main cavern system. The rough-hewn walls offered privacy, and the single torch I'd brought cast just enough light to work by. Perfect for some probably ill-advised cultivation experiments.

""Your soul essence remains stable at 450 units,"" Azure reported as I sat cross-legged on the cold stone floor.

I closed my eyes, focusing on my inner world. The familiar space felt... different here. Empty, like someone had swept all the spiritual energy out while I wasn't looking. My seed of creation pulsed sadly, its two reality-bending leaves drooping like houseplants I'd forgotten to water.

""Right,"" I muttered. ""Time to try something probably ill-advised.""

I reached for my soul essence, feeling that deep well of power that had somehow survived the dimensional hop. I then pulled on it, trying to convert it into something my cultivation could actually use.

You know how they say you can't really describe a color to someone who's never seen it?

Try explaining what it feels like to turn a piece of your immortal soul into knockoff spiritual energy. It's like trying to turn a Shakespeare sonnet into interpretive dance – technically possible, but probably not what anyone intended.

The conversion... worked? Sort of? My spiritual pathways filled with something that felt like spiritual energy's cousin who'd learned about cultivation through game tutorials. Not quite right, but hey – better than nothing.

*Status Update:*

*Soul Essence: 400/450 (Slightly concerned about this)*

*Spiritual Essence: 50/350 (We have at least some gas in the tank!)*

*Physical Essence: 25/350 (Still pathetically weak, but alive!)*

""Fascinating!"" Azure exclaimed. ""The conversion rate is roughly 10%, but the resulting pseudo-spiritual energy appears stable. Though I should note that—""

I tried to cycle the fake spiritual energy through my cultivation paths, and immediately discovered what Azure was about to warn me about. You know that feeling when you're running on a treadmill and suddenly the power cuts out? Yeah, it was like that, but with my entire spiritual system.

The energy... disappeared. Not converted back, not stored away – just gone, like it had never existed.

""Oh,"" I said eloquently. ""That's not great.""

""As I was about to explain,"" Azure continued, ""this world lacks the fundamental spiritual energy field necessary to sustain cultivator techniques. In our world, your body would naturally absorb essence from the environment to replenish what you use. Here, any energy we create through conversion will be... temporary.""

I looked at my pathetic spiritual essence readings and did some quick math. ""So I can convert more soul essence, but...""

""But it will be consumed without replacement, yes. Like trying to fill a bucket with a hole in it. A very large hole. In a universe that doesn't believe in buckets.""

Great. Just great. I had maybe enough converted energy for one decent technique, and then I'd be running on empty again. And converting more soul essence seemed like a fantastic way to end up as a soulless husk, which was probably not going to improve my day.

""Physical essence is still viable,"" Azure noted. ""Unlike spiritual energy, which dissipates in this world, physical essence becomes a permanent part of your body's structure. Each unit converted literally rebuilds you from the inside out.""

That was... interesting. ""So instead of trying to maintain spiritual techniques, we focus on improving the hardware?""

""Correct. Your current physical limitations are due to this body's lack of development, not fundamental constraints of this reality. Converting soul essence into physical essence would bypass years of training.""

I settled into a cross-legged position, considering the risks. ""Walk me through the process.""

""Converting soul essence to physical essence will be... dramatic,"" Azure warned. ""Each stage will fundamentally reshape your body's structure. I recommend removing your outer robe.""

I stripped down to my waist, the cool cave air raising goosebumps on my skin. This body was embarrassingly soft – I could practically hear Senior Sister Liu’s voice: *""A cultivator's vessel should be as refined as their dao.""*

""Converting 350 units of soul essence directly would be... unwise,"" Azure warned as I sat cross-legged in my secluded chamber. ""I recommend three stages: foundation, refinement, and transcendence. Each will fundamentally reshape different aspects of your body's structure.""

""Okay, so for the first stage I could start with around 150 units of soul essence and see where that gets me?""

""Yes, that sounds reasonable.""

""Beginning foundation phase,"" I muttered, separating the essence. The moment I began the conversion, I realized why Azure had been concerned. It felt like molten metal being poured through my veins.

I bit back a scream as the transformation wracked my body. Every muscle fiber was being torn apart and rebuilt. Bones splintered and reformed, denser and stronger. My skin felt like it was being flayed and rewoven. I could see – and feel – blood vessels bursting and regenerating in more efficient patterns. The pain was unlike anything this body had experienced – a deep, cellular agony as every part of me was destroyed and reborn.

""Foundation phase at 50%,"" Azure reported clinically. ""Try not to grind your teeth – your jaw is currently restructuring.""

I tasted blood as my gums reformed. The wet cracking sounds of bones reshaping themselves echoed in the small chamber. By the time the first phase completed, I was drenched in sweat and shaking.

""Basic physical parameters now match a first-stage cultivator,"" Azure announced. ""Though you might want to rest before—""

""No,"" I gasped. ""Keep going. Refinement phase.""

The second wave of 100 units hit even harder. My spine felt like it was being ripped out and reforged. Muscles didn't just grow – they tore themselves apart and rewove into denser patterns. I felt my ribcage cracking and expanding, organs shifting in ways they were never meant to move. Each heartbeat was torture as my cardiovascular system revolutionized itself.

I couldn't hold back the scream this time, but I managed to muffle it against my arm. The last thing I needed was villagers investigating strange noises.

""Refinement phase successful,"" Azure noted. ""Though I really must insist on a brief recovery period before—""

""Final phase,"" I growled through clenched teeth, reaching for the last 100 units. ""Transcendence.""

The third transformation was beyond pain – it was apocalyptic. My skin burned as it transformed into something that could turn blades. Every muscle fiber screamed as it arranged itself into patterns that defied mortal limits. My bones felt like they were being forged in dragonfire. Golden light rippled across my sweat-soaked skin as the final changes took hold.

When it was finally over, I collapsed onto the stone floor, my newly enhanced senses making every point of contact feel like sandpaper.

""Physical essence conversion complete,"" Azure announced after giving me a moment to recover. ""Your body now matches the physical parameters of a third-stage qi condensation cultivator!""

*Final Status:*

*Soul Essence: 50/450 (Keeping this in reserve)*

*Spiritual Essence: 50/350 (Last resort attacks)*

*Physical Essence: 350/350 (Back to proper cultivator standards)*

I pushed myself up, still trembling from the ordeal. The difference was staggering. Raw power coursed through every movement. This wasn't just a strong body – it was a cultivator's vessel, even without spiritual energy to fuel it. The transformation had been absolute: dense, perfectly defined muscle moved like liquid steel under skin that could shrug off mortal weapons.

""Next time,"" I managed between ragged breaths, ""warn me that it feels like being reborn in a volcano.""

""I did suggest taking breaks between phases,"" Azure reminded me.

""It’s better to just persevere, kind of like stopping to sit when you're exhausted,"" I replied. ""Once you let yourself rest, your body fights against moving again. Better to stay in motion, to keep standing.""

""Well, perhaps we should find you some new clothes before someone investigates why it sounds like someone is being murdered in here,"" Azure added.

I looked down at my transformed physique and the shirt on the floor, a shirt that now looked way too small. Where the villagers had known a soft-bodied miller's son, now stood a frame of lean, corded muscle – a change that would be impossible to explain away, especially now that I'm topless...

""Right. Cover story first, then food. Having your entire body torn apart and rebuilt really works up an appetite.""

""A logical response to complete cellular reconstruction,"" Azure agreed. ""Though perhaps we should focus on maintaining your low profile. Accidentally crushing stone cups or bending iron tools would raise... awkward questions. Especially since you can barely walk straight at the mo—.""

The air... changed. That same static sensation from before, but deeper underground. Everyone felt it – the cavern went silent as that familiar wrongness seeped through the rock.

""The Skybound,"" I whispered. ""It found us.""

Combat
1. DA2 - tactics and fun and excuses for ridiculousness because it’s Varric’s narrative, sign me up
2. Veilguard - too heavily reflex based for my old bones, style over substance but oh the style
3. Origins - clunky but intricate like Cailan’s armour
4. Inquisition - too boring, ease and aesthetics do not make up for lack of tactics


Environments
1. Veilguard - gorgeous, maps are a bit confusing but that is a me problem 
2. Origins - good for its time, maps are satisfying 
3. Inquisition - pretty but did not need to be open world and is worse for it, plus Val Royeaux was a huge disappointment 
4. DA2 - learn to describe a variety of caves, Varric


Story
1. DA2 - I am not taking questions at this time
2. Origins - loses points for being a bit generic and relying on the grimdark factor a lot (looking at you city elf origin but you’re not the only offender)
3. Inquisition - loses points for putting the actual end of the story in a DLC

I haven’t finished Veilguard yet so I don’t know where it falls on this as endings are pretty important for overall story.

Companions
1. DA2 - iconic, please ignore Sebastian, we all do
2. Inquisition - beats Origins by sheer volume
3. Origins - would be higher but Oghren is there and Shale isn’t base game
4. Veilguard - how are you all so bland


DLC/expansions
1. Origins, no question, Awakening is top notch
2. DA2 - even if the Felicia Day one is cringe
3. Inquisition- putting the real ending in a DLC is a dick move
4. Veilguard - no dlc


Player character RP
1. Origins - voiced can’t compete with unvoiced and we all know it
2. DA2 - Hawke can be a terrible human being but only a human being
3. Inquisition - moral choices are on rails but the inquisitor is fun
4. Veilguard - the origins are really good! But Rook can’t make any choices DAO era Sten and Morrigan would approve of."

"SOTC — Kagekiyo, Nihei, Yoshikane, Matsubara and more ",TrueChefKnives,1hqhxrt,2024-12-31 11:14:23,76,0.98,31,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hqhxrt,auto_eros,State of the collection,"I really just started collecting knives this year. Started with Japanese knives in 2014 with a Kanetsugu Pro-J, which I sold in the spring. Then I got a Shibata, sold that, bought another, sold that, then got my Matsubara and things started escalating pretty quick!

It was really fun learning more about my preferences. I learned I like a knife with some donk. After 2 shibata, I learned that lasers just aren’t for me. I also learned 220-230 might be the perfect length for my kitchen. There’s so much to this culinary rabbit hole. 

After my 180 Ittetsu petty in white #2 arrives, I’m putting new acquisitions on pause for a bit.  Otherwise my beautiful, amazing, accepting and also true crime-loving wife might be tempted to use one on me…😅

Shiro Kamo White #2 Damascus Sujihiki 270mm — Beautiful slicer. This was a fun knife to put through its paces on my honeymoon in November. Amazing size for roasts, brisket and poultry carving.

Yoshikane SKD Kiritsuke Gyuto 240mm — What else is there to say? Practically a perfect knife. Great grind, great height and looks absolutely bad ass on the rack. 

Kagekiyo White #1 Gyuto — I just got to use it for the first time last night with mushroom, herbs and a pork tenderloin, and it’s such a joy. Light but substantial, with a grind that really blazes through food. The aesthetics and fit/finish are all top notch. Looking forward to using it more. 

Matsubara Blue #2 “Wavy Face” Gyuto 210mm — This has been my go-to for a lot of this year, and it’s been my base point for evaluating the grinds of other knives. Now that I’ve gotten more, I’m starting to see where the grind on this falls short, so it’s been my project knife to refine my thinning and polishing. It came with a big low spot below the tsuchime which made it pretty frustrating to think first. Lots of lessons learned on this guy, and while it’s not my favorite knife, I still have a soft spot for him. I mean, just look at how it takes a patina 🥵

Hatsukokoro Nihei Aogomi Super “Shinkiro” Nakiri 165mm — This thing is AMAZING. Picked it up from another member here. Literally, the grind falls through food. Like, seriously. I was shocked the first time I cut an onion. I swear I heard that little allium start reciting the Lord’s Prayer. I thought perhaps my ears deceived me. But now, my sweet potatoes shudder in fear. Carrots cower in the corner of my vegetable drawer. Mushrooms are falling to pieces practically as soon as they hit my cutting board. If you’re on the fence, do yourself a favor and get one. 

Fujitora Santoku 170mm — This thing is so damn cute. Like a kitchen knife from a Miyazaki film IRL. And it’s thin. I reserve it mostly for guests. 

Dao Vua V3 52100 Kiri Cleaver 180mm — This thing is a beast. Not super thin behind the edge, but I bought it as a light duty cleaver for when I need to break up a chicken carcass for stock, and it’s been perfect for that. Solid knife. I hear Dao Vua has come a long way from the early leaf spring blades. 

Shun VG-MAX paring 4” — I’ll never understand the Shun hate around here and the old sub. They’re pretty great knives, if NOT a good value. I found this one on clearance and it’s been an awesome little knife that glides through chicken joints, slays garlic and is awesome for general vegetable trimming. I initially got it for my wife as an upgrade from her little IKEA paring knife, but now I use it absolutely all the time.  

Special mention goes to the Victorinox 8” chef knife that lives in my chuck box for camping. 

Knives have been an interesting and visceral way to reconnect with cooking. I’ve gotten to make some really wonderful meals, and having amazing knives to use makes the act of cooking that much more enjoyable. Especially since I’m the primary cook for my family. 

Anyways! Thanks for reading. I still owe the sub some proper NKD posts. There have been some real bangers the last couple weeks with the holidays, and I’m excited to see what new knives everyone else ends up with in 2025. "

"🚀 $EGO: A Memecoin with Real Utility and Massive Potential! 🦎

The team behind $EGO, led by Loïc BELLEZ, has made it clear: they're on a mission to redefine what it means to be a utility memecoin. Here's a look at some of the most exciting developments coming your way in 2025:



1. New Bridge in January 2025

We’re about to unlock even more potential for $EGO by launching a new bridge to a mystery blockchain. While the chain remains a secret for now, this expansion will significantly boost cross-chain interaction and ensure that $EGO stays at the forefront of blockchain innovation.



2. Staking and Yield Farming in February 2025

Traditional staking can be a bit boring, right? Not with $EGO. Get ready for a revolutionary staking and yield farming system that will allow holders to earn rewards while also contributing to the growth of the $EGO ecosystem. This isn't just about earning passive income—it’s about being a part of the journey!



3. Play-to-Earn Gamified Staking in March 2025

Hold tight for the launch of Play-to-Earn gamified staking! Traditional staking meets gaming in a way that brings fun and rewards together. Players will not only earn tokens but also experience a new level of interaction with the $EGO ecosystem. Gamification is going to take $EGO holders on an entirely new adventure, making staking exciting again!



4. NFT Membership and DAO Access in April 2025

$EGO’s governance model will get a major boost with NFT membership tokens that will unlock exclusive access to the DAO. These NFTs won’t just be collectibles—they will empower holders to vote on important decisions and have a direct say in the future direction of the project. It’s about true community ownership and influence.



5. Smart Contract for DAO in April 2025

Along with NFT DAO access, $EGO will launch its smart contract that will automate and secure governance. This will streamline the decision-making process, ensuring that the community can execute proposals and manage the ecosystem with the utmost transparency and efficiency.



6. Interoperability Enhancements in July 2025

The world of blockchain is constantly evolving, and $EGO is making sure it stays ahead. In July 2025, expect interoperability enhancements that will allow even more seamless interaction between different blockchains. This is a step toward $EGO becoming truly chain-agnostic—providing even greater flexibility for holders and users.



7. Mobile App Launch in September 2025

2025 will also bring us closer to an even more accessible $EGO ecosystem with the launch of a mobile app. This will provide an easy, user-friendly interface to track your holdings, participate in governance, and stay updated with all the exciting developments in the $EGO world, all from the convenience of your smartphone.



These upgrades are just the beginning. The $EGO team is dedicated to creating a sustainable and thriving ecosystem where the community has a direct say in the project's trajectory. 2025 promises to be an explosive year of growth, innovation, and rewards.
