Deciphering Maple (MPL): A Deep Dive into Recent Trends and Institutional DeFi Integration  
  
Abstract  
  
This analysis explores the recent surge in interest and activity surrounding Maple Finance's $MPL token on Coinbase. We delve into the multifaceted aspects of Maple's operational growth, including a significant increase in loan originations surpassing $2.26 billion in 2024, alongside a doubling of interest payments to lenders. The paper examines Maple's strategic positioning at the intersection of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), assessing the impact of its institutional lending model on market perception and investor behavior. Governance changes, such as the introduction of SYRUP and its implications for $MPL holders, are critically analyzed. Additionally, we shed light on security measures, regulatory compliance efforts, and community feedback, providing a balanced view of Maple's challenges and opportunities. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to offer insights into $MPL's market performance, future potential, and its role in the evolving landscape of institutional DeFi adoption.

4 RWA Gems: Bringing Real-World Assets to DeFi,CryptoMoonShots,1dce0qq,2024-06-10 01:25:26,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1dce0qq/4_rwa_gems_bringing_realworld_assets_to_defi/,WowHow06,Other (chain not covered by other flairs),"**1. Landshare** transforms real-world properties into asset-backed, income-generating tokens that you can trade on the Binance Smart Chain. With Landshare, you can invest in real estate starting from just $50. As an investor, you get the advantages of property value increase and monthly rental income sent directly to your wallet. In addition to traditional benefits, Landshare provides extra features from decentralized finance (DeFi). These include automatic compounding of yields, play-to-earn NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), and an upcoming loan protocol. This means your real estate investment is enhanced with modern financial tools and opportunities.

**2. Centrifuge** is a decentralized protocol focused on providing financing for real-world assets (RWA) within the realm of decentralized finance (DeFi). Its mission is to reduce the cost of capital for small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs) while offering investors a steady income source. Unlike relying on volatile crypto assets, Centrifuge aims to create profits by transferring real monetary value from traditional fiat currencies to cryptocurrencies. Centrifuge benefits both parties by connecting assets like invoices, real estate, and royalties with DeFi. Investors receive income and rewards in the form of CFG tokens. Borrowers, on the other hand, enjoy the advantage of financing their real assets without relying on banks or other intermediaries. The ultimate goal is to bridge the traditional financial world with the possibilities offered by decentralized finance.

**3. Maple** is like a decentralized bank for companies. It helps businesses straightforwardly get money using blockchain technology. People who put their money into Maple can earn a steady income by lending it to different groups of top-notch cryptocurrency organizations. The groups in charge of managing the money pools, called Pool Delegates, carefully check and decide the terms with the companies that want to borrow. All of this is governed by the Maple Token (MPL), which lets token owners have a say in decisions, share in fees, and provide insurance to the money pools. If you want to make some money with Maple, you can deposit your money into the pools, and experienced investors, the Pool Delegates, will take care of managing it. Companies that need money can ask Maple for it, and because of their good reputation, they can borrow more than the value of what they own without worrying too much about losing everything.

**4. Polymesh** is a specialized, high-grade blockchain designed for regulated assets, catering to institutional needs. It addresses various challenges in public infrastructure, including governance, identity, compliance, confidentiality, and settlement. The native protocol token, POLYX, plays a crucial role in staking, securing the network, covering transaction fees, and participating in governance. This blockchain features built-in financial tools, allowing users to operate efficiently with minimal fixed costs. Developers can leverage Polymesh to build decentralized applications (dApps). The platform prioritizes addressing key concerns such as rule enforcement, identity verification, regulatory compliance, data privacy, and transaction finalization."
Binance's Updated Listing Rules: Key Changes and Potential RWA Projects,SatoshiStreetBets,1d6r43o,2024-06-02 19:58:19,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/1d6r43o/binances_updated_listing_rules_key_changes_and/,WowHow06,Discussion 🦍,"In the past months, Binance has updated rules regarding token listing to comply and cooperate with regulations. These changes aim to improve safety, compliance, and investor protections on the Binance platform. They are designed to encourage longer-term commitments from projects and reduce risks for investors from the immediate selling of tokens post-listing. The key changes are:

1. Extended Cliff Period:
   * The minimum “cliff period” before tokens can be sold has been increased from six months to at least one year.
2. Requirement of Security Deposit:
   * Projects must make a security deposit, usually amounting to several million dollars, which Binance may keep if the projects fail to meet the listing conditions.
3. Market Maker Allocation:
   * Projects are now required to set aside more tokens for market makers to enhance trading liquidity.

There are a handful of tokens awaiting listing on Binance’s crypto exchange, but here are the ones with immense potential and higher chances of getting listed. Centrifuge (CFG), Landshare (LAND), and Maple Finance (MPL) are the RWA projects likely to get listed and be in a position to take advantage of the event.

The Real World Asset (RWA) sector is one of the hottest narratives in the crypto market right now, grabbing substantial attention. This trend is pushing a few leading projects to aim for listings on the world’s biggest crypto exchange, Binance.

Crypto exchange listings expose tokens to numerous users, investors, and traders, boosting their value. As the number of token holders grows, the respective tokens' positions become stronger and more stable in the notoriously volatile crypto market. The RWA crypto sector is projected to hit a $16 trillion market cap by 2030, presenting a massive opportunity for leading RWA tokens to monetize their positions and grow with the broader RWA sector.

Recently, Binance has updated its token listing rules to comply with regulations. These changes aim to improve safety, compliance, and investor protections on the platform. They are designed to encourage longer-term commitments from projects and reduce risks for investors from the immediate selling of tokens post-listing. The key changes are:

1. **Extended Cliff Period** The minimum “cliff period” before tokens can be sold has been increased from six months to at least one year.

Typical snare specs for a big fat side snare,drums,1d39kt5,2024-05-29 07:09:02,3,0.8,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/drums/comments/1d39kt5/typical_snare_specs_for_a_big_fat_side_snare/,DrBackBeat,Discussion,"I'm looking to widen my snare arsenal, on one side to have at least one more option for a main snare, but more importantly because I want to be able to bring a side snare with me for that sweet sweet big fat snare drum sound. 

Also I want another snare to have some contrast with the 14""x 6,5"" Supraphonic that normally does it all for me, so I'd quickly consider a wood snare and perhaps with a thick shell and even deeper. I also have a 12"" x 4"" Tama Metalworks that's a whole other type of side snare (or main snare when the occasion arises) so I have the small and shallow end of the spectrum covered.

While I already have and use a BFSD overlay, I'd rather go for a snare that I can get to sound like this naturally. No worries, I am very well aware that the head and tuning and muffling have far more to do with that, but certainly at least the depth and shell material/thickness enter into the equation as well.

I wanted to keep all options open and all assumptions at the door, but yet I couldn't help running into the [PDP Limited Edition Maple Walnut 14"" x 8""](https://www.pacificdrums.com/products/pdsn0814mwns-20-ply-ltd-mpl-walnut-snare-8x14/). That boi be thicc alright. So far [I like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzGGcH_g9GA) what I've heard though nothing beats listening with your own ears of course. Also it's pretty and more than makes up for missing out on getting a Catalina Club kit in Satin Walnut Glaze ........ oh dear I'm falling in love aren't I...

SO! What specs would you look for in a snare for a big fat beefy snare fit for ballads or the dirtiest of grooves? Is it necessarily a drum larger than 14""? Does depth mean the world? And to skip ahead a bit, what heads would you recommend?"

Real World Assets in DeFi: Bridging the Gap between Traditional Finance and Crypto,SatoshiStreetBets,1awpdtu,2024-02-21 17:24:59,4,0.75,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/1awpdtu/real_world_assets_in_defi_bridging_the_gap/,WowHow06,Fundamentals,"Real World Assets are gaining momentum in the DeFi space, offering a new avenue for investors to tap into traditional assets through blockchain technology. RWAs encompass physical assets like real estate, precious metals, commodities, and art, tokenized and transferred on-chain to provide a source of yield in DeFi protocols.

In 2020 alone, global real estate valued at $326.5 trillion and the gold market cap at $12.39 trillion underscore the massive potential of RWAs in the financial landscape. Leveraging US Treasury Bills and high-interest rates, companies like Ondo Finance offer investors lower-risk yields within the DeFi ecosystem.

MakerDAO, a prominent DeFi protocol, has ventured into RWAs by deploying idle assets into short-term bonds, fueling an MKR buyback program, and bolstering the DAI Savings Rate. This move demonstrates how protocols can benefit from RWA investments, driving growth and value to token holders. Landshare takes RWAs further by transforming real-world properties into income-generating tokens on the Binance Smart Chain. Investors can now access real estate investments starting from just $50, enjoying the benefits of property value appreciation and monthly rental income directly to their wallets.

The potential impact of RWAs on DeFi is immense:

\- They are providing sustainable and reliable yields backed by traditional assets.

\- Making DeFi more compatible with traditional financial markets, enhancing liquidity, capital efficiency, and investment opportunities.

\- Bridging the gap between DeFi and traditional finance, opening doors to new possibilities for both sectors.

Furthermore, projects like Maple Finance (MPL), Goldfinch (GFI), and Centrifuge (CFG) are paving the way for RWA lending within the DeFi ecosystem, offering additional avenues for investors to explore in this rapidly evolving landscape."

Folks Finance is excited to announce the listings of wAVAX, wSOL, and wMPL, which will soon be open for deposits in the lending market and Lending Pools. This means that you can use your favorite tokens from the Avalanche, Solana, and Maple Finance ecosystems in Algorand DeFi!

10,000 ALGO will be airdropped to Folks Finance users for each of these 3 coins: wAVAX, wSOL, and wMPL. That’s a total of 30,000 ALGO up for grabs!

How to participate? To participate in the airdrop, you’ll have to deposit in the lending markets or [lending pools](https://folksfinance.medium.com/lending-pools-liquidity-made-efficient-5659e8d82398) for wAVAX, wSOL, and wMPL. Make sure you keep your liquidity deposited — a snapshot of participating wallets will be taken at a random time during September, and active wallets will be the ones to get rewarded!

First, [connect your Algorand Wallet to Folks Finance](https://academy.folks.finance/tutorials/folks-tutorials?video_id=44). Once you have connected, you can deposit tokens into the [lending markets](https://academy.folks.finance/tutorials/folks-tutorials?video_id=1) or [lending pools](https://academy.folks.finance/tutorials/folks-tutorials?video_id=43). Timeline:

The wAVAX lending markets and lending pool will go live on Folks Finance on August 15th, 2023.

The wSOL lending markets and lending pool will go live on Folks Finance on August 22nd, 2023.

The wMPL lending markets and lending pool will go live on Folks Finance on August 29th, 2023.

**What are bridged assets?**

Bridged assets are tokens that have been transferred from one blockchain to another. wAVAX, wSOL, and wMPL will be bridged into Algorand using Wormhole technology, which allows for the secure and fast transfer of assets between blockchains

wAVAX is the wrapped version of AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche blockchain ecosystem. Avalanche is a layer one blockchain that functions as a platform for decentralized applications and custom blockchain networks. It is one of Ethereum’s rivals, aiming to unseat Ethereum as the most popular blockchain for smart contracts.

wSOL is the wrapped version of SOL, the native token of the Solana blockchain. The Solana protocol is designed to facilitate decentralized app (DApp) creation. It aims to improve scalability by introducing a proof-of-history (PoH) consensus combined with the underlying proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus of the blockchain.

wMPL is the wrapped version of MPL, the native token of the Maple Finance protocol, live on Ethereum and Solana. Maple offers borrowers transparent and efficient financing completed entirely on-chain. For liquidity providers, Maple offers a sustainable yield source through lending to diversified pools of crypto’s premium institutions.

**Why are bridged assets beneficial?**

Bridged assets offer a number of benefits, including:

* Increased liquidity: By allowing tokens to be transferred between blockchains, bridged assets increase liquidity in both ecosystems.
* Reduced fees: Bridged assets can often be transferred at a lower cost than native tokens.
* Diversification: Bridging tokens allows ecosystems to expand into one another and strengthen their DeFi markets.

The listings of new bridged assets open new doors for Folks users, offering a number of benefits. Be sure to make the most of this giveaway while it’s active during Q3!

Thank you for your continued support.

Prices plummeting, inflation running rampant, regulators cracking down, protocols imploding, scams leveraging other scams, and institutions collapsing… the perfect mixture of pain to signal… a market bottom 👀?!

This is NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE!!!

For many people around the world, 2022 will go down in history as one of the most difficult investment years.

As the dust settles & investors begin to regain confidence, it is extremely important to front-run everybody & capture as much of the upside as possible.

Regardless of the market cycle (bull or bear), new ideas are always popping up & brave investors are always willing to take a chance when they see the opportunity is right.

Well, opportunities are knocking & it is our job to understand which door(s) we must open.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ikj5svpfm6qa1.gif

Before we dive in, let's first define a few key points that constitute a “big” opportunity:

**TAM (total addressable market)**  
*The actual size of the market. This includes both the number of users & the monetary value.*

**Growth potential**  
*Will the TAM grow moving forward or will the market stay roughly the same size?*

**Competition**  
*Competition is a good thing because it means there is demand, however, if there is too much competition a market becomes saturated & returns are distributed horizontally. (we want vertical returns baby)*

**Desirability**  
*Who wants what & why? What are the most painful, underserved, & necessary ideas?*

**Most hated by regulators**  
*If they hate it, there must be a good reason. Governments hate things that can put them out of business. Government is a BIG business…*

**Totally missed by regulators**  
*Government moves very slowly. What are they missing that entrepreneurs can capitalize on?*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lkm71ui9m6qa1.jpg?width=2100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=859d6b0400a164246cb783ace084541200f6ff80

\-Biggest *medium-term* potential.  
\-Not facing any regulatory headwinds at the moment.  
\-Strong steady growth anticipated.  
\-Modestly competitive landscape, *no* games/projects on the level of Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, or Runescape.

Gaming is one of the most intuitive sectors to be exploring for benefits from the coming market cycle. Built on tightly knit communities & almost entirely digital in its nature, gaming appeals to a broad audience of individuals who are prime to become users of digital assets.

This nascent sector of the regular economy will bring in [***$365.60 Billion*** in ***revenue this year*** & is expected to grow roughly \~7.17% per year](https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/digital-media/video-games/worldwide#:~:text=Revenue%20in%20the%20Video%20Games,to%20hit%2038.3%25%20by%202027.).

One of the most lucrative possibilities in terms of cash flow due to massive margins.

There isn’t much pain here to solve with blockchain tech, but the potential of being disregarded by regulators will bring tons of attention here.

>***How to address the opportunities in gaming with crypto?***  
*NFTs primarily.*  
*In their current form, I colloquially refer to NFTs as “non-financialized tokens” because of their strong retail appeal; pictures of monkes are more relatable to regular people than the cold numbers on a trading terminal or spreadsheets.*  
*Gamers are typically not caught up in anything else much outside of their games — it would be best to keep it that way. Trying to financialize their processes with cryptocurrency will likely dis-incentivize people from playing the games with it’s complexity.*  
*However, building out online gaming guilds (DAOs) with the use of NFTs will garner stronger communities. Rewarding players with exotic in-game assets that are owned by them & can be transferred between games holds a lot of promise.*  
***\* Personal note:*** *Don’t look for promises of fully on-chain games (that is resource intensive & not sustainable or scalable, yet) consider looking for infrastructure providers (*[*ENJ*](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/enjin-coin/)*), Guilds (*[*YGG*](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yield-guild-games/)*) or possibly in-game objects such as metaverse lands (*[*Otherdeeds*](https://opensea.io/collection/otherdeed)*).*

\-Biggest *long-term* potential.  
\-In a regulatory gray-space (not hated, nor loved)  
\-Always going to grow over time (assuming for no cataclysmic events)  
\-Currently VERY FEW competitors ([Maple finance](https://www.maple.finance/), [Centrifuge](https://tinlake.centrifuge.io/), [GoldFinch](https://goldfinch.finance/))

Nearly impossible to accurately pinpoint the true size of this market, but the sums are calculated in the Trillions. **R**eal **W**orld **A**ssets represent the vast majority of all the world's wealth. This includes everything from government bonds to real estate, to company debt & everything else in between.

This segment has been receiving some flack/pushback from notable people in the industry namely

[Andre Cronje](https://medium.com/u/34f4446c6ba1?source=post_page-----a7a5cfb742f7--------------------------------) [talking about the “death of RWA”](https://medium.com/@andrecronje/the-death-of-defi-rwa-31821c288341). His point is valid that this category is NOT TRUE DECENTRALIZATION, however, I cannot help but see the incredible potential as it continues to flourish.

>***How to capitalize on the opportunities in RWA tokenization?***  
*This sector will obviously be built with a lot of overlap into tradfi. So capturing this opportunity might be most suited for companies/enterprises, more so than individuals. Nonetheless, there are a few interesting ways for people to benefit;*  
*- go to an existing RWA tokenization operator & leverage your business history to take out an on-chain loan*  
*- take advantage of early stage incentive programs for participating in lending through these operators*  
*- build out a DECENTRALIZED RWA tokenization engine/protocol run by a DAO*  
***\* Personal note:*** *I do not own & will not recommend buying the tokens of these platforms, however it might be worthwhile to not completely rule them out. (* [***CFG***](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/centrifuge/) *—* [***GFI*** ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/goldfinch-protocol/)*—* [***MPL***](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/maple/)*)*

\-Largest *risk-adjusted* opportunity.  
\-HATED by regulators.  
\-Strong steady growth is almost certain.  
\-Difficult competitive landscape, due to extreme technical requirements in knowledge, skill, & funding.

The hottest segment for those looking to stick it to the government.

The key word in this is “decentralized”. Centralized stablecoin issuers will be faced with the same regulatory issues as banks & other traditional money service businesses. Those issues will trickle down to consumers & ultimately serve no real benefit to the end users.

The task is enormous & many brilliant people have attempted to solve this problem. Of those attempts, out came a [graveyard filled with ≥ 23 failed ambitious projects](https://cryptosec.info/failed-stablecoins/). It would be softly said that nearly every one of the failures in this space has resulted in catastrophe for its participants.

There are a tiny handful of projects that can serve as a “successful” case study in the space that comes to mind:  
\- [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/) \- with their [DAI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/) stablecoin.  
\- [Frax Finance](https://frax.finance/#welcome) \- with the [FRAX](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/frax/) stablecoin  
\- [Reserve Rights](https://reserve.org/) \- with the [RSV](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/reserve/) stablecoin  
\- [Decentralized USD](https://usdd.io/#/) \- with the [USDD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usdd/) stablecoin

>***How to capitalize on the opportunities in Stablecoins?***  
*Stablecoins are the most nuanced segment in terms of capturing value because there is no real direct growth here. Growth in Stablecoin’s represents an increase in supply/underlying collateral. Capturing the upside here depends on creativity & which side of the fence you want to be on; creator or consumer.*  
*- Leverage new expanded collateral models,*  
*- explore/test new algorithms*  
*- expand cashflow opportunities of stablecoin protocols to sustain market shocks & unprecedented failures. (i.e. have a protocol BUY its own stable-assets to serve as an emergency form of insurance pool ← still not financial advice)*  
*- lend/borrow, with cross-collateralization, to maximize yield (still NFA)*  
*- have exposure to the protocols overseeing the minting of decentralized stablecoins (*[*MKR*](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/maker/)*/*[*RSR*](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/reserve-rights/)*)*

\-Modest competitive landscape with no clear leader or solution available.

Decentralized Identity is still in its infancy & by the looks of it will require a multitude of separate solutions/issuers.

This is the wild west for innovators in the space.

As it stands there are [\~103 different methods](https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/#did-methods) that are recognized by the Web3 alliance for building decentralized identity. One of the most counterintuitive, but potentially exciting ideas that was brought to surface by Vitalik Buterin is the concept of non-transferable tokens called ([SBT) **S**oul-**B**ound **T**okens](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html).

>***How to capitalize on the opportunities in decentralized identity (D.ID)?***  
*There are actually a multitude of creative ways to take advantage & capture this opportunity; mostly through the use of NFT’s*  
*- Join early stage projects building some form of decentralized social media & capture the namespace.*  
*- Leverage your existing web2 reputation to become a thought leader on early stage platforms*  
*- leverage as many web3 platforms as possible & farm the incentive tokens*  
*- launch a project in this space & look for funding (if you have an actual solution)*  
*\*Some projects to gain inspiration from:* [*Civic (CVC)*](https://www.civic.com/)*,* [*Serto*](https://www.serto.id/)*,* [*Nametag*](https://nametag.org/)*,* [*Fractal*](https://web.fractal.id/)

\-Largest *Short-term* opportunity.  
\-HATED on by regulators.  
\-Growth is always going to fluctuate as old projects die & new ones arrive  
\-*EXTREMELY* competitive.

Decentralized finance is the future of all finance; it is simply a matter of time until we drop the first half of the term & just call it finance.

This segment of the crypto economy is always ripe with opportunity (even in bear markets). Primarily because it is the most competitive segment of all the others (in terms of total number of projects & the rate at which new projects pop up).

The interesting thing here is the reason for so much competition… It is super easy to spin up a “DEFI” project…

Innovation is/has been basically non-existent.

Most of the projects that you will find are going to be copy-pasta clones of one another with some minor adjustments.

Nevertheless, the space is flush with attention & incredible metrics:  
\- Floating a market cap \~$100B ([source](https://defimarketcap.io/))  
\- Over \~$90B TVL (total value locked)  
\- Exists across [>130 different blockchain ecosystems](https://defillama.com/chains)

>***How to address the opportunities in DEFI?***  
*Simple. Dive into everything without doing any research & hope for the best… THIS IS A JOKE! DO NOT DO THIS!*  
*As in the case with any other trade/investment there is one golden rule to guarantee profits: GET IN EARLY while Marketcap is LOW & ride or die baby.*  
*Some other things that might be worth trying*  
*- participating in protocols before they have a token & hope for an airdrop*  
*- provide liqudity to promising crypto pairs on DEXs (before price skyrocket)*  
*- NFA: leverage yield & build compounding systems across chains (advanced)*  
*- research strong incentive programs & farm their token*  
*\* leading projects:* [*AAVE*](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aave/)*,* [*dydx,*](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dydx/) [*Synthetix*](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/synthetix/)*,* [*1inch,*](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/1inch/) [*Balancer*](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/balancer/)*,* [*SushiSwap*](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sushiswap/)

These are the 5 sectors of opportunity that I am currently watching; there certainly are a few other very promising segments with massive potential that I will be writing about in the near future:

*- Privacy (ZKsnarks/rollups, etc..)*  
*- AI meets blockchain*  
*- Oracles & data verification*  
*- Multi-chain bridges*

but as I have learned the hard way;  
It is better to stay focused & catch some gains  
rather than  
getting lost in the chaos & missing everything.

Rosson MPL-0 first impressions from Canjam Singapore (new entry Rosson planar @ 1699USD),headphones,122ksrd,2023-03-26 08:37:35,28,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/122ksrd/rosson_mpl0_first_impressions_from_canjam/,ilkless,Impressions,"Was at Canjam Singapore earlier, and got to try the brand spanking new Rosson MPL-0. This is the new entry Rosson headphone at 1699USD, slotting in below the RAD-0 that has been a cult favourite not least for the gorgeous resin earcups. The earcups are now [a gorgeous glossy maple](https://rossonaudiodesign.com/shop/mape-01) that reminds me of the nitrocellulose finish you find on acoustic guitars. The finish is personally more to my taste than most RAD-0s I've seen.

If you haven't heard, Rosson Audio Design is a boutique maker of planar headphones that was launched by ex-Audeze CEO Alex Rosson - and that's where the similarities end.

The Rosson driver is a 66mm planar driver, unlike the 90 and 105mm Audeze goes for. I'm not sure the MPL-0's 66mm is the exact same driver tuned and damped differently but I expect someone here to be able to answer. From the Rosson website it seems to be the same driver.

I have auditioned the RAD-0 in very quiet conditions for a significant amount of time with familiar recordings. My problem, at least with the specific RAD-0 I auditioned from a distributor since there is apparently both a darker and brighter tuning available on request, was a deep recession at 4-8kHz.
This recession was accentuated by how unusually smooth and extended the top octave was. It was in some ways a victim of its own success, especially since it lacked the midrange bump of something like a LCD-2C that distracted from the recession with forward, resonant vocals. Brass instruments would sound unnaturally muffled in particular.

First impressions for MPL-0 are that the recession seems slightly more filled in 4-6kHz, and the top octave is more rolled off. But the roll off helps because it means the transition from the recessed range to the top octave is less abrupt and jarring, even if there is some loss in ultimate air and resolution that comes with the extension. Now the brass is soft but not jarringly muffled. Unfortunately the attack on piano keys is also blunted even further than on the RAD-0 but I think the trade off was worth it.

There also seems to be a touch more lower midrange body centred at around 300Hz, but this is extremely gentle and the trend is still flat and extended to subbass overall, along the lines of Audeze.

There is a slight improvement in imaging as well. I think the top octave roll-off might have helped in cutting through some of the haziness in the imaging I experienced in the RAD-0 but separation is definitely still below the levels of LCD-2/3.

The headband and pads appear the same as the RAD-0. This means the clamping force is on the heavy side, but mitigated by very squishy memory foam pads. Unfortunately I think the squishiness and density of the pads are not conducive to the sound (particularly imaging), as it makes consistent fitting, distancing and angling of the drivers to the ear difficult to achieve. Weight distribution is also a problem as the earcups need to pulled way forward from where they naturally sit around my ear for the padding on the headband to sit right on my crown, thereby breaking the seal. When I put the pads where the earcups feel natural to me, the headband and much of the headphone's centre of gravity dangles off the rear of my skull. This doesn't feel like a secure fit, and causes neck strain to boot.

And the thing is, because the pads deform so much, I don't have a clear sense of where the earpads are sitting on my face, especially whether they are wrapping around my ears (compared to the more predictable deformation of Audeze-style open-cell foam).

So the Rosson MPL-0 has:

+ better build and polished design than pre-LCD-5 Audezes
+ way better headband adjustment than Audeze
+ softer headband padding
+ Audeze-style tuning but way smoother
+ Very natural, slightly dark vocals. Leading edge is perfect but trailing edge dies down a little.
+ relative lack of treble extension but not to an objectionable degree

But:
- near absence of spaciousness
- near absence of separation
- still a hole at 6-8kHz that will be polarising  but much better balanced against the rest of the FR than in the RAD-0. It most prominently affects brass instruments, but also softens the attack on piano keys. It might work for really treble heavy electronic, pop and rock as snare drums trade a bit of slam for rumble.

Other quick takes:

vs Meze 109 Pro: Much more midbass slam than the Meze's dynamic driver, but surprisingly both are much closer than you'd expect lower down. Much more natural midrange than the 1kHz recession in the Meze that causes a sense of hollowness and excess distance.

vs Audeze MM-500: lacks the 500-800Hz energy this has to give that natural edginess to the human voice.

I really wanted to like the Rosson and there's indeed plenty to like if one wants a smoother response along Audeze lines. For many people the ergonomics and comfort might favour this over Audeze as well. Definitely worth a try for someone who craves a boutique product not many others will have!"

Summer -  [2022 YEAR WRAP UP REVIEW! PART 1: Summer! : bathandbodyworks (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bathandbodyworks/comments/zft58z/2022_year_wrap_up_review_part_1_summer/)

So there's a brief look back at the previous seasons, let's get started with the 2nd half of the year!

&#x200B;

So I get confused because the set that begun was considered Summer 3 / Fall 1 so I decided to just move this to Fall 1.  Anyways Poppy was our next signature scent released to kickstart the season with something a bit more floral.

**Packaging:** Pretty simple packaging with the picture of a poppy and basic bottle appearance with the scent name and overall red look.  I found most interesting was the spray tube was green to give it a look as if it was the stem to the poppy design on the bottle.  Pretty cool touch I'd say, still way simple though.

**Scent:**

* **Poppy** (Fresh Morning Dew, Wild Poppies, Sugared Rhubarb, Juicy Pear) - For being the season's floral scent, Poppy feels a lot like something but also nothing to me.  It's very sweet and floral that's for sure, but it doesn't seem to really etch any kind of sensation to remember it by.  I think the pear & rhubarb collide into one scent, but the poppies are kind of somewhere and the morning dew?  Little weird of a note to have.  Kind of reminds me of Midsummer Dream and Confetti Daydream (all 3 have pear in their notes).

**Overall: (7/10)** \- I feel like Poppy was kind of forgotten about pretty quickly after its release and I get it because florals aren't the most fantastical scents to make into the core scents of the year.  I mean I felt the same way about Honey Wildflower last year.  It's not bad and to be fair it's pretty good to bridge between Summer into Autumn, but I don't know, it doesn't seem to really leave much of an impression especially with other scents like Midsummer Dream and Confetti Daydream existing.

Next up is the foodie set to start Autumn 1 off and it initially had Blueberry Sugar Pancakes, Champagne Apple and Honey, and Marshmallow Pumpkin Latte released physically (while Pumpkin Cupcake remained an online exclusive).  Later on in Fall 3, we then got Strawberry Pound Cake and Pumpkin Pecan Waffles also joining the set as well.

**Packaging:** Well, this is the first set where I didn't get the new packaging as all 6 scents owned by me were in older looks so here's a picture of the packaging for this year:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/79owm2ic1d6a1.png?width=350&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c708001bf0ee124eb17daa30d7b7961e735d343

Have to say, I really love the pop art look of the set quite a bit.  It's colorful and fun and has a certain comic aesthetic that I enjoy.  The colors were mostly on point, though so many red/browns that kind of blended too much together (MPL, Pumpkin Cupcake, and PPW, CA&H, and SPC were pretty guilty of that).  Still, what a fun and bright design.

**Scents:**

* **Blueberry Sugar Pancakes** (Sugared Blueberries, Fresh Pancakes, Caramel Cream Drizzle) - I was happy to see this one return after how popular both this and Raspberry Jam Donut were last year!  While this definitely smells closer to blueberries, BSP is really sweet and a little caramel-y, most of the gourmand notes are in the spray.  Yeah, this is still a great scent to get here!
* **Champagne Apple & Honey** (Pink Lady Apple, Sparkling Champagne, Jasmine Honey, Autumn Woods) - This was no surprise to see as this has become a staple to the season as with Marshmallow Pumpkin Latte & Sweet Cinnamon Pumpkin.  CA&H is just a really solid apple scent that's pretty sweet, has a twist from the honey and smells surprisingly fancy to me.  Definitely continues to rank high for me!
* **Marshmallow Pumpkin Latte** (Pumpkin Latte, Toasted Marshmallows, Creamy Sandalwood, Praline Musk) - Like I said, it's another staple scent for the season so I'm not surprised to see this here.  It seems this year's rendition wasn't quite as good as year's previous, but I can't say too much on that because I have this older variant.  What I've discovered that the other 3 other pumpkin scents, are quite different to one another.  For MPL, I think it's trying to go for a drink-like scent, but I get is a more diluted Sweet Cinnamon Pumpkin and I'm not sure what the scent is going for other than spice and sweetness.  Also kind of smells like mosquito spray sometimes, but I kind of like that?  I dunno, it's a good scent, but just has odd moments XD.
* **Pumpkin Cupcake** (Whipped Buttercream, Pumpkin Spice, Vanilla Cake Batter) - Strange to see this one return once again as an online exclusive.  After Marshmallow Pumpkin Latte, this smells wholly of gourmand and I kind of love that about it.  The cakeyness is there in full glory and the pumpkin spice adds a little oomph to make it seasonal.  Just like a delicious spiced cake to me.  Really unique amongst the set for sure.
* **Strawberry Pound Cake** (Fresh Strawberries, Golden Shortcake, Whipped Cream) - Might not have noticed but this is the 3rd time this year this scent has been released if you've been following the releases.  It came out as part of the Faceted collection and then had a new packaging as a part of a gift set as well and then it leads to the scent joining this collection a few weeks after the intial drop.  I would say this and Champagne Toast have been ABUSED this year and shoved in our faces a bit too much.  Can ya blame it though, Strawberry Pound Cake smells sugary and gourmand and just smells great!  Just a little overdone...
* **Pumpkin Pecan Waffles** (Maple Syrup, Golden Waffles, Pumpkin Spice, Brown Sugar) - This was a popular scent last year and was happy to see it return (albeit a bit late to the party) but regardless, Pumpkin Pecan Waffles is such a strong scent from B&BW.  It's got a more rich scent to it and definitely hits the maple and brown sugar hard in this one.  Even more gourmant than Pumpkin Cupcake even.  I love this scent, but I still am on the fence on whether it is good body care since it is such a potent and unique scent.

**Overall: (7/10) -** To me, I feel I'm a bit torn about this set here.  On one hand, these are all great scents and really fit the gourmand style quite perfectly.  That is for sure and is why I love this set of scents.  What's bad is though 5/6 of these scents were in the same set last year (the only difference is Coconut Candy Apple didn't return and Champagne Apple & Honey took its place) on top of there's no new scents in this collection.  Kind of bummed to be honest.  It might be even a 6/10 if I wasn't in a better mood here lol.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xwajfjr89d6a1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=3121bdcb41d43d9ec1714db06cb75da6c0563058

Also released as Fall 1, we have this collection which was pretty interesting to say the least.  We see Pinkberry Clouds returning from last fall, Sun-Washed Citrus and Denim & Daisies from last summer and White Jasmine which we haven't seen for a couple of years but sold as an online exclusive.

**Packaging:** Going off of White Jasmine, the set's design is pretty simple and feels a lot like a Springtime collection more than anything else really.  I do like the bold colors (yellow, blue, pink, and white for the obvious scents here).  The floral/fruit designs were also nice too.

**Scents:**

* **Sun-Washed Citrus** (Sugared Lemons, Mandarin, Agave Nectar) - This was the citrus-y, fruity scent from the set and I'm still not really on board with this one.  It smells kind of like Pledge in a way with the strong lemon & orange note and then you have the agave nectar which gives it a slight twang to the scent as well.  I don't really think I enjoy this one too much sadly.
* **Pinkberry Clouds** (Strawberry Spun Sugar, Marshmallow Fluff, Fresh Air) - It's basically Boardwalk Taffy with an air note added in.  At initial spray it really does smell like the aforementioned scent very closely with the sugary berry note that's in it.  Somehow though, once on skin, the scent changes for me in a way I kind of like?  The fresh air note gives it this bite and as I've grown accustomed to that note, it's a hit or miss kind of note at that.  Here, it actually is nice, gives it a nice bounce and dreamy quality.  Not bad here!
* **Denim & Daisies** (Sweet Daisies, Sun-Washed Denim, Summer Citrus) - This scent though does the citrus element so much better than Sun-Washed Citrus did with its notes.  It could be the scruffy smell of denim and the light florals from the daisies, but this one really won me over.  I think it's also because it's in a fitting collection unlike last year where it was bypassed quite quickly compared to its two other scents Bonfire Bash and Firecracker Pop.
* **White Jasmine** (Creamy White Jasmine, Apple Blossom, White Cedarwood) - Yeah, funny that this was a scent I didn't own when the collection came out.  White Jasmine is kind of an odd floral scent to be honest.  It smells nice and clean, but I can't exactly compare it to Night-Blooming Jasmine, if anything, this immediately reminded me of Magnolia Charm from last year.  Maybe not as strong and I still would prefer the latter over this scent, but I definitely can smell that this is sweeter (thanks apple blossom).  It's not bad persay, but it feels like its been done before.

**Overall: (6/10)** \- Likewise with the previous set, I was pretty disappointed in the lack of new in Fall 1.  I mean 3 of the scents are passable, Denim & Daisies being the best of the 4 and it's cute that they brought back White Jasmine after a few years break and all, but I'm not feeling this collection.  Like I said, lack of new kind of brought it down for me.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/62dfhpnded6a1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e64342e45e6c24e8c2013bd38c8aace415a227b

Whoa there, yeah after last year's Halloween, it seems that it was big enough to bring Halloween closer to body care by releasing 2 full body care sets and 3 minis!  Ghoul Friend and Pumpking Carving aren't new scents to B&BW, but are finally mist (shimmer mists though) and Enchanted Candy Potion is a brand new scent!

**Packaging:** For the 2 full sets, the designs are pretty opposite to one another due to one being more about darkness while the other is more cutesy and bright.  I quite like that a lot in that way.

As for the minis, I also seem to enjoy the designs to from the lettering to the colors and design of the package (Vampire Blood was a light red this year BTW).

**Scents:**

* **Wicked Vanilla Woods** (Magical Vanilla, Glowing Amberwood, Enchanted Pink Pepper) - I was giddy to see this one returning as it's become my favorite scent and somehow my favorite vanilla scent of all time too.  It's just a good mix of sweet, gourmand, and a bit of a kick.  There's just something that works here and it's even better this year!  Just an overall awesome scent for me and I even love its new packaging too with more of the bats and a dark purple wrap, ahhh so gooood!
* **Enchanted Candy Potion** (Spellbinding Sugar, Bewitched Berries, Whipped Pixie Dust) - Right around when I got this scent (and some others in the review) I had come down with COVID and it took me a while to get back into things, I was so sad I couldn't smell this one but when I did, I had wondered what the hype was about.  At first, I thought this was going to be Sugar Coated, but it didn't quite turn out that way.  To me, it reminds me of those sugar sticks and even now it does, but there's something off on this one.  I'm still unsure what the actual scents involved here are, but maybe there's a drink or fruit in here?  Honey?  I'm not sure, but it's definitely not as great as Wicked Vanilla Woods is.
* **Vampire Blood** (Red Berries, Night-Blooming Jasmine, Plum) - Seeing Vampire Blood return was a no-brainer for me, but I did enjoy the new color it got (despite me having last year's royal purple edition).  I still to think it reminds me of Sweet Bunny Berry just less fake raspberry scented and it smells a lot more sweeter.  Not bad for a scent, once again hoping for full body care in the future...
* **Ghoul Friend** (Dark Strawberries, Ghostly Peony, Spine Chilling Citrus) - As I've said, Ghoul Friend isn't a new scent for the company, it's been in many forms and now it's a shimmer mist and I was curious since it took the purple look away from Vampire Blood here.  Smelling it, Ghoul Friend is a LOT more sweeter, taking over that strawberry note for sure.  Kind of reminds me of Secret Wonderland if the amber note was gone and the strawberry note was a bit more tart.  I like this one quite a bit and translates nicely to a mist.
* **Pumpkin Carving** (Freshly Carved Pumpkin, Spiced Pumpkin Seeds, Smooth Brown Sugar) - It's literally Sweet Cinnamon Pumpkin unfortunately here.  It's maybe a little sweeter, but that's not the biggest difference in my eyes sadly.  I do like the scent though and the fact that it's a smidge sweeter than SCP is may be something I would lean towards more.

**Overall: (9/10)** \- I loved that BBW went out for Halloween in the mists area because all those Halloween scents are just begging to be made into FFM.  I didn't go 10/10 primarily for this reason that it was just 2 main scents and the other 3 are relegated to being minis....C'mon BBW, next year make them all full size (and not shimmer mists >.>).

&#x200B;

Somewhere between Fall 1 & 2, this mini collection was sneakily released into stores.  We see a return of Pumpkin Cupcake (which was already an online exclusive BUT the mini was sold all over.  Then there's Pumpkin Apple which was originally supposed to come out last year but that was postponed or cancelled for whatever reason and then our new scent White Coconut Caramel.

**Packaging:** This was cute packaging especially for doing a raccoon, fox (for Pumpkin Cupcake), and chipmunk on the front and some warm colors for all 3 scents.  Simple and cute, not bad!

**Scents:**

* **Pumpkin Apple** (Red Delicious Apple, Fall Pumpkin, Fresh Ground Cinnamon, Clove Buds) - Wow, who knew that one of my favorite new scents to come out for 2022 would be in a mini?!?  This scent very much fits the theme of Autumn and just has this kind of fruit punch scent mixed in with the warmness of the cloves and it's no wonder because Pumpkin Apple has been many other things in BBW products.  Not sure where the pumpkin is persay, but I really enjoyed this one a lot and has stuck out at me most of the season into the Winter.
* **Pumpkin Cupcake** (Whipped Buttercream, Pumpkin Spice, Vanilla Cake Batter) - I mean I've already talked about it earlier in the post so you can read that, I just find it funny that it was released here with no online exclusive tag whereas the full body care was...
* **White Coconut Caramel** (Coconut Flakes, Toasted Hazelnut, Caramel Swirl) - As for the actual new scent (well once again, not really as it's been a hand soap a few times prior), but we have this one.  Some say it's a dupe to Coconut Cream Pie from last year, but to me, it lacks the pie element and favors more of the hazelnut in the scent, but I can definitely see the similarities between the two.  It's still a pretty solid scent overall, but I think the other two scents did more for me this year.

**Overall (8/10)** \- For as quiet of a release this was, this trio of scents were pretty good.  Super happy for the people that wanted to see Pumpkin Apple get a mini FFM for sure (definitely would've loved it in full-size though and White Coconut Caramel was a surprising addition and it came out quite well too.  Pumpkin Cupcake is probably the most confusing as it was already out n' about as a full-size in a different collection this year, but I suppose it works.  Overall, one of the more hidden gems.

&#x200B;

Next was this set which technically was supposed to release with Fall 2, but was given an early release by a few weeks.  We see the return of Sunrise Woods and Crisp Morning Air from last year and two new scents that joined for this one.

**Packaging:** Going off the 2 new scents, the packaging is actually both really pretty and also familiar.  It definitely takes the nature-esque looks from last year (the one Crisp Morning Air is showing) and then giving this interesting logo on the front (I've started noticing they've been putting these symbols above the scent name for a couple of these scents.  Overall nice, though I find it funny that Crisp Morning Air dons the only cool color of the quartet, but that's just me.

**Scents:**

* **Sunrise Woods** (Creamy Sandalwood, Sweet Berries, Cozy Cashmere) - I found it funny that also Twilight Woods came back this year (with new packaging, but isn't a part of this set).  I find Sunrise Woods this year to be rather forgettable for some odd reason.  I definitely think it could be the scent notes that don't truly excite me and then sniffing it, it just feels kind of boring?  Like it smells warm and cozy and the berries give it a sweet notek but I just feel as if it's not a really unique scent for me.
* **Autumn Drive** (Wild Raspberry, Warm Amber, Vanilla Birch) - Which is funny because I like Autumn Drive but I keep getting reminded of how amazingly close it is to smelling like Buttercups & Berry Bellini from earlier this Spring.  I'm not entirely sure what makes it feel different from one another sniffing them side by side, but I feel like Autumn Drive doesn't quite have the floral note that the other scent does.  Though I could be perfectly wrong and they're dupes and I wouldn't be surprised either.
* **Golden Hour Coast** (Sun-Kissed Bergamot, Golden Pear, Radiant Woods) - Just like Sunrise Woods, I feel bored from Golden Hour Coast.  Granted, this is a brighter scent overall, but I also feel as if I smelled this before in my collection.  Maybe it reminds me of Afternoon Sunshine minus the shampoo-like note.  I don't know...it's good no doubt, but I'm very susceptible to forgetting it in the future.
* **Crisp Morning Air** (Crisp Fall Breeze, Golden Amberwood, Juicy Apple) - Last, but not least we have Crisp Morning Air and at least this smells fruity like Autumn Drive does with the abundance of apple in the scent.  It's definitely its own apple scent though and the air note still kind of bites me here which makes me not want to wear it too much.

**Overall: (6/10) -** I really couldn't tell you all why I wasn't really into this collection this year.  I mean last year I loved Sunrise Woods, but this year it just felt plain to me?  Autumn Drive was good if it wasn't for the fact it smells like a total dupe and Golden Hour Coast felt boring too.  To think Crisp Morning Air (a scent that I'm slowly growing into is the best scent out of this set just feels weird to me).

&#x200B;

These last 6 scents in this post feel like I've kind of bypassed since I haven't spent time with them since the review happened.  Anyways, Midnight Amber Glow was Fall 2's core scent and I was surprised they'd go for a drink-forward scent such as this...very cool!

**Packaging:**  At first, I thought the design was kind of boring until I got to actually see it face to face and I noticed the bottle's wrap-around looks like a latte with the flowing liquid going down like a latte does.  Add on some cute little stars and a simple text and I quite ended up liking it!

**Scent:**

* **Midnight Amber Glow** (Smooth Amber, Caramel Latte, Vanilla Bourbon) - I was elated to see a latte scent be a core scent and Midnight Amber Glow is a really nice surprise for the season!  I really love the smell here.  I definitely get all 3 notes in here, the latte and bourbon really make up the sweetness and kind of smoothness of the scent while the amber gives it that nice perfume-y touch.  I have also seen mixed reviews about the other parts of this scent (like the lotion smelling different and whatnot) but the FFM has been pretty much praised all-around.

**Overall: (9/10)** \- Yeah, this was my favorite between this, Poppy, and Fall in Bloom.  There's just something warm and delicious about this scent that I can't seem to get enough of.  Very cool scent and I hope it returns somehow next year (or stay in the lineup too).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qjcd4l01ud6a1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6144089348451b4375d8ab9e95f26af1cd18fa2

As it's aptly named, the Sweater Weather collection, this was also a part of Fall 2 as well.  Of course just by namesake, Sweater Weather returns on top of Ivory Cashmere from last year.  Then we got two new scents in Cozy Season & Pink Suede.

**Packaging:** From the idea of the collection, the bottle style is set to look like fabric because sweaters, cashmere, suede and just being cozy hence all 4 scents coming together.  I also like the soft pastel colors especially with the new scents.

**Scents:**

* **Cozy Season** (Soft Lavender, Golden Honey, Creamy Oak) - With the amount of lavender scents released since last year, I find it difficult to really differentiate them all.  Like with Cozy Season, I find it hard to say what's all that's different between this and something like Cozy Sunday Morning, Cloud Nine, or Cozy Evening, or even Golden Ocean Pearl...it's just hard to really pinpoint things out.  What I can say is that is it's sweet, not heavy on the lavender itself and does suit the cozy feeling its trying to give.  Still damn...so many scents with the word ""cozy"" in it it feels like.
* **Sweater Weather** (Sun-Crisped Apple, Autumn Leaves, Orchard Woods) - I feel like just with Crisp Morning Air, I feel like Sweater Weather is like THE apple scent of the season.  To me, unlike that scent, this one is a lot more sharp and gives me a cologne-like vibe in my opinion, but it's a popular scent as well.  I like it, but maybe I'm the only one that still kind of prefers the Winter variant?
* **Ivory Cashmere** (Fresh Lakeside Air, Silver Musk, White Amber) - I still cannot really get into this one much.  My feelings have not really changed much about it since I reviewed it.  I feel as if it's just too sterile and smells completely weird to me?  Like even these scent notes to me don't really feel like anything I would particularly like together like fresh air note and amber seems dangerous and I have NO idea what silver musk is? XD  Yeah, respect to those that like it though :3
* **Pink Suede** (Blush Berries, Velvet Peonies, Soft Cotton) - Pink Suede, being the other new scent really surprised me and I'm surprised I don't use it a bit more.  I'm not sure what it is about it that makes me love it but it's like Pinkberry Clouds but more potent and just more floral as well.  I really enjoyed this one a lot and probably the best out of the 4.

**Overall: (7/10)** \- For as the last set released for the season, the Sweater Weather collection was pretty good?  I feel like Sweater Weather and Pink Suede really carried this set for me.  They both just smell so good and interesting.  Cozy Season smells good, but it doesn't offer much for me in uniqueness and Ivory Cashmere is just too much...  Still, not a bad set!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/il3v480yzd6a1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca73a13d08b9feabf0c6772e18e24d32ca91fffd

The last scent in this post was the ONLY new scent to really represent Fall 3 (as the other scents released were Pumpkin Pecan Waffles and Strawberry Pound Cake for the popart collection and some scents for the Faceted collection).  Fall in Bloom would be the last core scent of the season as well.

**Packaging:** Funny, I actually thought of Dahlia when I saw this packaging as it kind of has a similar art style with the flowers and the metallic wrap as well.  Though obviously with the peach coloring it does look different.  Is OK though.

**Scent:**

* **Fall in Bloom** (Juicy Plum, Wild Blooms, Velvet Moss) - As the final Autumn scent for the year, Fall in Bloom is kind of a miss for me.  There's something pleasant about the plum for sure and is probably what makes me tolerate the scent, but that moss note is a bit much for me.  I don't know what they were going for here to be honest.  I guess the floral notes may be trying to connect the dots, but I feel a little dizzy out of this one.

**Overall: (6/10)** \- Yeah, this core scent is probably the first to kind disappoint me.  I know this has fans and all, but personally, it's just a bit too musty and heavy for me to really appreciate it fully.  Not gonna lie, here's hoping the remainder of the year doesn't hit this low for me!

&#x200B;

**And there's Part 3 DONE!  Of course, Winter is next and it might be a little while before I can make that post since Winter SAS hasn't even started yet and there's scents I'll need to get!**"

Prescribed Burns Scheduled in Cades Cove Nov. 1-22,GSMNP,yfbdtn,2022-10-27 22:34:59,7,0.82,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GSMNP/comments/yfbdtn/prescribed_burns_scheduled_in_cades_cove_nov_122/,magiccitybhm,NEWS,"*Great Smoky Mountains News Release*   
*Date:  October 27, 2022* 

*Park Plans Prescribed Burns in Cades Cove* 

*Great Smoky Mountains National Park and Appalachian Piedmont Coastal Fire Management Zone staff plan to burn approximately 1,200 acres of fields in Cades Cove. Weather permitting, burn operations will occur between Tuesday, November 1 and Tuesday, November 22.  These seasonal controlled burns help perpetuate native herbaceous species that provide high quality cover and foraging opportunities for a diversity of wildlife including deer, turkeys, and ground nesting birds.* 

*“Appalachian Piedmont Coastal Zone Fire Staff are excited to lead prescribed burn operations in Cades Cove this year to meet field restoration goals in the Smokies,” said Fire Management Officer Brian Tonihka. “Notably, we will be using Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in ignition operations for the burns, which will be a first for the National Park Service in the Southeast region. This new technology provides a great opportunity to improve efficiency and operational safety.”*   

*Over the last 20 years, park managers have conducted burns during the spring and fall under specific prescription parameters to safely reduce fuels, restore meadow habitats, and maintain the historic landscape of Cades Cove. Park staff closely monitor fire weather conditions including vegetation and soil moisture, wind speed and direction, temperature, and relative humidity to ensure that conditions meet the burn plan objectives for the site. Forecasted precipitation in the East Tennessee area over the next few weeks will improve the opportunity for prescription parameters to be met.*  

*Visitors should expect to see firefighters and equipment along Sparks Lane, Hyatt Lane, and the Cades Cove Loop Road.  The closure of Sparks Lane and the access road and trailhead for the Abrams Falls Trail may be necessary during certain operational periods.  The loop road and historic structures will remain open to visitor use, but brief delays and temporary closures may occur to ensure public safety during burn operations. Specifically, the crew plans to burn the following units labeled on the attached map:  Cable House, 97 acres; Cemetery Marsh, 291 acres; Tipton Oliver, 257 acres; Maple Branch, 377 acres; Sparks, 164 acres; and Martha’s Branch, 17 acres.  The map can be downloaded to a cell phone using the QR code.* 

*Visitors should expect to see fire activity and smoke during prescribed burn operations. Fire managers ask that motorists reduce speed in work zones, but refrain from stopping in the roadways. If smoke is present, motorists should roll up windows and turn on headlights.* 

*For more information on the use of prescribed burns in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, visit the park website at* [*http://www.nps.gov/grsm/learn/nature/wildlandfire.htm*](https://www.nps.gov/grsm/learn/nature/wildlandfire.htm?fbclid=IwAR2i5_QJYGyoHgx5wMplXFTL_i7UJ0PYqZWGiAoDblVS3Mwo7gvA44WfDRs)*.*"
