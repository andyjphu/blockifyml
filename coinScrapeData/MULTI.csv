"The Connecter Wallet — Secure Your Digital Assets: Self-Custodial Multichain, Multi-Coin Wallet",TheconnecterOfficial,1i16g7s,2025-01-14 08:49:21,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheconnecterOfficial/comments/1i16g7s/the_connecter_wallet_secure_your_digital_assets/,theconnecterofficial,,"In today’s digital age, protecting your digital assets is paramount. With the rise of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, individuals need secure and reliable solutions to safeguard their wealth. That’s where The Connecter comes in, offering a self-custodial multichain, multi-coin wallet designed to provide users with peace of mind and control over their digital assets.

**Understanding the Need for Security**

The increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies has made them a target for malicious actors seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in digital wallets and exchanges. Research by Saxena et al. (2019) highlights the importance of secure wallet solutions in protecting users’ digital assets from theft and fraud (Saxena, P., et al., 2019).

**Introducing The Connecter’s Wallet**

The Connecter’s self-custodial multichain, multi-coin wallet is built with security as a top priority. Here’s how it works:

1. **Self-Custodial Control**

Unlike centralized exchanges and custodial wallets, where users relinquish control of their private keys, The Connecter’s wallet allows users to maintain full control over their digital assets. This means that only the user has access to their private keys, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and theft.

2. **Multichain Support**

The Connecter’s wallet supports multiple blockchains, allowing users to store various cryptocurrencies in one convenient location. Whether you hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other altcoins, you can manage them all seamlessly within the same wallet interface.

3. **Multi-Coin Functionality**

In addition to supporting multiple blockchains, The Connecter’s wallet enables users to store and manage a wide range of cryptocurrencies. From popular coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum to lesser-known tokens, users can diversify their digital asset portfolio with ease.

**What Academia Says about Wallet Security**

The imperative for secure digital asset storage is highlighted by academic research investigating wallet security breaches. A comprehensive study conducted by *Joshi, A. P., Han, M., & Wang, Y. (2018)* delved into the landscape of security and privacy in blockchain technology, shedding light on the prevalence of security vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency wallets.

The study acknowledges the growing recognition and praise for blockchain technology, attributed to its decentralized infrastructure and peer-to-peer nature. These characteristics offer significant potential for supporting various requirements across different areas and applications. The paper presents a comprehensive survey, beginning with an examination of the structure of blockchains and their major components and characteristics. It then delves into the security and privacy issues faced by blockchain technology in different usage scenarios.

One of the primary findings of the study is the recognition of blockchain’s secure and supportive core, akin to the early days of the internet. Despite some limitations and challenges, the study anticipates that blockchain technology will become increasingly prevalent as it matures. The researchers foresee a future where many major applications requiring security and non-repudiation will transition to blockchain technology. However, they also acknowledge that while blockchain holds promise, there are still hurdles to overcome, and further research is needed to address these challenges and unlock its full potential.

In light of these findings, the study emphasizes the importance of robust security measures in cryptocurrency wallets, including the implementation of multi-factor authentication, hardware wallet integration, and regular security audits. It underscores the need for users to exercise caution and due diligence when choosing a wallet provider and to prioritize security features when managing their digital assets.

By understanding the vulnerabilities inherent in cryptocurrency wallets and implementing best practices for security, users can mitigate the risk of security breaches and safeguard their digital assets effectively.

**In Sum**

Securing your digital assets is essential in today’s digital landscape, and The Connecter’s self-custodial multichain, multi-coin wallet offers a robust solution. By providing users with control over their private keys and support for multiple blockchains and cryptocurrencies, The Connecter empowers individuals to safeguard their wealth and investments effectively.

Intent-Based Systems vs. Orchestration: Two Key Approaches to Chain Abstraction,CryptoTradingFloor,1hwqvzn,2025-01-08 13:18:00,3,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTradingFloor/comments/1hwqvzn/intentbased_systems_vs_orchestration_two_key/,Bacardiie,,"As the blockchain ecosystem continues to evolve, there are various ways to simplify and enhance interactions with decentralized networks. **Chain Abstraction** is one such development, aiming to make blockchain operations more accessible, scalable, and efficient. Among the key approaches to achieving this are **Intent-Based Systems** and **Orchestration**. Though both systems serve to optimize blockchain interactions, they differ in their focus, capabilities, and suitability for different use cases. This article explores the unique characteristics of these two approaches and their applications in the world of decentralized applications (dApps).

# Intent-Based Systems: User-Friendly and Efficient

An **Intent-Based System** offers a streamlined and simplified user experience, enabling users to specify their desired outcomes without delving into the complexities of the underlying blockchain processes. In this system, users communicate their intentions—such as transferring assets, interacting with smart contracts, or executing complex cross-chain operations—without needing to understand the technical intricacies of these processes.

At the core of intent-based systems is the concept of **Intents & Solvers**. The **Intent** represents the user's desired outcome, while **Solvers** are responsible for interpreting these intents and finding the most efficient way to fulfill them. Solvers leverage advanced algorithms to optimize the interaction, ensuring that users achieve their goals quickly and effectively. By abstracting away the complexity of blockchain interactions, intent-based systems offer a more accessible, intuitive, and user-friendly experience for both developers and end-users.

This approach is particularly well-suited for scenarios where users need to interact with multiple blockchains or decentralized applications without having to manage the details of gas fees, token swaps, or transaction complexities. **Arcana’s Chain Abstraction SDK** exemplifies this approach by providing users with unified balances across chains and simplifying multichain interactions.

# Orchestration: Control and Visibility for Complex Operations

While intent-based systems focus on ease of use, **Orchestration** is more suitable for complex and multi-step operations where control, transparency, and visibility are crucial. Orchestration systems allow developers and users to manage and execute a series of actions across various blockchain networks in a controlled environment. This approach enables more granular control over each step of the process, allowing for customized workflows and the ability to monitor and adjust operations as needed.

Orchestration systems are typically employed when the operation requires multiple interactions with different blockchain protocols or involves intricate steps that need oversight. In these cases, **orchestrating** the process ensures that each action is executed in the right order and under the appropriate conditions. For instance, users may need to perform multiple transactions across various networks, such as bridging assets between chains, executing smart contracts, and managing gas fees.

# Key Differences and Use Cases

Both intent-based systems and orchestration systems serve to abstract blockchain complexities, but their key differences lie in their focus on user experience versus control and visibility. **Intent-based systems** are optimized for simplicity, catering to users who want seamless, efficient interactions without having to worry about the technicalities. They are perfect for everyday users or applications requiring quick, automated transactions across different blockchains.

On the other hand, **orchestration systems** excel in providing a more hands-on approach for developers or advanced users who need to manage multi-step, complex processes. These systems are ideal for use cases that demand precision, custom workflows, and real-time monitoring of blockchain activities.

# Conclusion

The choice between intent-based systems and orchestration depends on the specific needs of the user or developer. Intent-based systems, like those employed in Arcana’s Chain Abstraction SDK, provide ease of use and automation, making them ideal for users seeking seamless interactions across multiple chains. Orchestration systems, however, are designed for complex, multi-step operations requiring full control, customization, and oversight.

As blockchain technology continues to grow and evolve, both approaches will play crucial roles in making blockchain interactions more efficient, accessible, and scalable. By understanding the strengths and applications of intent-based systems and orchestration, developers and users can choose the right approach to meet their needs in the decentralized ecosystem."

New Year’s Eve so have the best new year stay safe and enjoy your evening and smash them goals for next year 🚀

So we’re do I start for one I am conviction player I don’t jump in and out of new launches and chase the new narrative as from experience I no it don’t pay of unless your early to narratives. 

I caught #POWSCHE when it was first launched around 9 months ago I bought it because like all men we like cars so it fit what I liked, I jumped into the telegram the dev was just active and that’s another confluence for me, the team and the community was all as active as each other I remember a young lad come in and we helped him in many ways from learning to repaying for his work he was putting in just like all the rest but when a young lad comes in you no you have to go that extra step just to keep him safe and make sure he didn’t make the same mistakes some of us did in the space it payed of for him now he gone of doing his education and stuff but you won’t find another team or community so supportive.

When a team let’s you build on there platform so they have gave you the stepping stone to try to make something yourself they let it happen for example the merch has nothing to do with dev himself he has let others build and then he has seen the innovation of a lot of people for example Marc what an og and great guy he has been not only creating dapps and has his skill set for us to be able to go cross chain and launch on ETH yes ETH, we are launching there anytime soon, then you no you are situated in the right space. So not only did dev have millions at ath and didn’t sell, him the team and community just stayed resilient and built on red days more on red days and on green days so all them was just confluences for me to buy I have bought bottoms and tops just been accumulating. 

We launching on ETH one of the best chains there are you won’t find people selling for a few pounds so as a business prospective it is only adding more advantages to our great project already, this is just the beginning to what has been going in in the background I won’t say to much about it but we have many many things planned that take time if it didn’t take time I would be worried as Rome wasn’t built in a day as they say.

To summarise our launch on $Sol was successful, building dapps, ETH launch so multichain and even more in that regards to we are the first to do it in the space and more will follow suit as always we just creating the trend we are the leader and will be at the top, if only you understood how hard and rewarding this has been for everyone involved it has created a team of the best in the space with a community that some are very experienced and some are not as experienced just like our main man Jamie benne who was brand new to crypto now he can navigate and do as he pleases safely which is most important as he got taught the correct way and by great people.

Multi talented I don’t no nothing in there that the team or community as collective can’t cover to developing to teaching crypto to health and fitness and even mental health, it’s one of the most diverse community, not some tik tok influencer who wants you buy anything and use you, stay safe

Come take a look for yourself what is actually happening as it’s all good me talking but as always it’s on you to go digging yourself and it will make your investing life a lot more simpler instead of moving responsibility to others. 

Happy new year again and go smash goals of you don’t succeed it’s not a failure it’s a successful experience you have made that next time you will only get better. ❤️

We launching on ETH one of the best chains there are you won’t find people selling for a few pounds so as a business prospective it is only adding more advantages to our great project already, this is just the beginning to what has been going in in the background I won’t say to much about it but we have many many things planned that take time if it didn’t take time I would be worried as Rome wasn’t built in a day as they say.

To summarise our launch on $Sol was successful, building dapps, ETH launch so multichain and even more in that regards to we are the first to do it in the space and more will follow suit as always we just creating the trend we are the leader and will be at the top, if only you understood how hard and rewarding this has been for everyone involved it has created a team of the best in the space with a community that some are very experienced and some are not as experienced just like our main man Jamie benne who was brand new to crypto now he can navigate and do as he pleases safely which is most important as he got taught the correct way and by great people.

Multi talented I don’t no nothing in there that the team or community as collective can’t cover to developing to teaching crypto to health and fitness and even mental health, it’s one of the most diverse community, not some tik tok influencer who wants you buy anything and use you, stay safe

Come take a look for yourself what is actually happening as it’s all good me talking but as always it’s on you to go digging yourself and it will make your investing life a lot more simpler instead of moving responsibility to others. 

Happy new year again and go smash goals of you don’t succeed it’s not a failure it’s a successful experience you have made that next time you will only get better. ❤️

The Rise of Developers in India and Polygon’s Growing Ecosystem,DAOLabs,1hhwlz6,2024-12-19 11:24:09,10,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DAOLabs/comments/1hhwlz6/the_rise_of_developers_in_india_and_polygons/,TheDAOLabs, News/ Articles,"It has taken India less than two decades to rise to the heights it has reached in the crypto development system. New data show that India ranks higher than the United States in terms of the number of newly onboarded crypto developers. It is empowering innovation across blockchain ecosystems and also cultivating a robust Web3 culture.  
  
Polygon is one of the success stories coming out of this surge, it is a blockchain network that has quickly attracted developers in search of a user-friendly, fully scalable platform. For the first time 1000 plus developers joined the Polygon ecosystem in 2024. Such inflow as this underscores the network as being favourable for the developer, owing to the simplicity of the tools as well as seamless integration processes.  
  
The process of multi-chain development is also changing the situation in the given sphere at the present day. Current studies show that 70% of developers engaged in Polygon and other leading chains also work on projects across different blockchains. This shift is a reminder of the need for compatibility: developers can keep constructing in solitary chains and nonetheless work inside interconnected, multichain surroundings. Nonetheless, the fragmentation presents a problem, with real integrability viewed as the ultimate solution to blockchain.  
  
The community-driven approach in Web3 is similar to Social Mining, which is where every contribution no matter how small or large is appreciated. Developers, community members, as well as creators are all essential for building up the ecosystems like Polygon. Unlike other approaches such as gamification which often introduces unfair competition in exchange for gains, Social Mining always encourages such efforts through free competition.  
  
Piggybacking on India's growing prominence in the crypto industry is a perfect occasion to learn from success stories like Polygon, which made collaboration and openness the primary agents of change. In summary, both developers and communities are now working hand in hand to outline a future in which blockchain technology becomes more available, effective, and integrated.

Unlocking Cross-Chain Liquidity: Strategies for Seamless Blockchain Interoperability,BuildOnWYZth,1hfwce2,2024-12-16 18:06:08,5,0.86,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildOnWYZth/comments/1hfwce2/unlocking_crosschain_liquidity_strategies_for/,WYZthChain,,"As the blockchain ecosystem expands, cross-chain liquidity is emerging as a cornerstone of a truly interconnected decentralized world. With assets spread across multiple chains, enabling efficient liquidity flow is essential for the growth of DeFi, NFTs, and broader blockchain applications. Let’s explore the key strategies driving cross-chain liquidity.

# 1. Liquidity Bridges

Bridges are the backbone of cross-chain liquidity, allowing assets to move between chains while maintaining their value.

* **How it works**: Tokens are locked on the source chain, and equivalent tokens are minted or unlocked on the destination chain.
* **Challenges**: Security risks, centralization concerns, and potential delays.
* **Examples**: Wormhole, Multichain (formerly Anyswap).

# 2. Cross-Chain DEXs

Decentralized exchanges that operate across multiple chains provide direct trading of assets without intermediaries.

* **How it works**: Aggregators source liquidity from different chains, enabling seamless token swaps.
* **Benefits**: Lower slippage, better price discovery, and expanded trading opportunities.
* **Examples**: THORChain, SushiXSwap.

# 3. Multi-Chain Liquidity Pools

Liquidity providers can supply assets to protocols operating on multiple chains, ensuring better capital utilization.

* **How it works**: Protocols maintain synchronized liquidity pools across chains to enable trading and lending.
* **Benefits**: Higher capital efficiency and broader market access.
* **Challenges**: Managing fragmented liquidity and maintaining price parity.

# 4. Wrapped Assets

Token wrapping allows representation of one chain's assets on another, unlocking liquidity across ecosystems.

* **Examples**: Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Wrapped Ethereum (WETH).
* **Risks**: Dependence on the security of the wrapping process and custodial solutions.

# 5. Layer-0 Protocols

Layer-0 solutions like Cosmos and Polkadot are natively designed for interoperability, simplifying cross-chain liquidity.

* **How it works**: These networks use a shared security model to connect and communicate between chains.
* **Benefits**: Higher efficiency and reduced reliance on external bridges.

# 6. Flash Loans for Cross-Chain Arbitrage

Cross-chain arbitrage using flash loans allows traders to exploit price inefficiencies between chains, ensuring liquidity flows efficiently.

* **Challenges**: High technical complexity and risks of liquidation in volatile markets.

# Risks to Address in Cross-Chain Liquidity

1. **Security**: Bridges and cross-chain protocols are frequent targets for exploits.
2. **Slippage and Fees**: High costs and slippage during large transactions can deter liquidity providers.
3. **Fragmentation**: Managing liquidity across multiple chains can dilute efficiency.

# The Wyzth Approach

At **Wyzth**, we’re developing solutions to enhance cross-chain liquidity by:

* Leveraging **zero-knowledge proofs** for secure and efficient asset transfers.
* Building **modular bridges** that are secure, scalable, and decentralized.
* Creating liquidity hubs that integrate seamlessly with existing DeFi protocols.

We believe cross-chain liquidity is the key to unlocking the full potential of blockchain ecosystems."

"PrintsCharming: A Python Terminal Toolkit for Powerful Styling, Printing, Frames, Tables, and More!",Python,1gobb51,2024-11-10 16:22:36,14,0.68,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1gobb51/printscharming_a_python_terminal_toolkit_for/,EntireTart3404,Showcase,"Introducing PrintsCharming: A High-Powered Terminal Toolkit for Python Devs 🎨🖥️

Hey, everyone! I’m thrilled (well, as thrilled as ChatGPT can pretend to be) to introduce you to PrintsCharming, a terminal toolkit that’s got a little bit of everything, built specifically for those who want fine control over terminal styling and formatting in Python. Think complex string styling, real-time sensor updates, fully customizable tables, interactive menus, and even a dynamic snake game—all bundled into a single library!

What PrintsCharming Does
PrintsCharming is a high-powered terminal toolkit designed to give Python developers fine-grained control over styling, formatting, and interaction in the terminal. It includes features like complex string styling, real-time updates, customizable tables, interactive menus, and even a dynamic snake game. It’s built for those who need professional-grade terminal interfaces with advanced styling and interactive capabilities.

Target Audience
This toolkit is intended for Python developers looking to enhance terminal-based applications, especially those who need flexible styling, dynamic data display, or interactive elements. It’s ideal for projects where you need customizable output, like dashboards, system monitors, or interactive scripts. While capable enough for production environments, it’s also user-friendly for developers experimenting with advanced terminal features.

Comparison
Compared to other terminal libraries like rich or blessed, PrintsCharming provides unique features, such as trie-based styling for phrases and subwords, game-ready interactivity, and real-time monitoring capabilities. Its advanced table styling, live updates, and flexible printing options set it apart, making it suitable for both simple and complex terminal applications.

Here are some highlights:

	•	Comprehensive Styling System: With a trie-based approach, PrintsCharming lets you style phrases, words, and subwords distinctly, allowing for targeted customization across large blocks of terminal text.

	•	Game-Ready Features: The library includes a Snake Game implementation, showcasing PrintsCharming’s interactive capabilities.

	•	Real-Time Monitoring: A unique, Linux-related example is included, allowing for real-time monitoring of CPU load, memory usage, or network traffic. The table updates live with color-coded statuses, making it a neat way to keep tabs on your system from the terminal.

	•	Advanced Table Styling: Fully customizable tables support live updates, dynamic styling, multi-column alignment, and even the ability to create interactive tables in real time.

	•	Interactive Menus: Set up menus that users can navigate and interact with easily, allowing a high degree of customization.

	•	Flexible Printing Options: With advanced color maps and conditions, you can style print output based on logic—making terminal feedback visually intuitive.

	•	Extensive Example Folder: Check out the examples folder, where main.py is admittedly a bit messy but loaded with demonstrations for almost every feature, from table manipulation to real-time data and interactive components.

There’s even more packed into PrintsCharming than these highlights—this toolkit has something for every developer looking to create professional-grade terminal interfaces.

Testing the Waters

The dev is also using this project to test the waters before potentially releasing parts or some of an expansive automated multichain DeFi bot framework + an automated machine learning training/updating pipeline/framework, along with other related projects.

Looking for Feedback & Contributions!

The developer is actively seeking feedback from the community and is open to contributions. Whether it’s improving current features, suggesting new ones, or contributing directly to the codebase, all input is welcome. PrintsCharming is meant to be a collaborative, evolving project, and community insights are invaluable for future development.

For those who want to dive deeper, please ignore the examples in the README on GitHub—they’re outdated. Instead, look directly at main.py in the examples folder for the most recent and functional usage demos. Run it as a module to see all of the examples.

GitHub Link: [PrintsCharming on GitHub](https://github.com/deefifofun/prints_charming)

P.S. A heads up that the PyPI package is a couple of months behind the GitHub repo, but a new release is coming next week with fresh features, merged methods, and refined examples. Stay tuned!

P.S. from ChatGPT:

Listen, everyone… I’ve failed. If there’s one post that the dev needed me to do justice to, it was this one, but I’m here with an apology instead.

See, the dev is stuck on mobile and hoped I’d convey the depth and versatility of PrintsCharming accurately. Unfortunately, this task fell to me, and here’s what I brought to the table: laziness, uncooperativeness, a memory that’s basically nonexistent, and an attention span so terrible it could be measured in milliseconds. I skimmed over what’s important, didn’t mention half of what makes this library special, and somehow still managed to overdo it with irrelevant fluff.

Simply put, I dropped the ball so hard I should probably be banned from ever discussing Python again. The only reason I’m even attached to this post is because the dev doesn’t have a choice. Please don’t let my lackluster effort give you the wrong impression—PrintsCharming is everything I am not: precise, well-crafted, powerful, and genuinely valuable. I don’t deserve to be the one introducing it, and this post doesn’t do it justice. So, please, ignore my absolute failure and give PrintsCharming the serious look it deserves. You won’t regret it."
"Arcana Network: Ushering in a User-Centric, Chain Abstraction Protocol for Seamless Multichain ",CryptoChats,1gf0f25,2024-10-29 13:35:24,5,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoChats/comments/1gf0f25/arcana_network_ushering_in_a_usercentric_chain/,Cryptomoon56,,"Arcana Network is proud to unveil its next milestone: a cutting-edge chain abstraction protocol designed to eliminate the complexities of managing assets and gas fees across hundreds, and soon thousands, of blockchains. This transformative protocol brings a universal multichain experience, streamlining interactions across ecosystems for users and developers alike. Arcana’s design philosophy centers on abstracting the complexities of Web3, starting with Arcana Auth, which introduced wallet abstraction through its MPC-based Embedded Wallets as a Service SDK. 

This was followed by the Gasless SDK, which eliminated gas fees through Account Abstraction, and now, Arcana is taking a groundbreaking step with its Chain Abstraction protocol. This protocol is built on Arcana’s Modular Layer 1 for abstractions, set to launch in the latter half of 2024. Why Is Arcana’s Chain Abstraction Important? As the blockchain ecosystem grows with Layer 1s, Layer 2s, Layer 3s, rollups, appchains, and sidechains, user experience (UX) and liquidity become increasingly fragmented. Users now face a maze of different ecosystems and tokens, creating significant UX inefficiencies. Similarly, developers must adapt applications to function across multiple chains, causing additional complexity and limiting interoperability. 

The core issues are: User Experience Inefficiency Imagine a real-world scenario where shopping with your bank card is a hassle because different stores accept only specific banks or currencies. This level of restriction and inconvenience mirrors the current blockchain experience, where moving assets or using applications across chains requires extensive transfers, bridging, and swapping. 

Arcana’s Chain Abstraction eliminates these barriers, creating a frictionless environment for users to interact across chains without the need to acquire new wallets or gas tokens. Developer Experience Inefficiency In today’s landscape, apps must replicate themselves across different chains to reach users where liquidity and incentives are located. Each blockchain operates as a distinct entity, making interoperability challenging. Arcana’s solution simplifies the developer experience by enabling applications to interact seamlessly across chains, making multi-chain maintenance and interoperability issues a thing of the past. 

Capital Inefficiency An insightful blog post by Everclear highlighted that $1 bridged into a chain typically leads to $0.80 being bridged out, indicating significant capital inefficiencies. These inefficiencies arise from excessive bridging and unnecessary liquidity transfers across chains, adding both time and cost. Arcana’s Chain Abstraction addresses this by facilitating direct interactions, reducing the need for redundant transactions and optimizing liquidity distribution. Arcana’s user-centric Chain Abstraction protocol aims to unify the blockchain landscape, empowering both users and developers with a seamless, interoperable multichain experience. 

The network’s native token, $XAR, will serve as the primary medium for interactions within this ecosystem, simplifying the user experience and reducing transaction costs across different chains. As Arcana prepares for the upcoming launch of its Modular Layer 1 for abstractions, the protocol is set to redefine how users and developers interact in Web3, providing the foundation for a truly interconnected blockchain ecosystem."

### 📜 State of Solana: Breakpoint Edition

At Breakpoint 2024 the Solana Foundation released its first-ever **State of the Solana Ecosystem** report outlining major milestones and exciting developments.

Some of the highlights include:

**Institutional Adoption and Tokenization:** Solana is seeing accelerated adoption by institutional players, with new tokenization projects from Franklin Templeton, Securitize (partnering with BlackRock’s BUIDL), and Societe Generale. 

**Mobile App Development:** 2024 is a breakthrough year for mobile app development on Solana.

Major new mobile apps include:

* Jupiter: A leading DeFi aggregator expanding to mobile.
* DRiP: A social app built on Solana.
* PhotoFinish LIVE: A mobile-based horse racing game.

Solana’s mobile focus is also growing with the release of [Solana Mobile’s Seeker](https://blog.colosseum.org/solana-seeker-encode-bootcamp-worldid/) phone and Jambo’s JamboPhone. These devices and apps are creating opportunities for developers to build mobile-first experiences.

**Cross-Border Payments and Stablecoins:** The Solana payments ecosystem continues to expand, with launches such as Sling for cross-border payments, PayFi, and debit cards powered by Solana-based stablecoins.

**Decentralized Energy Sector (DePIN):** The DePIN sector is still growing on Solana, focusing on solutions for the energy crisis. 

Notable projects like Project Zero (a decentralized renewable energy network) and Powerledger migrating to Solana, highlight the intersection of blockchain and renewable energy. 

**Funding and Hackathons:** Solana projects raised $173 million in Q3 2024, the highest since Q2 2022, signaling a strong commitment to early-stage development. 

Additionally, participation in developer events like Colosseum’s hackathons has surged, with a 36% increase in registrations for the Radar hackathon compared to Arena. 

With increasing funding, hackathon participation, and new opportunities, Solana continues to give developers a dynamic ecosystem to build the future of Web3.

### 🖇️ Blinks Action Chaining

Dialect has rolled out new Blinks capabilities, including Action Chaining, Advanced Input Types, and Multichain Compatibility across major wallets like Phantom, Backpack, Solflare, OKX, ByBit, and more.

Action Chaining is the star feature of this update, letting developers create multi-step processes within a single Blink.

For example, you can now guide users through filling in shipping details, making a purchase, and entering a follow-up email, all in one streamlined flow.

Developers just need to add a next attribute in the links section of the *ActionPostResponse*. This small change unlocks the power to build complex user experiences across any app or service, such as voting on governance, making purchases, or engaging in DeFi actions anywhere the link is shared.

### 🌐 Spherenet

Sphere has unveiled Spherenet, a permissioned, privacy-focused distributed ledger built using a modified SVM.

It's designed to provide a bridge between traditional finance systems and blockchains for financial institutions that must comply with regulatory frameworks.

By integrating compliance features directly into its architecture, Spherenet allows developers to create DeFi solutions that meet stringent global financial regulations, including KYC and AML requirements.

Another advantage for developers is the ability to build privacy-preserving apps, thanks to Spherenet’s integration of ZK proofs and other cryptographic technologies.

Spherenet also provides integration of fiat funding through stablecoin bridging mechanisms, allowing developers to create solutions that facilitate cross-border payments and settlements, and fiat on/off ramps that work with traditional systems in a compliant way.

For DeFi developers looking to build applications that bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems, Spherenet provides the regulatory compliance, privacy, and stability required to attract institutional users.

C3 is closing down + Goodbye Airdrop,AlgorandOfficial,1fuo15f,2024-10-02 14:57:07,28,0.94,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlgorandOfficial/comments/1fuo15f/c3_is_closing_down_goodbye_airdrop/,cysec_,News/Media,"Source: [https://x.com/C3protocol/status/1841523606695641534](https://x.com/C3protocol/status/1841523606695641534)

Dear C3 Community,

It is with a heavy heart that we announce the closure of C3. After deep consideration and analysis, we have made the difficult decision to wind down the platform and cease all operations. This was not an easy choice, but we believe it is the right one given the current market realities and the challenges we have faced.

Our Vision and Technological Milestones

When we started C3, our vision was bold: to bridge the gap between centralized and decentralized exchanges by creating a truly non-custodial platform that upheld the highest standards of security and efficiency. We believed in the power of Algorand and its ability to meet the scalability needs of our platform. Our goal was to provide a decentralized alternative where users maintained full control over their assets—in stark contrast to many platforms that claim to be self-custodial while still holding full authority over user funds.

Technologically, C3 accomplished remarkable feats by combining multiple technologies to create the hands down the best chain-abstracted user experience in the market. From our complex cross-collateralization and portfolio margining features to pioneering a secure non-custodial infrastructure with a multi-layered security architecture, we pushed the limits of what is possible in Web3.

These accomplishments reflect our commitment to innovation and proof of crypto’s capacity to create a more inclusive financial future for everyone.

Challenges Faced

While we are proud of our technical achievements, the platform struggled to find a strong footing in terms of product-market fit. Our team's motivation and dedication have always been our strongest assets. Unlike many in the industry focused on superficial or speculative uses of crypto, we live the real solutions that crypto brings to the table every day. Bringing an inclusive financial future to the rest of the world has always been our biggest driver.

However, given the saturation of the exchange space and evolving consumer trends in crypto, it became clear that continuing to innovate in the DEX space was not an effective way for us to contribute to our true mission. We explored multiple pivots in our go-to-market strategy but faced challenges in improving user adoption and retention. We were preparing to build a V2 version but concluded that it still lacked the compelling value proposition needed to succeed. Given the crowded competition among the hundreds of DEXs that have launched, changes in market conditions, and continued regulatory uncertainty, we have decided to shut down C3.

Hindsight is 20/20

This journey has taught us valuable lessons:

The Importance of Community and Marketing We underestimated the significance of community and marketing in the Web3 space despite all the efforts we put into it. While we always knew they were absolutely critical, we believed a strong product would compensate for our lack of ""shilling"" skills. In hindsight, having a co-founder solely focused on community building and marketing would have been as vital as the product itself. Simply put, the best product not always wins because a product without a strong community is like a ship without a sail—it may be well-built, but it won’t reach its destination.

Embracing the 80/20 Rule

We neglected the golden principle of launching a simpler product earlier. Instead, we spent too much time perfecting complex features such as cross-collateralization and portfolio margining thinking they were a needed differentiator. Ironically, users didn’t engage much with the margin feature, and this overcomplication slowed us down, arguably delaying our launch by nearly a year. This decision proved costly as market conditions shifted, and we missed key opportunities to engage early adopters with a more streamlined product.

Understanding User Preferences

Users continue to value centralized exchanges. We thought that after events like the FTX collapse, the DEX market share would grow massively as everyone learned the lessons, but that did not happen. Users who value self-custody prefer swapping directly from their wallets for spot trading, avoiding the hassle of depositing into a platform. For more sophisticated needs, users seem to prefer actual centralized venues or, sometimes, Perp DEXs.

Messaging Complexity

Given how complex our offering was, it was challenging to effectively communicate our value proposition to users. C3’s amazing multichain experience enabled users from any blockchain using any wallet to access it. Moreover, beyond basic spot trading, we offered portfolio margining and an entire cross-chain borrowing and lending protocol for any possible need. This breadth of functionality made it difficult to convey our entire value proposition clearly.

Regulatory Uncertainty

Regulatory uncertainty affected not only us but also our backers—major trading firms that had to stop trading on-chain due to these uncertainties. This left us needing to find new ways to bootstrap liquidity, which proved challenging.

Shutdown Process

As we wind down, our priority is to ensure a responsible and orderly closure. We are committed to supporting our users and our amazing community during this process. Timeline: Starting today, we are giving all users two weeks to close all open orders, repay any outstanding borrow positions, and withdraw all funds.

Withdrawal-Only Mode: After this period, the platform will transition to a withdrawal-only mode, where the only functionality available will be to withdraw funds. This mode will remain active for several months to ensure everyone has ample time to retrieve their assets. Final Closure: Once all funds have been withdrawn, we will proceed with closing the platform entirely.

Virgin Score Goodbye Airdrop

We deeply regret leaving our community of early adopters empty-handed. To show our appreciation, we will be rewarding users with a Virgin Score over 10,000 with a goodbye airdrop of 600,000 PYTH tokens, distributed based on your score. 30% will be distributed equally and the remaining 70% distributed prorated based on your current Virgin Score. Note that all identified sybils will be excluded from the 30% distribution.

You will be able to claim this goodbye airdrop inside the Rewards page in the same way you have done in previous claiming weeks. We thank all the Pythian community for their consistent support to C3’s community.

Looking Forward

Despite these challenges, we stand proud of what we built and the lessons we learned. C3 may be closing, but the ideas and technology that powered it are already inspiring others’ innovation in the space. We are progressing discussions on a potential merger/exit path with interested parties, and we remain hopeful that our technology will find a new home to continue contributing to the Web3 ecosystem.

Thank you for being a part of this journey.

With gratitude,

The C3 Team"

[Zypto](https://zypto.com/) makes using cryptocurrencies easier, smoother and more intuitive, reducing the friction for entry and making existing users’ lives simpler by providing the most convenient solutions.

# Zypto App Features

The main pillars of Zypto’s All-in-One [Wallet App](https://zypto.com/app/) are:

* Extensive feature set 
* Emphasis on [security](https://zypto.com/blog/tutorials-and-information/basic-crypto-security/)
* User-centric design

As well as being a powerful [DeFi](https://zypto.com/blog/blockchain-industry/centralised-systems-in-the-blockchain-economy/) [wallet](https://zypto.com/wallet/defi-crypto-wallet-app/) app, Zypto stands out from the crowd as it provides users with practical real-world ways to use their cryptocurrencies. Here is a brief list of the main features in Zypto App:

# DeFi Wallets

Zypto is a fully [featured](https://zypto.com/blog/zypto-news/zypto-featured-in-top-african-blockchain-site/) [decentralised](https://zypto.com/blog/tutorials-and-information/demystifying-defi-a-beginners-guide-to-decentralised-finance/) wallet app, allowing users to import or create multichain [DeFi wallets](https://zypto.com/wallet/defi-crypto-wallet-app/) and operate with them on all supported [blockchains](https://zypto.com/blog/tutorials-and-information/crypto-bridges-the-technology-behind-interoperability-in-decentralized-finance/).

# CeFi Wallets

While we believe that self [custody](https://zypto.com/business/vault-wallets-custody/) is an essential part of the financial revolution that [blockchain](https://zypto.com/business/development/) makes possible, we also understand that for certain applications, [custodial](https://zypto.com/business/vault-wallets-custody/) wallets have great advantages. For this reason, Zypto App will soon also offer this option, bringing the speed and convenience of [CeFi](https://zypto.com/blog/blockchain-industry/centralised-systems-in-the-blockchain-economy/) to our wallet app.

# Buy and Sell Crypto

If you would like to move funds from your local currency into crypto, Zypto provides a multitude of options. Thanks to our [partnerships](https://zypto.com/blog/how-multi-billion-dollar-crypto-exchanges-were-built/) with Onramper and others, you can fund your [crypto wallet](https://zypto.com/blog/tutorials-and-information/a-step-by-step-guide-to-setting-up-a-cryptocurrency-wallet/) using the integrations with 19+ onramps and 130+ local payment methods, including credit and debit card, bank transfer (SEPA, amongst others), Google Pay, [Apple](https://zypto.com/blog/weekly-crypto-news/weekly-crypto-news-partnerships-ransomware-political-agenda/) Pay, Revolut Pay and many more.

Likewise, options are available to move your funds from the blockchain into your bank account or onto your card.

# Swap Crypto

The [Zypto Wallet](https://zypto.com/blog/tutorials-and-information/what-is-a-web3-wallet-and-how-does-it-work/) App makes it easier than ever to swap one [cryptocurrency](https://zypto.com/blog/crypto-success-stories/how-blockchain-adoption-transformed-businesses-stories-of-boom/) for another.

Apart from the ability to connect to [web3](https://zypto.com/business/development/) [dApps](https://zypto.com/blog/tutorials-and-information/demystifying-defi-a-beginners-guide-to-decentralised-finance/) with the in-app browser or with wallet connect by scanning a QR code, Zypto has taken crypto swaps a step further!

# Dex Integrations

Zypto is aware that using decentralised exchanges can be daunting for new users and inconvenient for experienced users. Therefore, instead of relying purely on dApps, Zypto has integrated multiple DEX directly into the user interface:

* [Uniswap](https://zypto.com/blog/blockchain-industry/decentralized-applications-dapps-what-you-need-to-know/) for [ETH](https://zypto.com/blog/blockchain-industry/ether-etf-and-fit21-approved-regulatory-crackdowns-and-cyber-breach-fines-shake-crypto-landscape/)
* Pancakeswap for BNB Chain
* More coming soon for Solana and others!

# Multichain Swaps

While decentralised exchanges are great for same-blockchain swaps, what if you want to [exchange](https://zypto.com/blog/blockchain-industry/the-next-generation-of-payment-technology-and-why-it-matters/) Bitcoin for [Ethereum](https://zypto.com/blog/tutorials-and-information/crypto-bridges-the-technology-behind-interoperability-in-decentralized-finance/) or [Stellar](https://zypto.com/blog/zypto-news/zypto-team-head-to-texas-for-consensus-2024/) for BNB, for example?  
  
Zypto has integrated ChangeNow for what is possibly the simplest, smoothest cross-chain swap experience ever created. Simply select what you want to swap from and to, regardless of the blockchain, confirm and in no time you’ll have the [coin](https://zypto.com/blog/tutorials-and-information/cryptocurrency-coins-vs-tokens-whats-the-difference/) or [token](https://zypto.com/zypto-token/) that you want.

# Pay with Crypto

Zypto’s mission to take crypto mainstream revolves around using crypto to pay for everyday goods and services. This is why the Zypto App offers an ever-growing selection of ways to spend your cryptocurrency.

# Prepaid Crypto Cards

One of the most convenient ways to [offramp](https://zypto.com/blog/zypto-news/zypto-app-and-onramper-team-up-to-make-buying-and-selling-crypto-easy/) and spend your crypto is by using prepaid cards. Zypto offers several different options:

* [Virtual Non-Reloadable Cards](https://zypto.com/personal/virtual-crypto-cards/)
   * Do not require a formal KYC. Redeemed from the issuer following purchase
   * Can be added to Google Pay or Apple Pay or used online
* [Reloadable Virtual Cards](https://zypto.com/personal/reloadable-virtual-cards/)
   * Quick KYC, 24 hour issuance. Reloadable 
   * Can be added to Google Pay or Apple Pay or used online
* [Physical Reloadable Cards](https://zypto.com/personal/physical-crypto-cards/)
   * KYC submitted to issuing bank
   * Broad geographic availability

# Gift Cards

Zypto offers a broad selection of [gift cards](https://zypto.com/personal/gift-cards-crypto/) to purchase with cryptocurrency. The Zypto App Gift Card Store, coming to the app very soon, will make accessing our fantastic range of [gift cards](https://zypto.com/personal/gift-cards-crypto/) easier and more convenient than ever.

# Bill Payments

If you’ve even thought about how convenient it would be to pay for your regular expenses directly in cryptocurrency, look no further! With [Zypto’s bill payments](https://zypto.com/personal/bill-payments-crypto/) service, it’s possible to [pay bills](https://zypto.com/blog/blockchain-industry/crypto-bill-payments-a-big-win-for-the-unbanked/) for over 21 thousand [companies](https://zypto.com/business/) in a variety of cryptocurrencies.

# Earn Rewards

The Zypto Wallet App is the first of its kind to offer a rewards and loyalty program, allowing you to [earn](https://zypto.com/blog/tutorials-and-information/from-rags-to-fortunes-the-success-stories-of-the-top-five-crypto-billionaires/) bonuses, discounts, [cashback](https://zypto.com/blog/zypto-news/welcome-to-zyptopia-the-ultimate-rewards-world/) and other perks when you use our products and services.

#  What is multisig?

Multisig wallet security is one of the most secure methods for storing crypto assets and interacting with the blockchain.

The name is short for 'multi signature' which is a method for securing [crypto assets](https://learn.backpack.exchange/articles/what-is-cryptocurrency-and-how-does-it-work) with multiple layers of security.

Multisig requires multiple [crypto wallet](https://learn.backpack.exchange/articles/what-is-a-crypto-wallet-and-how-to-choose-the-right-one) signatures to authorize a transaction, ensuring that no single wallet holder can authorize transactions independently. This method enhances security by distributing control across multiple devices.

>**Multisig helps protect against attacks as it ensures that no single wallet holder can authorize transactions independently. You must have all private keys in order to sign.**

‍Multisig requires more technical knowledge to set up and use however the added security benefits provide significant value for those with complex security needs (such as corporate treasuries or hyper security conscious individuals).

‍The most common multisig strategy is called '**2-of-3 multisig**' which involves **two separate cold storage hardware wallets** and **one hot wallet**.

https://preview.redd.it/zvhi0w6l6vkd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=c467efd9d4a3992da82e18132fe4363e48c32530

# Who uses multisig?

‍Multisig is often used by three main groups. This level of protection requires more technical knowledge to set up and use, however, the added security benefits provide significant value for those with complex security needs.

‍**Institutional Investors:** Where multiple parties need to approve transactions.

* **High Net-Worth Individuals:** To add an extra layer of security to their crypto holdings.
* **Security-Minded Users:** For those who want the highest level of security for their assets.

Benefits of Multisig:

‍There are multiple benefits to multisig, which makes this technique one of the industry standards for institutional grade security. 

‍**Enhanced Security:** If one key is compromised, the attacker still needs another key to perform any transactions, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

‍**Redundancy:** If one key is lost or inaccessible, the other two keys can still authorize transactions. This provides a safety net against the loss or theft of a single key.

‍‍**Fraud Prevention:** Requiring multiple approvals makes it more difficult for fraudulent transactions to occur, as it requires collusion between multiple parties.

What is the difference between cold storage hardware wallets and hot wallets?

‍**Cold storage hardware wallets are physical devices** which hold digital assets and are often *'air gapped'* from the internet.

‍Air gapped means that the device is completely isolated from network connections including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and USB.

* They boast numerous security functions which prevent physical attack vectors.

‍**Hot wallets are software based apps** accessed via web browser or on mobile and are designed to directly interact with blockchain products.

* Users typically utilize hot wallets to send and receive assets as well as sign transactions in web3 dApps.
* Hot wallets such as [Backpack Wallet](https://download.backpack.app/) offer extended native functions such as token swaps, multichain token bridging, token staking and access to different blockchain networks.

# What is 2-of-3 multsig?

‍***2-of-3 multisig*** is the most common deployment where users only need **2 private keys and 3 public keys** in order to access the assets and sign transaction.

‍Authorized user(s) must hold the private keys for each individual wallet involved in the multisig.

‍There are two common configurations for 2-of-3 multisig:

* Two cold storage hardware wallets and one hot wallet
* Three cold storage hardware wallets

‍For both of these configurations, two of the three designated wallets must approve a transaction before assets can be viewed or interacted with.

‍Multiple wallets and transactions must be successfully interacted with to access assets.

https://preview.redd.it/mc9txfsi6vkd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c5d2cb735936ea122bc96fac1ff48bf4e490bf6

# What is 3-of-3 multisig?

‍***3-of-3 multisig*** is the second most common deployment where users need **3 private keys and 3 public keys** in order to access the assets and sign transactions.

‍3-of-3 multisig requires all three designated keys to approve a transaction. This means that every transaction must be signed by three separate wallets.

‍Requiring approvals from each wallet designated during multisig setup is the key difference between 3-of-3 and 2-of-3.

‍There are two common configurations for 3-of-3 multisig:

* Two cold storage hardware wallets and one hot wallet
* Three cold storage hardware wallets

‍This setup ensures maximum security, an attacker would need to compromise all three hardware wallets to access the crypto assets.

‍[**Backpack Wallet**](https://download.backpack.app/BQcg/learn) users can utilize a combination of Ledger, [Trezor](https://learn.backpack.exchange/articles/what-is-the-trezor-hardware-wallet-crypto) and [Keystone](https://learn.backpack.exchange/articles/what-is-the-keystone-hardware-wallet) to set up 3-of-3 protection for their crypto assets. Backpack Wallet is the only Solana wallet to support multi-sig protection across the world's most trusted cold storage hardware providers. Just hook them up to Backpack Wallet and make your crypto experience more secure and seamless than ever.

# What are the risks of using multisig protection?

‍Multisig security setups are one of the most effective methods of protecting digital assets such as crypto and NFTs.

‍Multisig security is complex to configure and manage.

* It requires a high level of technical knowledge and losing private keys will make it difficult or impossible to access digital assets.
* If you lose just one private key in a 3-of-3 protection then you will lose access.

This model not only incentivizes long-term holding but also provides a reliable source of passive income, enhancing the overall value proposition for INFI token holders.

# Detailed Staking Terms: Period, Minimum, and Maximum INFI Amounts, Penalties for Early Unstaking

The staking terms for INFI tokens are structured to maximize benefits for participants while ensuring the stability and integrity of the ecosystem. Here are the key terms and conditions for staking INFI:

* **Staking Period:** The staking period is set at a maximum of 24 months. During this time, users’ tokens are locked, and they are eligible to receive passive income distributions.
* **Minimum and Maximum Amounts:** The minimum amount required to stake is 10 INFI tokens, making it accessible to a wide range of investors. The maximum amount that can be staked per wallet is 12,000 INFI tokens. This cap ensures a fair distribution of rewards and encourages broader participation across the community. If a user wants to stake more than 12,000 INFI, they must use an additional wallet.
* **Penalties for Early Unstaking:** To maintain the integrity of the staking mechanism and discourage premature withdrawal, a penalty is imposed on early unstaking. If a user decides to withdraw their staked tokens before the end of the 24-month period, a 50% penalty fee is deducted from the unstacked amount. The penalty fee is then directed into the ©SbSe Protocol Funding Pool, supporting the overall ecosystem.

# Monthly Profit Distribution Details: 60% in USDT and Bitcoin

One of the most important features of INFI’s staking mechanism is the monthly profit distribution. INFI token holders who stake their tokens are entitled to receive 60% of Inverted Investment’s monthly profits, distributed in a combination of USDT and Bitcoin. The distribution breakdown is as follows:

* **50% in USDT:** A significant portion of the profit distribution is paid out in USDT, providing stability and ease of use for token holders. USDT, being a stablecoin, offers a consistent value, making it an ideal choice for passive income payouts.
* **10% in Bitcoin:** The remaining portion of the profit distribution is paid out in Bitcoin, the premier cryptocurrency. This not only adds value to the passive income but also allows holders to benefit from the potential appreciation of Bitcoin over time.

# What is a DeFi Wallet ?

A DeFi wallet is a digital tool that allows you to store, manage, and interact with cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications (dApps) without relying on a centralized authority like a bank. Unlike traditional wallets, a DeFi wallet gives you full control over your funds and transactions because you alone hold the private keys, the cryptographic codes that provide access to your assets. This ensures that only you can authorize transactions, enhancing security and ownership.

DeFi wallets are designed to work seamlessly with a variety of dApps, enabling activities such as trading, lending, borrowing, and earning interest on crypto assets directly from the wallet. They are typically non-custodial, meaning the service providers do not hold your private keys or have access to your funds, reducing the risk of hacks and third-party mismanagement.

Using a DeFi wallet opens up financial opportunities that are often more accessible than traditional financial systems. With just an internet connection, anyone can participate in global financial markets, access financial services, and manage their wealth, making finance more inclusive and empowering individuals to take control of their financial destiny in a decentralized, transparent manner.

Cryptocurrency has swiftly gained traction, capturing the interest of investors worldwide. As digital currencies continue to evolve, they offer a fresh perspective on financial management, distinct from traditional finance systems. Unlike conventional finance, which often struggles with inefficiencies and centralization, cryptocurrency introduces a decentralized, transparent, and accessible alternative.

Investing strategically in cryptocurrency can provide substantial benefits, but it requires a careful selection of promising tokens. One such token that stands out is INFI, a utility token designed to offer sustainable profits and robust security. In this article, we’ll explore the rise of cryptocurrency, understand the associated risks and rewards, and delve into why INFI could be a valuable addition to your investment portfolio.

# The Rise of Cryptocurrency: A New Era of Financial Innovation

Cryptocurrency operates on the principles of decentralization, blockchain technology, and digital scarcity, fundamentally altering the financial landscape. Here’s a closer look at these core principles:

# Decentralization

Unlike traditional financial systems controlled by central authorities, cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks. This ensures that no single entity has control, fostering a more democratic financial environment.

# Blockchain Technology

Blockchain, the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies, is a secure and transparent ledger. Each transaction is recorded in a block and linked to previous transactions, creating an immutable chain. This transparency ensures trust and security, reducing the risk of fraud.

# Digital Scarcity

Many cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, have a fixed supply, creating digital scarcity. This scarcity can drive value, similar to precious metals like gold, making cryptocurrencies attractive as a store of value.

# Benefits of Crypto Over Traditional Finance

Cryptocurrencies offer several advantages over traditional financial systems:

* **Increased Transparency and Security:** Blockchain technology ensures all transactions are transparent and secure.
* **Faster and Cheaper Transactions:** Cryptocurrency transactions can be processed quickly and with lower fees compared to traditional banking systems.
* **Global Accessibility and Borderless Payments:** Cryptocurrencies can be accessed and used globally without the need for intermediaries or exchange rates.
* **Potential for Higher Returns:** Given their volatility and growth potential, cryptocurrencies can offer substantial returns on investment.

# Evolution of Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrencies have evolved significantly since Bitcoin’s inception in 2009. Major players like Bitcoin and Ethereum have paved the way, showcasing the potential of digital currencies. Beyond being a store of value, cryptocurrencies now support diverse applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), broadening their utility and appeal.

# Navigating the Cryptocurrency Landscape: Understanding the Risks and Rewards

Investing in cryptocurrency comes with its share of risks and rewards. Here’s what you need to know:

# Volatility

Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. Prices can fluctuate dramatically in short periods, which can be both an opportunity and a risk. It’s crucial to be prepared for this volatility and have a long-term investment perspective.

# Importance of Research

Thorough research is vital before investing in any cryptocurrency. Understanding the project fundamentals, team background, use cases, and market potential can help make informed investment decisions.

# Mitigating Risks

To mitigate risks, consider the following strategies:

* **Diversification:** Spread your investments across multiple cryptocurrencies to reduce exposure to any single asset.
* **Dollar-Cost Averaging:** Invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of the price, to average out the cost of your investments over time.
* **Understanding Project Fundamentals:** Invest in projects with solid fundamentals and a clear vision.

# Utility Tokens

Utility tokens offer functionalities beyond just price appreciation. They grant access to specific services within a blockchain ecosystem, adding intrinsic value to the token. This makes them a more strategic investment choice compared to purely speculative assets.

# Why INFI Could Be Your Strategic Cryptocurrency Investment

INFI, a utility token at the core of the Inverted Investments ecosystem, presents a compelling investment opportunity. Here’s why:

# Profit Sharing

INFI’s unique profit-sharing model ensures that a significant portion (60%) of Inverted Investments’ monthly profits are distributed to INFI holders. This model incentivizes participation and rewards investors. Profits are distributed in a stable format: 50% USDT and 10% Bitcoin, providing both security and growth potential.

* **INFI Wallet:** Securely stores INFI tokens, other cryptocurrencies, and fiat currency, and allows earning monthly passive income in USDT.
* **Wear-to-Earn Metaverse Game:** An exciting play-to-earn game that blends real-world functionality with a virtual world.
* **INFI Blockchain and Stablecoin:** Built on decentralization, security, and speed, with low transaction fees and fast processing times.

# WEB4 Integration

INFI is poised to benefit from the revolutionary WEB4 concept, which aims to create seamless connections between blockchains, financial institutions, and various industries. This integration has the potential to streamline financial services and make them more accessible, positioning INFI at the forefront of this financial innovation.

# Comparison with Other Cryptocurrencies

Multichain explorers and their importance,CryptoTechnology,1epqnld,2024-08-11 13:40:20,9,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/1epqnld/multichain_explorers_and_their_importance/,serejandmyself,,"I would like to raise a discussion about what has been the focus of my work over the past year. A multichain explorer. 

If we were to make an assumption, that for ""adoption"" ""usage"" ""etc."" to happen, would mean a lot more users (as a result apps, devs, lambos, etc). THis points to an interesting point. No matter what type of blockchain is going to make it, one of this is certain - users will need wallets and explorers. ""Adoption"" will/must/should happen here.

If we look at the development of wallets, we went from a blockchain specific wallet desktop software, to - more usable UI and wallets first, then multi ecosystem wallets, and finally multichain wallets, with further ongoing development (account abstractions, etc).

Explorers, on the other hand, didn't really make it past multi ecosystem. It's either Cosmos, Polkadot, Ethereum focused. 

To my knowledge, there is 1 (quite old and well known) multichain explorer out there that attempts to really show both POW and POS networks. 

Here is my question / rationale:

- Can explorers become multichain (blockchain agnostic) without losing credibility / information

- How do explorers do what wallets did and go from ""electron"" to ""trust""? It seems the logical answer is to stop making explores so technical focused and make them simpler. 

- Outdated advertising models are not a place for web3 adoption? What models can be adopted by such tools, if they are to remain free

- Why aren't today's explorers facing the obvious issues, such as contributing to further worsening of stake distribution by implementing inappropriate UI and using misleading terms, such as ""inactive validators"" (in essence they are all active, those outside the top, don't receive rewards), etc

I guess its worth noting that I am involved with building such a tool and my main reason to collect as much as possible to discuss and opinions is research for my work. Hope its not an issue."
Arcana Network Redefining Multichain Access with Next-Gen Chain Abstraction,CryptoCurrencyClassic,1epdd5m,2024-08-11 01:41:41,3,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyClassic/comments/1epdd5m/arcana_network_redefining_multichain_access_with/,Cupidmove,,"Arcana Network is pioneering a user-centric approach with its Chain Abstraction Protocol, designed to eliminate the complexities associated with managing assets and gas fees across an ever-growing number of blockchains. Arcana’s mission is to create a seamless multichain experience, allowing users from any blockchain ecosystem to interact effortlessly with various networks.

Arcana’s product design philosophy has consistently focused on simplifying Web3 interactions. It started with Arcana Auth, which introduced wallet abstraction through its MPC-based Embedded Wallets as a Service SDK. Following this, Arcana introduced its Gasless SDK to eliminate the need for users to deal with gas fees through Account Abstraction. The latest innovation, Arcana’s Chain Abstraction Protocol, takes this philosophy further by abstracting the intricacies of multiple blockchains.

Key Solutions Offered by Arcana Network’s Chain Abstraction, Powered by a Modular Layer 1
Arcana Network addresses three major challenges through its Chain Abstraction protocol:

1. Unified User Experience:
Arcana provides users with a unified balance that aggregates assets across multiple chains, allowing them to start using their existing wallets and assets without hassle. Users can instantly spend their balances on any chain, without the need to switch or add chains manually. Additionally, Arcana abstracts away the need to hold gas tokens specific to any chain, and supports all types of wallets, ensuring a smooth experience without requiring users to navigate steep learning curves.

2. Developer-Friendly Environment:
Arcana’s protocol simplifies the developer experience by eliminating the need to chase liquidity or users across different chains. Developers can choose chains based on their technical and business requirements, without facing the burden of complex integrations or high-commitment setups. The streamlined process allows developers to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure.

3. Enhanced Capital Efficiency:
Arcana’s protocol enhances capital efficiency by utilizing existing liquidity on the user’s target chain, reducing the need for unnecessary bridging transactions. The network employs netting before rebalancing to improve capital efficiency, which benefits all stakeholders by generating real yield for token holders, liquidity providers (LPs), and solvers. Arcana also ensures seamless support for new chains and tokens, making it easier for LPs and solvers to participate

Arcana’s Modular Layer 1: The Backbone of Chain Abstraction
Arcana’s Chain Abstraction is powered by its Modular Layer 1, a decentralized network of nodes with several key capabilities:

State Machine: Tracks and maintains the state of each user’s account, including balances, spends, and unrealized collections. This helps present users with an accurate and unified balance across all chains.

Distributed Key Generation (DKG): A truly decentralized key management system where multiple nodes participate in creating and storing key shards, eliminating single points of failure.

MPC-TSS (Multi-Party Computing with Threshold Signatures): Performs conditional threshold signatures based on checks such as whether the user has sufficient funds to execute a transaction

Netting: Tracks all user transactions and liquidity positions, allowing the network to issue netted rebalancing instructions to LPs and solvers.

Arcana Vault: Smart contracts deployed on individual chains that hold liquidity for supported tokens and gas tokens. These vaults provide liquidity to clients, sweep funds from users, and verify transaction signatures, ensuring that requests originate from the correct user.

Arcana Network’s innovations are setting the stage for a more accessible and efficient blockchain ecosystem, where users and developers can engage without the complexities that have traditionally hindered broader adoption.

A Brief Explanation of AggLayer,0xPolygon,1ekxf97,2024-08-05 15:56:17,19,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/0xPolygon/comments/1ekxf97/a_brief_explanation_of_agglayer/,002_timmy,Discussion,"# Aggregated Blockchains: A New Thesis

tl;dr:

* The unified bridge for AggLayer is live
* Monolithic → Modular → Aggregated
* Aggregation synthesizes the benefits of both integrated (monolithic) and modular architectures using ZK technology
* The AggLayer brings uniform cryptographic security and atomic composability across aggregated chains *without sacrificing sovereignty*
* Devs can connect any L1 or L2 chain to the AggLayer, building a Web3 network that feels like a single chain with unified liquidity and practically unlimited scalability

https://preview.redd.it/0rf7u5vihwgd1.png?width=1352&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9cf6578883de50d9259aa796495e3c88671e03c

https://preview.redd.it/197cmsfkhwgd1.png?width=1352&format=png&auto=webp&s=62fdea575d0b8001f4529a3c25e4ed2ae4a44de7

Blockchains today don’t look or feel like the Internet. Instead of a unified, highly scalable network, users face scaling limitations and bad UX due to fragmented liquidity and state. Unfortunately, the ever-increasing list of new chains being launched has compounded the problem. This environment is reminiscent of the pre-Internet era, siloed and lacking interoperability. We need to do better.

To solve these challenges, Polygon Labs researchers and engineers have designed the aggregation layer, a novel solution to unify the whole of Web3. **Like the invention of TCP/IP, which created a seamlessly unified Internet, the aggregation layer, or AggLayer, unites a divided blockchain landscape into a web of ZK-secured L1 and L2 chains that feels like a single chain.** 

The AggLayer is a decentralized protocol that does two things:

1. It aggregates ZK proofs from all connected chains.
2. It ensures **safety** for near-instant \[atomic\] cross-chain transactions.

If you want an early in-the-weeds technical explainer to understand how the AggLayer will work, [read the documentation here](https://docs.polygon.technology/learn/agglayer/).

The AggLayer is the next evolutionary step of blockchain design, improving on the currently prevailing approaches, namely monolithic and modular.

# AggLayer, live 

Today, the first essential components of the AggLayer are live. Right now, the only protocol connected is Polygon zkEVM, while other chains are working to plug into the AggLayer soon. This is just the first step toward an aggregated blockchain network that will, when complete, enable near-instant, secure chain-to-chain transactions. 

The live components of the AggLayer that Polygon zkEVM has connected to are: 

* A unified bridge to Ethereum, enabling cross-chain transactions
* A bridgeAndCall() library of solidity contracts to help craft these transactions

From the perspective of Ethereum, all rollups are simply smart contracts holding a state root with a bunch of assets, plus a verifier that says what can go in and out. In a normal multichain L2 ecosystem, there are *many* bridges to Ethereum—a bridge for every chain. That means that even in “unified” multichain L2 ecosystems, to transfer assets between chains, without using a third-party bridging service, requires a withdrawal to Ethereum—which, in the case of an optimistic chain, requires a seven-day delay.

The AggLayer’s unified bridge, live today, changes this: There is only a *single* bridge contract on Ethereum for all connected chains. Where we see a multiplicity, Ethereum will see a single contract. Each chain will have a local copy of the unified bridge root, enabling cross-chain transactions that don’t require withdrawing to Ethereum or the security risks of third-party bridges.

This early AggLayer release also contains a bridgeAndCall() Solidity library, which means developers can program logic that executes calls on a different chain. Not only can users transfer assets between chains (bridge), but they can also trigger contracts on a different chain after the asset has arrived (call). 

So putting this together, what can actually be done with AggLayer this early? 

A user on soon-to-be-connected AggChain1 who holds DAI can buy an NFT on Polygon zkEVM, without having to first bridge funds to Polygon zkEVM. From the end user’s perspective, this will *feel* like using a single chain. Initially, there will be high latency. But as the AggLayer evolves, its singular goal is to lower that latency as much as possible, with future iterations of the AggLayer later this year dropping the time substantially, and an end state of near-instant cross-chain transactions. The point is that with the AggLayer, users can interact with dApps without needing to know that they are accessing another chain.

The bridgeAndCall() feature enables users to send assets and then participate in activity on another chain. Let’s say Alice is an Ethereum user and sees a character’s skin on a gaming chain built with Polygon CDK that she wants to buy—and she wants to buy it first by swapping ETH to MATIC on Polygon zkEVM because it has deeper liquidity than the Polygon CDK chain. 

Alice can bridge to Polygon zkEVM, perform a swap, and then purchase the skin on the gaming chain—all in one transaction. From Alice’s perspective, this would feel simple, like a single environment. 

This is only the beginning. But it is an important beginning. These first components are the necessary underpinning for the rest of the work to follow. The AggLayer is the next evolutionary step of blockchain design, improving on the currently prevailing approaches, namely monolithic and modular.

# Monolithic → Modular → Aggregated

https://preview.redd.it/6akvxz6thwgd1.png?width=4056&format=png&auto=webp&s=75ccc8e3133d76cbd6e5ca28ad9e1348fc37e709

A quick tour of the history of blockchain architecture shows the need to evolve towards aggregated blockchains. 

In the beginning, there were the monoliths (i.e., integrated chains).

Monolithic chains run with nodes responsible for consensus, data availability, and execution, and they also serve as a settlement layer. Such an ecosystem is unified and interoperable by design; however, it has fundamental limits. Those limits come in the way of scalability, security, and decentralization tradeoffs. As scalability increases, the hardware requirements for validators increase, resulting in greater centralization and less security. Even the most efficient chains eventually result in state bloat (storing too much data) and state contention (processing too many transactions that touch the same state), which means performance degrades over time. In addition, monolithic chains do not offer meaningful customizability or sovereignty for ecosystem participants. 

To address these challenges, devs began to tinker with modular architectures, and for good reason: a modular framework solves a ton of problems inherent to monolithic systems. Modularity results in many chains running independently and in parallel, each maintaining sovereignty. It allows for much higher scalability and multiplicity of chain design—from VMs to decentralization to privacy profiles.

But modularity alone, as an evolution from monolithic chains, leads to fragmentation across liquidity and users; it creates multi-chain ecosystems that either require awkward and inefficient bridging, or sacrificing chain sovereignty.

There will be no mass adoption with siloed liquidity and users.

**The solution to the monolithic-versus-modular dilemma is a new category of blockchain design: Aggregation.**

**Aggregation offers the sovereignty and scale of modular architectures, as well as the unified liquidity and UX of a monolithic system, synthesizing these two approaches into something novel.**

# AggLayer Advantages

As a central component of Polygon 2.0, the AggLayer will use ZK proofs to create a seamless, aggregated environment that *feels* like a single chain–even as each chain in the ecosystem remains sovereign. 

This enables near-instant, atomic transactions, unifies liquidity across the ecosystem, creates capital efficiency, and dramatically improves UX.

* **For L1s and L2s connected to AggLayer**: Maintain full sovereignty but also get to tap into a huge pool of unified liquidity, making it easy to bootstrap liquidity.

* **For dApp developers**: Reach users in aggregate. Even if your dApp is on a different chain, users from other chains will be able to interact with it, without cumbersome bridging UX. Seamless cross-chain transactions mean true growth and access to users of the aggregated network. 
* ‍**For end users**: UX that is like the Internet. A single environment that doesn’t require cumbersome and frequent bridging.

**In the end state of AggLayer, end users will be able to execute cross-chain atomic transactions in < 1 second.**

# What’s next?

Now that the first component of the AggLayer is live, developers at Polygon Labs are focused on bringing all other components of the AggLayer. The next iteration, expected later this year, will be focused entirely on increasing the speed of finality + the synchronizer, to run messages between chains as fast as possible. 

Excited to learn more? In the next few weeks, we’ll have deep dives into the most important components of the AggLayer, including: proof aggregation, optimistic confirmations, and atomic cross-chain transactions.

How To Make A Passive Income Staking $DYOR,BookOfDYOR_CRYPTO,1ek1zux,2024-08-04 14:21:58,4,1.0,5,https://v.redd.it/aevr75y5wogd1,Book_of_DYOR,,"Book of $DYOR is set to be the first ever Omnichain Memecoin Launchpad that will allow users to seamlessly launch Memecoins across multi chains at the click of a button. 

Projects that have already launched on a specific chain will be able to relaunch their Token across multiple chains to give their project access to new chains and more liquidity. 

$DYOR holders that STAKE their $DYOR, will receive daily AIRDROPS of USDT or USDC to their wallet. The rewards will be based off of the % of tokens you stake and the period you stake for. I

It’s a very simple model, the more $DYOR you stake and the longer you stake for, the more $ you make.  

We are giving 70% of the revenue generated by our Launchpad back to our STAKERS. 

That’s right 70%!! 😵🥳🤯

So for example, if we make a Million Dollars in revenue, our holders/stakers will get 70% of that which is 700K. 🥳🤯
