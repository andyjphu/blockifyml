I wanted to say thank you to everyone who has chatted with me so far, I look forward to talking to more ppl and learning from ya‚Äôll into the new year. 

Oh, and I asked Santa for 1$ SKL in 2025 and he said yes. "

Supports are at .05 and .045. Cycle low AVWAP is currently sitting at .0560 which will be our next battle as it was a few weeks ago. If you‚Äôre a long term holder, now‚Äôs the time."

As far as technicals for now, the main support I have is the .0570-.0560 area. It has been very strong but if that breaks down then I‚Äôd have to re-evaluate this on the shorter time horizon."

My TA on SKALE,SKALEnetwork,1hcx0tc,2024-12-12 17:17:20,12,1.0,7,https://i.redd.it/lqdt0g8osh6e1.jpeg,FuturesAce,,"I‚Äôm a technical trader that owns SKALE on Coinbase and is holding SKALE on leverage with Blofin as well. 

What I‚Äôm seeing here is a nice 50% fib buy from most recent major low to high. The 2 white lines we are currently selling off of are Anchored VWAPs. The more important one is the higher one at .0720 which is the AVWAP from the .1360 high back in March. If you aren‚Äôt using AVWAP‚Äôs I highly recommend researching and using them. If we cross .072 I think we test .085 again which has been a tough resistance many times over, however, with strong resistance comes strong support. If we cross that .085 mark, I think it‚Äôs straight to .10-.11 very quickly which we will be met with resistance again. 

The retest of .085 after crossing it will be my add to my leverage position. I think we could see .0625-0.645 again before going higher but we don‚Äôt necessarily need to get the buyers in here. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking right now, let me any thoughts in the comments."

This requires ISO20022 compliance in order to use MX messages aka XML data. This will also include debt management and tokenization of real world assets.

üöÄ **SKALE‚Äôs Promise to Revolutionize Crypto**

Built on **Ethereum**, SKALE tackles two of blockchain‚Äôs biggest challenges: **high fees** and **slow speeds**. With **fast, free transactions** and **unlimited scalability**, SKALE aims to reshape how dApps and NFTs operate.

üí° **Key price predictions:**

* **2025**: $0.073
* **2040**: $28 üöÄ

SKALE‚Äôs approach as a ""helper"" to Ethereum, rather than a competitor, makes it stand out. While many projects aim to replace Ethereum, SKALE‚Äôs focus on solving scalability could position it as a critical player in blockchain‚Äôs evolution, especially as the NFT and dApp markets grow.

But is this enough to push SKALE into the top tier of cryptos? Or are we overestimating its potential?

Navigating the Cosmic Waves: A Trend Analysis of SKALE (SKL) in the Cryptocurrency Universe  
  
Abstract  
  
In the vast galaxy of cryptocurrencies, SKALE (SKL) emerges as a beacon of scalability for Ethereum's congested network, promising zero-gas-fee transactions through its modular blockchain constellation. This analysis ventures into the trend-following cosmos of SKL, exploring its price trajectory from launch to its current orbit as of October 2024. Employing a myriad of technical indicators like moving averages and RSI, alongside a sentiment analysis extracted from the chatter on platforms like X, we chart SKL's journey through the market's ebbs and flows. We delve into how SKL's promise of enhanced scalability influences its market trends, investor sentiment, and potential for parabolic ascents or corrective descents. This study not only aims to forecast SKL's potential price milestones, like the fabled $10 mark, but also humorously critiques the human endeavor of predicting celestial market movements in the ever-expanding universe of digital currencies. Herein lies a tale of numbers, trends, and the relentless human spirit to find patterns in the randomness of crypto-space.

**News Article**

After hitting historic lows during the bear market, popular meme token Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced a sudden increase in popularity, reaching a 24-hour trading volume of $528 million. This resurgence can be attributed to social media influencers and communities rallying behind SHIB, driving renewed interest in the asset. Despite being known primarily as a meme coin, the Shiba Inu community aims to build an entire decentralized ecosystem around the token, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized applications (dApps), and even physical merchandise. As the Shiba Inu ecosystem continues to evolve, analysts predict that its influence and relevance in the broader cryptocurrency landscape will continue to expand.

Bitcoin have crossed the 50000USD mark today with other cryptos following, many of it have already made the moves but i believe there are still some of them we can bet on. The list below are some that have the potential to atleast give a good return if the bullish momentum in the Bitcoin remains. The analysis is based on monthly chart.

01. **JASMY/USDT**

Currently trading at 0.0145 USDT. Breakout was at 0.0066 USDT, made  a  higher low and a higher high, already outperforming BTC in daily timeframe and started outperforming in the weekly too. With the breakout the nearest supply zone is at 0.035 USDT. 

&#x200B;

02. **ADA/USDT (CARDANO)**

The price action is not ideal, the low made in the swing was lower than the previous but the breakout is beautifully clean. Currently price is at 0.59 USDT, nearest supply zone is at 1.14 USDT. If the price breaches the point then it can go upto 2.76 USDT. It is outperforming BTC in the monthly timeframe, that is a sign of long run.

&#x200B;

03. **HBAR/USDT**

A clean breakout with lower and higher high, trading at 0.11 USDT, outperformance in the  daily timeframe only but on the basis price movement I believe it is a good pick.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xugp2mfjq5kc1.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1e55acd5c29611f8c412925d786a3327a150d12

04. **SKL/USDT**

**PS**:- The cryptos mentioned above are very small in market cap. Hence, a proper target on the price will be better than riding on hope, when BTC will turn these small market cap cryptos are the first to crash. So it will be better to keep an eye on the price and exit when the target hits. "

Binance is criminally charged with breaking sanctions and money-transmitting laws. The exchange agrees to a historic $4.3 billion settlement, marking one of the largest penalties obtained by the U.S. from a corporate defendant. Founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) pleads guilty, agreeing to pay a $50 million fine and step down as CEO. Richard Teng, a former Abu Dhabi regulator, is set to replace CZ. The charges against Binance include failures in maintaining an anti-money laundering program, operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, and violating sanctions laws. This landmark case signals increased regulatory scrutiny in the crypto industry, prompting a significant net outflow of over $950 million within 24 hours and raising questions about Binance's future operations in the U.S. market.

### Ethereum Layer-2 Project Blast Sparks Controversy and Excitement

In the Ethereum ecosystem, the upcoming Layer-2 blockchain, Blast, scheduled for launch in March, has ignited both excitement and controversy. Despite scepticism from some corners of the crypto community, Blast has attracted over $225 million in staked ether and stablecoins within a few days. The protocol, led by the pseudonymous u/PacmanBlur and backed by notable entities like Paradigm and ""eGirl Capital,"" aims to incorporate native staking and generate yield through ether staking and real-world assets. However, questions arise about the invite mechanism, with some likening it to a pyramid scheme. As the Blast project unfolds, it adds another layer of intrigue to Ethereum's ongoing efforts to address scalability challenges.

### Uniswap's UNI Token Surges Amid Governance Proposal

Uniswap's governance token, UNI, has taken the spotlight with a remarkable rally of over 13% within the last 24 hours, outpacing its peers. The surge in UNI's value lacks a clear catalyst, but market analysts suggest a potential connection to a proposal submitted by StableLab, a governance service provider. The proposal seeks to delegate a substantial 10 million UNI from the decentralised autonomous organisation's (DAO) treasury to underrepresented delegates. As the crypto community eagerly awaits the on-chain vote on this proposal, Uniswap's positive momentum underscores the influence of governance decisions on token dynamics within decentralised exchanges.

### Bitcoin: Latest developments

Bitcoin has recently surged past the $38,000 mark, demonstrating resilience amidst a complex market environment. The upward trajectory, marked by a recent 5.76% increase to $38,420, unfolds against the backdrop of thin holiday trading and a strengthening dollar. Notably, Bitcoin's positive momentum persists despite the uncertainty surrounding Vivek Ramaswamy's proposal to deregulate digital currencies, a move that has sparked concerns within the crypto community.

Market dynamics, influenced by US and Japanese holidays and a fluctuating dollar, initially favoured the greenback due to unexpected drops in unemployment benefit claims. However, Bitcoin defied the odds, experiencing positive momentum as improved market sentiment overshadowed the dollar's comeback. This divergence highlights Bitcoin's growing influence in the broader financial system.

The crypto community closely monitors Ramaswamy's proposal, which aims to significantly diminish the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and liberalise the cryptocurrency industry. Despite industry concerns about sweeping deregulation, the market sentiment has surprisingly improved, possibly influenced by financial backing from prominent figures in the crypto space.

### Bitcoin: Analysis

Bitcoin's recent surge to over $38,420, following Binance's settlement and amid regulatory debates, suggests a robust investor confidence. The settlement has positively impacted the broader CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), witnessing gains in other major [cryptocurrencies](https://www.iconomi.com/cryptocurrencies) like Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Chainlink (LINK). Speculation arises that the Binance settlement might pave the way for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve a U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), contributing to the sustained positive sentiment.

https://preview.redd.it/dzq7fsrxna2c1.png?width=2932&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3e08367025707ba4c6687c0363c195c12d61724

In terms of technical analysis, Bitcoin's current price of $37,388 positions it just above the key pivot point of $37,175. The immediate resistance levels at $38,040, and $38,700 indicate potential hurdles, while strong support levels at $36,035, and $35,215 provide a safety net. Technical indicators, including the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), suggest a cautiously bullish sentiment.

https://preview.redd.it/9g0drns6oa2c1.png?width=2466&format=png&auto=webp&s=00c5edde3e80c9b069c247ff7f8d854ddeb7fd84

In conclusion, Bitcoin's resilience, positive market sentiment, and technical indicators point towards a cautiously bullish trend. Traders may consider a buying strategy if Bitcoin maintains its position above the pivot point, with a watchful eye on resistance levels for potential profit-taking opportunities. Conversely, a dip below the pivot point could signal a selling strategy. In the short term, Bitcoin is anticipated to test the resistance at $37,630, with the potential for further upward movement if it successfully navigates these levels.

### The News From Planet Ruby‚ÄîFriday, July 28, 2023

*One of the leading Earth technologists, the ape known as Elon, has once again proved a staunch supporter of decentralized systems. He has already done more for the adoption of cryptocurrencies than any other human.*

*Now, his ambition is to decentralize social media, by driving users away from his ""X"" platform to as many competitors as possible. We await his next move with intense curiosity.*

## Has The Fed Threaded The Needle?

As things stand, the Fed seems to have achieved its near impossible aim of bringing down inflation without crushing the economy. However, the Soft Landing is in jeopardy. We don't know how, only that one of the most reliable indicators in existence is sounding its klaxon.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/paabmfh2xpeb1.png?width=542&format=png&auto=webp&s=a51335725147333738532e59c5ecbd814ed9a15a)

Elon Musk continues his plans to destroy/upgrade Twitter/X (delete as appropriate) by turning it into a WeChat-style ""Everything App"" that will include payments. X could, he says‚Äîif ""done right""‚Äîaccount for half of the world's financial system. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/1mygfis4xpeb1.png?width=542&format=png&auto=webp&s=9aff4c96a24c912370b03c17079066a9072e59f3)

Wednesdays FOMC meeting provided precisely zero surprises. The committee raised the headline interest rate by 25 bps to 525-550, which was expected with 99% confidence by the market. Accordingly, risk assets like stocks and bitcoin barely batted an eyelid.

## Bitcoin Feels The Squeeze

Having closed last week just above $30,000, bitcoin promptly dropped $1,000 into its long-term support zone. While this seems a significant move in dollar terms, the market is showing low volatility and low trading volumes. Bollinger Bands on the weekly timeframe have narrowed to historic levels. This suggests that a large move is on the horizon, though whether that's up or down cannot be known in advance.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/vctvrk47xpeb1.png?width=542&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfd7ba11afd1b20e57c747df5140098c23e53f46)

The [Fear and Greed Index](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/) is neutral (52), and not even Jay Pow could convince BTC to wake up. [$16 million in bids](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-28k-plunge-btc-price-new-volatility) was positioned just below $28,000 on Binance, poised to take advantage of any Fed-induced crash. It wasn't tapped, though that could be about to change as bitcoin is heading lower, currently changing hands around the $29,100 level and sat on the 50-day moving average.

Altcoins have begun to stir, following the partial victory for Ripple, but even that is muted. Bitcoin Dominance is down 2% from its high above 50% a month ago.

## 1984 Calls

Price action has been relatively quiet but there have been some big developments in the crypto world. The Sam Altman-backed [Worldcoin project formally launched](https://www.rexwire.net/worldcoin-the-audacious-crypto-startup-eyeing-global-transformation/), ushering in a world of eyeball-scanning AI-powered surveillance that could make 1984 look like the Wild West.

Dogecoin saw some action on the back of Elon's move to rebrand Twitter as X, but there is (as yet) no suggestion that cryptocurrencies might prove a meaningful part of his plan to turn the social network into a financial super-app.

A couple of weeks back, Standard Chartered stunned the crypto space by predicting that bitcoin would hit $120,000 by the end of 2024. It turns out that options markets are not nearly so optimistic. Futures markets estimate the [possibility of ATH by June 2024](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/standard-chartered-bitcoin-prediction-defies-options-traders/?utm_campaign=) at around 1%. Meanwhile a survey of 29 financial experts have offered an average figure of around [$40k by year end](https://finbold.com/29-finance-experts-set-btc-price-for-the-end-of-2023/).

SKALE is Melding the Best of Blockchain Layers for Enhanced Scalability and Customization,SKALEnetwork,14zem0i,2023-07-14 08:03:25,6,0.88,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SKALEnetwork/comments/14zem0i/skale_is_melding_the_best_of_blockchain_layers/,Mod-Mod13,,"[ ](https://preview.redd.it/y918e2gq7xbb1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=930fa241a1e0f99eae6279fa569c424c6233425e)

In the continually evolving blockchain landscape, new players and cutting-edge technologies keep emerging, aiming to solve the perennial challenge of blockchain ‚Äì marrying scalability with security. Today, we shine the spotlight on the SKALE Network, a pioneer offering a revolutionary architecture that expertly melds the robustness of Layer 1 solutions with the efficiency of Layer 2 solutions. Additionally, each SKALE Chain serves as a distinctive App-chain, enabling unparalleled customization and horizontal scaling.

But before we dive in, let's decode the blockchain layers.

## Unraveling the Blockchain Layers: From Core to Scalability and Beyond¬†

In the realm of blockchain technology, the terminology of ""layers"" often pops up. So, let's demystify them.

#### Layer 1: The Settlement Layer

This is the core blockchain protocol, handling the recording, verification, and storage of transactions. Despite their robust security, Layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin grapple with scalability issues due to their inherent design.

#### Layer 2: The Scalability Layer

Layer 2 is like a jetpack for a Layer 1 blockchain. Its mission is to scale up the transactional capacity and slash associated costs. Although it can significantly enhance transactional throughput and efficiency, it does so at the expense of centralization, data availability, and computational power.

#### Layer 3: The Application Layer

The new kid on the blockchain block, Layer 3, facilitates customization of the underlying blockchain infrastructure. But while it offers impressive scalability and features, it suffers from being weakly-trusted.

## Enter SKALE: The Hybrid Layer Powerhouse

Unlike standard blockchain networks that strictly operate as either Layer 1 or Layer 2 solutions, [SKALE Network presents a unique hybrid architecture](https://skale.space/blog/modular-skale-chains-and-the-new-hub). It allows each SKALE Chain to function as a base layer (Layer 1) and yet built atop a Layer 1 blockchain (providing security and validator-node orchestration). This means **SKALE Chains can swiftly process transactions with the efficiency of Layer 2 solutions and simultaneously benefit from the robust security offered by Ethereum, a Layer 1 solution characteristic.**

This groundbreaking blend mitigates the usual compromise between security and scalability experienced in conventional blockchain networks. And as an icing on the cake, SKALE Network even offers the customization and features promised by Layer 3 Blockchain-as-a-service via App-chains and Hub-chains.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/e3uwuprt7xbb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=197e0c4478446d5fa65fa57447bc69ac63a6b945)

## Redefining Blockchain Customization: SKALE's App-Chains and Hub-Chains

**SKALE's architecture brings two trailblazing concepts to the table - App-chains and Hub-chains**. App-chains are SKALE Chains tailored for a specific application, while Hub-chains are designed for an ecosystem of applications or needs. They offer shared customization and facilitate inter-chain communication and transactions, providing a shared infrastructure for related hubs or applications.

This diverges from the one-size-fits-all approach prevalent in blockchain networks. Developers can now choose how to serve the unique needs of their dapp and its user community, promising fast, efficient, and predictable performance.

## The Enterprise Edge with SKALE's App-Chains

For enterprises, the App-chain model offers significant advantages. It allows for the creation of permissioned or permissionless blockchains tailored to an enterprise's specific needs. This could be invaluable for applications that require high levels of control and security, like supply chain or CRM services.

Additionally, the ability to customize the chain parameters can enable higher performance, as enterprises can choose an optimized routing infrastructure for their use case. Also, each App-chain operates independently of others, ensuring consistent performance, even under high load.

## The SKALE Revolution: A Leap Forward in Blockchain Technology

**SKALE, with its innovative amalgamation of Layer 1 and Layer 2 characteristics and its unique App-chain model, offers developers a secure, scalable, and customizable platform for application development.** This leap in blockchain technology enables developers to create applications that can meet user needs more effectively, marking a significant stride in the evolution of blockchain applications.

Stay tuned with us as we continue to explore more exciting developments in the blockchain universe. Happy developing!

DeFi Needs to Do These 3 Things to Reach Its Full Potential and Impact the Masses,SKALEnetwork,14m53n7,2023-06-29 09:30:21,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SKALEnetwork/comments/14m53n7/defi_needs_to_do_these_3_things_to_reach_its_full/,Mod-Mod13,,"&#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/za7u4bynly8b1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=467b12571b0077afacf9c261772351569e6e05d8)

DeFi needs to start doing three things well. And guess what? Advanced derivatives. Curve trading, and flash loans are not on the the shortlist. Those are all sophisticated financial instruments that DeFi investors can use to creatively invest their crypto assets outside the traditional banking system.  


Still, what about somebody who just wants to buy an item in their favorite Web3 game?  


It‚Äôs tempting to over-complicate things. All too often, new DeFi projects seem fixated on offering novel (and increasingly complicated) financial services to a small niche of elite finance pros.¬†  


But just because the blockchain is a novel technology doesn‚Äôt mean DeFi products have to be complex. To use a basketball analogy, the DeFi space is taking a lot of 3-pointers ‚Ä¶ and struggling to make its layups. And until we start making the layups, we won‚Äôt see DeFi impacting the masses.¬†  


**DeFi will start reaching its potential and impacting the lives of millions once it can easily help beginner users do these things well:**  


1. **Store digital assets safely**
2. **Earn with digital assets securely**
3. **Swap and trade digital assets effectively**  


None of these are advanced offerings. Yet they speak to the basic needs of the vast majority of crypto‚Äôs nearly 500 million users ‚Äî needs that will only become even more important as the space matures to include billions worldwide.¬†  


In that light, let‚Äôs take a step back to consider how DeFi can serve these basic needs.

### 1. Storing Digital Assets Safely

On a broad level, DeFi needs to help you bank online in a trusted way.¬†  


This is particularly critical with a fully digital asset class, such as cryptocurrencies or non-fungible tokens, where users don‚Äôt have the option to hold their cash in a physical form.

And it‚Äôs become even more important after the closure of Silvergate and Silicon Valley Bank, two banks that were more supportive of crypto projects and currencies.  


When most people deposit money in a bank, they expect that money to be available to them at a moment‚Äôs notice, with, at most, a marginal cost of storing it or a negligible fee for moving it later.¬†  


The fractional reserve banking system offers a version of this ‚Äî or at least the mirage of security, since that money is actually being reinvested to get the bank higher returns, and may not be available if there is a bank run or other liquidity-reducing event.  


DeFi protocols can offer simple storage of digital assets, and potentially even more secure storage, since they do not face the same profit demands that traditional financial institutions do, with less pressure to take risks while reinvesting depositor funds.¬†  


Offering safe storage of digital assets, in a way that is easy, quick, and simple, will go a long way to creating a DeFi space that is [ready for mass adoption](https://skale.space/blog/the-web3-hierarchy-of-needs).¬†

### 2. Earn With Digital Assets Securely

In the traditional system, financial institutions can secure relatively certain gains by investing in government bonds. The presence of reliable, secure returns helps banks guarantee a return for depositors and provides general stability to the entire ecosystem.  


These centralized earning options don‚Äôt need to promise outlandish returns, as Terra did (before its collapse, those who deposited the UST stablecoin into the Anchor Protocol were promised 19.45% returns).  


Instead, DeFi builders should look to sufficiently decentralized and balanced examples like Aave and Compound, lending protocols that offer lower returns but more security for long-term investors.

### 3. Swapping and Trading Effectively

Go to a coffee shop in your neighborhood, pay in your local currency, and the transaction is simple. Go on vacation, buy coffee in another country, and it gets slightly more complicated.  


You‚Äôll need to switch your native currency for foreign currencies, either letting your credit card or bank handle the transaction and charge you for it, or carrying physical cash ‚Äî and if you‚Äôre anything like me, you‚Äôll soon have loose change from dozens of countries rattling around in your backpack.  


Maybe that process is manageable in the physical world, where 10 to 20 global currencies are regularly traded or used, and the average person isn‚Äôt likely to use more than one or two on a daily basis. However, in the web3 world, where thousands of competing cryptocurrencies and digital assets serve different needs online, things can quickly get messy.¬†

The ability to use and swap these digital assets in a cost-effective, agile way is essential to creating a more robust DeFi ecosystem, from helping gamers swap ETH for in-game digital assets to helping investors [buy NFTs](https://skale.space/blog/how-traditional-businesses-can-nft-the-right-way) on their favorite exchange.  


To this end, many blockchain exchanges, chains or apps will focus on raising their TVL (total value locked). It‚Äôs an important metric for reducing slippage when trading one asset for another, but those who over-emphasize TVL risk missing the point ‚Äî and, yes, you do need high TVL to secure large trades.  


However, you don‚Äôt need $100 million in TVL to allow people to swap $10, $20, $50 worth of crypto in a series of micro-transactions. The point: Right now, you can start building DeFi products that make it easier to move virtual assets across the web3 ecosystem, even without building hundreds of millions in TVL first.  


In the coming months, more DeFi projects are slated to call SKALE home, using our modular architecture, no gas fees, and [the Metaport Bridge](https://skale.space/blog/introducing-the-skale-metaport-bridge-easily-transfer-tokens-between-skale-chains-and-ethereum) to more easily swap cryptocurrencies and move digital assets around.  


We‚Äôre not just interested in growing the [**DeFi architecture here on SKALE** ](https://skale.space/network/defi)**though**. We want to enable a whole global economy of applications that support web3 users and purposes. And in order to do that, we need a robust DeFi ecosystem that grows across all chains that see significant uses in the space.¬†

Introducing the Levitation Protocol: SKALE's Solution for Decentralized Zero Knowledge Proofs,SKALEnetwork,13y1pn1,2023-06-01 23:21:12,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SKALEnetwork/comments/13y1pn1/introducing_the_levitation_protocol_skales/,Mod-Mod13,,"&#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/882qkwm7wi3b1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=e62ea65b2010c891c86fd200c6ed345e6518c3b1)

In an effort to further the innovation and breadth of the SKALE Network, the community developers working and contributing to the SKALE Network have pushed forth an open-source effort that will empower SKALE with a flexible and configurable suite of ZK scaling solutions.¬†

Today SKALE developers announced a SKALE Improvement Proposal, named the Levitation Protocol, a fully-decentralized ZK scaling solution designed to revolutionize the world of zero-knowledge proofs by enabling a full host of ZK solutions to connect seamlessly into the SKALE Architecture with rollup connectivity to the Ethereum Mainnet.¬†

The proposal includes a further ecosystem upgrade with the addition of a new ""Layer 1 Megachain"" called SKALE G (G for Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system) fortified by ZK Rollups. The Levitation Protocol will empower developers and businesses to take their decentralized applications to new heights.

The Levitation Protocol is designed to enhance the capabilities of the SKALE ecosystem, offering any operator of Zero Knowledge Proofs the opportunity to provide a decentralized ZK solution to application developers through a SKALE Chain. This new offering will give developers building on SKALE even more flexibility in configuring their applications within SKALE‚Äôs robust app-chain network, which already consists of over 20 EVM blockchains.

https://reddit.com/link/13y1pn1/video/bso6nd9awi3b1/player

### SKALE‚Äôs Novel Approach to ZK Proofs

The SKALE community is particularly optimistic about the launch of SKALE G (G for Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system) which is set to become the world's fastest and most scalable decentralized Layer 1 blockchain. SKALE G will feature L2 ZK hooks back to Ethereum, enabling developers to harness the power of this cutting-edge technology while maintaining a seamless connection to the Ethereum network. Additionally, the proposal plans to enable App-Chains within the SKALE ecosystem to leverage both fast, gas-free transactions on SKALE or opt to use L2 ZK solutions in a configurable manner.¬†

SKALE Labs CEO and co-founder, Jack O'Holleran, emphasized the collaborative nature of the SKALE community in shaping the future of our network: ""SKALE's community of developers is incredibly involved in not only running the network but also shaping the network's future, which was shown in the outpouring of contribution and community design of this initiative. The Levitation Protocol will take SKALE to the next level, offering even more options for developers and businesses to build and scale their decentralized applications. We're excited to see the impact Levitation will have on the future of the blockchain industry.""

SKALE‚Äôs established network of Dapps and app-chains sets it apart from other ZK solutions. [With over 70 million on-chain transactions](https://skale.space/stats) completed and a native integration capacity for best-in-class ZK EVM solutions, SKALE offers developers a proven and reliable platform to build their decentralized applications.¬†

The Levitation Protocol propels SKALE forward as a comprehensive blockchain scalability platform, providing app-specific chains, Layer 1, and Layer 2 options.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ozkrwf7dwi3b1.png?width=4001&format=png&auto=webp&s=962bd82f4f2b1db8c6935e2752e30e921876bb25)

### Levitation vs. Other ZK Protocols¬†

The current options for ZK protocols are centralized. Levitation protocol is different as it will implement a decentralized sequencer as a set of smart contracts deployed to a SKALE Chain. The sequencer protocol has pluggable modular architecture which enables existing ZKRs to run seamlessly on SKALE Chains that have chosen to implement the Levitation protocol.

Here are the three main advantages of Levitation:

1. Decentralization: Existing ZKRs, when executed on Levitation, become decentralized, without requiring any modifications to the underlying software.
2. Interoperability and Modularity: Levitation turns existing ZKRs into modules that interact with each other seamlessly.
3. Common security: Multiple ZKRs can run in a common environment of a single Levitation-enabled chain. This enables a common ledger of transactions and eases the interaction of rollups.

### Scaling Ethereum Together

Chris Sharp, the CTO of Blockdaemon, a major Validator of the SKALE Network, highlighted the significance of SKALE's technological prowess and active developer community: ""By marrying SKALE's instant finality to the added security of a novel layer 2 ZK approach, SKALE offers developers a platform for building new, decentralized applications. Not only will they be able to use app-specific chains, but also ZK roll-ups, and SKALE-G, an innovation that we are excited to see grow the blockchain ecosystem.""

SKALE‚Äôs open-source developer community, known as the ""SKALE\_Dev\_DAO,"" [has proposed the protocol addition through the SKALE developer forum](https://forum.skale.network/t/exciting-levitation-protocol-research-paper/461). The devs plan to start releasing source code in the coming months and will later launch a public testnet. Mainnet is slated to launch in Q4 2023, marking a significant milestone in the advancement of SKALE's capabilities. All timelines are subject to alignment and execution by open-source contributors to the SKALE Project. The core team will support and facilitate the development, but the timelines, spec, and delivery will be governed by devs, stakers, and community members within the SKALEverse. Ultimately a successful on-chain vote will be to push the source code proposal into live production.¬†

The Levitation Protocol represents a significant leap forward in the world of decentralized scaling solutions. This innovative protocol will empower developers and businesses to unlock the full potential of decentralized applications. Stay tuned for more updates from SKALE as we continue to revolutionize the blockchain industry together.

A bridge was needed so users could easily navigate the advanced Multi-chain ecosystem and provide a way to easily and securely direct tokens to where they want to use them.¬†

Free Token Transfers via Metaport are made possible by SKALE's zero-gas fee architecture.

### What is the SKALE Metaport Bridge?¬†

At its core, the Metaport Bridge is a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of transferring tokens between Ethereum and SKALE Chains and between different SKALE Chains and Hubs. It visually guides users through the necessary steps making token migration effortless. It also supports moving tokens across multiple chains, for example from Ethereum to Europa, and onward to any other SKALE chain.

Underneath the surface, the Metaport Bridge leverages SKALE IMA (Interchain Messaging Agent), a decentralized bridge solution supported by shared security from Ethereum validators, SKALE validators, and BLS threshold cryptography. This combination ensures the utmost security and reliability while maintaining fast finalization times.¬†

One of the standout features of the SKALE IMA Bridge is its exceptional speed. Thanks to the fast finality achieved on SKALE, users can experience rapid token transfers, enhancing the overall efficiency of the network. Moreover, the utilization of BLS threshold cryptography provides additional layers of security, further strengthening the confidence users can have in the bridge.

To access the Metaport Bridge, users can connect their wallets, such as Metamask or MEW's Enkrypt wallet. This allows for a seamless and familiar experience, ensuring widespread adoption and ease of use.

Welcome to our latest Partner Spotlight Q&A featuring [Prospectors](https://pickaxecrypto.io/)! Join us as we journey into the Voxelverse, an entirely online blockchain sandbox-style survival game that provides gamers with the opportunity to explore, build, and earn $PROS tokens!  


In this discussion, we explore the inspiration behind Prospectors, its unique features, and the challenges faced during development. We also discuss their collaboration with SKALE, [the fastest blockchain network with zero gas fees](https://skale.space/blog/how-does-skale-offer-zero-gas-fees), and other notable projects within the SKALEverse that are pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology.¬†  


Read the full Q&A below with the Prospectors team to uncover its role in shaping the future of blockchain gaming.  


### How did you come up with your project's concept?

Our project's concept initially started as a way to distribute cloud mining services through 3D Voxel characters in the form of an NFT collection. However, it quickly evolved into a full-fledged game that combines elements of survival and multiplayer gaming with the original mining features. We wanted to create a fun and engaging way for players to participate in decentralized ecosystems by simulating traditional prospecting and Bitcoin mining, all while adding a unique twist with the addition of survival gameplay. This combination of themes and features presented an attractive concept that we believed would appeal to a wide audience.

### What differentiates your project from other competitors?

Our project offers a unique blend of blockchain technology, survival-style gameplay, and mining that sets us apart from other competitors in the gaming industry. By leveraging SKALE Network, we are able to incorporate creative and innovative features into our smart contracts and game mechanics that give players a truly unique experience. Our focus on mining and its integration into the game's core mechanics allows players to engage in decentralized ecosystems in a way that is both fun and informative. These unique features and our dedication to delivering an engaging and exciting gameplay experience differentiates us from our competitors.

### What is your favorite feature of your project?

Our favorite feature of the project is the integration of crypto mining within the game itself. This feature adds a new level of excitement and immersion for players, as they can use their in-game actions to mine cryptocurrency and contribute to the game's overall economy. We believe that this feature not only makes the game more engaging and fun to play, but also highlights the potential for blockchain technology to be used in novel ways that are both educational and entertaining.

### Why did your team decide to partner with SKALE?

Our team decided to partner with SKALE Network due to its unique features and potential as a leading blockchain infrastructure provider. We were particularly drawn to SKALE‚Äôs ability to provide users with 0 transaction fees, making it a cost-effective solution for our gaming project. Additionally, Skale's potential for growth and the possibility of becoming a top 10 blockchain infrastructure provider made it an attractive choice for our team. We saw this partnership as an opportunity to work with an innovative and forward-thinking solution that aligned with our project's vision and goals.

You can watch it here:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnE\_ei0Ge2M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnE_ei0Ge2M) 

### How much time did it take to develop your product and what challenges did you face?

We started developing our product in August 2021 with the initial design of 3D characters intended to be NFT collectibles. As a small development team of 2-3 people, we faced various challenges during the development process, the most significant of which was working on a tight budget. Despite this, we persevered and made steady progress, gaining valuable knowledge and insights throughout the development process. While progress was sometimes slow, the journey has been incredibly rewarding, and we are proud of what we have achieved so far.

### How do you see web3 evolving in the next 3-5 years?

We believe that Web3 will continue to evolve rapidly in the next 3-5 years, with several exciting developments on the horizon. One major trend we expect to see is the increasing adoption of zero-knowledge proofs, which allow for secure and private transactions on the blockchain. Another development that we anticipate is the widespread use of gasless transactions, which will reduce transaction costs and make blockchain technology more accessible to a wider audience. Finally, we believe that blockchain games will become increasingly popular and may even move towards being completely on-chain, allowing for seamless integration with the blockchain and offering new opportunities for monetization and engagement.

### What other projects do you admire and or enjoy in the SKALEverse and why?

We admire and enjoy several projects in the SKALEverse, but one that stands out to us is [Ruby Exchange](http://ruby.exchange/). We appreciate the platform's ease of use and its ability to provide liquidity to projects seeking to grow. We also find their innovative use of NFTs to boost the user experience to be exciting and forward-thinking. Overall, we believe that Ruby Exchange represents a promising and exciting addition to the SKALEverse, and we look forward to seeing how it continues to evolve and impact the blockchain ecosystem.

Platform games have been the cornerstone of video gaming history from the pixelated landscapes of the '80s to the three-dimensional worlds of today.

Untitled Platformer isn't just a nod to nostalgia; it's a game-first approach to blockchain gaming.

Welcome to our latest Partner Spotlight Q&A featuring [NFT Moon Metaverse](https://nftmoon.space/en/main/)! Journey with us into this futuristic, Create-to-Earn multi-blockchain universe where users can create and monetize their own content!  


In this discussion, we explore the inspiration behind NFT Moon Metaverse, its unique architecture, and the challenges faced during development. We also discuss their collaboration with SKALE, [the fastest blockchain network with zero gas fees](https://skale.space/blog/how-does-skale-offer-zero-gas-fees), and other notable projects within the SKALEverse that are pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology.¬†  


Read the full Q&A below with the NFT Moon Metaverse team to uncover its role in shaping the future of the metaverse and creator economy.  


#### How did you come up with your project's concept?

Since 2018, we have been paying attention to the metaverse and its different use cases, and realized that there was a distinct lack of utility. We came to the realization that there are different categories of visitors (audiences) across different metaverses that builders were catering to. Our solution at NFT Moon Metaverse was born with the idea of the Create and Earn function alongside the ability to use many blockchains in the metaverse.¬†

https://preview.redd.it/hkj6zyk9uk0b1.png?width=537&format=png&auto=webp&s=df3e0cc871fd209098726bd2276d20aa082baa50

Watch here:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGb967owmvw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGb967owmvw) 

You might be wondering what¬† the Create and Earn Metaverse is. It is where you fully own and manage all the content and with the help of the constructor, you also create a location on your plot of land or area selected for development. From here you can create virtual items and buildings of any type, regardless of complexity. For instance:

* As a gamer you can create a location for your favorite games or create a game location from scratch.
* Entrepreneurs can create virtual locations of their businesses and create means for selling goods and services. Such examples are virtual offices, meeting rooms, and conference rooms.¬†
* As a designer or programmer, or if you are looking for work, one can create a vacancy on an internal virtual exchange and sell your services. There are a lot of people in the metaverse who don't want to spend time creating locations or mechanics, but they are willing to pay money for those to be created for them.¬†
* Finally, as an explorer, you can start with free access and take the time to understand the benefits of the metaverse. For this, you will receive an internal NTMi token and a unit of content measurement called Moon bytes. With the help of the NTMi token and Moon bytes, you have access to the closed functions and various locations within the metaverse.

Create and Earn allows you to maximize and monetize any action within the metaverse, from content creation to entertainment.

At its most basic core the Moon Metaverse is made of plots, ID cards, avatars with each of these assets providing advantages to the respective owner.

#### What differentiates your project from other competitors?

We provide the user with a huge selection of possibilities ranging from gaming to the creation and integration of business into the metaverse. The design of the metaverse allows for you to create any object and structure designed to your liking without any restrictions. Once inside, users can start exploring the metaverse for free and get rewarded for it.¬†

In addition, multi-blockchain access to the metaverse is an added benefit as users can choose which network they want to develop on. We also provide the ability to transfer your assets to another network at any time.¬†

While we have limited the number of plots to 10,000, these are divisible. Thus, the buyer of the plot already can release new plots himself and ensure that the balance between supply and demand is maintained.

 Watch here:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aabZ\_P1nS6k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aabZ_P1nS6k) 

In addition, we allow the user to control the metaverse using DAO avatars. Not only to manage but also to manage the development of the metaverse and the distribution of income.

#### What is your favorite feature of your project?

Our favorite feature of NFT Moon Metaverse is the ability to create any content regardless of the desired shape, quality of graphics, and backend design. This allows the user to start exploring the metaverse for free, which creates benefits for the metaverse and the environment. Over time with oracles and dynamic NFTs, users achieve massive growth within the metaverse and increase the value of his objects and NFTs that they have created.

#### Why did your team decide to partner with SKALE?

For NFT Moon Metaverse, SKALE‚Äôs zero gas fee structure is crucial. In addition, with the SKALE ecosystem rapidly growing, NFT Moon Metaverse is primed for growth as well with a large number of users joining from the SKALE Network.¬†

We also share the same values with regard to long-term partnerships, and this is evident with the SKALE Labs team with the support they have provided us technically and with marketing.¬†

#### How much time did it take to develop your product and what challenges did you face?

NFT Moon Metaverse has been in development for over two years and we are preparing for the release of our alpha version.¬† One of the challenges we have faced over the years is the lack of technical solutions to create metaverses. This also applies to blockchains (gas fees), server capacity, internet speed, as well as the development of the NFT industry and oracles. As these respective technologies have advanced,¬† dynamic NFTs and oracles allow you to implement unique solutions in the NFT Moon Metaverse.

#### How do you see web3 evolving in the next 3-5 years?

You can check out this study that our founder Alex Zhukevich participated in regarding the future of the Metaverses from the ""[Copenhagen University of Future Research](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tQa8OMMpevf7zHUYEabV9rp8kWTldEGg/view?usp=sharing)"" for some insight into our beliefs on where web3 is headed.

#### What other projects do you admire and or enjoy in the SKALEverse and why?

We like many projects in the SKALE Network ecosystem so¬† the ones we listed out below were based on the consideration of the possibility and benefit for integrating with NFT Moon Metaverse.¬†

1. [AILand](https://skale.space/blog/ai-blockchain-transform-gaming-ailand-building-on-skale) has many similar features and this means that in the future we can make it possible for users to use AILand through NFT Moon Metaverse.¬†
2. [HUMAN Protocol ](https://skale.space/blog/now-live-on-skale-human-protocol-is-revolutionizing-job-markets-with-decentralization-and-automation)provides an opportunity for NFT Moon Metaverse users to participate in the internal freelance exchange and get more jobs while also automating the process of checking the work performed.
3. [XP Network](https://skale.space/blog/multi-chain-nft-bridging-solution-xp-network-is-live-on-skale) is someone who we already partner with to¬† bridge and transfer NFT assets between blockchains.¬†
4. [Gamifly](https://skale.space/blog/gamifly-now-live-on-skale-is-an-esports-metaverse-bringing-sports-inclusivity-to-fans-and-gamers-alike) is a promising project that would have real value within the NFT Moon Metaverse as users could take the opportunity to play their games within the NFT Moon Metaverse.

Welcome to our latest Partner Spotlight Q&A featuring [Tank Wars Zone](https://tankwars.zone/)! Join us as we delve into the world of Tank Wars Zone, a visually refreshing, fully decentralized play-to-earn battle game built on blockchain technology.¬†  


In this discussion, we explore the inspiration behind Tank Wars Zone, its unique features, and the challenges faced during development. We also discuss their collaboration with SKALE, [the fastest blockchain network with zero gas fees](https://skale.space/blog/how-does-skale-offer-zero-gas-fees), and other notable projects within the SKALEverse that are pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology.¬†  


Read the full Q&A below with the Tank Wars Zone team to uncover its role in shaping the future of the metaverse and creator economy.  


### How did you come up with Tank Wars Zone concept?

The concept for our project was inspired by the classic Nintendo game, Battle City, which holds nostalgic appeal for those who grew up in the 80s and 90s. By searching for the game on Google, you'll likely recognize its familiar visuals. We believe this connection to childhood gaming experiences will resonate with a wide range of players and evoke fond memories.

### What differentiates Tank Wars Zone from other competitors?

Our project stands out from competitors due to its enjoyable gameplay, seamless blockchain integration, and diverse assortment of NFTs. Additionally, we offer a unique renting system, cloning capabilities, and compatibility with Android mobile devices. Our game also supports both PvE (player versus computer) and PvP (player versus player) modes, enabling cross-platform competition between PC and mobile users, further setting our project apart from others in the market.

As we develop our MOBA version, it will introduce real-time action battles to the game, greatly enhancing the excitement and enjoyment for players, and adding an extra layer of depth to the gaming experience.

[ ](https://reddit.com/link/13aav64/video/3wn4ryfvrbya1/player)

### What is your favorite feature of Tank Wars Zone?

My favorite feature of the project is the Candy Crush-inspired puzzle game that comes into play during battles between two players. This engaging mechanic requires players to strategically align similar items in a row to execute actions, adding a fun and challenging dimension to the gameplay.

### Why did your team decide to partner with SKALE?

Our team chose to partner with SKALE because we recognized it as the only blockchain network capable of supporting an unlimited number of rapid, on-demand, pooled-security blockchains while eliminating gas fees for end users. SKALE empowers developers to deploy their own interoperable EVM blockchains quickly and easily, all without compromising security or decentralization. This made it an ideal fit for our project's requirements and goals.

Additionally, the SKALE support team has been exceptional in providing assistance during our deployment on their network. Their guidance and expertise have been invaluable, further solidifying our decision to partner with them and ensuring a smooth integration process for our project.

### How much time did it take to develop Tank Wars Zone and what challenges did you face?

Developing and releasing the official Play-to-Earn version of our game took approximately 6 months. Some of the primary challenges we faced included attracting Web2 users to Web3 gaming, establishing a sustainable business model to propel the project forward, and retaining user engagement by consistently providing entertainment and fostering a sense of loyalty towards the project's ongoing development.

[ ](https://reddit.com/link/13aav64/video/gz8qcmk6sbya1/player)

### How do you see web3 evolving in the next 3-5 years?

Over the next 3-5 years, Web3 is expected to experience substantial growth and change. Mainstream adoption is likely to increase as more people become aware of decentralized technologies and integrate them into their daily lives, services, and products. As this occurs, Web3 platforms and applications will focus on improving user experience, accessibility, and interfaces, making it simpler for users without advanced technical knowledge to engage with these technologies.

Interoperability will become more important, with an emphasis on seamless communication and collaboration between various blockchain networks. This will enable the development of more comprehensive and versatile decentralized solutions. Privacy and security are also expected to be enhanced with new protocols and tools that protect sensitive information and digital assets.

As Web3 continues to evolve, regulatory bodies and governments will play a greater role in shaping the landscape, establishing legal frameworks and guidelines to ensure compliance, consumer protection, and industry stability. The decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem is poised for significant growth, with innovative financial products and services catering to a diverse range of user needs.

Finally, there will likely be increased convergence between Web3 and other cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and virtual/augmented reality. This integration will open up new possibilities for decentralized applications and solutions, ultimately reshaping the way we interact with technology, the internet, and each other.

### What other projects do you admire and or enjoy in the SKALEverse and why?

Within the SKALEverse, one project that we admire and enjoy is the [Ruby.Exchange,](https://ruby.exchange/) which serves as SKALE's primary decentralized exchange (DEX). During our deployment on the SKALE network, we had the opportunity to interact with Ruby Exchange and found its user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) to be impressive and user-friendly. The platform plays a crucial role in promoting the growth of the SKALE network, making it an essential component of the ecosystem and a standout project in our view.

NFT Labs and SKALE Partner to Bring Sports Fans to Blockchain,SKALEnetwork,13861sv,2023-05-04 21:07:07,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SKALEnetwork/comments/13861sv/nft_labs_and_skale_partner_to_bring_sports_fans/,Mod-Mod13,,"&#x200B;

Web3 products are booming, but they face a major challenge: reaching new users. Traditional targeted advertising is costly, with solutions that can be complex and not well suited for web3.¬†

Enter [NFT Labs](https://nftlabs.tech/), a company that's building a suite of fun and engaging web3 products aimed at sports fans. Their innovative approach is already attracting thousands of users, but to scale up and take it to the next level, they need a high-performance blockchain network that can handle their unique needs. These needs and the high gas fees on many blockchain platforms were making it difficult for users to interact with web3 products seamlessly.¬†¬†

That is why NFT Labs has chosen to partner with SKALE! With SKALE's fast and zero gas architecture, NFT Labs will be able to deploy their suite of products at scale while also onboarding more users into web3. NFT Labs offers a suite of web3 products designed to engage sports fans through games and other interactions.¬†

One of NFT Labs' flagship products is ""Mywin,"" a NFT play-to-win product that is deployed during sports games. Fans claim free NFTs as raffle tickets with a frictionless UX, and the raffle winners get a chance to win autographed jerseys. Mywin enables NFT Labs to enrich the experience for thousands of in-game attendees by providing them with a unique and interactive experience.

In addition to Mywin, NFT Labs is integrating its social-plus marketplace, [Itsmyne](https://www.itsmyne.app/), for the secondary trading of Mywin NFTs and Metamyne, a metaverse experience where fans can explore different sports-based experiences and play-to-win games.¬†

NFT Labs is working hard to onboard those who might initially be hesitant to venture into web3 by targeting web2 users who play casual smartphone games and attend live game events, such as soccer matches. They have already successfully launched a pilot with over 4,000 user activations at a soccer match between Tottenham Hotspur and AS Roma at the Samy Ofer Stadium in Haifa, Israel and this success spurred the Itsmyne app for its approval to be listed on the Apple app store!

NFT Labs' partnership with SKALE empowers the company's ""invisible blockchain"" philosophy, allowing it to deploy first-of-their-kind, scalable gasless digital collectible collection and distribution systems. SKALE offers high scalability and throughput, sub-second confirmation times, up to 2,000 transactions per second per chain, and low gas fees, making it an ideal platform for NFT Labs' products and goals to service thousands of live event attendees.¬†

According to Atharva Sabnis, Co-Founder of NFT Labs, ""Our partnership with SKALE empowers our 'invisible blockchain' philosophy, letting us deploy first-of-their-kind, scalable gasless digital collectible collection and distribution systems to let sports superfans collect the rewards they deserve.""

Uniting the Gaming and Web3 Communities: What Will it Take?,SKALEnetwork,12zjmz2,2023-04-26 10:42:52,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SKALEnetwork/comments/12zjmz2/uniting_the_gaming_and_web3_communities_what_will/,Mod-Mod13,,"&#x200B;

The majority of the most avid gamers have been, at best, apathetic about blockchain games, and at worst, antagonistic toward it.¬†  


We know that gamers are willing to pay to play ‚Äî the [$170](https://gameranx.com/updates/id/416500/article/gaming-is-five-times-bigger-than-movies-now/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CToday%2C%20gaming%20is%20the%20largest,global%20movie%20box%20office%20revenues.%E2%80%9D) to [$300](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/software-platforms/gaming-the-next-super-platform?c=acn_glb_thenewgamingexpbusinesswire_12160747&n=mrl_0421) billion gaming industry is now [bigger than Hollywood](https://gameranx.com/updates/id/416500/article/gaming-is-five-times-bigger-than-movies-now/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CToday%2C%20gaming%20is%20the%20largest,global%20movie%20box%20office%20revenues.%E2%80%9D) for a reason. So why aren‚Äôt they willing to play when it means they could earn?

In my opinion, one of the biggest reasons has to do with that three-letter f-word that Ohanian mentioned: ‚Äúfun.‚Äù Gamers often see web3 gaming projects as optimizing for the *earn* part of play to earn, while forgetting about *play*.¬†

That dichotomy especially plays out when you consider the metaverse, which has promised immersive experiences yet, to date, offers mostly a regression of the gaming experience ‚Äî vast and largely empty worlds, with outdated graphics, few users and little to do compared to the types of activities that have been possible on MMORPGs like World of Warcraft or Runescape for over a decade.

The metaverse will catch up, as will web3 gaming experiences, and there are a number of promising projects on the horizon. But the current state of play has made gamers hesitant to go all in ‚Äî and they‚Äôve rightly interpreted NFT launches by big game developers, such as [Square Enix](https://www.nftculture.com/nft-news/square-enix-stands-firm-on-blockchain-gaming-plans-despite-industry-skepticism/) and [Ubisoft](https://epicstream.com/article/ubisofts-quartz-nft-program-failed-because-of-ubisoft-not-nfts), as thinly veiled cash grabs rather than genuine attempts to return value back to their users.

Such extractive tactics are exactly what NFTs and the blockchain were created to deter, so of course those projects have seen little adoption from gamers and web3 enthusiasts alike. And those gaming giants have little incentive to change ‚Äî after all, those extractive measures are what got them their massive market capture in the first place (even if they could well benefit from launching NFTs that actually engage with their community and produce real value for both users and developers, as I‚Äôve [previously written](https://skale.space/blog/how-traditional-businesses-can-nft-the-right-way)).¬†

[ Currently, there is still only a little bit of overlap between the web3 and gaming communities.  ](https://preview.redd.it/m82dh3snq8wa1.jpg?width=2667&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e34c9fe8959db97b638958e58d5681a0a8623bc)

### So How Do We Cross the Chasm?

I don‚Äôt see a future of gaming that isn‚Äôt mostly focused on fun. It is the critical first component for web3 developers to solve for.¬†

The earliest play-to-earn blockchain games often made players spam-click their phone to receive crypto tokens. Ironically, this repetitive gaming style most resembles the type of pay-to-play (also known as pay-to-win) mobile games that get players addicted to a *Candy Crush*\-style mania, and then try to upsell them through [microtransactions](https://www.makeuseof.com/mobile-games-microtransactions-reasons-why/).

In this case, earning speculative tokens isn‚Äôt enough of an incentive to convince most gamers that it‚Äôs a worthy use of their time. Playing such games is work ‚Äî tap in, make money, tap out ‚Äî not, well, play. And so the typical early adopter web3 gamer was actually less gamer and more remote worker.¬†

The real value of web3 gaming lies in its ability to create a deeper connection and fairer collaboration between gamers and the games they love. As Everett Muzzy, a senior vice president at the marketing firm Serotonin, writes for CoinDesk in ‚Äú[The Gaming Industry Doesn‚Äôt Need Web3, but Gamers Might](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-gaming-industry-doesnt-need-web3-but-gamers-might).‚Äù

Games built on blockchain technology can provide gamers with true asset ownership, financial opportunity and creative feedback loops with studios, to name a few. The history of gaming is rife with examples of how gamers have felt cheated or deceived by the industry they love. Web3 principles of sovereignty and collaboration can offer a way for gamers to benefit more richly from the games into which they already pour their time and commitment.

In order to get to those values, though, the game has to actually be good.

Ask nearly anyone what the most successful Web3 games are and you‚Äôll get answers like Axie Infinity, DeFi Kingdoms and Wolf Game. These apps gained significant attention (and capital) during the bull market, and came to represent the first wave of ‚Äúproven‚Äù Web3 games. In reality, these titles were little more than decentralized finance (DeFi) apps with a veneer of design and gamification. Any traditional gamer familiar with the fidelity, storyline and aesthetic of titles like Stardew Valley would certainly bristle if they were told that DeFi Kingdoms was the future of gaming.

Gamers are especially wary of games that are over-financialized, after years of gaming giants trying to monetize every aspect of their game playing process. They have every right to be suspicious.

[ Eventually, web3 and gaming will co-exist ‚Äî but it requires a better experience for users.  ](https://preview.redd.it/uqlcmooqq8wa1.jpg?width=2667&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3089b8cd1043c13b725af53b23676c82431003a5)

### Thankfully, the Web3 Gaming Industry is Maturing

The user experience has been a major roadblock in the past. Historically, managing transaction speeds and throughput on the blockchain has been a time and energy-consuming affair. Those challenges, plus high gas fees and tricky wallet integrations, often bogged down the in-game experience.

[Games built on SKALE](https://skale.space/network/gaming) have zero gas fees, and seamless wallet integration, so users don‚Äôt have to log-in to their wallet for events to be recorded on-chain. It‚Äôs the most eco-friendly and green blockchain that can operate at mass scale, and recently was shown to have the fastest speeds of any chain in a [recent Dartmouth Study](https://skale.space/blog/the-quest-for-the-best-blockchain-performance-results-from-dartmouth-blockchain-study).

**Those innovations make it easier for web3 games to provide more immersive gaming experiences. And it‚Äôs a major reason why a number of gaming companies are building on SKALE, including‚Ä¶**

Welcome to our latest Partner Spotlight Q&A featuring [AILAND](https://ailand.app/)! Join us as we delve into the world of AILAND, a decentralized and user-centric platform that aims to revolutionize the metaverse experience by empowering creators and putting control back in their hands, combining AI and blockchain technology.

In this discussion, we explore the inspiration behind AILAND, its unique features, and the challenges faced during development. We also discuss their collaboration with SKALE, [the fastest blockchain network with zero gas fees](https://skale.space/blog/how-does-skale-offer-zero-gas-fees), and other notable projects within the SKALEverse that are pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology.¬†

Read the full Q&A below with the AILAND team to uncover its role in shaping the future of the metaverse and creator economy.

#### How did you come up with your project's concept?¬†

We came up with the concept for AILAND when we saw the potential of the creator economy in the metaverse. We noticed a lack of ownership and control for users in centralized virtual worlds and wanted to provide a solution that empowers creators and gives them more control over their digital assets. We believe that the metaverse has the potential to revolutionize the way we live, work, and play, and we want to be at the forefront of this transformation by creating a decentralized and user-centric platform that puts the power back in the hands of the users.

[ ](https://reddit.com/link/12u64rx/video/x544mll269va1/player)

#### What differentiates your project from other competitors?¬†

What sets AILAND apart from our competitors is our focus on combining the latest AI and blockchain technologies with a strong emphasis on empowering creators and building a vibrant creator economy within the metaverse. Our comprehensive suite of products and services are designed to provide users with a seamless and engaging experience that sets a new standard in the virtual world.

#### What is your favorite feature of your project?

My favorite feature of the project is our Avatar Creation and Customization service. It allows users to create realistic avatars from their photos, which can be used as NFTs in the metaverse. This feature enables users to express their creativity and individuality and opens up new revenue streams for creators and designers within the virtual fashion industry.

Additionally, integrating blockchain technology ensures secure ownership and transfer of digital assets, adding an extra layer of value and protection for our users. Overall, I believe this feature has the potential to revolutionize how we interact with virtual environments and the digital economy.

#### How much time did it take to develop your product, and what challenges did you face?

I can say that developing our product was a challenging and time-consuming process. It took over a year of intense work by our team to create a truly innovative and robust solution. One of our biggest challenges was finding the right balance between functionality and usability. We wanted to create a product that was feature-rich yet also intuitive and easy to use for our customers.

Additionally, the rapidly evolving technology landscape in the metaverse space presented its own unique challenges that required us to stay agile and adaptable. Despite these challenges, we are proud of the final result and are excited to bring our product to the market.¬†

#### Watch it here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvHOo85ctR0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvHOo85ctR0) 

#### Why did your team decide to partner with SKALE?¬†

We believe that SKALE's EVM-compatible blockchain technology is the future of blockchain infrastructure, and their zero-gas fees make it an ideal solution for gaming and other applications within the metaverse. Additionally, their focus on creating a scalable and interoperable ecosystem aligns with our vision for AILAND and our goal of creating a comprehensive and seamless user experience. We're excited to partner with SKALE and leverage their cutting-edge technology to take AILAND to the next level.

#### How do you see web3 evolving in the next 3-5 years?

I see web3 evolving rapidly in the next 3-5 years, with the combination of AI, blockchain, and the metaverse playing a pivotal role in this evolution. We believe that AILAND will be at the forefront of this transformation as a pioneer in developing and implementing cutting-edge technologies that enable seamless interaction between the virtual and physical worlds.

Our focus on creating innovative products and services, such as AI-generated movies and series, digital fashion for avatars, and interactive AI-driven NPCs, will help us drive the growth and adoption of web3 technologies and unlock the full potential of the metaverse.

#### What other projects do you admire and/or enjoy in the SKALEverse and why?

I particularly admire and enjoy the work of ConsenSys, The Graph, and MetaMask in the SKALEverse. ConsenSys is a leading blockchain technology company that provides various tools and services to support the development of decentralized applications. The Graph is a decentralized indexing protocol that allows developers to build and query data from blockchains, while MetaMask is a popular browser extension for accessing and interacting with EVM-compatible blockchains.¬†

All three projects have significantly contributed to the growth and adoption of the blockchain ecosystem, and I appreciate their dedication to advancing the technology. I'm also impressed with MADNFT, a SKALE-based NFT marketplace that leverages SKALE's high-speed and low-cost infrastructure to create a seamless and user-friendly experience for creators and collectors alike. MADNFT's innovative use of SKALE's blockchain technology and focus on NFTs demonstrates a deep understanding of the potential of the metaverse and blockchain industry.

We hope you enjoyed our Partner Spotlight with AILAND, and it is clear that they will play a pivotal role in the evolution of the metaverse, web3, and the creator economy. By combining the power of AI, blockchain, and a user-centric approach, AILAND is not only empowering creators but also fostering a thriving and interconnected ecosystem within the virtual world. Their partnership with SKALE further solidifies their commitment to leveraging the most advanced technologies to create seamless and engaging user experiences.

We look forward to the future of AILAND's vision, innovation, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of what's possible will undoubtedly continue to inspire and drive the growth of the metaverse and beyond!¬†
