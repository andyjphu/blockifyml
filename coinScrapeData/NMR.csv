NMR/BTC Near Critical Turning Point: Numeraire is a Must-Watch,DigitalCurrencyTrader,1fs3h8h,2024-09-29 08:43:21,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalCurrencyTrader/comments/1fs3h8h/nmrbtc_near_critical_turning_point_numeraire_is_a/,lumbridgecity,,"### 🚀 NMR/BTC Near Critical Turning Point: Numeraire is a Must-Watch! 🚀

Hey fellow traders! I just dove into an insightful article about the current trends for Numeraire (NMR) against Bitcoin (BTC), and the analysis is absolutely compelling. Here are some key takeaways that caught my attention:

- **Trend Shifts:** After a significant downtrend since late 2021, we might be witnessing a consolidation phase—could this signal a bottom formation? 🤔
  
- **Support Levels:** A crucial support level at **0.0001745** has been tested multiple times, creating several bounce opportunities. This area is effectively a ""buying zone"" right now! 📈

- **EMA Insights:** Keep an eye on the EMAs! Short-term EMA crossovers moving above the long-term EMAs hint at a potential trend reversal. However, be cautious, as this isn’t confirmed yet. ⚠️

- **Volume Fluctuations:** The OBV shows varying volume levels. A strong uptick could indicate increasing buying interest—great news if you’re considering entering the market! 📊

- **Pattern Recognition:** Look for small bullish patterns forming around that support level, like double bottoms—these could be early indicators of a bullish trend change! 🎯

The article also touches on:

- **Future Implications:** If the price holds above the crucial support, we could be gearing up for a bullish reversal. But remember, confirmation is key! 🏁
  
- **Community and Growth:** Numeraire is powered by collaboration among data scientists using blockchain, and with a growing community, it's an interesting project to watch! 🌐

This article is a must-read for anyone interested in the crypto scene and specifically in NMR's trajectory. It’s at a pivotal moment, and understanding these dynamics could give you an edge in your trading decisions.

A Look Into Grayscale's Proposed Privacy ETF & Potential Role of Oasis,altcoin,1ddj57f,2024-06-11 13:00:41,8,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1ddj57f/a_look_into_grayscales_proposed_privacy_etf/,DC600A,,"The financial aspect of crypto is a huge draw for users. Now, despite the volatility of the crypto markets, the lucrative pull is undeniable. So, when Bitcoin ETFs got approved and succeeded, it paved the way for Ethereum ETFs. While early market sentiments are yet to call out the final result if it is a hit or a miss, indications are it will be successful. The focus now shifts to another untapped potential for ETFs - privacy, and it is a big deal.

Whether you are a veteran or a newbie in the ETF scene, Grayscale is a well-known name that inspires confidence. Some sources have suggested that Grayscale is prepped for filing a privacy ETF and they have been considering and monitoring several projects since 2022. Here is the list of assets under consideration:

* 0x (ZRX)
* 1inch (1INCH)
* Apecoin (APE)
* Arweave (AR)
* Axie Infinity (AXS)
* Bancor (BNT)
* BitTorrent (BTT)
* Bora (BORA)
* Iota (IOTA)
* Kava (KAVA)
* Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)
* Loopring (LRC)
* Monero (XMR)
* Near (NEAR)
* Numeraire (NMR)
* [Oasis (ROSE)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/oasis-network/)

While Ethereum itself depends on L2 solutions to implement privacy effectively in its ecosystem, there is no dearth of blockchain protocols that have been working in this field and have achieved various degrees of success. As a pioneer in smart privacy for web3 and AI with privacy-preserving technologies in use, [Oasis](https://oasisprotocol.org/)'s inclusion in the above list is as expected. However, before getting into how or why Oasis / $Rose could feature in Grayscale's plans, it is useful first to examine the makeup of the privacy ETF.

Ed, a well-known persona in the blockchain and crypto and web3 space, and an engaged Oasis community member with 3+ years of experience being embedded across the ecosystem while contributing towards community building, business development, networking, and marketing activities, has put it all together.

Let's start by looking at what type of projects will constitute this ETF.

* Data Privacy Solution Providers
* Cyber Service Providers
* Blockchain-Based Privacy Solutions
* Network & Communication Security Provider
* Privacy-Preserving Protocols

The projects considered also have some eligibility criteria to fulfill before qualifying and we will mention the top 3 here.

First, a substantial portion, if not all, of their revenue has to come from one or more of the categories mentioned above. Second, the projects need to be listed on U.S., non-U.S. developed market or emerging market exchanges. Third, the market cap must equal to or in excess of $250M.

Projects are scored as 'primary' or 'secondary' based on three metrics.

1. Data Privacy Solutions, Cyber Services, or Blockchain Privacy Solutions take priority over other sectors
2. If ALL or just some business operations are aimed at privacy
3. By alignment with GDPR and CCPA regulations

The prominence and priority of Oasis in Grayscale's proposed privacy ETF plans becomes evident based on the above discussion as it firmly falls under the 'primary' category. While the fact remains that quite a few of the projects mentioned above in Grayscale's list have lost relevance, Oasis has gone from strength to strength emerging as a regulatory-compliant solution provider in addition to its confidentiality capabilities.

According to Ed, this is just the tip of the iceberg and there are other reasons too that underline why Oasis / $Rose is well-positioned in Grayscale's proposed privacy ETF.

To note, Grayscale has reiterated its principal investment strategy of avoiding exposure to digital assets directly, and still, $Rose has potentially a significant role to play in the privacy ETF when it comes out. Intrigued? The answer lies in a single entity having effected a huge accumulation of $Rose (approximately $440M) on chain through Coinbase. To deep dive into this, [check out Ed's thread](https://x.com/ECrypto0/status/1800135721648546253) on Twitter (X).

Favorable market sentiments of ETFs aside, Grayscale's backing of the privacy narrative is well-deserved and timely. Oasis has always been privacy-focused in line with its founder, Prof. Dawn Song's expertise in computer security and decentralized confidentiality. In conclusion, the potential is all there for a blockbuster privacy ETF with an MVP role by Oasis, but nothing is concrete yet. Hopefully, we will hear something positive very soon.

Let's discuss in the comments what you like about privacy ETFs, and also what other criteria, metrics, and projects you think would make it more robust and impactful."

Intrigued? The answer lies in a single entity having effected a huge accumulation of $Rose (approximately $440M) on chain through Coinbase. To deep dive into this, [check out Ed's thread](https://x.com/ECrypto0/status/1800135721648546253) on Twitter (X).

Favorable market sentiments of ETFs aside, Grayscale's backing of the privacy narrative is well-deserved and timely. Oasis has always been privacy-focused in line with its founder, Prof. Dawn Song's expertise in computer security and decentralized confidentiality. In conclusion, the potential is all there for a blockbuster privacy ETF with an MVP role by Oasis, but nothing is concrete yet. Hopefully, we will hear something positive very soon.

Do discuss in the comments what you like about privacy ETFs, and also what other criteria, metrics, and projects you think would make it more robust and impactful."

Fetch is a platform that provides the tools and infrastructure needed to build an AI-based digital economy, helping to connect people, devices and services, enabling the sharing of data and cooperation. Launched in June 2019, it is a decentralized platform for building and deploying autonomous agents that can be used for a wide range of applications such as supply chain management, logistics, and decentralized finance (DeFi).

The platform helps users build and deploy intelligent and autonomous software agents that can cooperate to provide services to individuals, companies, governments, and other organizations. These agents can interact with each other and with the real world, to perform tasks such as data analysis, prediction, and decision-making.

**Token Utility:**

Services provided by Fetch.ai are paid in the FET token, their cryptocurrency which is the main medium of exchange within the Fetch.ai ecosystem.

**Ocean: Private Data for Building AI Models**

**What is it:**

Private data is considered the most valuable due to its potential to improve research and business outcomes; however, concerns over privacy and control make it difficult to access.

Ocean Protocol’s Compute-to-Data addresses this issue by granting specific access to private data rather than directly sharing it, enabling the data to be used while still maintaining privacy and control.

Ocean Protocol was launched in November 2018, and it aims to make it easy to share and monetize data while ensuring data privacy. On the Ocean platform, data owners can approve the use of AI algorithms on their data, allowing for the training of AI models that can lead to improved predictive accuracy of models and other benefits without compromising the privacy of the data.

**Token Utility:**

The OCEAN token serves as the utility token on the Ocean Protocol, it can be used for staking on data curation and for buying and selling data on the Ocean marketplace.

**Numerai: AI-based Portfolio Management**

**What is it:**

AI-based portfolio management refers to the use of AI algorithms and techniques to manage and optimize investment portfolios. This can include a wide range of activities such as asset selection, risk management, and portfolio rebalancing.

Numerai was launched in 2015 and is a decentralized, artificial intelligence-powered hedge fund that uses machine learning algorithms to make investment decisions.The platform uses a unique approach as it crowdsources predictions from a global community of data scientists and rewards them with its native token, Numeraire (NMR), for making accurate predictions. Numerai then uses these predictions to drive its own trading algorithms.

It is built on the Ethereum blockchain and uses a combination of blockchain and AI technologies to create a decentralized, secure, and transparent system for making predictions and managing investments.

Numerai also allows data scientists to test and refine their models on a confidential and anonymous dataset, while ensuring data security and privacy. Numerai aims to create a more efficient and fair financial system by leveraging the collective intelligence of the community and the power of AI.

**Token Utility:**

The NMR token is used as a means of incentivizing data scientists to submit accurate predictions to the platform, and as a means of accessing the platform’s services.

**Oraichain: Oracle Solution for AI data**

**What is it:**

Smart contracts can currently only access data within their own blockchain and must rely on oracles to access external data from the real world or other platforms in order to perform a wider range of tasks. An oracle is a way for smart contracts to get data and information from the outside world.

Oraichain, launched in 2020, is a blockchain-based ecosystem for decentralized AI, and uses AI and blockchain to create a secure, transparent, and decentralized infrastructure for building and deploying AI applications.

One of the key features of the Oraichain platform is its oracle solution for AI APIs. Its architecture is designed to focus more on AI data sources, allowing for the integration of AI data and services into smart contracts.

This would enable the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) that utilize AI capabilities and the creation of a wider range of AI-based services, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and predictive analytics, and enables the exchange of these services among the participants in the ecosystem.

**Token Utility:**

Apart from staking and governance, the ORAI token is required in order to run an AI request sent to the Oraichain network.

**Alethea AI: AI-powered Image Generator**

**What is it:**

An AI-powered image generator helps to generate new images based on inputs from the user. It can be used for creating digital art, advertising, or even video game assets.

Alethea was launched in 2021 and is an AI-powered image generator based on user input. Alethea AI has introduced CharacterGPT, a Multimodal AI System that generates interactive AI Characters on the blockchain from a description in natural language. In short, CharacterGPT enables Text-to-Character creation.

These AI characters exist on the blockchain as NFTs, and their owners can upgrade their intelligence or be trained in specialized domains, while these NFTs can generate and own AI assets that exist on the protocol.

**Token Utility:**

The AI Protocol utilizes the Artificial Liquid Intelligence (ALI) token to generate these AI character NFTs, upgrade them, and more, on top of being used for governance and to incentivize the various participants of the AI Protocol.

**Hera: AI-powered Pathfinder**

**What is it:**

A pathfinder is an algorithm or system that helps users find the most efficient and profitable trade path when trading on Decentralized Exchanges (DEX).

Hera was launched in 2022 and is a pathfinder algorithm that helps users find the most efficient and profitable trade path when trading on DEXes. The Hera aggregator uses an AI-powered pathfinder which uses machine learning algorithms to analyze trading volumes, prices, and liquidity, to identify the best route for a trade.

This could include identifying the most efficient trading pairs to use and the optimal amounts to trade in order to reduce slippage, which is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual executed price.

The team started on the Metis network; however they are going multichain in 2023 and aims to launch on Arbitrum next.

**Token Utility:**

The Hera token currently shares the protocol revenue and allows for participation in the governance of the project, but in the future will be launching swap fee reduction and airdrops based on the usage of their DEX aggregator.

I started with ETH from Nexo and everything went well with the withdrawal. About 20min later however I noticed my ledger balance was not updating at all and checked on the transaction. Nexo reported it completed 2min after the request. It was then that I discovered something that made my stomach drop. 

Within the same minute as the funds arrived at my ledger address, it was immediately then sent out again to another address. I'm quite freaked out at this stage as I definitely didn't touch my ledger to approve anything of that nature. Ledger Live version is 2.50.1 and ledger nano x firmware on 2.0.2. Never seen anything like this happen. Is it possible that the blackhat elite has finally found some way around hardware wallet confirmations or does anyone potentially know where it could have gone **automatically** (and hopefully I'm just being a moron)

OpenAI’s ChatGPT causes Artificial Intelligence token prices to surge by up to 77%.,coingecko,zksfow,2022-12-13 05:24:56,6,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/coingecko/comments/zksfow/openais_chatgpt_causes_artificial_intelligence/,coingecko,,"&#x200B;

Is AI bullish on crypto? OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which was launched at the end of November, caused Artificial Intelligence-related token prices to surge within a week. DeepBrain Chain ([DBC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/deepbrain-chain)) jumped the most at 76.7%, and Numeraire ([NMR](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/numeraire)) rose 54.5%.

But not all tokens won big, and the hype-based pump looks unlikely to be sustainable.

"Market Update: Bitcoin And Ethereum Struggles To Recover, AR And NMR Soars Significantly",czcalls,vrazar,2022-07-04 12:15:07,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/czcalls/comments/vrazar/market_update_bitcoin_and_ethereum_struggles_to/,montorul,,"https://bit.ly/3A5SXOQ

Despite the market condition, top currencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, struggle to regain their values. On the other hand, some altcoins, AR, and NMR are showing a significant gain charm over 14-days.

Since the Fed Reserve decided to raise interest rates and the May inflation report, Bitcoin has been floating in a small zone between $19,000 and $20,000. Thus, it is difficult for it to recover any significant upward pace.

Bitcoin, the most valuable cryptocurrency, has dropped more than 70% in value since peaking at $67,000 in November 2021.

However, according to CoinGecko data, BTC is now trading at $19,500 and has experienced losses of 7.8% and 5.4% during the last 7 and 14 days, respectively.

Senior market analyst at the foreign exchange trading firm Oanda, Edward Moya, claims that Bitcoin is under pressure and finding it difficult to hold onto the $20,000 level.

 BTC is currently trading above the $19,500 level on the hourly chart | Source: BTC/USD price char from Tradingview.com Ethereum had a successful year in 2021, reaching an all-time high price of $4850 in November. But since last month, the price of Ethereum, which had a great November like bitcoin, has been floating between $1,100 and $1,000.

Meanwhile, it made an effort and struggled to recoup its value, but the price of Ethereum couldn’t rise beyond $1,100. CoinGecko data shows ETH is currently trading at $1,073.58, and in the past 7 and 14 days, ETH has lost 10.6% and 0.6% of its value, respectively.

 Significant Growth in AR and NMR Arweave (AR), one of the top 100 crypto assets by performance and market capitalization, is booming, while two of the most popular currencies are faltering. Per the statistics from CoinGecko, AR has reached $11 and increased by 10% in one day, 15% in seven days, and 32% in fourteen.

A decentralized storage network, Arweave aims to provide a platform for the long-term archival of data. The Arweave network pays “miners” to keep the network’s data permanently stored using its native coin, named AR.

Similarly, Numeraire (NMR) is also leading in week gainers. It displays a noteworthy increase of 122% over a week. NMR is currently trading at $19.37, per the statistics of Coinmarketcap.

Additionally, during the previous 14 days, Numeraire has outperformed the rest of the cryptocurrency market and made massive gains, increasing by about 16% over the past day. As a result, trade volumes have exploded, according to CoinGecko.

Since its peak in May last year, NMR has dropped by 79%. It is, however, showing an uptrend at the moment, which may help it rise over these prior lows.

Moreover, some other coins are showing positive vibes, including TerraUSD with a gain of 17% during the last 24 hours, RUNE showing a 13% gain in the previous 24 hours, Celsius with 15% in the same period, and CEEK with 15%.

Stratis (STRAX) Soars 200% From June Low On Sky Dream Mall Launch,czcalls,vohfly,2022-06-30 16:00:58,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/czcalls/comments/vohfly/stratis_strax_soars_200_from_june_low_on_sky/,montorul,,"https://bit.ly/3A5SXOQ

After the news of the launch of the Sky Dream Mall metaverse and Stratis GBP stablecoin, the price of STRAX increased by 200% from its low of $0.365 on June 15 to its high of $1.20 on June 29, according to data from coinmarketcap. The price dropped the next day and is currently trading at $1.09, although it is still up from its low.

The record high for STRAX was $22.77 on January 8, 2018, more than four years ago. However, the coin’s record low was $0.011 on August 12, 2016, approximately six years ago.

In spite of the overall market downturn, per the CoinGecko information, Stratis, a blockchain-as-a-service platform, witnessed a notable gain in volume. And among STRAX, Numeraire (NMR) is another coin that shows a notable gain of 201.1% in the seven-day chart. NMR is an Ethereum token that fuels Numerai (a San Francisco-based hedge fund). 

Since Stratis has a comparatively strong growth momentum and increased by more than 140.9% over seven days, it is defying expectations in the current bear market. The term “bear market” so refers to a market where commodities or securities’ values are consistently decreasing.

 Reasons Behind STRAX Price Spike This Week Currently, two of the factors are driving the increase in STRAX’s price this week. The first is the Stratis GBP stablecoin announcement, and the second is the Sky Dream Mall metaverse launch.

 STRAX is currently trading at $1.05 on the daily chart | Source: STRAX /USD chart from Tradingview.com In a blog post published three days ago, Stratis said that it is making progress in its attempts to introduce the Stratis GBP stablecoin:

Plans to launch a Great British Pound Token (GBPT) stable coin using Stratis technology are progressing with ‘Stratis Investment Group Limited,’ a new entity created that will be used for the Stratis GBP stablecoin.

However, Price Waterhouse Coopers (PwC), according to the company, is assisting it in obtaining the necessary licenses from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

The post also stated that blockchain technology offers a significant chance to streamline cross-border and wholesale payments as organizations like Visa are becoming more open to accepting stable coin payments.

Polycarbon Games announced on Twitter on June 25:

Sky Dream Mall, a metaverse powered by Stratis Blockchain Coming soon! 

The idea of Stratis launching the metaverse front could also be a major motivator behind widespread acceptance in the cryptocurrency industry.

While a few individuals concentrate on the benefit this metaverse will offer, a far more significant number is intrigued by the possibility of financial gain from a metaverse investment.

Investors cannot ignore the fact that Stratis is establishing itself with Sky Dream Mall as a major player who will be important in the developing Web3.0 world.

"Trading for AGLD, API3, LDO and More Starts May 5 – Deposit Now!",Kraken,ujoblp,2022-05-06 10:09:43,7,0.9,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kraken/comments/ujoblp/trading_for_agld_api3_ldo_and_more_starts_may_5/,kraken-frankie,Announcement,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7yr30og64vx81.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5d544a67a32133b77fb88dc1e0ec587707a98f5

We’re thrilled to announce that Kraken now supports **Adventure Gold (AGLD), API3 (API3), Lido DAO (LDO), Numeraire (NMR), iExec (RLC), KeeperDAO (ROOK), Threshold Network (T)** and **Wrapped Ether (WETH)!**

### Funding and Trading

Funding is live, and trading will begin on May 5 at approximately 14:30 UTC. Keep an eye on the [status page](https://status.kraken.com/) for updates.

You can add these tokens to your Kraken account by navigating to [**Funding**](https://www.kraken.com/u/funding), selecting the asset, and hitting **Deposit**. Deposits require **20 confirmations** (\~5 minutes).

All tokens are tradeable against **USD** and **EUR** on [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) and the [Kraken Pro](https://trade.kraken.com/) interface with the following price precisions and minimum deposits:  


|**Asset**|**Price precision**|**Minimum deposit**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|AGLD|4|10 AGLD|
|API3|3|2 API3|
|LDO|3|12 LDO|
|NMR|2|0.6 NMR|
|RLC|4|6 RLC|
|ROOK|2|0.2 ROOK|
|T|5|70 T|
|WETH|**Funding Only**|0.004 WETH|

&#x200B;

**Note:**

* **Adventure Gold (AGLD), Numeraire (NMR), KeeperDAO (ROOK) trading is not available to residents of the United States, Canada and Japan.** 
* **Trading via Kraken App and Instant Buy will be available once the liquidity conditions are met** *(when a sufficient number of buyers and sellers have entered the market for their orders to be efficiently matched).*

Here’s what you need to know about the assets:

**Adventure Gold (AGLD) –** AGLD is the native ERC-20 token of the Loot non-fungible token (NFT) collection. Loot is a text-based, community driven on-chain adventure game that is continuously developed by its network of token holders. AGLD was airdropped to Loot NFT holders and could potentially be used as the project’s in-game currency.

**API3 (API3) –** API3 is a platform for decentralized API services enabling the Web3 infrastructure. API3 data feeds are served and governed in a decentralized manner using its Airnode network of severless oracles. API3 token is the governance token of the network, allowing its holders the opportunity to participate in the future development of the platform.

**Lido DAO (LDO) –** Lido is a liquid staking solution for Ethereum. Lido lets users continue to use their staked ETH for other on-chain actions, like providing collateral for a DeFi loan. LDO, Lido’s native token, can empower holders to vote on governance proposals such as fee parameters and other protocol updates.

**Numeraire (NMR) –** Numeraire is an Ethereum-based blockchain utilizing AI to open-source the creation of stock market prediction models. By crowd-sourcing strategies, Numeraire aims to incentivize a global network of data scientists to create new financial models, which compete against each other for the chance to be rewarded in bitcoin. NMR token holders can choose to stake their tokens with different models, for the chance to receive more NMR tokens in return.

**iExec (RLC) –**  iExec is an open-source, decentralized cloud computing marketplace, running on Ethereum blockchain. iExec allows decentralized applications (dApps) to gain on-demand access to computing resources and technologies. RLC is an ERC-20 token for the iExec platform which allows users to monetize and rent computing power and data.

**KeeperDAO (ROOK) –** KeeperDAO aims to make DeFi more secure, profitable and fair. KeeperDAO plans to make DeFi more accessible by redistributing on-chain profit (known as Maximal Extractable Value or *MEV*) back to network participants. ROOK is an ERC-20 token that lets holders propose and vote on protocol upgrades. ROOK holders can also decide the profit share between liquidity providers and users.

**Threshold Network (T) –** Threshold Network aims to allow smart contracts to more easily access and manage private encrypted data. The Threshold Network is built on a set of ‘keeps,’ which are off-chain storehouses for encrypted data. T allows token holders to earn yields from staking T and providing T as collateral, as well as the right  to vote on governance proposals raised on the Threshold Network.

**Wrapped Ether (WETH) –** Wrapped Ether allows Ethereum’s native token Ether (ETH), which was developed prior to the ERC-20 token standard, to be traded, lent and borrowed on any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. wETH tokens are identical in value to ETH tokens and can be redeemed for ETH at any time.

### Will Kraken list more assets?

Yes! But our policy is to never reveal any details until shortly before launch – not even which assets we are considering. All of Kraken’s listed tokens are available on our website, and all future tokens will be announced on Kraken’s blog and social media profiles. Our client engagement specialists cannot answer any questions about which assets we may be listing in the future. 

### Trade with caution

There is no guarantee that a limit order will execute. There is also no guarantee of executing at a certain price for a market order. The availability and liquidity of the particular digital asset will impact these types of orders.

Listing an asset or token for trade is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or participate in the associated network. Do your own research and invest at your own risk."
