Questions For The AMA,Plutus_Uncensored,1i896k6,2025-01-23 12:46:29,22,1.0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Plutus_Uncensored/comments/1i896k6/questions_for_the_ama/,Rare-Log968,,"I don't see that anyone has posted any questions for the AMA upcoming on Saturday, nor really seen it mentioned since the initial discussion.  The host did put out a call for questions, so I've come up with a few:

Customers:

How many “fully active” customers do you have (by this I mean customers having an active subscription and making a card transaction within the past 30 days)?

If this figure is materially different from the “nearly 150,000” customers you claim to have, why make this claim?

Is it legal under the UK Consumer Rights Act 2015 and Equality Act 2010 to intentionally filter out customers based on perceived intelligence or ""persona type"" as part of a business strategy?


FCA:

Why are you not FCA registered?

Given you are not regulated by the FCA, why do you claim that customers have a right to refer complaints to the FOS, when in reality they can’t.

What progress has been made on obtaining FCA registration since your initial application in May 2022,  specifically Key milestones achieved and expected timeline for completion?

Now that you’re removing in-app PLU from stacking requirements, presumably you’ll be seeking FCA regulation before offering any promotions which require increasing/maintaining a stacking level, as these will now be promoting cryptocurrency rather than a “reward token”?

Given you are not regulated by the FCA, and you claim to be a ""regulated financial institution"", who provides this regulation? (from /u/MrSpaceCool )

T&Cs:

You retroactively applied the October Terms changes to PLU rewards earned before the changes came into effect. What legal basis supports this retroactive application?

Several operational changes have been implemented without corresponding updates to Terms & Conditions, including: restriction on what can be done with PLU tokens after payout, prohibition of considering PLU as cashback, requirements to be a “productive” customer. How do you justify implementing these changes without formal term updates?

Where are the new T&Cs, necessary to remove internal PLU from stacking benefits?  The new T&Cs were promised in January, but you have announced the change will be applied from 20th February - already less than a 30 day notice period away.

These upcoming changes have been announced as affecting emission and redemption rates of the PLU token, though no mention has been made of existing holdings. How will existing PLU holdings be treated under the new £10 ""intrinsic value"" system?

Will the new T&Cs be fully updated with all newly announced restrictions?  Will they remove non-existent FOS rights? And what Alternative Dispute Resolution scheme will replace them?


Gift Cards:

The whitepaper specifically name-checks Amazon as being one of the gift cards available - why are they not?

The whitepaper (and later documents) clearly show one PLU can be turned into one £10 voucher, or higher values in multiples thereof.  Why now charge £9 and 0.1PLU for a £10 voucher?  Why set the “buy cost” higher than you claim the vouchers are actually worth (an £8.50 average cost)?


Fees:

Why increase the payout fee from a £15 “gas fee” (which is ~10 times higher than the actual gas fee) to a punitive 33%?  This is a change to the fee schedule (part of the T&Cs), so why was this not announced in advance?

How much have these additional fees added to the withdrawal costs of customers who were refused a £15 payout, but granted a 33% payout?

You have stated that dynamic fees ""help change the way product is used."" Could you explain how this aligns with your original product promises, the impact on customers who purchased premium services based on those promises and your approach to compensating affected customers?


Roadmap/Plan Updates:

Can we have updates on the below:

“Temporary” restriction of fiat withdrawal in December 2023.

UK Dex “paused” in 2021

Automate payouts of PLU Rewards (one of your “personal goals” for 2023)

“Smart Audits (upload receipts)” - due within “months” a year ago

Network migration (“aiming for 2024”)

Apple Pay

Direct Debits + Cashback on them

US launch (expected Q1 2023)


Misc:

The PLU token was seemingly the target of a pump and dump scheme on the 19th of January.  How much did Block Code Limited and/or their employees/representatives benefit from this?  I’m not implying they were in any way responsible (I don’t believe they are), but they presumably sold at least some of the tokens bought during the pump at an inflated price.

Why did you remove the Pluton Loyalty Rewards: Forgetting 'Crypto Cashback' post from your blog?



I don't use X, so won't be able to ask any of these questions myself, but I'd love to hear the answers, so I'm hoping someone will bring them to the attention of the host, or ask for me themselves if they get chance."
Best way to buy PLU?,plutus,1i0dysc,2025-01-13 08:30:21,0,0.14,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/plutus/comments/1i0dysc/best_way_to_buy_plu/,InnerAbrocoma9880,Discussion,"I want to buy some more PLU to stack to get a higher level, but the Pluton app doesn't yet support direct purchases (at least not in the UK)?

I know you need to connect a wallet with PLU in it, but have people worked out the cheapest way to buy and move PLU without incurring loads of fees? I have Coinbase One, so I was just thinking of buying a load of PLU within Coinbase with spot trading and then moving the PLU to a wallet to connect to Plutus.

I did look into buying directly from a wallet (i.e. Phantom) but the fees were super high.

Any help appreciated."

I am sure everyone knows Koin - the one guy in Plutus that used to provide ""price predictions"" for PLU (Pluton), that all of them were failed... Supposedly PLU was gonna moon in price in the meantime we see the opposite. 

Worst of everything? Koin is able to withdraw to this day - Using other stackers as ""Exit-Liquidity"".

How can that be proven? Koin called a few ""offensive names"" to Danial...

And now he is trying to hide the truth about it. 

He even threatened to call the police to whoever leaked the information! Calling the police for what? For you scamming other customers?

Koin, you're just like Danial, Plutus & everyone else. You're part of their ""scam"" and you shall be held accountable for that. 

Also important to note:

After an exchange between me and Koin - he tried to provide an ""argument"" that made no sense, an argument that was easily countered and he didn't feel satisfied with that and so he blocked me, he changed ideas though and unblocked me, then responded to my comment, blocked me again and unblocked me now, he seems a very indecisive guy of what he really wants to do

Anyways truth to be told and main point here: Plutus allows him to withdraw, while they don't let others withdraw and meanwhile Koin uses those others as exit liquidity. "
Plutus Responded to my Trustpilot Review,Plutus_Uncensored,1hlxnsy,2024-12-25 04:32:43,28,0.94,6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hlxnsy,WingyAngel,,"Hello,

As some of you know, recently Plutus has made TrustPilot remove one of my reviews because I included the CEO name and some of the others who do not really use real names like ""Yogi""

Of course, as we know, Plutus is doing this to their benefit of trying to hide the truth which is already exposed out there.

I've done another review and sorta changed the game and one of the terms that I used was ""CEO"" without Danial's name. In their response however, they said our ""CEO Danial"" which, is of course - contradictive on why they try to remove some of the reviews ""they can do it, but we can't"", of course I know Trustpilot is a platform that is more beneficial to their actual customer, than us reviewers. 

But hey, they responded some ""trash"", saying I could unfollow & block Danial if I wanted and if his content wasn't for me, which realistically I made a new review saying we are in ""investigation mode"" after their scam & of course they gave me all that crap saying ""pay-outs"" are enabled and that I should adhere to the ToS. 

Of course, little do they know, I don't really have an account anymore, so it just proves on how basic of a reply they provide and how easy it is to prove their reply is bullshit, considering they are like ""we lifted your restrictions"", yet... I don't have an account anymore which also had some small ""Internal PLU"" in it, that was used for ""Adolf Yogurt, Lolian and Actimel""

Another part that is interesting as usual, they mention Danial has been ""openly addressing industry challenges"", when that's purely a lie based he can't even address his own product, he is actively scamming people and he threw shade at Tether and Bitcoin, when deapite whatever flaws they have, Pluton is just way much worst and it's not even crypto with their platform anymore but more of them begging you to deposit your money in their ""fake-lottery"" that eats up your FIAT, mostly all benefiting Block Code/Plutus.

I'll leave the screenshots in this post with the reviews, as usual. "

I am around break even now.  I still do not agree that I had to pay the 570€ payout fee because it was not communicated and was not displayed. But at least I have the PLU. Sadly, the price has dropped since a few days have passed."

The Joke of The Flat Service Fee of 30% for Plutus Gift Cards That isn't Flat and isn't 30%,Plutus_Uncensored,1h8eco7,2024-12-06 18:03:12,19,1.0,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Plutus_Uncensored/comments/1h8eco7/the_joke_of_the_flat_service_fee_of_30_for_plutus/,TightAsF_ck,,"I saw the £1 for a month Starter Plan and the promise of access to the Plutus Giftcard offering. Thought I would try and redeem the 101 Pluton I had stuck in the app (even though I have emailed no less than 3 times to cancel my account, they still have not done so).

Anyway, this is from the Plutus Giftcard terms:

> 4. Service Fees
>
> 4.1. Any applicable service fees for redeeming PLU via PlutusGift will be clearly displayed in the app before completing a transaction.
>
> 4.2. By proceeding with a redemption, you acknowledge and accept the fees as displayed at the time of the transaction.
>
> 4.3. **A flat services fee of 30%** applies to transactions and a 10% or more may be charged for high volume transactions, with such adjustments clearly notified within the app.
>
> 4.4 Fees are subject to change at any time without prior notice; however, all applicable fees will be transparently displayed in the app prior to the completion of any transaction.


30% they say. Flat, they say. 

Here's my version:

* Pay £1.
* Transfer £30 into my account. I can redeem for 10x £10 giftcards right? Flat fee of 30% = £3 per giftcard, right? Wrong.

Giftcard 1 fee: £3

Giftcard 2 fee: £3

Giftcard 3 fee: £3

Giftcard 4 fee: £4

Giftcard 5 fee: £4

Giftcard 6 fee: £4

Giftcard 7 fee: £4

Giftcard 8 fee: £4

Giftcard 9 fee: £4 (I topped up some more here)

Giftcard 10 fee: £4

Giftcard 11 fee: £5

Giftcard 12 fee: £5

Giftcard 13 fee: £5

Giftcard 14 fee: £5

Giftcard 15 fee: £5

Giftcard 16 fee: £5

**This is neither flat, nor 30%.**

£63 for £160 giftcards. +£1 fee. It's currently on 42%, and would keep rising if I bought any more.

And at 16 PLU redeemed, I've ran out of decent giftcards to buy. Anymore and I'd just be paying 50%+ fee for crap I do not want or need. 

I got M&S (can get 4 of these as there two different versions), Morrisons, Love2Shop, YouChoose, Iceland, Farm foods and B&M.

My advice: pay the £1. Redeem for the decent giftcards, and then try and cancel your account again.

First of all, thanks for all your inputs. I'm having the same issue with Coinbase. I can't seem to figure out how to get an address on Coinbase for a wallet that is connected for stacking. I researched a lot, but maybe it's just common sense for most people and it's not explained anywhere i searched. I have that Coinbase wallet i got described in this guide: [https://medium.com/@0xTigerLionFox/withdrawing-plutus-rewards-plu-directly-to-an-exchange-1536b48b32e5](https://medium.com/@0xTigerLionFox/withdrawing-plutus-rewards-plu-directly-to-an-exchange-1536b48b32e5) but nothing else. Do you have any advice on how where to look up the wallet that is connected for stacking. Thanks!

Coinbase has a wallet extension that allows you to generate your own crypto wallet. [https://www.coinbase.com/wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)



Once you generate your own wallet address you can then connect it just like you would a metamask wallet. [https://www.plutus.it/help/connecting-your-wallet-for-plu-stacking](https://www.plutus.it/help/connecting-your-wallet-for-plu-stacking)

Thank you so much for the explanation! After like 2 hours of tinkering around with this I finally got it. I added the chrome extension, created a wallet, copied my coinbase wallet ETH address, went to plutus->Connect wallet and added it, went to the Pluton tab, clicked payout, put in the value and then it has like a dropdown where I had the other coinbase wallet from the [medium.com](http://medium.com) article above but the dropdown doesn't seem to work. Somehow i was able to select the new coinbase wallet ETH address and did the payout. The 15€ were deducted so it think all went well. <- just describing all of this so everybody like me that has little experience with this can follow along.



Now after the pluton is transferred to this coinbase wallet do I just send it to my ""normal"" coinbase wallet through the coinbase wallet extension by clicking on ""Send""?

Yes, once the PLU has arrived in your coinbase wallet extension (a wallet you personally own), you simply have yo use the send function to send it to your usual PLU deposit address on coinbase. Note that you will need some ethereum on your new personal wallet to be able to send the PLU (2-3eur at most of eth should be fine)

You are a legend! Thanks for all the help. I had already seen that I'll Need ETH and bought 10€ on my Coinbase account. I guess I will have to send it to the coinbase wallet extension when the PLU arrives there. Thank you again, if it weren't for you helping me navigate this maze, I'll probably had just given up and left my PLU there.

Yesterday (18 days later) the money was there. Just to help anyone else: I linked my coinbase with the coinbase wallet a choose ""cash out"" (send the PLU to my coinbase account and convert it to EUR) and it asked me how i want to pay for the ETH gas fees. I choose to pay with my eth in my coinbase account (6EUR worth of ETH) and it transferred the ETH to the wallet and sent the PLU to my normal coinbase account and converted it into EUR all in one go. I did the cash out to EUR because while i was doing this, the PLU price went from 1.8eur to 2.42eur and I assumed it would not get this high again. I could be wrong but I got more money out with the 2.42eur than i ever thought I would get, so all good for me.

StarLines thanks again for everything. I will never get a cashback card with this level of complexity ever again! :D

___________________________________________

Hello Coffeezilla, Moderators of Coffeezilla Subreddit and everyone else from the whole world no matter where you are, I am sharing this post here that was shared on PlutusUncensored Subreddit by another user (StuxR). As I want it to be spread, as much as possible.

I think, it's important to mention additionally has it's been spread by other users - Some users that were refunded their FIAT (not everyone!!), for the Metal Card - were refunded through Plutus UK Bank Account and the FIAT that has been taken back in the days for the Metal Card - was also taken directly from their Modulr Account which is weird considered they said they don't have access to Plutus Customer Funds.

Considering everything, what's happening is weird - Pluton being dumped straight away for USDT (Tether), which is a currency Danial also despises a lot, supposedly. But I guess since, it is dumping customer funds, it's all fine for them.

If in some way, everyone else can and keeps investigating them and spreading the word, it's all appreciated."

They state 60 million card spend in two months. No surprises there, this is in line with appx 90-100 million quarterly we have seen in reports 8, 7, 6…

However, they only mention 2,5 million USD worth PLU awarded, which would be less than 4 per quarter, lower than previous 5-6% reward rate. In previous reports, this numbers appears to have been reported on PLU value at the time when it was awarded, not the price when reconciling.

On the other hand, if you look at the awarded 1,637,404.88 PLU… the price in March / April was above 5 USD/PLU! Which was over 8 million USD at that time. So, this leads to 13,6% award rate on spend. That cannot be correct, can it?"
Plutus - Ambassador Acting Like Danial,Plutus_Uncensored,1gk1j93,2024-11-05 02:43:21,27,0.97,14,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gk1j93,WingyAngel,,"As some of you, who probably saw the ""interview"" which, I'd like to call it a ""confrontation"" between Danial & Coffeezilla - we all probably remember this moment where Danial told Coffee, that he should publicly apologize for what he was saying to him.

Yesterday, I sent a screenshot someone had sent me about this same Ambassador (Himmel) supposedly selling PLU, I tried to nicely ask about it. 

Funny part is - he tried to contradict me with arguments that really didn't answer my question, it was more of cold attacking me for no reason. 

Then he pulled a Danial and asked me ""to delete my messages"" to which I said, I wouldn't as it would remove the context to the conversation and the proof, where I wasn't even mean to him. Anyways, problem is - This is similar to what Danial said to Coffee and how this Ambassador is reacting to me. 

So question is - Does Himmel want to become the next ""Volunteer paid moderator""? Does he want to get hired to be Plutus Staff for being exactly like Danial in a way? He also reminds me of Iulian, so I really wonder if he is just undercover staff doing empty threats. "

[Yesterday's AMA](https://twitter.com/DDhopn/status/1851236365419098575) was maddening to me, but I can imagine someone who's not experienced this cycle before might view CEO Danial Daychopan as a plucky try-hard who is at least trying to reach some kind of goal.

**DON'T BE FOOLED!**

> ""If you've been with us for a while you know what we're about""

This encourages new listeners that all is not what it seems. That current tribulations are just some kind of temporary stepping stone to a master plan. This is *bollocks* - I have been with Plutus for 2.5 years. I very much DO know what they're about. Try talking to someone who has been here since the 2015 ICO and swapped $ETH for $PLU and see how they feel.

> ""The past model was build on sand. New one is sustainable""

In 2.5 years I have been through 5 (!) cycles of: old model bad (""unsustainable""), new model good (""sustainable""). It's an endless cycle of bullshit that lets Dan and his team avoid accountability. Makes the users think that NOW it's sorted, and this is the end of the broken promises, that utility is coming, when really it's a repeating loop. Here's a timeline:

**1) Rewards 2.0** (Q1 2022)

This is when I joined. Like many Plutus users, I fled Crypto.com after they slashed their cashback card rewards, and this looked like the Next Big Thing. Plutus in 2015 was very different. I wasn't here, but if you dig out their [first whitepaper](https://www.scribd.com/document/653445776/white-paper-plutus) it's... weird. In 2022 when I joined they had just released 'Rewards 2022' - [Here's the model in Dan's words](https://medium.com/plutus/announcement-rewards-accounts-2-0-model-details-e3738f9f6d3c)

This model was active for over a year. Dan always argued it was sustainable:

> PLU has a low circulating supply and a large reward pool by design, it also has a progressive emission reduction based on demand. As result, **it can last from several decades to more than 100 years**. 
[source](https://twitter.com/DDhopn/status/1524997360207769601)

In early 2023, he re-iterated this:

> **How Are PLU Rewards Sustainable?**
> The rate of users stacking PLU (i.e. demand) has outpaced the rate of new PLU entering circulation (i.e. circulating supply) in the past 12 months. This is a crucial metric that we monitor.
> As a result, we have continued to see stable and **sustained** growth of PLU Rewards over the last 3 years since Rewards 2.0 (November 2020).
[source](https://medium.com/plutus/sustainability-of-plu-rewards-bb8ca4d1814a)

**2) Difficulty Adjustment** (Q3 2023)

...in the same article he goes on to introduce the proposed **Difficulty Adjustment** model:

> The Difficulty Adjustment is crucial for the longevity of the reward pool, as it limits the emission of PLU by reducing the number of users who can easily reach higher reward levels that emit more PLU. With the current trajectory, the reward pool is expected to last for more than 20 years, **but we anticipate it will exceed 100 years** as the token becomes even scarcer due to its unique use-case within the Plutus app.

Note that ""100 years"" line again from Rewards 2.0. He loves this line. Every model can last 100 years, until it can't, but the next model *will*!

The Difficulty Adjustment (DA) comes in to effect July 2023. It's a bunch of bullshit that that immediately devalues $PLU as it reduces the stacking power, causing emitted rewards to spike. A child could see that's what would happen, and Dan was warned by the users. Still, he continues down this path, and does another DA round in Oct 2023, which devalues PLU further. Eventually he reverts it and we move on to the next model:

**3) Self-sustaining perks** (Q4 2023)

This time companies are paying Plutus for the honour of having a few 1000 clickthroughs by buying up $PLU. No, I don't understand what they get out it either. As far as I know, the only company that they ever confirm doing this are Curve, for which (for various boring reasons) membership is practically a requirement of using Plutus in the first place:

> The outcome contributes to a **self-sustaining rewards model** where customers effortlessly earn rewards through their Plutus Card shopping, which are then recycled back into the Pluton Rewards Pool to be earned again, significantly increasing its longevity and reducing the circulating supply.
[source](https://medium.com/plutus/plu-utility-self-sufficient-perks-6f4c9b7c8aaf)

Oh, so NOW it's sustainable? This time? Great!

**4) Redeem** (Q4 2023)

Rather than finally learning that devaluing stacking ROI > devalues $PLU > increases emissions > $PLU runs out sooner, Dan continues down the path of ROI nerfs with 'Redeem'. By sending $PLU back to the reward pool, one can increase their monthly cashback limit (""rewards cap""). Sounds good? Not really, because the default cashback limits are slashed so you're essentially paying additional $PLU to get what you previously got with your subscription. But anyway, here's Dan again:

> Today, we are proud to unveil our initial plans for **self-sustaining rewards**, an iteration of our Subscription plans and Rewards Levels.
[source](https://medium.com/plutus/important-update-subscription-reward-levels-811ea430b02a)

Wow, self-sustaining? *For me*?!

**5) 2024 White Paper** (present)

The 2024 White Paper had sweeping changes - the CRY %apr stuff, the 'utility' through giftcards/airmiles (which I note are not here still), unlimited reward pool (dream on). Too much to go through, but ""sustainability"" was a big part of it: https://www.plutus.it/blog/fact-check-debunking-common-myths - '**sustainable**'/'**sustainability**' mentioned 7(!) times.

Do you get it yet?

> Long-Term Operational Capability: The uncapped supply ensures that **the system can remain operational 100 years from now**
[source](https://www.plutus.it/blog/fact-check-debunking-common-myths)

There's ""100 years"" again! I'm going *insane*

And even that White Paper model hasn't lasted! He's already brought in huge (100%!) fees for PlutusSwap (swap $PLU for $), and he revealed in the AMA last night that the much-vaunted PLU to Gift Cards utility would have some kind of fee involved, neither of which were mentioned in the White Paper. I can ASSURE you that this time next year he will have moved onto something else - that the White Paper model was bad and that the new one fixes it. 

Every time this cycle continues, Dan convinces new users that *THIS TIME* it's going to work, that *THIS TIME* utility is coming. *NOW* is the time to jump in, get a subscription, to invest in $PLU, create your 5 year plan spreadsheet, and work the system, only to have it ripped up months later, leaving bag-holders trapped in something they didn't sign up to.

PLU ,Plutus_Uncensored,1gep0fw,2024-10-29 03:33:17,25,0.97,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Plutus_Uncensored/comments/1gep0fw/plu/,Equivalent_Sweet_962,,"Now that the whole scheme is unraveling, let’s review one of the fundamental parts of what went wrong. This is probably one of the root causes behind all the censorship, slowing down withdrawals and removing cryptocurrency elements from the T&C.

Pluton ERC20 token has a hard limit of 20 million tokens based on smart contract Block Code defined in the beginning. This cannot be changed. The latest reconciliation report only covers until February, leaving a bit less than 12M in the reward pool.

The internal PLU stack is off-chain. It is just a number on database. Only a withdrawal to customer’s wallet converts this liability to a real cryptocurrency. 

The reconciliation reports 6, 7 and 8 show a steady state of 100 million USDT card spend of 5-6 million USDT rewards each quarter (5,42 million in the latest). 8 months have passed, so we can assume appx. 15 million USD worth PLU rewards since then. With a price of 2 USDT/PLU, that is about 7,5 million PLU.

So, reconciliation until today would leave appx. 4,5 million PLU in the reward pool. This is worth about 8 million USDT right now. If the price remains at 1,86 level,  this will last until 14th of March, ceteris paribus. If price goes further down, faster. If price goes below 1 USD, the end of the year could mark a moment when more PLU is awarded than what exists."

Trend Following Analysis of Pluton (PLU) Cryptocurrency  
  
Abstract  
  
This study presents a comprehensive analysis of trend following strategies applied to Pluton (PLU), a notable cryptocurrency within the burgeoning digital asset market. The research delves into historical price trends, identifying key periods of bull and bear markets to assess the efficacy of trend following techniques such as moving averages, Bollinger Bands, and the Parabolic SAR. Through detailed case studies, the analysis explores both successful and failed trend following trades, providing insights into optimal entry and exit points, risk management, and the psychological aspects of trading PLU. The study also incorporates external influences like market sentiment from social media platforms and regulatory news, which significantly impact PLU's price movements. By comparing PLU's performance against other cryptocurrencies under similar trend following methodologies, this research offers a nuanced understanding of PLU's market behavior. The findings suggest that while trend following can yield substantial profits, it requires disciplined execution and continuous adaptation to the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets. This abstract encapsulates the broader implications of trend following in cryptocurrency trading, with a specific focus on PLU, highlighting its potential as a case study for future trend analysis in digital currencies.

This is new. I have not seen this mentioned before. Another sneaky change!

This is from the post titled ""Everyone is an idiot except me"" - [https://x.com/plutus/status/1833551919056306479](https://x.com/plutus/status/1833551919056306479)"
Some observations.,Plutus_Uncensored,1fbs8z6,2024-09-08 03:30:16,7,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Plutus_Uncensored/comments/1fbs8z6/some_observations/,RattyDAVE,,"I am looking at [https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/pluton/richlist/](https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/pluton/richlist/)



Assuming 75% of the PLU is stored in self custody, and only looking at 52 wallets.

4 of the wallets are known exchange wallets so we can remove them as we know they will not be tied to personal accounts.

So that leaves 52 wallets. And then ignoring anything over 100000 as they are most likely wallets containing PLU for the running of Plutus.  

  
This then leaves me with:

* Legend 10000 - 25 Accounts
* Myth 20000 - 6 Accounts
* Goat 30000 - 3 Accounts
* Honey Badger 40000 (Up to 100000 PLU) - 6 Accounts



This is Far below what I expected!

""So this is the currently described process: ""Plutus rewards payouts occur monthly. You receive a percentage back of the card purchases you made during the previous month, according to the rewards cap set by your subscription plan. The rewards are credited to your account as Pluton (PLU) tokens.  Rewards are calculated and distributed at the beginning of each month, for the purchases made in the previous month.

Your PLU Rewards are generated in Pending status, and after they are verified, they get updated to Available status. This typically happens at the 45-day mark after they have been generated."""

Man muss beachten Pluton befindet sich gerade auf dem niedrigsten Stand seit 1,5 Jahren. Habe es nach aktuellem Stand trotzdem auf 1600 € Cashback mit 394 PLU geschafft. Der Rest ist noch locked.

Wenn es wieder auf einen Preis von 1,5 Jahren gehen sollte mit 9€ wären das wieder meine aktuelle 454 PLU über 4080€ Wert.

Es ist immerhin 
Eine hübsche Summe. Das Geld habe ich ja sowieso ausgegeben. Deshalb netter Bonus.
Auscashen lohnt sich mmn nicht mehr da wir gerade am Tiefststand sind. In ca. 4-5 Monaten müsste ich sie nächste Stufe erreichen für 6% Cashback.

Rewards Pool | Balance Reconciliation #7,plutus,1bm112c,2024-03-23 15:47:01,16,0.71,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/plutus/comments/1bm112c/rewards_pool_balance_reconciliation_7/,PPJ87,Announcement,"
**Background - what is “Balance Reconciliation”**

Plutus customers earn PLU from spending; this is emitted from the Pluton Rewards Pool. As this remains locked in cold storage, the amount of PLU awarded to customers has to be reconciled onto a Corporate hot wallet to be distributed.

This process is checked and confirmed by an independent external accountant and auditor (Haggards Crowther).

at some point in Q4 we will have the [new reward levels and accounts](https://medium.com/plutus/pluton-new-reward-levels-accounts-f51993efc8ed); 4 stacking tiers has become 7, and the subscription plans AND stacking tiers have independent cashback limits, which combine. i would suggest now that it is *impossible* to understand or explain this offering without a spreadsheet, and, well, [look at it](https://www.reddit.com/r/plutus/comments/15p4yjp/one_table_to_rule_them_all/). can you imagine trying to explain this to a friend? or a parent? how on earth will plutus advertise this system?

now we have [metal cards](https://medium.com/plutus/plutus-metal-supercharged-rewards-e7fdbebd2ffa), which, rather than being just... metal cards... is yet ANOTHER layer of complexity in this impossible matrix with 3 new levels (""bundles""), granting certain rewards. there are [spreadsheets for this also!](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F4wfojzvslupb1.jpg). i confess i have lost interest in trying to understand it.

taking a step back, what is the plutus offering? ultimately, it feels like it should/could be simple enough: **hold PLU to earn more PLU on everyday spending**. however, the system around that is getting exponentially more complex, with new layers being announced every few months, even whilst there are various service issues with the current offering.

i can't imagine what an advert for plutus would look like in 2024; how can you gather together the infinite combinations of subscription, stacking tier, metal card ""bundle"", and monthly spend? how is a potential user going to understand the sort of return they're going to get? WE don't understand it!

this feature creep needs to stop. there is absolutely no need for any of this complexity."

I am not sure what I will do, and given that lots of folk are selling like crazy, i might buy the missing $plu if the price of $plu is low enough.

Regardless, $plu has been going up non stop for the past 2 years. I don't think this will change with the recent changes. My understanding is that with people selling like crazy now, people with less than 325 $plu but with enough dough on the side to get it, will be inclined to get $plu, this will balance the price at around 8$.

As the bull market returns, with the reintroduction of the DEX, lots of folk will be looking for an on-off ramp. What better way of having a bank-like account that lets you swap crypto to fiat in an instant or top up your card with crypto, that also gives you 3% with only 100 $plu stacked? 

So, overll, even with the new changes that are really annoying, $plu has lots of room upwards.

I might be entirely wrong and I don't speak with certainty but I think it is worth continuing with $plu for the long run even if it is not profitable for the short-term."

Plutus - $10 Free signup bonus & crypto cashback debit card,beermoneyuk,15jeax3,2023-08-05 22:47:27,5,0.86,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/15jeax3/plutus_10_free_signup_bonus_crypto_cashback_debit/,Sylent20,Cryptocurrency,"Plutus is just a normal debit card, but it comes with amazing cryptocurrency rewards. You top the card up with GBP just like a normal bank account and spend.

I have personally been using this card for all my everyday spending and I use it to get a free £10 shop at Amazon every month. This debit card is too good to miss out on.

***
**Benefits:**

When using Plutus there are two main benefits:

* 3% cashback in cryptocurrency on all spending with your Plutus card 
* Additional cashback on perks every month 

You are able to choose from a variety of perks per month on Plutus, for example, Tesco perk or Amazon perk. These perks allow you to spend £10 a month on the perk, for example spending £10 on Amazon, and you will get that £10 back in cashback in the form of cryptocurrency. 

Plutus offers over 30 perks to choose from and with a free plan you can choose one perk a month, but if you upgrade your subscription you can get more perks each month. [Here](https://plutus.it/accounts) is more information on the subscription levels and all the perks they offer.

All the cashback is rewarded in Pluton (PLU), which is Plutus' own cryptocurrency. When you receive PLU, to use it you would need to wait 45 days till it settles on your account, and then you can withdraw it from the Plutus DEX and exchange it for GBP. 

Even if you know nothing about crypto, the withdrawal and exchange process is very easy and you can find a detailed guide on how to do this from [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/plutus/comments/146zshi/buying_selling_and_swapping_plu_guides/)

There are even some more benefits you can get for staking PLU, [here](https://support.plutus.it/hc/en-us/articles/4701908861213-How-to-stack-your-PLU-for-additional-rewards) is some more detail on this


***
**Referral Offer**

On top of all of this, Plutus are running a referral scheme for new users to get even more free money.

Right now if you sign up to Plutus using a referral link and top up your Plutus card with £20, you will get $10 in PLU completely free to your Plutus account. 

Once you have an active Plutus account you will be able to invite others for more $10 bonuses.

**How to get the $10 PLU bonus:**

1. **[CLICK HERE](https://dex.plutus.it/auth/referee/signup?refId=6x7lf0)** to sign up to Plutus using my referral link and here is my referral code in case you need it: **6x7lf0**
2. Get yourself verified using your ID (passport, driving licence, etc.)
3. Deposit £20 to get a Plutus card (this £20 will be available to use on your card)
4. You should get the $10 PLU reward (can take up to 45 days), and make sure to select your free perk for the month.

Understand ownership of address and multichain activity - Missing PLU Token (ERC20) deposit on Coinbase,ethereum,14pjeq0,2023-07-03 09:42:50,13,0.99,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/14pjeq0/understand_ownership_of_address_and_multichain/,bernardovleitao,,"Hello,

I encountered an issue that initially prompted me to seek assistance on another subreddit. However, I have been guided to present the problem here, as it seems more appropriate for the specific problem, which revolves around proving address ownership probably by considering address multi-chain activity also.

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/plutus/comments/14otttk/missing\_plu\_deposit\_on\_coinbase/](https://www.reddit.com/r/plutus/comments/14otttk/missing_plu_deposit_on_coinbase/)

In brief, my problem involves a transfer of 17 PLU tokens (approximately $180) from MM (originating wallet) to Coinbase Address. Despite using the address displayed on Coinbase's website (as confirmed by a screenshot below), Coinbase customer support claims that the destination address does not belong to them or in fact to any account.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mv0p05e14r9b1.png?width=2031&format=png&auto=webp&s=383c54ddb4633e1ffee7dd645e572e13e888c15a

Destination address: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x0C454244f51FbC52907Dd5a6C00890efc11195F1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0C454244f51FbC52907Dd5a6C00890efc11195F1)

&#x200B;

According to Coinbase, the address in question is not associated with them, despite the fact that it was the very address provided on their website. For a significant duration, this address remained visible until it was changed, indicating that Coinbase has the liberty to modify incoming addresses at their discretion.

&#x200B;

An important observation is that this address was exclusively used for incoming transfers; there were no outgoing transactions or any other activities recorded for several days. Based on this, I am inclined to believe that other Coinbase users might have encountered a similar issue. It's essential to clarify that I am solely responsible for the transfer of PLU tokens, and any ETH or MATIC transactions received by this address on the same day or nearly the same time are unrelated to my actions, if we believe CB customer support those incoming transactions were also ""lost"" as their system doesn't recognize this address.

&#x200B;

Any suggestions?

&#x200B;

Thank you in advance!"

Initially, the transfer appeared to go through smoothly as it was confirmed within seconds by the network. However, it never showed up in my Coinbase account balance. I immediately reached out to Coinbase support to find out what was happening.

tx in question: [https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1bf295c721c77dca62929c2a92ac710fae30a3be7c12cebd96ee474e861055a3](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1bf295c721c77dca62929c2a92ac710fae30a3be7c12cebd96ee474e861055a3)

Coinbase's response was that the address I used for the transfer isn't associated with **any** Coinbase account, and they suggested that it might be a browser-related issue. They mentioned that addresses can change over time, which could explain the discrepancy between the address displayed on my mobile app and the web version. However, they claim that this was not an address from them.

&#x200B;

To shed some light on the situation, I have attached screenshots from both my mobile app and the web platform, clearly showing the address used for the PLU transfer. How can I provide evidence to Coinbase that the address I used for the transfer was indeed associated with their platform at the time of the transaction? I have noticed that at least two transfers were received by this address almost simultaneously, which makes me believe there might have been a technical glitch...

I understand that this is not directly related with Plutus but would be interesting to know if this happeed with someone else."

I am in UK, new user, have accrued some PLU I want to cash it out to FIAT (UK GBP £).

I followed instructions on plutus website, it told me to sign up to ""metamask"" on their page [https://dex.plutus.it/withdraw/pluton/wallet](https://dex.plutus.it/withdraw/pluton/wallet)

I have done this. If I try and transfer, I only get option to send to my ""PLU wallet"".

I have totally don't understand any of this, and it then states "" Your account will be charged £ 3 to cover network gas fees. "" Which seems, well ridiculously expensive I would have thought 3 pence would be more realistic.

So, please someone tell me what is the cheapest and simplest way me to ""cash out"" my PLU to GBP.

That’s right, the first Difficulty Adjustment will now take effect on 1st July 2023 (previously 1st June) to give customers one last opportunity to upgrade. 

From 1st July onwards, the amount of PLU required to unlock a Reward Level will increase (view table below for details).  

📅 **Does this impact the calendar?** 

The rest of the calendar remains the same (i.e. the dates are not moved back, the Q2 adjustment is merely being skipped to give customers more opportunities to upgrade). Please refer to the image below for calendar details.  

❓ **What is the Difficulty Adjustment?** 

To further increase the longevity of the Pluton Rewards Pool, the amount of PLU required to unlock a Reward Level increases over time.  

🔓 **What happens if I unlock a Reward Level?** 

Once you have unlocked a Reward Level, it is grandfathered in and will no longer be subjected to future Difficulty Adjustments. This benefits early adopters of Plutus.

Cashback debit cards in the UK?,u_Dcoggin,12ndztu,2023-04-15 14:35:54,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Dcoggin/comments/12ndztu/cashback_debit_cards_in_the_uk/,Dcoggin,,"Video Guide - [https://youtu.be/oaA\_HGTV4EI](https://youtu.be/oaA_HGTV4EI)

When it comes to getting cashback on your spending this isn’t a new thing. The likes of American Express and other credit companies have been doing it for years… but what if I told you there are now Cashback debit cards in the UK, which you can utilise to ensure you’re becoming more of a smarter spender. In this article, we’ll be looking at the three most popular cashback debit cards in the UK, ranging from the lowest 0.5% to a massive 3% per transaction.

[**Crypto.com**](https://Crypto.com) **Debit Card – Cashback in the UK**

One of the most popular cashback debit cards is the [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) card. You can get up to a whopping 5% on every purchase, with a 100% rebate for Spotify, Amazon Prime, and Netflix with the Obsidian card… You may be thinking what’s the catch? Well recently [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) changed their cashback requirements, previously anyone could main a minimum of 1% cashback (paid in their crypto coin) on every transaction no matter the card you had, but now you need to invest and lock up (stake) their crypto coin, Cronos (CRO) for a period of time to earn any cashback. To earn 1% you need to invest and stake $400 of their CRO token, and with that, you get a free rebate for Spotify every month. Simply put the more you invest the more perks you have. Cashback can be instantly withdrawn whether that’s to GBP or Crypto, it’s your choice.

[**Crypto.com**](https://Crypto.com) **Cashback perks - Cashback debit cards in the UK?**

With the recent change to their cashback, a lot of people decided to leave the platform and as CRO was an asset, the price did drop massively from an all-time high of 67p to 9p per coin. This is one of those cards which seems good in practice but I won’t be using it going forward. The 1% cashback was great as an entry-level card to get some cashback if you didn’t want to get a new credit card. During the initial periods, I made around £12 in CRO. As they’ve made the change, I can’t recommend it now.

**Chase Bank (UK)**

Chase and their parent company JP Morgan have been a big player in the USA for many years and recently decided to move to the UK. As a way to obtain new customers, they offered two things. I high 1.5% AER on savings and a huge 1% cashback on all transitions, paid in cash. The 1% only runs for a year from the date when you signed up, but if you were making a few big purchases that could rack up quickly. Please note, not all purchases are valid. I saw someone on Twitter saying they bought a new car, and chase didn’t pay out for this as per their Terms & Conditions.

As you can imagine a lot of people ran and signed up for this deal as it’s great, but now people are back at stage one. Chase did mention they are extending it for customers, but how long will that last? I highly recommend this card, it’s simple to sign up, you just need an app and fill in a signup form. You get really good perks, like a brilliant UI and high interest. I’d suggest you save this for when you’re making a large purchase.

**Plutus Debit Card (kinda) – Highest Cashback Card in the UK**

Plutus is the final card I want to discuss. This is a new cashback card that you have to top up before making any purchase (pre-paid debit card). They’re currently only operating in the UK, but expanding into the US over the next few months. Plutus is trying to unlock the potential of crypto and provide True Financial Freedom.

Plutus offers a whopping 3% cashback on every transaction, paid in their Pluton (PLU) token. This token has been around for years and seems to hover between £6 and £10 normally. The best thing about this card, no matter what you’ll earn a minimum of 3% cash back on every transaction, as well as a £10 rebate across a range of retailers. Similar to [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) the more PLU you earn the more you can gain. If you stake 250PLU you can get a whopping 4%, 500PLU, 5%, 1,000PLU 6%, and finally 2,000 PLU 8%. Also the more you have staked the more rebated you obtain for retailers.

Although these rates are brilliant, at the time of writing it’s a nightmare to get the PLU withdrawn. It appears that the UK has some regulation issues where certain government bodies don’t allow PLU a license, compared to other places in Europe (which is called the dex). To withdraw, you have to jump through a few hoops concerning Crypto Wallets. I’ve heard that Plutus is working with regulators to get the dex approved in the UK, then transactions would be seamless. I’ve made 47.87 PLU in the 5 months of using it, which is around £412.16.

**Passive Cashback Addons**

Although they are the best cards, what if I could tell you there as ways to stack more cashback? Where there are two platforms I want to discuss that mount onto traditional online bank accounts. These are Airtime rewards and Daali.

Both of these read your bank data and reward you for shopping at certain retailers. They’re constantly changing but you can get some brilliant perks. With Airtime rewards, they normally offer between 0.5% and 20% cashback depending on the retailers, and you can use this to pay for your phone bill. Daali monitors certain stores but pays you back in coins within their platform, 2 coins = 1p. They offer loads of vouchers like Amazon, Currys PC World, and more. The best thing is, these work together, and you can even mount them to some cashback cards.

[Daali Sign Up](https://refer.mydaali.com/vmUmt8HMBmckFgpT6) – Enter my EXCLUSIVE code ExyT2 to earn 200 daali points

**Stacking more cashback?**

Two more platforms I want to discuss will allow you to stack more cashback. One is called Jamdoughnut. Jamdoughnut is a broker for gift cards. They sell you gift cards at the same price as what you’re paying but allow you to get £10 in cash back once you’ve hit that value in the application. This could stack with all the cards mentioned above.

[Jamdoughnut Sign Up](http://www.jamdoughnut.com/) – You can get £2.50 worth of value when you sign up and enter my EXCLUSIVE code: RFKP

Once you have the gift card for something you’d like. I’d suggest going to TopCashBack, Swagbucks, or Quidco. These sites make money by referring you to certain platforms, and they share the money with you. I’d always suggest picking the site which offers more cashback. Then go through those sites to buy the item you want and input the gift card you got through Jamdoughnut.

The most cash back I’ve ever received through this manner is 15%. 3% through Plutus, 8.1% through Topcashback, and 3.9% through Jamdoughnut.

**Conclusion on Cashback debit cards in the UK**

My final thoughts are that it’s worth having these cashback cards. These are only a snapshot of things available in the UK, and Europe. With regards to Plutus expanding to the USA that does mean more people can get access to cashback with ease. I’m excited to see how the space evolves further. Which is my favourite cashback debit card or cards in the UK though? Well, it’s Plutus, I’m big into Crypto, and the fact they offer a high rate, it’s so enticing.

Be careful using PLUTUS.it (crypto debit card with cashback based on PLU) - my account was terminated without notice and there are many other red flags!,CryptoCurrency,12kxe27,2023-04-13 13:53:33,18,0.64,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12kxe27/be_careful_using_plutusit_crypto_debit_card_with/,Allions1,DISCUSSION,"Hello fellow r/cc members,

I am quite active in this sub and maybe someone remember my posts exposing scams/MLMs. Today, unfortunately, I have to create a post that involves me personally.

In november 2022, after using crypto . com card for a while, I was looking around for another crypto card with cashback. I tried the Nexo Card but the cashback was just 2% but it wasn't a real ""debit card"" and it was based on USD so I moved on and found Plutus.

Some useful links:

[https://plutus.it/](https://plutus.it/) is the official website

[https://twitter.com/DDhopn](https://nitter.net/DDhopn) CEO's Twitter -  Danial Daychopan

[https://coinmarketcap.com/it/currencies/pluton/](https://coinmarketcap.com/it/currencies/pluton/) \- PLU on CMC

[PLU or ""Pluton"" on CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/it/currencies/pluton/) (Plutus own token) - can be exchanged on CoinBase and KuCoin and in some DEXs (as well as the internal DEX when it was active).

# Introduction

Plutus.it offers a crypto debit card with cashback from 3% to 8% with an amount of ""perks"" (similar to benefits from crypto.com card) based on how many ""PLU"", their own token, you have on your wallet.

Perks are vary: Netflix, Spotify, LIDL, Amazon Prime, Disney+ etc., more or less all worth 10€/£. Plutus gives back the amount in ""PLU"". The PLU remains locked in ""pending"" status for 45 days and then, after this time, it can be sold in the internal DEX (currently paused) or withdrawable to MetaMask/Ledger (3€ fee + spread on CEX).

Free plan is 3% cashback and 1 perk, with a cashback up to 250€/month

Everyday plan is 4.99€ a month and gives 3% with 2 perks, with a cashback up to 2000€/month.

Premium plan is 14.99€ a month and gives 3% with 3 perks, with a cashback up to 22500€/month.

If you hold on the account ***or in your personal wallet*** 250 PLU or more, you get more perks and more cashback up to 8 perks and 8% cashback (with 2000 PLU ""staked"").  On the roadmap of Plutus, is expected to see the minimum ""stake"" for a level to go up after a while, but only for new users.

The interesting part is that you can keep funds on your custodial wallet, not on the Plutus account itself. This is also underlined and advertised by the CEO, Danial Daychopan, on Twitter. The guy also likes to criticize badly Bitcoin and shill Ethereum... but hey, that's only opinions, right?

The first month of use went smoothly. When 45 days passed I used to sell PLU on the internal DEX and the money went directly on the card, so I could directly spend it and earn more cashback.

In these months they halted the live support due to the increase of number of costumers. I had some problem with their promotions (PLU not given, missing) but after 2-3 weeks the support always managed to solve the problem. Top up to the account and then to the card was always slowly, it took 2-3 days.

In December 2022 I decided to buy 500 PLU to increase my level to veteran: 5 perks and 5% cashback, together with the premium subscription (15€/month).

In February 2023 they changed the bank that support their costumers, Modulr. [Here is the news](https://medium.com/plutus/new-banking-partner-modulr-46a8ae44ec87). Now top up to the account was very fast, while for the card was still slow. They have plans to change the card partner in Q2-Q3 2023.

# 🚩 Plutus DEX pausing from 1 March 2023 till 30th June 2023 🚩

Now, this is the first (small) red flag. On the 21st of February 2023 Plutus announced that the internal DEX, used to sell PLU directly on the website, would be paused from **1 March 2023** till **30th June 2023**. [This is the official news](https://medium.com/plutus/important-update-plutusdex-paused-eea-99f8d2747723) . They claim that the decision was made to improve the DEX but 3 months are a long time.

Also, not all costumers that use Plutus are capable to use MetaMask and CEXs such as KuCoin or CoinBase, this caused a lot of confusion but the support team reassured that it was to ""improve the service"".

# 🚩 Block Code LTD (company behind plutus.it) is overdue for presenting their financial records 🚩

Red flag number 2. This one for me is a big red flag, but you can assess it yourself.

On the 3rd of March 2023 a user [posted](https://np.reddit.com/r/plutus/comments/11ixxhb/companies_house_accounts_overdue/) on r/plutus [this link](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09674279) , regarding the fact that the company behind Plutus was overdue. Also there was [this other document](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09674279/filing-history/MzM3MDIxMTc3NmFkaXF6a2N4/document?format=pdf&download=0) . The company did not released their financial Statements for 2021 and is still considered ""overdue"".  The deadline is coming closer and support just stated that this already happaned on 2022 and they managed to solve it. Another [post](https://np.reddit.com/r/plutus/comments/12hp5re/block_code_ltd_plutus_accounts_overdue/) was made 3 days ago, still no news about the financial records.

# 🚩 PLU withdrawals delays due to ""fraudulent activity""  🚩

Red flag number 3. Delays in withdrawals are always a bad, bad thing. Who here can remember other examples? What happened shortly after halting withdrawals? Maybe that's not the case, but this is another red flag for me.

Withdrawls of PLU can be requested anytime, but are processed on wednesday, every week. That's the deadline, so withdrawals are processed after every wednesday and sent to users' wallets. Since the end of March withdrawals of PLU started to be really slowly. A lot of people started complaining on r/plutus and weeks passed.

On the 4th of April Plutus sent out an email regarding this situation. They claimed ""*withdrawal requests will now take a little longer than the usual weekly payout after the initial 45 day refund review""* due to *""new auditing requirements*"" to ""*protect Pluton Rewards and our customers against increasing instances of fraud.*"" They also claimed that ""*To further protect PLU Rewards, we will now require* ***receipts*** *on any transactions we deem suspicious*."" .

This was taken badly by the userbase, considering the fact that at the beginning in Plutus' T&C didn't mention that the card could not be used for professional purchases or business. They updated that but many users still used the card for that kind of purchases. Also, the 45 days period should have been used by Plutus Team to review the transaction. After that period the PLU reward was considered withdrawable, but many users reported that support requested receipts for transaction of 2,3 or even 4 months before. See [this post for an example.](https://np.reddit.com/r/plutus/comments/12bpa1f/plutus_is_asking_for_receipts_from_more_than_half/)

**Following this, the same date, the 4th of April i requested a PLU withdrawal from my account, for a total of 18 PLU.**

It is important to underline that the support, after some days, started to request receipts for small and cheap transactions [such as this: 1,40£.](https://np.reddit.com/r/plutus/comments/12k3i9k/asked_to_verify_transactions_worth_140/)

# 🚩 A user reported that a an ambassador abused the PLU rewards program 🚩

Red flag number 4. One of the ~~mod~~ ambassador (EDIT4) of r/Plutus was accused of fraudolent [in a post on the subreddit.](https://np.reddit.com/r/plutus/comments/12c6fuu/in_light_of_recent_fraudulent_activity_involving/) So now they are asking for receipts about transactions of 4 months before, but a mod absued the reward system? Or at least he done some sketchy stuff? That's not a good sign.

# 🚩 PLU price going down 10% due to sell pressure 🚩

Another small red flag. Last week some withdrawals went through, as reported by  support on their subreddit, and PLU price went down between 8% and 10%. Important fact is that on the trade pair USDT/PLU on KuCoin there are a lot of sell orders, quite 3 times bigger than the buy orders. So many people were dumping their earned PLU but also some staking users were selling their whole amount.

Due to the situation I decided to sell my 500 PLU, because I wasn't sure about the condition of the company and I didn't want to go in ""red"" and sell with a loss later.

# 🚩   Today, my account was terminated without notice 🚩

Last, BIGGEST red flag.

Remember that I requested a withdrawal of 18 PLU on the 4th of April 2023? Now, not receiving it after a week, I wrote to the support to understand why they weren't transferred.  No answers. Absolutely nothing from support.

Today I made a 5€ purchase in the morning, then, after 1 hour I used again the card... and the transaction was blocked. I entered the app and found myself logged out.

I logged in back with my credential and found the message  “***User has been suspended***”. [This](https://np.reddit.com/r/plutus/comments/12kjo4f/user_has_been_suspended/) was my post on their official subreddit.

I checked the email and found a simple email regarding the account termination:

""*The purpose of this message is to inform you that* ***we are terminating your Plutus account*** *and your access to our services. I understand this is unexpected and you may have some questions about it, but please note that* ***we are unable to disclose the reason for this decision*** *and it can’t be appealed.*

*Regarding your account funds, we will send them over as soon as possible. For it, please provide me with the following updated information: (bank account info request).*

*Once this information has been received, we will send you the funds within 5 business days. I will follow up here with the transaction details.*

*Thank you for your interest in our project and your stay with us, and I wish you the best.""*

I requested why my account was terminated like this, without asking for receipts, without a warning or anything else. No answer from support was given because they are not allowed to disclose the reason.

They told me that they will give back my 400€ to my bank account, but they will not give me any of the PLU on my account, not the 18 PLU requested the 4th of April, not the 5 PLU available neither the 50 PLU in pending. **This means nothing of 600€ and more cashback money lost.**

I also asked to be refunded of the premium subscription for the last 2 months (30€) but they denied it.

So, in total I've lost around 800€ between the price of PLU when I bought, the subscription of Plutus, the Subscription of Curve (it was a full rebate Plutus Perk but now I need to pay for at least 2 more months before cancelling it), the cashback lost. The cashback earned before and requested was around 250€, so a total loss of 550€. Not bad right?

Now to be clear: we are on the internet, so you guys cannot trust me, but I assure you: I did not use the card for something strange, illegal or against the normal use of a debit card. My total monthly transactions were around 1500 and 4000 €, so way lower than 22500€ limit of use of the card.

I did not buy crypto, used the card on gambling website/casinos, purchased gifts card. I could not imagine this could happen to my account due to violation of T&C and I cannot imagine what I could have done wrongly.

&#x200B;

Now, thinking about this while writing this post, the huge red flags  are there and I cannot understand how I did not manage to see them before. The reason of the above (the whole, not banning my account) - IN MY PERSONAL OPINION - is one of the following:

* the company is in deep financial trouble;
* the company is preparing a ""rugpull"";
* the company is scamming the costumers via their own token;
* the team behind the company is completely incompetent.

&#x200B;

I would advice to not join this project, do not put money or - at least - put a small amount just to test or use their free perk. Do not fall for the high % cashback and large number of perks, you will probably lose money if you join now. Things seems that are gonna go south soon.

If you are a staker of PLU, I would dump them and keep only the subscription.

EDIT: since it has been asked on the comments I specify: I did not use the card for business transactions (I work for the public administration of my country) and I am not a political/public exposed person.

EDIT2: updated the link to Twitter with a Nitter link.

EDIT3: I would like also to underline  that 1 month ago I applied and received a mortgage for an house, froma bank here in my own country (EU based). Banks in EU do a lot of checks for mortgage nowadays, so I would have known if I had some financial problem/warning.

EDIT4: Updated the post, removed ""mod"" and replaced with ""ambassador"" as user reported in the comment. 

I see that now Plutus supporter are downvoting my post and my comments. I presented many facts and I was polite and open. Anyway... If some of my transaction weren't suppose to have cashback (for example, if I used it for a business purchase or bought a gift card) why ban me directly? Send me an email to give me the possibilty to explain! And also... The reward should just be rejected and the transaction should continue to exist without fear of being banned. It's my money on the card, after all. 

^(I am not a native speaker of english, so please point out any mistakes and I will correct them.)

FAQ | PLU Withdrawals & Transaction Receipts,plutus,12ee0vx,2023-04-07 04:12:35,23,0.81,93,https://www.reddit.com/r/plutus/comments/12ee0vx/faq_plu_withdrawals_transaction_receipts/,AskPlutus,,"**Is this a short-term fix for PLU withdrawal delays?**

Yes, the extended time frames ensure our fraud department has time to properly audit PLU withdrawal requests. The team is working on several longer-term improvements in the meantime, including the hiring of two new fraud specialists who are joining the task force on Monday.

**Is there a longer-term fix to improve the wait times, efficiency, and reliability of PLU withdrawals?**

Yes, the team has mapped out and already initiated work on several improvements that will cut down wait times and ensure PLU withdrawals are consistently processed in a timely manner.This includes fitting the auditing process within the existing 45-day pending-to-available period; more automation; and product improvements that will reduce friction for submitting receipts.

**Will Plutus set a timeframe for PLU Withdrawals?**

No, there will be no hard date that Plutus will promise relating to withdrawals.This is because it varies on a case-to-case basis and some of the checks rely on customer response times which cannot be guaranteed.

**Will there be an actual process to set some sort of expectation?**

Internally, the team has already established several new procedures to help identify and prevent fraudulent activity. These processes will not be shared externally (as much as we would like to), as that would encourage abuse of the system which is what this update is here to prevent.

**This feels like a step away from the non-custodial values of Plutus?**

The new process is only slightly different from the existing process:

* We are removing the guarantee of seven days for withdrawals to manage expectations as this is not always the case
* We are being more thorough on our auditing and requesting receipts (as we already do) on a small subset of customers' transactions to prevent fraud

As mentioned earlier, the changes are a short-term preventative measure and more efficient automated processes are in the works. So long as users aren’t abusing the system, customers can continue to withdraw PLU to their personal self-custody wallets as always. Some level of governance is required to ensure the longevity of PLU rewards and this is an appropriate balance.

**Will withdrawals be continuously approved at all times throughout the week or still in batches?**

The fraud team will be continually auditing PLU withdrawal submissions as they come through for maximum efficiency. Withdrawals will no longer be processed on a weekly basis but as and when they are approved.

**Will receipts be required for all transactions?**

No, only a small percentage of users will be/are being asked to provide receipts on transactions and only some transactions will require receipts. We are not enforcing checks on all customers and/or all transactions.

**Can users proactively submit invoices for transactions they think might be flagged?**

This won’t be necessary. After processes are automated, customers will be contacted shortly after a transaction to increase the likelihood that the receipts are still at hand. However, we recommend holding on to the receipts of large transactions in case they are required just to be safe.

**I was asked for receipts, what made you think my transactions are suspicious?**

There is a vast array of reasons a transaction may be flagged as suspicious and fraudsters are extremely competent at masking their tracks.

**Example:** Many grocery stores offer cash withdrawals which causes a potential fraudulent loop. This is just one example of how any ordinary transactions may still be fraudulent.

**What if I do not have the receipt for a transaction? Will it be considered fraud and my rewards be declined?**

Customers may be requested to provide alternative receipts. However, failure to provide any evidence can/may result in PLU rewards being declined.

**Do you think the 45-day pending period could be reduced a little to compensate?**

The team is keen on reducing the 45-day refund review (pending) period to 30 days. However, with the upcoming automated auditing system, it is too early to confirm either way. We will update you here once an appropriate timeline is confirmed.

**Is Plutus trying to scam us?**

No. The team is taking additional measures to prevent fraudulent activity to prevent malicious actors from devaluing Pluton Rewards.

* Plutus was founded in 2015, it is one of the earliest crypto cards on the market.
* PLU cannot be transferred from the Rewards Pool without multi-sig confirmation across regulated third parties including both chartered accountants and lawyers - an unprecedented step that we proactively took to prevent a single point of failure.
* The entire team is public-facing and puts their names/reputations out there.
* We work with a number of financial institutions that undergo extensive due diligence processes before providing the licenses that we operate under."
Important Changes to PLU Withdrawals and Transaction Receipts,plutus,12az1ux,2023-04-03 17:46:54,0,0.43,113,https://www.reddit.com/r/plutus/comments/12az1ux/important_changes_to_plu_withdrawals_and/,AskPlutus,,"Hello everyone, a planned mass email in regards to the approval of withdrawal requests had technical issues earlier today so I am sharing it here for visibility for those who haven't yet received it:  

&#x200B;

**Important Changes to PLU Withdrawals and Transaction Receipts** 

We want to inform you about two important changes this week relating to PLU Withdrawals and Transaction Receipts. These changes are being implemented to better protect Pluton Rewards and our customers against increasing instances of fraud.  

&#x200B;

**PLU Withdrawals** 

Due to the new auditing requirements mentioned below, all withdrawal requests will now take longer than the normal weekly payout after the initial 45-day refund review period is complete - the exact length of time will vary on a case-by-case basis.  

&#x200B;

**Transaction Receipts**

 To further protect PLU Rewards, we will now require receipts on any transactions we deem suspicious. Plutus may contact you via the support@plutus.it email address and request a picture of your receipt before rewards are approved for withdrawal.  

&#x200B;

**Why are we taking these measures?** 

We understand that these changes may be inconvenient, but we assure you that they are necessary to protect the integrity of rewards earned by our customers. We have already suspended fraudulent PLU rewards in a six-figure value and estimate that up to 50,000 PLU may have been held on internal balances through fraudulent means. Therefore, it is imperative that we audit new reward tokens coming into circulation.  

&#x200B;

**How will we audit at scale?** 

In addition, we are developing a streamlined solution to automate much of the auditing process, which will audit transactions with the 45-day refund period. This will allow us to audit at scale and protect our customers stacking PLU from future instances of fraud.  If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our customer support team here.  

&#x200B;

Kind regards, 

The Plutus Team"
Connecting a Metamask Wallet to Plutus - What are we allowing them to possibly do?,plutus,127fnuj,2023-03-31 05:17:33,5,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/plutus/comments/127fnuj/connecting_a_metamask_wallet_to_plutus_what_are/,Velvet_Beach,Discussion,"Hi everyone guys and PLUTUS lovers like me!!!  
I'm a newbie on Metamask and I have a big doubt about connecting PLUTUS to METAMASK.  
When I try to connect a wallet to PLUTUS (trough PERKS ->  Connect wallet) Metamask ask me to confirm and sign this request (see attached screenshots). My concern is, signing this what I'm allowing PLUTUS to possibly do? I totally trust them but I want to be sure about what they can do with this sign.  
Can they just check the balance every day, or can then theoretically also take out PLU (from my Metamask wallet) without further approval on my side? This in both cases, using only a simple Metamask wallet or a Metamask/Ledger wallet....  


Also, connecting a wallet to PLUTUS DEX section or to PERKE section, is it the same thing?  
Or there are differences on what they can theoretically do with this permissions?  
   
Thanks very much to everyone that can clarify this!

Exporting lists of PLU awards for tax prep,plutus,113smc4,2023-02-16 10:02:12,6,1.0,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/plutus/comments/113smc4/exporting_lists_of_plu_awards_for_tax_prep/,white_rajah,Discussion,"  

**Context:** In Austria, where I live, we are expected to give detailed reports for tax purposes of any cryptocurrencies we receive, whether from mining, staking, or rewards programs like Plutus. Each transaction where we receive cryptocurrency is taxable – for example, if I make a payment using my Plutus card of EUR 100 and receive a 3% reward in PLU, then this reward will represent EUR 3 in taxable income (based on the price of PLU on the day). If I later go on to sell the PLU I have received, this is a separate taxable event on which I will need to report a profit or a loss, depending on whether the value of PLU has gone up or down since I received the PLU as a reward. This obviously gets complicated fast if you have more than a few transactions, which is why most people use web-based tax prep software to figure out where they stand. I think this is a bit different from the situation in the UK (there was a discussion of Pluton rewards and UK taxes here a few days ago).

**Disclaimer:** I’m not a tax lawyer, but this is my best understanding of the situation as it affects PLU rewards based on a couple of years of dealing with taxes on crypto transactions.

**Question:** Has anyone figured out a way of exporting the transactions associated with PLU rewards in Plutus in a form like a .csv file that can be imported into tax prep software? It is possible to view these transactions in the Pluton area of the website but it would be impractical to manually transcribe them into Excel. Thanks in advance for any suggestions!"

We’ve experienced an uplift in tickets and, as a result, customer support response times have been extended from our usual 24hr standards up to two weeks for non-critical cases. To help provide you with a quicker response, here are the answers to some of the frequently asked questions.

**Card Top-up Wait Times**During extreme spikes in card activity, card top-up wait times can take longer than usual. Don’t worry, your card top-up will arrive in due course. In the short term, we are taking steps where possible to reduce the top-up times. In the longer term, Plutus is moving to a new banking provider and this will enable instant top-ups (news coming soon )

**Inaccurate Merchant Description**Merchant description information is pulled directly from Visa and some specific merchants (e.g. Curve) are appearing incorrectly. As this relates to a third party, there are few measures Plutus can take to resolve it, however, the merchant descriptions often correct themselves and rewards are issued accurately once the transaction has fully settled with the merchant (which can take up to 5 business days). Please wait until the transaction has settled with the merchant before raising any tickets.

**Absent Rewards**

A small segment of users have transactions missing from their statements, or, transactions showing as pending permanently. This is a visual glitch and the transactions typically have settled in the back-end, however, in these instances, the rewards have not been issued.Don’t worry, the development team is aware of this and they will be retroactively adding any absent rewards to your accounts in February.

**PLU Withdrawals**

Plutus is in the process of a Pluton Reconciliation which involves the appointment of Haggards Crowther, a highly accredited firm of certified Charted Accountants, to verify all rewards issued to customers. We are taking these additional steps, which are rarely seen by private companies, to provide transparency to customers and strengthen trust in the crypto sector. Once this is completed, withdrawals will resume as usual.
