In order to advance research and get treatments, we need to be participating in clinical trials whenever possible. The faster these trials are completed, the faster we can get treatments. If you are able, please consider looking through this guide to find a trial that works for you. Use the link to find the study contact info, as well as other pertinent information (treatment, exclusion/inclusion criteria). I understand brain fog and fatigue is a significant factor, so if you need help, please pm me. These trials were found through https://clinicaltrials.gov/  - please add additional ones in comments.

The Most Popular Esports for Gambling,SportsBetNews,1i9x61j,2025-01-25 16:11:32,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SportsBetNews/comments/1i9x61j/the_most_popular_esports_for_gambling/,NonWiseGuy,,"Esports have been going from strength to strength over the last few decades and it seems like an obvious market when there is such a large fan base that follows the professional scene. The fact that there a massive competitions with prize pools into the millions of dollars shows that have been running for a long time, shows there is huge commitment, with online streamers also contributing to the popularity of games. These high profile tournaments have strict compliance and monitoring, which allows the bookmakers to feel a little bit more secure that they are offering genuine odds. On that basis, which games do you think make up the top five when it comes to eSports betting? Here they are..

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive

The original Counter Strike all began on the 1st of November 2000, based off the half life engine. It has gone through many upgrades and revolutions, with CS:GO being released in 2012. It instantly drew in lots of avid gamers who enjoy the fast paced play and is also a hit with a variety of betting markets.

DOTA 2

The second most popular esports title in the betting sphere, behind CS:GO. It features intense 5v5 multiplayer battles where each player can choose from over 100 unique characters using special abilities. There is a huge scene for Dota 2 tournaments which frequently set new records for prize pool amounts. The main annual tournament ""The International"" has a prize pool of over $30 million

League of Legends

Stood as an epic leader in the esports world for a long time but has seen that title take a wobble in recent years. It is still massively popular and involves players seeking to crush opponents in a 5v5 battle arena, where your team has to dismantle the enemy base before they destroy yours.

Valorant

A relative newcomer in the scene, but found on most esport betting markets. It began in 2020 yet has rocketed to the top of titles that take the most bets. It's similar in concept to CS:GO. It has some competitions with top prizes of $100,000 and over.

Call of Duty

Maybe the most recognizable title as it is a mainstream brand that is very well known to console gamers and offers a cross platform version on PC's. It has an official Call of Duty League with 12 professional teams, each having it's own logo like an NFL squad. $6 million is available to be won every season and it creates huge audiences for the game.

How Circes vision could be the first step in the formation of The Justice League,DCU_,1i9wwo8,2025-01-25 16:00:01,9,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9wwo8,Aware-Couple-108,Theory,"In Creature Commandos, we see a vision that Circe shows Amanda Waller that all the heroes die at the hands of the Princess and Gorilla Grodd. At the end of the season, it’s revealed that the vision was true but could have, potentially, been perverted by the Bride killing the Princess. But I believe this vision is gonna play a bigger part in the DCU and could potentially lead to the formation of The Justice League. 

  Let’s start with Amanda Waller. We do know that Waller is going to play a big role in the DCU, with her even getting her own show. I could see, in the Waller show, Amanda having to deal with not just the fallout of what happened in Creature Commandos but constantly being haunted by those visions given to her by Circe. These visions could lead Waller down a much darker path and leading her to potentially working with Lex Luthor. 
 
   I can see Waller sharing this vision with Lex and him taking it and twisting into his own personal gain where he uses it as excuse to rid the world of Metahumans, once and for all, leading to his campaign to become the next President of the United States, with Waller as his Vice President.  I remember Gunn saying in an interview that meta human population was growing, by the time we see Superman and this could be seen as an issue. I could see the growing number of meta humans and the tension between humans one of the main through lines, as it reaches its boiling point similar in stories like Kingdom Come and Justice League: The Nail.
 
 Because of this rising tension between the human and metahuman/super-powered community, thanks to President Luthor, a new team of heroes form that is strictly outside of the government called The Authority. After an event that involved countless destruction and death, at the hands of The Authority, everyone has now had enough of meta humans and the super powered community which gives Luthor enough ammunition to sign a new act called The Metahuman Protection Act which orders any being with super abilities (Meta, Amazons, Aliens, Magicians, etc.) stepping on American soil are no longer an American citizen and will be forced to relocate. 

Those that don’t come quietly will either be killed or taken to a secluded super-human prison, located in Gorilla City. With this new act in place, this forces all the remaining superheroes to come together and stop both Luthor and Waller and in this case forming the Justice League. This is just basically the cliff notes of my theory but this is how I believe Circes vision could be the first step into forming The Justice League.

Yama fights Ravana,stories,1i9qqqv,2025-01-25 11:31:37,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1i9qqqv/yama_fights_ravana/,Limp_Yogurtcloset_71,Story-related,"Once upon a time, Ravana's mighty army began devastating kingdoms across the earth. As the Pushpaka Vimana soared ominously above their skies, some kings surrendered with white flags, while others fought valiantly but were ultimately defeated. Ravana, with his relentless might, trampled King Aranya beneath his feet.

“I am destined to die at the hands of a weak human like you?” Ravana roared mockingly. “That will never happen!”

With his last breath, King Aranya replied, “If I have lived righteously, you will fall at the hands of my descendant.”

Ravana dismissed the prophecy with a scornful laugh, continuing his quest to flaunt his power. Observing his arrogance, the trickster sage Narada decided it was time to teach Ravana a lesson.

Narada appeared before Ravana, who eagerly began boasting about his invincibility. “Look at these scars,” Ravana said, pointing to his body. “This one is from the discus of Vishnu, and these were given by the tusks of Airavata. Surely, no one in existence can kill me!”

Narada smiled slyly. “Perhaps, but even the mightiest cannot escape Yama, the god of death. Can you conquer him?”

Ravana’s eyes gleamed with pride. “Of course, I can!”

Eager to prove his dominance, Ravana prepared his army to attack Yama Loka. Narada, watching the events unfold, smirked and thought, *Grandsire Brahma once said that Yama’s Rod of Time can destroy any being in the universe. Let us see how this unfolds.*

When Yama heard Ravana’s thunderous roar, he assumed the enemy had triumphed and that his own army had been annihilated. Convinced that his forces had been wiped out, his eyes turned blood-red with fury. He quickly ordered his charioteer, “Bring me my chariot!”

The charioteer brought forth the massive chariot and stood ready, while the magnificent Yama climbed aboard. Armed with a spear and a mallet, the lord of death who wields the power to destroy all three worlds stood resolutely before his charioteer. Beside him stood his divine Rod of Chastisement, personified and blazing like fire. Surrounding him were perfect nooses and a personified mallet, radiating a fiery impact.

As the wrathful lord of death, feared by all, prepared for battle, the three worlds trembled in unease. Even the residents of the heavenly realms began to quake with fear at the sight of his rage.

The charioteer urged the radiant horses forward, and the chariot advanced, producing a terrifying roar as it approached the location of the rakshasa. In an instant, those divine horses, equal in power to Indra's, brought Yama to the battlefield.

When Ravana's ministers saw the chariot, which carried the formidable lord of death and radiated an aura of fear, they were struck with terror. Overwhelmed by fear and their lack of strength, they lost consciousness and fled in all directions, unable to face the battle.

However, when Ravana caught sight of the fearsome chariot that struck terror into the hearts of others, he remained undisturbed and unafraid. As Yama confronted Ravana, he unleashed a barrage of spears and javelins, striking Ravana in his most vulnerable spots.

Ravana, steady and self-assured, unleashed a torrent of arrows at Yama’s chariot, like a storm pummeling a mountain with rain. As the battle raged, hundreds of spears struck Ravana's chest, causing him such pain that he could no longer retaliate effectively. For seven nights, Yama employed countless weapons, eventually rendering Ravana unconscious and unwilling to fight.

Then, a tumultuous duel began between Yama and Ravana. Both warriors fought fiercely, determined to claim victory, neither retreating. The gods, accompanied by gandharvas, siddhas, and great sages, gathered at the battlefield, with Lord Brahma leading them. As the clash intensified, it seemed as though the world itself might come to an end. Ravana, drawing his radiant bow, unleashed arrows that seemed to fill all of space.

Ravana struck Yama with four arrows and his charioteer with seven more. He swiftly pierced Yama’s vital parts with a thousand arrows, driving the lord of death to anger. From Yama’s mouth erupted a fiery blaze, a garland of flames mixed with smoke and breath, symbolizing his wrath. Witnessing this phenomenon, even the gods and danavas marveled at the sight.

Furious, the personification of Death turned to Yama and declared, “Leave me to battle this sinful rakshasa! He will not survive past today it is the natural law. Great beings like Hiranyakashipu, Namuci, Shambara, Nisandi, Dhumaketu, Bali, Vritra, Vana, mighty nagas, wise sages, serpents, daityas, yakshas, celestial damsels, and even the earth itself with its oceans, mountains, rivers, and trees—all were destroyed by me at the end of their time. What is this night-stalker compared to them? Leave him to me, for none who face me survive not because of my strength, but because it is inevitable.”

Hearing this, Yama replied, “You stay here. I shall be the one to kill him.”

Enraged, Yama raised his unfailing Rod of Chastisement. Deadly nooses dangled from its sides, and the personification of a mallet, blazing like fire or a thunderbolt, stood ready. This weapon was so fearsome that its mere sight could drain the life from any being. When touched by Yama’s mighty hand, it burned brightly, as if ready to incinerate Ravana.

Terrified by Yama’s display of power, all the rakshasas fled the battlefield. Even the gods grew anxious as they witnessed Yama preparing to strike Ravana with his formidable weapon. But just as Yama raised the Rod of Chastisement, Lord Brahma appeared and intervened.

But just as Yama prepared to strike Ravana down, Lord Brahma appeared, intervening with urgency.

“Do not use that weapon,” Brahma commanded.

Yama protested, “You have said that this rod will slay any being. Let me rid the world of this night ranger and restore peace.”

“This Rod of Chastisement is infallible in its effect on all living beings, and its radiance is beyond measure. I created it long ago, and it is closely tied to the essence of death. My dear one, you must not strike Ravana on the head with this weapon. If it were to fall, no being would survive for more than a moment.

“Whether this rakshasa dies by the blow of this rod or manages to survive, in either case, my boon would be rendered false. Therefore, I implore you to withdraw this raised weapon from Ravana and, in doing so, uphold the truth of my word. If you care for the preservation of the worlds, this is the only course of action.”Though reluctant, Yama lowered the Rod of Time and said, “I will honor your word, Grandsire.”

Brahma turned to Ravana and said. “Your time will come, Ravana. King Aranya was a righteous man, and his prophecy shall not fail.”

As Brahma and Yama disappeared, Ravana laughed boisterously."

Yama fights Ravana,mythology,1i9qpri,2025-01-25 11:30:27,2,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mythology/comments/1i9qpri/yama_fights_ravana/,Limp_Yogurtcloset_71,Asian mythology,"Once upon a time, Ravana's mighty army began devastating kingdoms across the earth. As the Pushpaka Vimana soared ominously above their skies, some kings surrendered with white flags, while others fought valiantly but were ultimately defeated. Ravana, with his relentless might, trampled King Aranya beneath his feet.

“I am destined to die at the hands of a weak human like you?” Ravana roared mockingly. “That will never happen!”

With his last breath, King Aranya replied, “If I have lived righteously, you will fall at the hands of my descendant.”

Ravana dismissed the prophecy with a scornful laugh, continuing his quest to flaunt his power. Observing his arrogance, the trickster sage Narada decided it was time to teach Ravana a lesson.

Narada appeared before Ravana, who eagerly began boasting about his invincibility. “Look at these scars,” Ravana said, pointing to his body. “This one is from the discus of Vishnu, and these were given by the tusks of Airavata. Surely, no one in existence can kill me!”

Narada smiled slyly. “Perhaps, but even the mightiest cannot escape Yama, the god of death. Can you conquer him?”

Ravana’s eyes gleamed with pride. “Of course, I can!”

Eager to prove his dominance, Ravana prepared his army to attack Yama Loka. Narada, watching the events unfold, smirked and thought, *Grandsire Brahma once said that Yama’s Rod of Time can destroy any being in the universe. Let us see how this unfolds.*

When Yama heard Ravana’s thunderous roar, he assumed the enemy had triumphed and that his own army had been annihilated. Convinced that his forces had been wiped out, his eyes turned blood-red with fury. He quickly ordered his charioteer, “Bring me my chariot!”

The charioteer brought forth the massive chariot and stood ready, while the magnificent Yama climbed aboard.

As Brahma and Yama disappeared, Ravana laughed boisterously.

"[M4A] (A Playing as multiple F) (Always Open) Huge Idea Drop: Harem-Themed Anime & Fandom RP Prompts Packed with Story, Action, and Just the Right Amount of Smut! (Anime, Rule 34. Fandoms, Games.)",harrypotterrp,1i9p8ah,2025-01-25 10:24:19,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotterrp/comments/1i9p8ah/m4a_a_playing_as_multiple_f_always_open_huge_idea/,septimusrp,,"18+ for smut themes.

Hey there! I’m Septimus (M) And it’s nice to meet you!

Today I’m coming forward with the desire to RP as an OC in OC x OC or OC x CC harem based prompts.(I’m greedy, I know but what’s RP without wish fulfilment?)

For my replies I only write in first person and the length of my replies vary from a singular paragraph to a few solid ones depending on how much is given, and how much is going on in a scene.

I figured I’d put a fair warning here that if you reply with low detail, I won’t be rping with you. I’m not looking for a few words as a response. While that might be your thing, that's fine and power to you! It’s just not mine.

I’m someone who likes a nice balance of build-up and story to go along with the smut. I’m not the biggest fan of constant sex, or sex that starts within one or two replies. I also like cute dates and moments, and love to type out action driven moments.

What I look for in a partner:

Third Person responses (Unless you're playing a “main” OC among the harem. Swapping between first person for each character in a harem situation puts too much stress on my tiny brain.)

Don’t take control of my character at any point. Self explanatory but if you write that he does something or has a reaction to something I didn’t write myself it’s majorly off putting and a major red flag for me.

Active: I totally understand that life may not give us time for our hobbies, this is mainly aimed towards the fellas at the back who only are able to write once a week.Sadly for me I finid it kills momentum. I personally try to get at the very least 1 reply out a day, though more is preferred if we both have the time! :)

Communicative: It kinda links in with the other but if you're not feeling the RP or you're busy. Please just let me know, I’m happy to wait for a reply so long as I have a heads up! Also we don’t both need to be online to RP I generally go off the idea that we both reply whenever we’re able to and the other will get to it once we’re up for it/online.

Please for the love of god don’t spam me every 5 mins. I get that you can get excited, and I do too! But sometimes it just comes across as extremely pushy. I’m not ignoring you, I’ll get to you ASAP, promise! Sending roleplay ideas/questions is totally fine!

Detailed responses: Anything just around a paragraph (4+ sentences though it depends on the RP AND my response.) is enough, but more is always very much appreciated.

I don’t do group RPS and I don’t play as female characters.

Now to get into the meat and potatoes, I’ll post my kinks and limits. There’s a lot there and not all of them will be applicable to the starters. Aside from Harems. Those are compulsory.

=====

Kinks:

Harems – (Which doesn’t mean playing a bunch of characters at once. If you prefer to play 1 character per scene that’s fine, though the minimum amount of overall characters I’ll take in a harem/RP would be 4 though more is heavily preferred! This kink is currently compulsory for all my rps)

Outercourse (Which is stuff like titjobs, thigh jobs, grinding, hot dogging, that kinda thing), Risky/public spaces. (Places you can get caught but don’t. Toilet stalls, changing booths, that kinda thing), Facials, Freckles (Face and body), Big, nicely shaped bums (Especially if they jiggle… just an overall fan of the jiggle if I’m honest), Creampies, Cum on tits/body, big cumshots, thigh high socks, shower/water sex (places like pools, showers, hot tubs that kinda things, and a Mutual desire for sex. I also like pubic hair as long as it’s not overly bushy, trimmed/slightly bushy is where it’s at. :). I’m also into the rougher stuff. Things like Anal, rough sex. Choking, Spanking all that as well!

Limits:

Pregnacy, which also includes lactation (Hard limit, sorry), Vomit, Piss, Blood, toilet stuff, knife/gunplay, noncon, Gangbangs (reverse gangbangs with females is fine), non hetero pairings, Rimming/pegging, cartoonishly large proportions, NTR, (There could be more that I haven’t thought of, if you’re unsure feel free to ask)

There could be more that I might be into, that hasn’t been listed so feel free to ask about it and we can work something out. And without further ado let’s head straight into it.

=====

I’ve made an easy access list for you to read through to see if anything piques your interest before you have to scroll through this abundant list.

Of course, due to reddit’s character limits I’ll just be posting a few of the starters below, so you can get a handle on my writing, any other ideas you might be interested in feel free to shoot me a PM and I can send those to you!

Idea 1: My Harem (Hero) Academia.

(So for this one, my character will be a transfer into class 1-A. From Shiketsu. His power is that of Persuasion. With the power he’s able to convince someone to do something as if it’s their own free will. That being said he’s rather hesitant to use it on other people and due to the stigma around his quirk he’s been seen as an outcast and a freak and has been constantly harassed due to the nature of his quirk.)

(The idea I have for this RP is that the girls of class 1-A will help him come out of his shell and accept that his quirk isn’t the villainous thing that other people have led him on to be. This is more of a “Love Route” though I suppose a more selfish route is also available! Also if you wanted to branch out to internships with heroes like Mirko and Mt Lady that’s available too! It’s currently set after the training camp arc and will continue from there.)

Starter: It was a day which started like most others in Class 1-A. The students got ready in the dorms and headed to class to chat among themselves while they waited for Aizawa to enter. However, unlike most days there seemed to be an extra desk placed in the room. The seat caused some confusion which didn’t last long as the first bell rang and Aizawa entered the room.

“Morning everyone.” He stated in his mainly bored and sleepy tone which seemed to sound like he was stifling a yawn. “Today we’ve got a new student transferring in from another school. He’s from Shiketsu, some of you may recognize the name since it’s got the same level of prestige as U.A. but regardless, make sure he feels welcome.” He said, pointing a sweeping stare at everyone and finally resting on the problem student of the U.A class Bakugo.

With that he fell silent and I felt it was my cue to enter. Swallowing a little at the nerves I steeled them quickly and entered. Nervously my blue eyes sweep over some of the familiar faces in the room. Many of the students had standout performances in the UA sports festival and as well in the news reports about the villain attack on the training camp.

I had a lot to live up to if I wanted to join these legends in training but regardless, I was determined to do just that. Breathing a little and shifting my auburn hair from my eyes I smiled the best I could. “My name is Schwarzer, Chris Schwarzer. It’s a pleasure to meet you all.” I say bowing to the class.

Satisfied with the introduction, Aizawa nodded to the spare seat in the room. Taking that as an order I nodded back and headed over to my seat sitting down and getting my books out. Curiously I turned to the seat next to me noticing one of the girls in the class and gave her a slight smile as Aizawa began his lesson.

Idea 2: One Piece.

(I’m not so sure how I want to approach this one, however I’ll jump in and give it a go. Much like the MHA starter this character will have the power of Persuasion. Having eaten the Persua-Persua fruit. I’m thinking for now either he makes a crew with characters from the story, or he joins the Straw Hats and goes on adventures with them. (Obviously this doesn’t have to be canon and completely made up as we go.) Either way I’m super keen on this since I love One Piece to death. I also have a list of potential crewmates I can send!)

Starter: Adventure! Freedom, Treasure and Booze! These were all the things a pirate needed in life. And exactly what every pirate set out to obtain. Two years after the events at Marineford where Strawhat Luffy himself took on the government with an army behind him, and the Whitebeard Pirates at his side in order to rescue his brother… And two years since I felt inspired enough in his absence to set forth on my own.

I gathered up a strong crew and made a name for myself. My alias, Silver Tongue Schwarzer, is a nice title which rolled off the tongue. I had no issues amassing a sizable bounty at 90 million berries. While it wasn’t as grand as other pirates, the world government saw enough of a threat in my power to provide a bounty that large. Of course, had my powers been widely known it’d have rocketed higher.

So then why was I now sitting at a bar on the Sabaody Archipelago, alone and staring into the amber liquid of booze in a mug? It was simple. Mutiny. Those whom I had trusted most among my crew turned on a dime and after reaching the Archipelago they threw me overboard and turned around. To where I didn’t know and quite frankly after their betrayal I didn’t care.

“Damn them. Damn them all.” I muttered under my breath cursing as I downed the rest of my contents. “Another!” I called out to the barkeep who approached to fill my mug.

“You’re looking a little rough there, are you sure you need another?” The bartender asked as he took the mug from me.

“I don’t have anything else to do. I don’t even know what else to do with myself.” I responded grumpily. “Just fill it up.” I demanded.

“Right.” The bartender responded as he filled it with more of the alcoholic amber liquid and slid It in front of me.

=====

Idea 3: Jujutsu Kaisen.

(So I’ve completed the anime and read up to date for Jujutsu Kaisen (No spoilers) and I really enjoy it. I’ve got an interesting idea for a curse ability, my character’s power is basically he emits smells. Mostly for support, however his ability is so strong that he’s unable to turn it off. He always smells great to anyone who smells him, almost like a pheromone. And to cursed spirits it’s a lure. Because of this he wears a lot to cover up his body so he doesn’t let out as much of his scent. He’s in Jujutsu Tech now because he wanted to learn how to use different smells for different things and one day he hopes to be able to control his powers. :) )

Starter: The sounds of fabric ripping filled the air followed up by my swearing as my scent was released into the air. This was bad. My scent leaking out meant that every cursed spirit within a few blocks would barrel down on my position.

It seemed the time for subtlety was out the window and as such I pulled the large hood back and unzipped my jacket which was usually zipped all the way up to cover half my face. Underneath my body was bare. I mean wearing a large coat all day with extra layers was just asking to make me sweat like a pig. I tossed my coat to the side and threw my gloves along with it.

My cursed energy seeped out increasing the potency and the range of my smell. My eyes narrowed at the grade three curse spirit which was staring me down. “Sleep.” I say clapping my hands together as my scent changed to that of a sleep agent.

The cursed spirit swayed a little before collapsing to the ground. My smell even caused me to sway a little as I breathed it in, however I had built up an immunity to it. The sounds of more cursed spirits barreling down on my position could be heard all around me as I grabbed my coat and my gloves and made a run for it into a nearby building. I didn’t have time to finish the spirit off before I ran into the building. This would be a better place for me to fight them given that my smell could permeate more efficiently than it would in an open space.

I wasn’t sure if help was going to come, but for now I’d operate under the assumption that it wasn't.

=====

Idea 7: Fairy Tail

(I love the girls from Fairy Tail, I find them all super hot! As for my character he’s going to be an OC Slayer called a Demon Slayer. My character will use fire based magic to increase his speed and force of attacks. I have some ideas for some missions, but we can keep it pretty casual :))

Starter: Another day in magnolia and another party being held at the large guild building at the centre of town. A large-scale job had just finished with some of the senior ranking wizards. and even though I wasn’t part of that mission, instead being on my own D-Rank job I joined in on the celebrations.

I had only been part of the guild for a couple of weeks and so far, it’s not been as exciting as I’d hoped, although I figured that it’d pick up once I proved myself. I was drinking by myself when I was approached by Makarov. He was wearing an eccentric looking orange outfit. “Schwarzer my boy!” He said as he patted me on the shoulder. “How are you fitting in?” He questioned.

“Fine sir! Everyone has been very welcoming.” I say to him in response.

“Glad to hear it! You’ve been doing a good job, although I’d like to see you do more.” The male said. “So I’ve arranged a partner for you on your next job, that way you can take on something more challenging, what do you say?” He questioned.

“Yes of course!” I say eagerly as a smile spread across my face.

“Great!” He said cheerfully. “I’ll introduce you to who you’ll be working with.” He said as he stood from his spot and led the way over to a female clearing his throat loud enough to get their attention.

=====

Idea 9: Bleach

(So a new human soul reaper makes it into the soul society. His power isn’t great to begin with simply being enough to take out the average hollow. And with the resurgence of the hollow threat the Soul Society has offered to give him a substitute badge to take out those hollows deemed too small for the soul society to handle. Maybe he’s paired up with someone or someone like Orihime steps in to help him grow.)

Starter: Another boring day at university followed by a night of boring patrols. With all the big hollows being taken care of by “Full-fledged” Soul reapers it didn’t leave me with much opportunity to train against bigger enemies.

At least that’s what I thought originally. A few blocks from me there was a rift which opened up and the pure spiritual pressure that came from the hollow that stepped out of it was enough to make me feel as though gravity itself was pushing against me.

It was hard to breathe and even harder to stand as my hand clutched my blade in my left hand tightly. I shook my head as I heard the loud roar of the large breast and could even see its towering form from my position.

It was nothing close to a menos, but it was enough to tower over a three-story building for sure. “Damn.” I hissed to myself as I knew there were no soul reapers around at this stage. With a threat this big I was sure they’d come, but until then it was up to me to buy some time and make sure no humans or souls were consumed.

Pushing myself forward I reached the park that the Hollow had appeared in. Thankfully the park was deserted at this time of night.

When he saw me, the hollow let out a low growl. “You don’t smell like much, but you’ll do as a snack.” The hollow commented as it charged forward.

“Just evade, buy time.” I commented to myself as I began to leap around the battlefield looking a bit like and feeling like an idiot.

The hollow toyed with me a little while enjoying the chase before it seemed to get bored. Just when I was thinking I was fast enough to keep avoiding it the creature’s mouth opened and its forked tongue shot out at me with faster speed than I was anticipating. I raised my blade to defend myself but it was a feeble attempt and I knew it wouldn’t be enough.

=====

Idea 21: Final Fantasy VII. (Others Can be done! :))

(So this one will be set in the world of Final Fantasy VII, however if you’re looking to do others, I’m more than happy to do so! I’m familiar with them all. Mainly 7 and 14 But this one will be focused on FF VII, since Jessie, Yuffie, Tifa and Aerith are best girls! If you wanted to mix this up with FF 14 and have them transported to Eorzea we can make something up!)

Starter: Midgar. Easy place to find work given you were capable enough. There were a lot of monsters prowling the highways between sectors and a lot of people willing to pay mercenaries to get the job done.

“Hiyah!” I called out as I cleaved my blade through the neck of a monster severing its head from the rest of its body and slaying it instantly. It was a tough fight but I overcame it. I panted a little as my muscles relaxed and I slid my blade back into its sheath. The job I was on was simple, kill the beast and return its head to a barkeep in sector 5. I scooped the beast’s head up into a burlap sack and hoisted it over my shoulder before I headed back to the bar.

By this point I was a rather well-known mercenary. Jobs exterminating monsters were easy to come by and easy enough to complete. Plus, the payout paid for my room and for most of my meals. As I entered the bar I headed up to the counter and placed the bloody burlap sack on the counter. “Got it done.” I say to the barkeep.

The older man, his hair and beard white with age frowned a little and looked at the bag. The blood splatter on the counter… which he had just cleaned was enough to let him know that I was serious and he placed the sack full of gil on the counter.

“Thanks.” I say as I picked up the purse. It was lighter than I expected, but even if it was short I wasn’t about to start an argument. In return to my manners, I got a short grunt back.

“Don’tcha forget about disposin of that thing, I ain’t want it.” He said waving his hand dismissively towards the bag.

“Right, I’ll get on that.” I say as I grabbed the sack.

“An there was a woman lookin for you.” He stated. “Said she’d be waitin for you in buildin next to the orphanage.” He stated.

“Right, thanks.” I said to the man and headed out, disposing quickly of the severed head in the sack before I headed up to the building in question. I frowned as I peered inside. My eyes looking around for any sign of someone out of place. It did seem a little crowded in the building after all. I was about to announce myself when I felt a hand tap my shoulder and turned to see who it was.

=====

Idea 26: Cyberfuck(punk) 2077.

(Recently I’ve gotten back into Cyberpunk and after watching the anime which broke my heart, I think the world will be an interesting one to RP in, I don’t have too much in mind in terms of story, but I figured we’d have a bunch of mini adventures across the setting of Night City, maybe a gang being built up or something. As for the starter, I’ve left it open ended enough for you to come in any direction, wanna be one of the Tyger Claws? The victim they had cornered? Another Edgerunner? Even a NCPD Officer, Civilian, all of it is open up! :) )

Starter: “Good morning Night City! Another busy night has passed in our beautiful little hamlet! Several corpos have turned up dead, Overdose? Or Corporate espionage? You tell me! Let’s not forget the gang wars breaking out! Everyone wants their own slice of heaven, but it seems they’re more than willing to get their hands dirty for it!”

The sound of the news broadcast was drowned out by heavy rain as I walked the neon soaked streets of Night City. Boots splashing through neon soaked puddles.This night I had found myself walking beats I’d long since abandoned, what seemed to be a lifetime ago, a different version of myself.

I shook it off, I needed air, and the streets of Watson’s back alleys, a charming concoction of half trash fire, half combat zone filled my nostrils. The pistol on my belt made for an easy-access defence while the old NCPD badge hung heavy in my pocket.

I should have turned it in when I quit, but I figured there was still a use for it here and there. I shook it off and soon the yell of a voice cutting through the heavy rain. I pressed my back against concrete, my eyes seeing four distinct shapes standing around a fifth.

Tiger Claws by the look of them, their ink and chromed out mantis blades had some poor person surrounded, the way their taunts echoed off the alley walls made it clear this wasn’t just a polite meet up.

“It’s not my problem.” I muttered to myself as I took a step back before finding a sigh escaped my lips.

Old habits die hard.

I stepped out, my boots splashing a puddle as I took a breath. “Four against one hardly seems fair.” I called out. The gangers turned to face me, their neon-lit tattoos glowed in the rain making them stand out even more.

“What the hell do you want Choom? You lost?” Came the growling voice of one of the men.

“I’m just out for a stroll, but why don’t we all just take a second to get along hm?” I offered.

The leader of this merry group sneered, his cyberoptics narrowing. “You think this is funny? You just signed your death warrant, you gonk.” He snarled.

I shook my head as my hand reached down to my pistol, pulling the piece and cocking it in one fluid motion. “Time to see if I’ve still got it.” I say bringing the weapon up and firing off a shot. As the first shot rang out the alley lit up like a war zone.

=====

Idea 30: Harry Potter.

(So to keep this one interesting I’m thinking of having it set in an AU where Voldemort and Harry don’t exist. However, there are still dark wizards who are part of a cult around. Defs looking for a Hermionie, Luna or Ginny, you could even have other known people as teachers or students for this one! Ocs are of course welcome too! I do have a reference list for this one as well. Feel free to ask me for that!)

Starter: Another year at Hogwarts, the last for some; and another year of learning was right around the corner. Although times were not peaceful in the wizarding world. Aurors who were the police of the magical world were going missing or showing up dead.

The ministry not wanting to make a panic kept it fairly under wraps, however some of the families have come forward with the information and rumours abound about what was really happening.

Stepping off the train I sighed a little rubbing my temple where a headache had begun to set in. During the train ride here, I found myself stuck next to a boy who wouldn’t stop going on about the rumours and conspiracy theories.

Glad to be off the train I looked around for a minute lost as to where I needed to go. “I know it’s around here somewhere.” I commented, although my sense of direction was always off. Usually I followed everyone else. But this time it seemed I was one of the last ones off the train.

=====

Idea 35: Multi Fandom/Dimensional hopping.

(So like a lot of these fandoms and can’t pick one? This is the RP for you! Basically my character will be given an ability/item that’ll allow him to jump to different realms and gain basic powers for each realm.It’s not super fleshed out but it’s a good starting point!)

Starter: My life was pretty usual, and nothing if not stable. Every day I got up, went to college, did my classes then trained afterwards. I wanted to be the best player on my volleyball team so I worked hard for it. Just like anyone else it wasn't like I had larger than life aspirations, I was happy to keep my head down and work hard.

Though a day soon came that changed everything. I home for my birthday when a strange package had arrived, a gauntlet of some kind, I figured it was a strange device that an aunt or uncle had given me thinking I could play games on it. I didn't think too much of it until later that night where, alone in my room I decided to see if I could test it out.

The glove seemed to form to my hand size, fitting perfectly, and before I knew it a sudden bright light shone from it. When my vision had cleared from the blinding light I realized I wasn't anywhere I recognized, and the gauntlet had changed shape and form.

(Leaving it super open ended to let you pick where we start/who we start with. It's pretty basic so far but gets us stuck in! )

=====

Those are by no means all of the starters and given the size limits of post limits I figured I’d narrow it down to some of the ones I like the most! Feel free to ask me about any of the others! Thanks so much for reading this and I hope to hear from some of you soon! :)"
Opposing team merch at Ball Arena?,ColoradoAvalanche,1i9p7dv,2025-01-25 10:23:08,3,0.8,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColoradoAvalanche/comments/1i9p7dv/opposing_team_merch_at_ball_arena/,phonicfrogahbuhcuh,,"Hi Avs!

A friend is visiting on March 8 when the Leafs come to town. He's from Kansas and can't buy Leafs or any NHL gear where he lives unless he orders online and it seems to be ridiculously overpriced. Do they have any merch for the out-of-town team at or near the arena?

I've seen this at Amalie and Key Bank when I've seen the Leafs play the Sabres and Lightning. I don't think they do it at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto but we have a massive Real Sports right outside the rink.

P.S. The Avs are my second team. I lived for the Sakic/Forsberg/Roy era as a kid. I still wear 19 in beer league for Joe.

Enjoy your weekend and thank you for any guidance. "
I asked ChatGPT to pitch me Injustice 3 and this is what it came up with,INJUSTICE,1i9ov4z,2025-01-25 10:07:04,0,0.13,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/INJUSTICE/comments/1i9ov4z/i_asked_chatgpt_to_pitch_me_injustice_3_and_this/,Illustrious-Sign3015,DISCUSSION,"Injustice 3: Dark Reign

Tagline: The battle for the future begins… where will you stand?

Setting:
After the aftermath of Injustice 2, the world is left in turmoil. Superman’s regime has crumbled, and Batman’s insurgency disbanded, but the seeds of distrust and division have already been planted. With new threats emerging, the stage is set for a war that could tear both the DC Universe and Earth apart.

Story:

A new and powerful force arrives from beyond the multiverse: the Dark Legion. Led by the mysterious and all-powerful entity known as The Arbiter, the Dark Legion is a group of cosmic beings hell-bent on reshaping reality itself, merging multiple timelines into one chaotic world ruled by their twisted vision.

The Justice League and Regime factions find themselves forced into an uneasy alliance, working together to face the overwhelming power of the Dark Legion. However, old wounds run deep, and trust is a fragile thing. The tension between the heroes who supported Superman’s regime and those who fought against it continues to simmer beneath the surface, threatening to tear apart the fragile coalition.

Meanwhile, a new threat arises: The Son of Krypton—the long-lost son of General Zod—has been resurrected and seeks vengeance on the heroes of Earth. With powers equal to Superman’s, this new Kryptonian has plans to forge an empire of his own. Can the combined forces of the Justice League, the Insurgency, and those who would stand for peace overcome their distrust and save the universe from ultimate destruction?

Key Features:
	•	Multiverse Faction System: Choose your allegiance between the Justice League or the Regime, each with its unique set of characters and motivations. As the story unfolds, you may be forced to make difficult choices that impact your character’s path.
	•	New Characters: Join forces with characters like Kara Zor-El (Supergirl), Killer Frost, Red Lanterns such as Atrocitus and Dex-Starr, and even an alternate version of Oliver Queen (Dark Arrow). New villains, like The Arbiter, Son of Krypton, and the cosmic warriors of the Dark Legion, are also introduced.
	•	Dynamic Fights Across Realities: Battles will take place across altered and merged universes. Watch as iconic locations transform, merging different timelines and dimensions, from destroyed Gotham to war-torn Metropolis and even the moon’s surface under a red sky.
	•	Real-Time Decisions: The player’s decisions can alter the course of the conflict. Should you embrace the light, or will you be drawn into the allure of the regime’s control? Will you fight for peace or destroy all who stand in your way? Every decision made could result in a different ending.
	•	Expanded Roster & Abilities: Unlock a roster of over 40 characters, each with unique powers, storylines, and alternate skins. Customize characters with new moves, weapons, and powers from different timelines.
	•	Tag-Team & Multi-Stage Battles: For the first time, team up with another fighter in battle for devastating tag-team combos and multiple stages of dynamic fighting arenas that evolve mid-fight.

Plot:
With a threat beyond their world, the former enemies—Superman’s regime, the Justice League, and even Batman’s allies—are forced to unite. But the Dark Legion is not their only foe. As the conflict escalates, the very foundations of reality are being ripped apart. Alliances will shift, some heroes will fall, and others may turn rogue. The true question: can you rebuild the shattered world… or will you claim it for yourself?

Injustice 3: Dark Reign will push players into a war where every choice counts and no one is safe. The final battle is not just for Earth… it’s for the future itself. Will you choose to restore order—or burn it all down?"
What Style Should I Use?,u_alxxvine,1i9nqps,2025-01-25 09:11:52,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9nqps,alxxvine,,"
I want to make VR arena and make an epic battle with the boss, now actively studying 3D and want to choose a future style for the game, help me decide 

Each style carries its own character, which will affect gameplay and mechanics, as well as the boss and naturally the environment

Kingdom - knights and castles

Since childhood I love the theme of kingdoms and everything connected with them (reminds me of old RPG games like Diablo or Gothic)

America - pizza and subways

""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" 2003 is what I put into this style: drama, rawness, rats (the backside of New York)

Candy - cartoons and chupa chups

The most positive style of all the chosen ones is SpongeBob among all the others, as silly and positive as he is

Psycho - wildness and abstraction

The most obscure and surprising style because of its absurdity, which can translate into anything

Depending on your taste preferences, choose the style that most resonates with you in terms of atmosphere. If you have any thoughts and cool ideas, feel free to share!

PWHL Weekly Recap - Week Eight,PWHL,1i9ncvo,2025-01-25 08:51:57,19,0.96,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PWHL/comments/1i9ncvo/pwhl_weekly_recap_week_eight/,RaivisElegante,Other,"https://preview.redd.it/iztnreki15fe1.png?width=5708&format=png&auto=webp&s=596cc66f7a3a637b19139fb69974ea70393c3530

[https://i.imgur.com/KFmlIhr.png](https://i.imgur.com/KFmlIhr.png)

Good morning r/PWHL! I hope your week has been wonderful, especially with the exciting hockey continuing both in the regular PWHL games and in the Takeover Tour. Quebec City, you were beautiful (and I fully expect QC to be part of the first PWHL expansion). This week was full of thrillers, even being a short week. We started off with Montréal and Ottawa squaring off in the Videotron Centre, with Montréal taking the victory in regulation in their home province. Ottawa traveled to Minnesota for the second game this week, shutting out the Frost by a goal in regulation. Finally, the week wrapped up with the Sceptres in Lowell, falling to the Fleet in regulation. With the Victorie's win and Frost's loss this week, Montréal holds onto the #1 spot and widens their lead for the third straight week with a 3 point lead and 2 games in hand on #2. The Frost maintain their spot in #2, but the #3 Charge are one regulation win away from tying the Frost. The Sirens fall behind the Charge into #4 by a single point (and 2 games in hand). Unfortunately, the bottom two stay the same with Boston at #5 and Toronto at #6, Boston being 1 point out of the top four and Toronto falling to 5 points out.

For the second week in a row, and never having fallen out of the top five, Sarah Fillier (NYS) leads all skaters, in a tie for first with Kendall Coyne Schofield (MIN) and Claire Thompson (MIN). Alex Carpenter (NYS) and Taylor Heise (MIN) sit tied in that #4 spot, just a point behind the league leaders. New York, Boston, Montréal and Toronto round out the rest of the Top 12 in skaters, with only Ottawa missing from the list. In terms of rookies, Sarah Fillier (NYS) continues to lead the way, holding 4 points over Hannah Bilka (BOS) and Britta Curl-Salemme (MIN). Maddie Rooney (MIN) has taken over the #1 spot among goalies, trading places with Corinne Schroeder (NYS), with Ann-Renée Desiens (MTL) following in third.

We have a full, complete week this week. There is a game everyday between today and next weeks update as the next international break approaches early in February:

* **January 25th:** New York heads to Toronto to face off against the Sceptres for the third time this season. This is the first of New York's chances to jump past Ottawa back into #3. The Sirens have a 1-1-0-0 season lead over the Sceptres, beating them on December 18th in the Siren's home opener, and then again on January 12th. This will be the Siren's first visit to the Scotiabank Arena this season, so will the home ice give Toronto the boost or will New York be able to counter it? Catch this matchup at 2:00PM Eastern/ 1:00PM Central.
* **January 26th:** For the fourth time this season, Boston and Minnesota will be facing off, once more in the X in Saint Paul. Minnesota leads the series 1-2-0-0 over Boston, with a regulation win in Boston for the Fleet's home opener on December 4th, and two overtime wins in Saint Paul on January 2nd and January 8th. Boston has 2 wins in their last 3 games, while Minnesota is having a small rough patch, with 3 losses in their last 3 matches. Is Sunday the day Boston finally pulls a win out against Minnesota, or does Minnesota keep their lead strong? Catch that matchup at 3:00PM Eastern/2:00PM Central.
* **January 27th:** TD Place will be lighting up this week, as the Sirens are set to sound in Ottawa against the Charge. The #3 and #4 teams in the league will be squaring off for the for the third time this season. Both of their first meetings have given Ottawa a 2-0-0-0 season lead, Ottawa having won in regulation both times they've visited the Prudential Center (Dec 29 & Jan 7). If New York doesn't get at least two points on Saturday, this will be their chance to directly influence which of these two teams sits at #3 as the week goes on. Catch this matchup at 7:00PM Eastern/6:00PM Central.
* **January 28th:** The Xcel Energy Center will be playing host once more this week, this time with the Sceptres coming to Minnesota for the first time all season. Toronto and Minnesota have only met once so far this season, a regulation victory for the Frost as they dominated Toronto 6 to 3 in Toronto on December 7th. Toronto currently sits 9 points behind Minnesota in the standings, but if they can pull a win out against the defending Cup Champions, they can spoil Minnesota's attempt at regaining #1 in the league. Catch this matchup at 7:00PM Eastern/6:00PM Central.
* **January 29th:** Game one of a back-to-back for the Victoire at home at Place Bell, with the Charge coming back into Quebec. After their faceoff in the Videotron, Montréal leads the season series 2-1-0-0, beating Ottawa for the Victoire's home opener on November 30th in a shootout, in Ottawa on December 6th in regulation, and January 19th in regulation during the Takeover Tour. The Charge have 6 points to tie Montréal in the standings, and a win would bring the series and the standings closer. Catch this matchup at 7:00PM Eastern/6:00PM Central.
* **January 30th:** Game two of Montréal's back-to-back to wrap-up January. Toronto, in their 3rd match of the week and second in a row on the road, enter Place Bell. The current #1 in the league plays host to the #6, the second match against an Ontario opponent. Montréal leads the season series 1-1-0-0, having beat Toronto both times they've traveled to faceoff (Dec 21 - overtime, Jan 8 - regulation). These two teams lead the league as the season drew to a close last year, but Toronto hasn't been able to replicate their season (hopefully Spooner comes back soon and we can see the pep return to Toronto). Catch this matchup at 7:00PM Eastern/6:00PM Central.
* **January 31st:** The last game of January, and the third to last game before the February international break. The Sirens, in game three of their week, head to Boston to face the Fleet. Boston currently sits 1 point behind New York in the standings, but with New York's 2 games already played before Friday and Boston's 1, the standings and differential might have changed significantly. This will only be the second meeting of the season between these two teams, Boston beating New York at home on December 8th in regulation. Where will these two stand as the week ends, no one knows for certain. But, be sure to catch this matchup at 7:00PM Eastern/6:00PM Central.

A busy freaking week this week and not a Takeover Tour game in sight. I was so excited to watch the Quebec City turnout and it did not disappoint, and I fully stand by my guess of QC getting an expansion team in the first wave (Detroit/Pittsburgh is my other guess, but time will only tell). The midway mark of the season is quickly approaching (Minnesota plays Game 15/30 on the 28th, the most games played in the league). Thankfully, May is still a long ways away.

A couple of minor changes this week with many thanks to u/vbbcla for mentioning them last week. The tables on the left-hand side of the sheet now have titles next to them and the Color Guide at the bottom has been reworked to lump the Wins and Loss flavors together instead of splitting them like they had been. I honestly love the changes and the sheet will more than likely maintain them going forward. As always, you can take a peek behind the curtain on this [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FCM8qicg-yKrQfmIfdRwOXkbRZQqF8lV_FwlSzovkxs/edit?usp=sharing). Thank you all for the support so far this season!"

My first time getting this rank!!!,Injustice2MobileGame,1i9lmls,2025-01-25 07:10:01,12,0.93,5,https://i.redd.it/qrsah8dfs4fe1.jpeg,FabulousMastodon7326,Discussion,Context: I first played this account several years ago when I had no idea on how to play the game so getting actual teams and playing arena was very rare for me. Then I got an android tablet and I didn’t get an iPhone again until about 1 year ago and I understood more about the game. However the stupid matchmaking for arena stopped me from getting anything higher than elite 1. So I started building several characters and teams so I could get some more points without spending a bunch of gems. I just finished building like 2 more arena teams and I realised that my league of anarchy team could be used so now I had 4 arena teams and I did every single pip (without spending gems) and I got to the top 200.

Who thought about making all the maps look boring?,RocketLeague,1i9j8gm,2025-01-25 04:15:56,0,0.22,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/1i9j8gm/who_thought_about_making_all_the_maps_look_boring/,Immediate-Sail986,:Discussion: DISCUSSION ,I took a pretty long break (more than 1 year) from playing rocket league religiously. Recently I hoped back on just to play a match on Neo Tokyo...and oh boy was I disappointed. What happened to the floor of that arena and some other ones like Wastelands and AquaDome?? When and why did they change the floor and put the same looking one in so many arenas? I feel like the arenas lost a bit of their personalities and I hope I am not the only one who thinks this way:)))

God has demonstrated tangibly the sharing of the terrible burdens that have been placed on all of creation as the result of ""missing the mark"" by disobeying God in the beginning. 
    
    Let me paint a picture for you: On one particularly gorgeous day in the Sarengeti, a crocodile was taking his normal prowling midday swim just gazing with those cold, steely, murderous eyes. This giant beast rules the water and for short distances on land. A modern day dragon. A massive formidable foe that can tear limbs off any beast of equal or larger size with a single bite, tearing it to pieces as it death rolls an unsuspecting wildebeast or gazelle or zebra. Ultimate cause of death? Hunger. That is it - one happy day Giselle the gazelle is strolling in the cool of the day after a day of grazing and playing with her cub and stops by the great Nile river for a drink. She was severely parched and thirst is very difficult so in a single moment, her life is suddenly, tragically and gruesomely taken. Her family watching in horror, never to see her again. That is true tragedy in the animal kingdom. Let's rewind that whole scene and change the script to thoroughly demonstrate my point. 
    
    This time Giselle observes the bloodthirst, terrifying and hideous monster lurking before it has a chance to make its move and tear her to pieces. In a moment of courage, a hamstring springload and a keen aim with all of the accelerative power she can summon she leaps 15 feet vertically and as fate would have it manages to snag an oversized limb that can support her weight. Introduce a problem for her. That limb that she is hanging on by the skin of her hooves also hovers over the water where the very same crocodile sends his gaze skyward and if a monster could smile, his abysmal monster jaws would be smiling from eye to eye. In his mind it is simply a matter of time before her lifeless body fills his stomach. Nature being absolutely true to its nature decides to send a plot twist. There is a lion in the bush that bolts like lightning with fire and leaps onto the tree as well, scaling the tree paw by paw with a ferocity that could scare the very spirit out of you was eager to eat for the first time in 3 days. Just then it dawns on Leo the lion that he could soon be in a serious predicament. As he lurches forward he is able to sink his teeth into Giselle's hindquarters. His insatiable and opportunistic hunger conspired with the day's heat and clouded his judgment which he proceeded to throw all caution to the very wind over the fact that if he and the gazelle fell into the water below then it was a certain immeditate death sentence for both of them. That would mean crocodile 2, gazelle 0, lion 0. Seems the menu at the Serengeti plains is serving the Paw and Hoof special today. The 400 mighty lbs of teeth, fur, claws, mane and tongue has made it impossible for the gazelle to hold fast. The lion is blueprinted to be a killer. Ferociously, swift and with no contest authority. The situation is going from bad to worse with no room for error in action and no time left on the clock. It is at this specific one second in this entire universe that three of God's creatures are all suddenly praying. One God. Three beasts. Three very different prayers. This is the mortal dance that all of us that participate in life face each day. We do not need to be ""safe."" I already know that I will be crucified by some for saying this. We need to be wise. Self-controlled. Formidable. Powerful. Competent. A cognitive capacity and function that would impress Einstein himself yet bound inextricably to humility. Wise, powerful, dangerous, capable, cunning and controlled trumps safety because it actually is safety!
    
    I came up with this story to illustrate the imperative for fulfilling moral obligations and duties which play out ethically with courage, prudence, awareness, keen vision, deadly accuracy, excellence in all things. Mediocrity is pathetic, vague and useless. Giving your all all the time, in all places, on all occasions, with every person and creature requires the right perspective which is the perspective that always aligns one with truth and love. The Universe, as it were, is sentient. It has a soul or something approximating thinking, feeling, perceiving, acting. And there is overwhelming tangible evidence that if there is anything the Universe and God Himself rejoices with and funds the mission of then it is a man or woman that has decided that they are only going to be truthful and they are only going to be benevolent as well as extend their hand forward to every man, woman, child and creature believing and inviting the best part of their being to step forth.The standard operating procedure is to sacrificially love at all times - taking responsibility not only for yourself but also for everyone around you - tempered and appropriated by wisdom, which is the deepest respect, loyalty, worship and adoration that a person could possibility possess. In one of Fyodor Dostoevsky works ""The Brothers Karamazov"" the wise monk Zosima says 'Each is responsible for self, for all men, for everything.' When this perfect soul syzzygy aligns: God, man, motion -- angels rejoice. The sequence has been activated now and what begins to manifest are fantastic, majestic, magnificent, sometimes astounding, inspiring and transformative things in an exponential manner that is non-linear yet observable. It is a synchronistic harmony that speeds the perception of time (maybe God is hinting here to go after more and don't sit on one's hands and think because it was an exceptional day yesterday that now we can just bum around all day today) and stirs the heart in ways that transcend the realities of loss, pain, horror, difficulty, and real malevolence, giving life meaning and a desire to keep being the fullest version of human possible. This is bearing His Image properly which brings love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. This is not only possible, it happens every day. It is poetry in motion. It sparks admiration which is the call for emulation. It is a sacred-infused symphony that is not only good but the highest form of Beauty. It makes you beautiful. And beautiful things never ask for attention. It makes every person, beast, fish, bird, critter, crawler, slimy primordial thing more at ease and promotes healing and regeneration of all creation. The paramount feature of all this is that one can make God shine brighter...yes, a human can make God more glorious. That is His glory. Payment for simply being fully human, no static, no pretense, no nothing except you.  
    
    I am writing this intro as a very unqualified, unworthy, flawed human being with nothing to show save a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from a small college in NW GA called Covenant College, a pilot certification, so much curiosity, enthusiasm and work ethic it only scares the adults and never the children! I do not just identify as a man: I am one. I write this book to fill up someone's fuel tanks, put more wind in someone's sails, warm someone's heart, affirm that the philosophy ""No matter what comes...I will do good. No matter what. I will be a force for good,"" give hope to a single mother that has lost her hope in humanity, herself and God. I am writing to the young men out there that feel their life has passed them by or pointless, it's too late and you failed because you have hundreds of real problems, your life is a shipwreck, full of confusion and lacking any direction to speak of significantly, you feel the weight of your problems like you've been transported into Sisyphus condemned to roll a massive immovable stone up a massive and vertical stone wall and all you want to say is ""to hell with people and this life."" I have been there. I have worked in mentor and counseling roles officially unofficially and I have never and I have never heard anyone with any sense that pays even the faintest attention to capital R Reality that that attitude will ever work to one's advantage and liking. It is called negative self-fulfilling prophecy evolution and it will always reinforce negatively. The death spiral ensues with negativity. Identify problems yet call them opportunities because behind every opportunity is a solution to be discovered by the wise mind. Therefore, I beseech you to aim up. One of the most fundamental and productive things you can do now is to begin to develop yourself by developing virtues. Look them up. Understand their meanings. Not just as accepted by that guy Webbster that probably never existed, but come to understand words for all that they possibly can possess. You literally can pack 1,000's of different meanings out of the same word: specific connotations, layers upon layers of meaning, contextual, historical and or technical context, efficiency condenses complex ideas, ambiguity, the problems with perception and that is one of the largest problems we have as humans. Proper perception. Telling the truth always recalibrates the miraculous gift of a perspicacious intuition. To exemplify this last issue I went into a store two days ago and there was a young man standing near the counter so I smiled at him and said ""Hey brother, how goes it today?"" His reply clearly indicated anger, disgust, hostility and feeling disrespected by replying ""What the hell is that supposed to mean?"" 
    
    Either nothing matters or everything matters. Words start wars and make business happen and lead to babies. I believe one of the best things a person can do is grow their vocabular, becoming an unstoppable force of clear and progressive articulation. I do not enjoy chit chatting. I love meaningful and productive conversations where we are unashamably transparent. When one is honest, you can stand firm on the truth when the world is falling apart around you and you are being blamed for all of it. Ambiguity is also known as dialectical. Using certain venacular also can trigger trauma responses if someone, for instance, was beaten as a child by a man with a very deep voice with deeper southern accent roots. In this case, years later a very large farmer opens the door for this same young man and his wife at a restaurant and looks down at him simultaneously. This scenario absolutely can and sometimes does trigger a trauma response that is one hundred percent involuntary and neuro-physiological; and extremely unwelcome. There are, too, some words, that despite high intelligence, absolutely are going to increase the cognitive load at best. At worst, it will trigger anger and hostility, the person will fill intimidated and embarassed. This will not lead to happily ever after.  So young men, I am writing to you and encourage you to continue being honest in all things, keep loving, keep hoping, keep praying, keep treating yourself as if you are someone else that you love and are responsible to care for. I am writing to the just plain curious audience also. It is my hope and deepest desire that the pages in this to follow after a serious and thorough edit of my run on sentences in this intro and idea hopping like a bullfrog on cocaine in a pond full of lilipads and potential mates will touch as many lives as possible in the most beneficial way possible. This is not motivated by profit. I am really talking to myself with my dictates in this writing as well as making general suggestions. So, when say foolishness and ignorance that is my self assessment. This composition to open your mind of the possibilities of what you can do with the few days you possess to steward maximally. I have had countless people give me what I needed in terms of resources, wise counsel, correction, and give me my belief in myself back. 
    
    I want to thank you for allowing me to expound a bit voluminous. I have done that because I fully comprehend and have total compassion for you to be able to answer the question: ""Well, what does all this mean to me?"" Transformation of self that allows you face everything head on and swiftly with love in your heart and the way people are blueprinted is to live in community. Trust me, there does not exist naievete in me. I have experienced personally and vicariously. I have studied the horros of WWI and WWII. Here is the kicker: Impact, Inspiration. When you inspire someone else you get inspired. Mark Twain said it well: ""If you want to be cheered up then go cheer up someone else! Time for some tangible numbers transparency: if you have 150 people in your circles and each one of those people has 150 people in theirs and you all decide to ask a simple question after accepting a premise. The premise is that before each and every interaction with others you are going to have intentionally purified your motives of selfish gain and instead decided to engage, listen say and do only things that build this person up optimally. That is, your aim is to make them feel like the most loved and appreciated person on the planet and have an experience that leaves you both better and more equipped to even more and more often. People are homeless. Addicted. Hopeless. Destitute. Demoralized. Institutionalized. Dealing with problems they don't know how to solve, but you do and it would change their life! There is traffiking. Loneliness. People trapped in poverty. Women stuck in prostitution. Children that face a volatile homefront and hunger. Men and woman that need home healthcare. Some people are uneducated yet would absolutely do the work. There are people experiencing loss that has cut them off at the knees. They need you. Today. Not someone else. Not tomorrow. And you have that Power in you to love at all times. Do good no matter what. Now here comes the mind-blowing piece: Your decision to better yourself, to be mature, wise, truthful and loving at all times; therefore, mathematically, this equates to you personally impacting an incredulous number of souls in the most excellent way: Love
    
    ""What a person desires is unfailing love; it is better to be poor than a liar."" -Proverbs 19:22
    
    You have the capability and opportunity to impactfully love
    
    3,397,650 people. 
    
    I am going to spell it out for you if it didn't leave you mesmerized and terrified of the need for you and the hole people leave in the world when the only thing at their death bed is misery, regret and a body. That is three million three hundred ninety-seven six hundred fifty souls. Most of which have families. 
    
    My experiences have led me to business success, marriage, divorce, arrests, bankruptcy, a dissolution of my very soul in the grips of alcoholism. Let me tell you, I had to crash a plane after a catastrophic engine failure in 2014 and were it not for God's grace and the training I did and executed I would not be writing this today. That is reason 975 that I daily live in gratitude. Lightning strike? Check. Lost jobs? I got an entire wardrobe of uniforms I will never use again. Despite galatactic intentional serious work to get to the very bottom of my soul and perform an entire biopsychosocial living autopsy and tear down relapses have been a large part of my story. I have been sleeping on sofas if I was lucky at times. Walking into a fast food restaurant and asking a manager to speak with me then after meeting proceeding to explain that I am homeless, broke and very hungry. I got many a meal that way. I have lived under bridges. I have lost countless bicycles and cars and had to sell practically everything I have ever purchased. I have been a nomadic herder of nothing but the few clothes, wallet and cell phone that I was soon to lose because I would get so drunk that I might as well have been somewhere on Naked and Afraid minus the camera crew. I almost lost my life several times due to the liquor consumption and pancreatic problems. I have had just about every reason under the sun to just throw in the towel, say my last goodbyes, lay down and die. 
    
    There was a certain day that I sat woefully and hopeless in tears in Dahlonega, GA in the woods by myself and I knew in my heart that I was at a crossroads that was going to change my life dramatically, radically and transformationally; one road was going vertical upward and the other one down the nearest ravine to the nearest liquor store and that would be my lot. Fate sealed. Destiny unfulfilled. I would commit suicide by bottle and be dead within 3 agonizing years. What was worse about that second option is that I knew that is exactly and precisely what would happen because I have witnessed it on several firsthand accounts and my poor mother and sisters burying their son way too young and unnecessarily all because I would not go to the nearest mirror and say ""Look you drunk! We are going to do whatever it takes to master thyself after we know thyself and generate more tears of joy and delight in others than The Rio Grande itself could hold."" I looked up and aimed in that direction. I did not know how, where, when, how much, how long, nor how difficult this journey would be, but as David Goggins so aptly has said: ""You are never finished."" The joy is not in some arbitrary destination. The joy is not in even reaching a destination that one has planned that thinks with all their foolishness and ignorance mostly without a thorough examination of all variables. The joy is in the Journey. Writing this discussion is integral to and part of my redemptive journey. The Journey of discovery. Discovery of God, self and what it means to always be positive, transformational, critical thinking, solution finder, manifesting maniac of all the things that are true, of love and right deep down in that big heart of mine and yours. Be a vital part of the earth and the places you call home. I call wherever I am home. There is much wisdom from the ole adage: ""Home is where the heart is."" 
     

This is incredibly copiously loquacious. I apologize.

However, the credit belongs to the one in the arena not the critic. This is the arena. Thank you Teddy Roosevelt for that truth.

Godspeed!"

Currently looking for my super awesome duo bestie to play the games mentioned in the title:)  
  
I'm 29M, living on the East Coast, huge nerd and night owl (I just had coffee and it's like 9pm, rip me). I'm pretty new to league but been having a blast learning. I've played so many ARAMs and starting to get into SR to hopefully push some ranked at some point. I'm playing mid mostly but would be down to play adc if we wanted to duo bot! If you don't mind a noob then we can definitely get our league on. I've been playing a lot of Marvel Rivals too, I only played ranked for one night but solo-climbed to Gold when I did, it'd be fun to push ranked or just quick plays. For WoW, this is my main game and have been playing it forever. I main a shadow priest for Mythics and PvE. I haven't done much in a while in terms of keys but when I did play, I stopped at timing all 9s - so around 2.4k io I believe. I enjoy arena and BGs too if you're more of a PvPer! Classic WoW I'd be down to play if you're more interested in that too, I have a few toons on Nightslayer already. An honorable mention is Valorant (played best when drunk of course). 

I'm a very non-rage/chill type of gamer and don't mind if you're bad or new, though I do find it fun to constantly push myself to get better. I'm more of a ""There's always something you can improve on, what could I have done better in that match?"" type of gamer, rather than ""Wow I got the absolute worst teammates and they completely lost me the game"". 

I'm a fan of VC, dark humor and banter and hopefully you are too. Yappers welcome haha. Last thing of importance to mention, please be somewhat around my age. Hope to hear from you soon:)"

Playing conquest knowing other MOBAs,Smite,1i9b3qw,2025-01-24 19:57:03,0,0.44,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1i9b3qw/playing_conquest_knowing_other_mobas/,LustMissy,,"One thing that i always noticed is that conquest was never a new player friendly Mode. 

But as a person that played other similar games like League, Hots, Pokemon United etc, it is infuriating and awful to play conquest with this level reset on smite 2. Bro, ppl dont know what they are doing, they barely even know the roles they are assigned. Run across the map ignoring xp, taking aggro without reason and just dying.

And i assure you, the worst part is that it doesnt matter if i play right or know the objectives, ppl dont listen and just run it down bcse of their ego.

Even in smite 1, that was the reason i barely played conquest. And even when everything seems perfect, ppl dont know how to end a game, which takes almost one hour sometimes, and instead of being fun, is tiring. Dont even get me started in VER spam.

Being almost forced to play arena due to practicity is sad. Even more when im a Guardian/utility main, i cant carry for myself.

What can i do to make this experience better? Any tipo?"

"Should A-League clubs focus on building smaller, modern stadiums like Croatia’s Opus Arena?",Aleague,1i98vh7,2025-01-24 18:11:44,32,0.77,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aleague/comments/1i98vh7/should_aleague_clubs_focus_on_building_smaller/,SimRP,🌧 CrowdPosting,"The Opus Arena in Osijek is a great example of how a well-designed, compact stadium can enhance the fan experience. With a capacity of 13,005, it’s not massive but still provides a modern, all-covered atmosphere with fantastic facilities for both players and fans. The fact that it’s also expandable to 14,750 means it’s flexible depending on demand.

A stadium like this is perfect for creating a more intimate environment while still accommodating large crowds when needed. Plus, its features like heated pitches, a hotel, and a translucent facade make it a truly unique space.

Would this be a better direction for A-League clubs to go, rather than big, outdated stadiums with poor fan experiences?"

This has been an idea Ive been toying with for a couple months, and Ive decided to rewrite the scene in the Sky Kingdom. It can work as a standalone oneshot of ""What if Glory wasn't there/What if Glory didn't shoot"", but I could see the possibility for a bigger fic from here. I guess Im looking for some opinions? Do you like this concept? Should I keep rewritting the entire series? Or should I just leave it at this? 

Either way, onto the actual chapter:

The guard unwrapped Clay's chains, and both stared at eachother in the arena. Peril lunged at him, crying out. Clay rushed to meet her, using his big body to knock her down. She hissed and tried to reconpose herself, and Clay could see a guilty look in her face.
""I know you're mad, I just-"" she said, apologetically, ""I thought you were trying to get away from me!""
Well, I am now, Clay thought taking a step backwards, readying for her next attack.
""I had a whole plan."" She lamented. ""A plan where I saved you after Kestrel and you liked me best of all!""
""Peril, I don't care if you save me."" Clay interjected, as she was gearing up for an attack. ""I want you to save my friends. That's what's important to me.""
""Its not fair!"" Peril roared, jumping into flight. ""I'm your friend! The others can have any dragon, I only want you!"" She yelled, and dived down at him, claws extended. Clay threw sand in her eyes, knocking her of the air, and tackled her, pinning her down.
""Peril, it doesn't have to be like this. We don't have to kill eachother."" Clay pleaded, feeling the heat from her scales beneath his talons. 
""Except we do!"" She gritted out, and tried to swipe at his face. ""Dragons kill eachother all the time. That's how we are. Especially you and me. We're the same, we were killers from the momeng we hatched!"" 
""That's not who I want to be."" Clay stated. ""Maybe that's what the prophecy is about, how to solve this without all the violence-""
""Just hurry up and do it!"" Queen Scarlet yelled from her balcony. Both dragonets' heads snapped to look at her. ""Don't look at me, kill eachother!"" She demanded. ""Its my moon dammed hatching day! I want to see some action!""
Peril reared up and kicked Clay's underbelly, sending him stumbling backwards. He could die from the irony right then and there. 
""It's not fair."" Peril bit back, but it didn't have the same punch as before. ""You chose who you want to be. I don't."" There was a small stream of vapor trailing from below her eyes. Her scales were too hot to even cry properly. 
""Peril, that's not true. You can still choose.""
""Shut up!"" She gritted her teeth and jumped at him again. He tried to knock her away, but she slid beside him and scratched his side. In turn, he smacked her with her tail, in a manouver he learnt from Tsunami. 
Mudwing tails weren't as strong as seawing tails, but it was unexpected enough to make Peril back out for a second.
""You're the prophecy dragonet here. The hero. Im the ruthless killer. It cant be any other way."" She didn't sound sad, or annoyed. More... resigned. Like she accepted her fate. They locked eyes again.
""That isn't true. You can do good things too, Peril.""
""This is a waste of my time."" Burn gruffed. The crowd was also disappointed. They started booing them, yelling out for them to hurry it up. 

Scarlet was fuming in her balcony. ""That is enough! Guards, someone, get in there and poke them with a spear! Make them fight! Get the sandwings on the field if you have to!""
In the blink of an eye, guards started flooding the arena. Peril looked shocked and Clay gulped. Why was Scarlet so insistent on killing one of them? Why was she so insistant that they kill eachother? He was running out of options. 
Clay looked to the balcony, hoping the other dragonets could at least give him some idea of what to do in this situation, but they were wrapped in chains and had guards guarding them.

""Do you truly mean it?"" Peril asked, turning up to him. Her eyes were filled with sadness, but also a great determination. ""When you said I can do good things?"" 

""Of course Peril."" Clay said. He wasn't lying. ""We all can."" She nodded and looked to the ground for a moment. She beckoned him to come closer, and burnt off the chains in his wings. Then she turned her back to him, to face the guards probbing at her with spears and roared. Simply flaring her wings and stepping closer was enough to make them drop the spears and run.

The ones behind Clay took a step back, and she lauched herself at them. 

""No! What are you doing!"" Queen Scarlet roared. ""Guards, stop her!"" She demanded. Peril whipped around in the air, and flew straight for Scarlet, clawing at her snout. 

This caused a pandemonium. Burn called her sandwings and quickly flew away. The arena was taken over by Scarlet's screams of pain, the entire audience and guards screaming with fear and running for the hills, and the disgusting sound and scent of burning scales and flesh. 

Taking this opportunity, Tsunami and Viper attacked the guards that were imprisoning them, and Clay flew up to help. The two orange skywings rushed off, but not before Viper stabbed the second one's tail with her poisonous barb. 

While rushing to fly off, one of them dropped a set of keys. Tsunami quickly grabbed them, and started unlocking everyone's wings. Viper stretched hers with vigour.
""Feels great to be unbound again. Lets get out of here before Burn comes back."" She said.
""What about... her?"" Clay asked quietly, looking at Peril. 
She was hunched over Scarlet, talons firmly placed in her scorched snout. The screaming and thrashing had stopped. She was breathing heavily. 

""Just leave her."" Flame whispered. ""Lets go.""
""We cant just leave her!"" Clay said. ""She just killed Queen Scarlet to save us!"" 

""And that is exactly why we should leave! She's a murderer and she cannot be touched. She'll be fine, come on."" Tsunami appealed. 

Clay, who truly loved his siblings more than anything in Phyrria, sighed and ignored their advice. Peril was hurting, and he just couldn't leave her like that. Not if he could do something. 

He walked up to her. ""Peril... she's dead. You can get off now."" Clay said gently. It was dead quiet now. Peril stared at him. He could see the trail of vapor leaving her eyes get bigger and bigger. She was sobbing. 

""Peril?"" He asked. 

""Im a monster."" She stated. ""I killed her Clay. She was my Queen, she was my mother. She took care of me, and fed me, and and- and I killed her.""

""Peril, listen-""

""No, what is there to listen?! I was right. I can't do good.""

""You just saved us. I think thats pretty good."" Clay spoke up. Peril stared at him. She opened her mouth to say something, but quickly snapped it shut. She heard wingbeats in the air.

Someone was coming. Clay's mind raced. Who could it be? Soldiers after Queen Scarlet? Burn coming back to acess the damage they've done?

""Go. All five of you."" Peril urged, snappinh him from his thoughts. 

""What about you?"" Clay asked.

""Ill be fine. I can't be hurt remember?"" Peril said. Clay nodded sadly. ""Now go. Before they find you.""

Flame didn't need any more pushing, immediately hopping off the border. Viper followed suit, with Tsunami on her tail. Clay waved one last time at Peril, before jumping off and following his friends.

The dragonets flew, leaving the Sky Kingdom behind. The dying rays of the sun reflected on Clay's exhausted eyes, and he had to land. They were ALL tired. They'd need to find Starflight, possibly the Talons, their parents and end the war. But the four of them were togheter in relative peace, and, for now, it was enough. "

This group really originated with leader Jacob Frank and were in league with the Jesuit Order’s Bavarian Illuminati.  With the King of Poland serving as his sponsor, Frank was baptized into the Roman Catholic institution as were all of his Hebrew followers.  Shortly after this time the Order imported the French Revolution from Bavaria into France, later giving way to the rise of Napoleon and his Consulate.  On this three-man triumvirate were First Consul Napoleon himself, Second Consul Jesuit Abby Sieyes and Third Consul Roger Ducos.  Napoleon was guided by Sieyes in all his campaigns, especially during his campaign in North Africa and in Palestine.  For Napoleon, the Great Jesuit Avenger, on the advice of his Jesuit master sought to make Palestine “a homeland for the Jews.”  Thus, Napoleon was really the first Masonic Labor Zionist leading the movement for Jews to repopulate their promised land for the benefit of the Jesuit Papacy yet to be restored in 1814.  During the 19th century, after the Order had completely gained control of both the British Crown and Parliament, the Company’s socialist-communist  British Fabian Socialists gave birth to the socialist-communist British Labor Party and hence to the socialist-communist Jewish Labor Party of the historic Masonic Jewish Labor Zionists.  The leader of the Masonic Jewish Labor Zionists was Theodor Herzl, the Jew who led the fight to found a new Jewish State in historic Palestine after the Jesuit-concocted Dreyfus Affair, it to be a rebirth of the historic nation of Israel.  The real purpose for the establishment of a Jewish homeland was to revive the Knights Templars’ Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem (AD 1099-1291)—for the benefit of the pope, the pope overseen and captive to the Jesuit Superior General, the Grand Master of the New Knights Templars.  These Masonic Jewish Labor Zionists rule Israel for the benefit of Rome, not for the benefit of the Lord’s beloved racial Hebrew/Jewish/Israelite people in Israel.  The Labor Zionists are completely in the arms of the Jesuit Papacy and are in fact Jesuit Temporal Coadjutors.

II.  Revisionist Zionists

This group was led by Vladimir Jabotinsky (“the Lone Wolf”) , a Polish Hebrew patriot who genuinely sought to establish a Hebrew/Jewish nation for the benefit of the Jews living therein.  He had the courage to attempt to save the Jews of Poland from their approaching fate at the hands of Jesuit coadjutors Hitler and Stalin, but was resisted by Masonic Jewish Labor Zionist David Ben-Gurion who insisted that millions of Polish Jews must perish if Israel was ever to be re-established.  Hence “the Lone Wolf” was murdered in Hunter, New York, given the Order’s “poison cup” for his disobedience to the pope’s Labor Zionists.  Jabo’s truly patriotic Irgun would be betrayed by the pope’s Labor Zionists and merged into Ben Gurion’s Haganah, later the Mossad created by the pope’s pro-Nazi American CIA and German BND in 1951.  For daring to fight against the pope’s Masonic Jewish Labor Zionists, the Revisionist Zionists were terminated.  See Ben Hecht’s Perfidy for the entire, heart-breaking story.

III.  Orthodox Zionists

This group is led by the Talmudic Orthodox Zionists.  They believe Israel has no right to exist save for the presence of their Messiah.  Hence, they are unreservedly against the present state of Israel, and seek its destruction.  It is for this reason we observe these Orthodox Zionists walking arm-in-arm with the Muslims calling for the destruction of Israel.  The Orthodox Zionists do not believe their own Hebrew scriptures:  for how can Messiah come to Jerusalem in power to deliver the city if there is not an earthly Jerusalem populated by Jews (Zechariah 14:1-4; Joel 3:18)?

IV.  Christian Zionists

This group, led by men such as Billy Graham, John Hagee, Pat Robertson and a host of other “Christian ministers” defend both the pope’s CFR/Vatican-led government of Israel as well as the right of the Hebrew/Jewish/Israelites to live in their own land to the exclusion of all other races and nations.  Your Editor, sorry to say, was once a Christian Zionist.  These men are half-wrong and half-right: they back the wicked government of the pope’s “Revived Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem,” but help in every way possible for Jews to remain in their land.  These heretics refuse to acknowledge Rome’s rule over Jerusalem to the detriment of the Jews bound by the glorious and everlasting Abrahamic Covenant.  They will never face the fact that the pope’s government ruling Israel has murdered its own people, refused to end the Arab-Israeli agitation, has attacked the American Naval Vessel USS Liberty (on orders of Masonic Jesuit coadjutor Lyndon Johnson), and whose Mossad is the right arm of the pope’s CIA in the region.  Many Protestants and Baptists are fighting the pope’s American-led 12th Crusade against the Muslims (the Shia Muslims) believing they are obeying the Word of God (OT and NT) defending the right of the Hebrews to live in their land.  The fact is these Christian Zionists are creating worldwide anti-Jewish fury by refusing to address the wicked government of Israel ruled by the pope’s Masonic Jewish Labor Zionists for the benefit of that antichrist in Rome, Pope Benedict XVI.

V.  Calvinist Zionists

This group, led by your Editor, believe the beloved Hebrew/Jewish/Israelites have the right to live in their ancient promised land to the exclusion of all other races and nations.  However, we also oppose the pope’s Masonic Jewish Labor Zionist government ruling the pope’s Revived Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem for the reasons stated above.  We side with the late Rabbi Meir Kahane who proposed that Israel should be only for Jews and that the Arabs should be gradually removed from the nation while given money to effect the transition.  For this, in addition to Kahane’s warning to New York Jews of their impending death in North America, he was murdered by an Arab assassin sent by the pope’s CIA.  Hence, the Calvinist Zionists take the Biblical view of defending the right of the Hebrew/Jewish/Israelites to both live in their land and to be governed by their own patriots seeking the good of their people in their nation.

VI.  The Adonai Yeshua ha Mashiach ben David (the Lord Jesus the Messiah of David)

This Son of God/Son of Man/Seed of David is the Great ZIONIST Himself.  For it is He that will one day restore a lasting peace to Jerusalem—then to be the “city of the great king”—after his Second Coming (Zechariah 12:10; Isaiah 2:1-3).  Messiah will be the world lawgiver, ruling restored Israel and the Gentile nations from his Fourth Hebrew Temple in Jerusalem—from Zion!  He is That Prophet, the Hope of Israel, the One yet to restore the Kingdom of David during which his repentant and born-again Nation of Israel will be the “Head of all Nations” (Deuteronomy 28:12-13).

“Even so, Come, Lord Jesus” (Revelation 22:20).

"I have made a summary for Blasphemous 2 lore. Anyone who wants info on Sor Cautiva or High Dramatist, i can send you me and my friend's docs respectively, sinc they require a good amount of words and study.",Blasphemous,1i90uot,2025-01-24 12:29:19,8,0.84,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blasphemous/comments/1i90uot/i_have_made_a_summary_for_blasphemous_2_lore/,SussyBox,Lore Discussion (Spoilers),"
Blasphemous 2 takes place 1000 years later from the Cvstodia we know of in Blasphemous 1. Faith in the Miracle had been dwindling and had decreased over time due to its sudden disappearance after the death of the High Wills. Most of old Cvstodia has been buried, sunk, or has been left behind. The City of the Blessed Name was built over the remains of old Cvstodia. Mother of Mothers is buried and left to rot, a symbol of the people leaving behind that savage bygone age of penance and affliction. The Library of the Negated Works has sunk, its ink leaking out to form the Sea of Ink.
There was a couple who wished for a child, but they couldn't conceive one. So in their utter desperation, they fervently prayed to the Miracle, asking for a child.
Such was their devotion, that the Miracle stirred from its slumber. It found itself weak due to lack of devotion, and confused due to lack of guidance from the High Wills.
It granted the wish of the couple. But it found its will tarnished in its long absence, and it gave upon that child, the blessing of deformity. This caused a plague which corrupted and infected everyone throughout the land, the midwife taking the child out grew wings, and became the Witness.
Due to the absence of the High Wills, the Miracle did what it was made to do best by them, afflicting pain and punishment.
The Miracle was to create an icon for the people to revere. An Incarnate icon. A symbol in which all the faith, pleas and hopes might be united in communion, so as to expand its diminished, almost extinct might.
Lacking sufficient mastery the Miracle did fail in its attempts to incarnate, manifesting only in the form of disease, deformity and pain. It spread more and more of its aberrations, like sores on diseased skin, in many places and on many innocent bodies.
There was a young innocent child, who wished for a symbol of hope in all the pain and despair. T’was then the Miracle gained its last chance.
One day a heart descended from the skies, this heart being the symbol that was asked for, and inside was a child, a child made manifest derived from the wish of the couple. For without the High Wills, the Miracle could seemingly only rely on the ideas and concepts made by others. The High Wills themselves were made by the Miracle, based on the concept Cvstodians had of them.
The Miracle was about to give birth to a child.
Much of the old and zealous ways of Cvstodia are gone, but some still remain faithful to the old ways of penance, the Archconfraternity.
Headed by Eviterno, the father of all Penitents and the first among them all, granted the oldest penance of eternal waiting and contemplation, only moving when required by the Miracle.
1.Orospina is the head of the Embroidery Palace in Grilles and Ruins. She eventually devoted, consecrated and her soul to her penance, getting wrapped in the very golden silk. She used to use the smallest needles for her most fervent hours, likely to inflict more pain and difficulty. She would kill all those who would enter the palace for that golden silk.
She is also the killer of the Veteran One, as explained by the alterpiece of the same name.
2.Odon was the captain of a sailor crew, sailing on the sea of ink, most likely in the search of the old forbidden library. Their ship was capsized. They woke up drowned in a beautiful cathedral, covered in salt, seaweed and coral, cracked lips and parched throats. They looked upon Odon, and he knew where they were. This had to be the cathedral that the Miracle had long hidden under the dark waters of the sea. He understood his duty and took up guarding of the Cathedral.
3.Lesmes was the Bell ringer, the sexton of the Crown of Towers. He was beheaded for reasons unknown, and his head was carried by a young girl, infanta and put into the reliquary we see. Lesmes seems to have no will of his own, neither his own pain. He lives, and yet he feels only death. He is directed by the Miracle, his own control is beyond him.
4.Benedicta was a member of a congregation of Sisters. Under the light of the candles did the cardinal's corpses lay, within sinister crystal caskets. They were chosen by the Endless Orison, a congregation of sisters that devoted themselves to honour the deceased, with their perpetual prayer. Each time a new body arrived, one of them volunteered as their warden, and so dedicated her daily prayers to their soul until the end of her days. Then another sister would take her place, and so the rite would continue.
One night, the coffin of a new cardinal arrived at the basilica, and the sisters surrounded it to prepare their ritual. At that moment, the sister Benedicta stepped forward, carrying a frayed scroll, and everyone immediately knew the parchment for what it was... the apocryphal prayer. Those ancient verses carried a terrible power. Whoever uttered its inked words would be imprisoned in eternal prayer, unable to stop until they died of starvation. Sister Benedicta kneeled and started her change, as the others fled the room in fear, closing the door upon leaving. They knew Benedicta had sealed her fate, but not the reasons behind that act of sacrifice. Even though centuries have already passed, some sisters swear that the white spectre of Benedicta can still be seen during the darkest nights, praying at the cardinal's sepulchre.
Benedicta at the beginning of the fight says “It's inevitable” in reverse, most likely referencing the birth of the child.
Eviterno wanted the return of the old painful ways of penance and repentance, and the Archconfraternity followed him.
Penitent One suddenly wakes up one day, in a coffin carried by Deogracias and surrounded by people who are seemingly frozen or turned to stone, stretching towards him as if yearning for his return. After all, he did end the cruel endless age of penance long before.
With Mea Culpa gone, he chooses one of the weapons of the 3 ultimate martyrs.
Upon defeating Chisel of Oblivion he is met by a divine and holy being.
Anunciada descends from the sky, upon a disembodied hand, carrying with her the endless scrolls, Penitent One's waking written on its eternal pages. She descends from the heavenly mountains on high, the seat and the beginning of all that is holy. She states herself to be a preceptor in this enterprise.
Penitent One is to defeat the three guardians, in whose consciousness the Miracle has instilled the three regrets, Radames, Lesmes and Orospina.
Radames was a preceptor
Afilaor found in the now broken and gloomy Mother of Mothers doesn't have any story to him for the moment unfortunately. But he's based on Afilador, traditional Spanish blade sharpeners which go around and announce their presence with flutes, Afilaor uses such flutes as well.
After his defeat we are met by the Witness, in the Chapel of Five Doves. Where he will open the cages of the doves and reveal more story and the works of the Miracle as we go.
The doves representing the Miracle can be imagery based on the fact doves represent the Holy Spirit either personally, or to its works, in this context, it refers to the Miracle's works such as the long lost Basilica, to witness it again the Crown of Towers was made, the Sunken Cathedral, the Severed Tower, the afflicted Two Moons.
I have already explained what is said by the witness as the story of the Miracle's effort to Incarnate.
Two Moons based on the Alhambra of Spain.
It was said the old bell, the one in the highest tower, plummeted down and sank in the lake, where no one could ever retrieve it from.
But one night, with the moon at its fullest, something strange happened. Within the surface of the lake, the bell could be seen, hanging on top of its tower, like it had never fallen. And then it tolled. A deep, somber toll that reverberated and tore the silence apart. The lake rippled, and its waters wrinkled like the skin of an old man. The waves spread along the surface, crossing each other, tracing creases and folds that distorted the reflection of the palace.
Those watching the lake witnessed in horror how their own reflections changed shape. Their faces stretched and twisted, their eyes sank within their skulls, their mouths opened agape in impossible, silent screams. That was the curse of the bell. What they saw in the water was not a distorted reflection now, but reality: abominable creatures, damned for eternity.
This was due to Svsona’s obsession with her own reflection, which afflicted all of Two Moons. Yerma had avoided such a fate and began the quest for her revenge.
The lake was a mirror. The palace could be seen in its reflection, a memory of what once existed. Only the Miracle allowed us such sight, as the palace was long lost. After all of this, we must travel through Crimson Rain and climb towards the heart.
We are met with Eviterno, the father of all Penitents, the first Penitent with a penance as old as the Miracle itself.
Upon the defeat of Eviterno and meeting the incarnate child of the Miracle, Incarnate Devotion, it seems the Miracle is unaware of the demise of the High Wills. It is confused about it's very birth and doesn't understand its purpose, feeling its presence is censured alongside the High Wills. It believes the confrontation with the Penitent One is for its judgement.
Ending B:
The blood spilt in the fight is the baptismal sacrament of Incarnate, it understands its purpose, and merges with the Penitent One to form a new incarnate icon, leading into the Second Psalm
Ending A: Upon using the incense of envoys, the Penitent One's fate alters. Incarnate dies, reconciled with the mystery of its birth.
Penitent One is then taken by the Envoys, their very presence means absolution, and Penitent One is blessed by The Great Grace, and is brought into the Canvas of Light and Time. Here we see many of the characters we found in Blasphemous 1 and some from 2. It is seemingly a heaven of sorts, a dreamt kingdom, the holiest of all places.

Dlc content discussion:

The dlc is incredibly interesting and phenomenonal, and performs, in my opinion the function of Blasphemous 1’s Stir of Dawn building, which builds lore and gives us questions. There also seems to be more of a direct plot involved, unlike the base game.

The base plot of B2 is not very expensive or big, it is rather simple compared to B1’s. B2 focuses more on the thematic elements. But the dlc seems to have taken a direct approach.

The dlc begins in Street of Wakes, where we meet Hilaria.

Hilaria is the lady of mud, who had once healed ailments of people with mud, now she has become one with the mud, and the mud people carry her and move in march to where the Miracle directs them.

She gives us a mud key, which breaks upon each use, the first one used to enger the Icebound Mausoleum. 

There's not much to be said about the region itself, it's self explanatory, a desolate icy landscape with mausoleums built into it that dig deep.

At the bottom of one of them, lies the sorority of Sor Cautiva del Silencio.

I have a lot to say regarding her, but I will not include anything here since that is a separate document.

Upon defeating her, we reach the ceramic door, and Anunciada returns to tell us we need the ceramic key from Hilaria to open it. For Anunciada to guide us, it is clear the door is an important one.

Upon reaching the last key, Hilaria tells us she wishes to pass on and we open the ceramic door to meet her on her deathbed.

She says “we got to a realm older than time, yet still a babe in the eyes of eternity.”

“Destiny must be fulfilled.”

There we meet Crisanta in a dream. A dream which has granted her refuge from all: from her life, from her death, and even the Miracle.

She explains her sacrifice at the beginning of the game was a call to stir Penitent One from his slumber.

She has held the hilt of the Mea Culpa, that was left behind after the blade’s destruction due to the end of the High Wills’ age of penance.

Crisanta states that the blade must be restored to prevent the Second Psalm, the result of Ending B.

Doesn't make too much sense since we can already do that with the Incense of the Envoys.

So I think Crisanta may be told to instruct Penitent One on this, likely from the being who exists apart from the Miracle, presiding over the Canvas of Light and Time, the High Dramatist(but we won't discuss that being yet), in order for Crisanta to redeem herself, and that she's not aware of the other alternative.

She says the blade must emerge from a chest of deep mourning and repentance, but also free from sin.

Once the blade is in Penitent One's hand, and he feels the ache and throb, that means Crisanta is with him, making guilt manifest.

She will continue to want until-

Penitent One is then stabbed through the chest by Asterion, pulling him out of the dream, killing him.

He also seeks the Mea Culpa.

He takes the hilt, and says he feels it's sacrilegious virtue, saying it will make ‘them’ tremble.

Then he feels a dark cloud shroud his thoughts, realising the need to use a heretical blade for their purpose.

Penitent One is revived by the blessings of the cherubs moments later.

I think this is also proof that Prie Drie respawns are not canon.

Since each time he's been revived:

1.Lying dead amongst the dead of the Silent Sorrow.
2.The beginning of Blasphemous 2
3.Revived by cherubs in Icebound Mausoleum.

Penitent One wakes up with barely any life left within him, the likely reason for this I will explain later.

Anunciada shows up, but something is very wrong.

She doesn't have the golden golden halo of cherubs around her, and her hand which carries her is gone. She looks gloomy, like a withered flower, her tone is also different.

It is likely she has been made aware or feels her fate coming upon her. But this is just speculation.

The beauteous quill of the Miracle has changed destiny itself in the endless scrolls.

A ribbon of crimson had slipped through her trembling fingers and flown away towards sacred confines.

There we see Asterion and Anunciada kneeling beside him, kneeling like the kneeling statue from whom Mea Culpa was birthed, in a place that is most likely the chapel of kneeling from Blasphemous 1, with resemblance of also the the windows and floor tiles.

Asterion feels doubt, a weight lies on his soul, as he is about to reforge this blade, as if his faith is wavering, to use such a weapon, his master's desires now revealed to him.

After killing Asterion, we speak to Anunciada.

She is saddened, even telling him to dry her tears. A light, a Voice so close and yet so far away revealed unto her a sudden destiny. It told her there is nothing but aching pain in her chest, this pain being Penitent One's gift. She has a sense of regret, though it is free of sin, and continues to pain her.

The blade is reforged from Anunciada’s chest, and now she lies dead.

It's as if this was not meant to go this way, considering destiny itself was rewritten.

Anunciada also had a lack of complete vision and knowledge, for she knew not who would wield the blade. She was willing for Asterion to wield it too. This has been a theme in the series, similar to how Escribar knew a Penitent of Silent Sorrow would come to him, but not knowing which one.

After leaving, we are revealed Asterion is not dead, and that his master has brought him back.

Upon meeting Asterion again, he feels changed.

There he reveals a great piece of information, the fact the Sentence of the Holy Return has been passed down onto both of them. Endless deaths and their endless returns. Their purposes, exalted, so much so they have become prisoners of them.

He wishes for Penitent One to pit his sword of guilt against the crystal tomb of his venerated master. Two Heresies in glorious combat. For now, Asterion only wishes to return to the delectable abyss of the deserved pain.

Upon defeat, Asterion now more bloodied up, feels the connection between him and his master severed.

We don't know if it's because of Mea Culpa, or the fact the master did it himself since Asterion failed him.

The reason why Penitent One woke up with barely any health, is likely because Asterion’s blade is also heretical, and may have heavily affected his sentence.

Asterion jumps off the ledge next to the arena and dies at the bottom.

We then move ahead to find the tomb of the ultimate martyrs, the wielders of the 3 weapons, The Anointed One, The Veteran One and the Punished One.

Twisted manifestations of them have been created from gold and we must defeat them.

Upon defeating them, we get the prayer of the Penitent One, through which we can summon the power of Crisanta through Mea Culpa.

With this we fight Incarnate Devotion and strike him down.

Then Penitent One hands the Mea Culpa to the spectre of Crisanta, who ends the weeping child of the Miracle.

This act has granted her absolution from the Envoys, and she's lifted to the Canvas of Light and Time, now redeemed.

Penitent One is now left behind, his penance is over, and he has sacrificed his ascension for Crisanta.

He approaches the beach, and casts off his capirote and thrusts his sword into the sand, walking away, the last of all Penitents leaving at the nightfall of guilt.

""In the heart everything takes root solitarily.
Footprints without companions are left behind, like in water, or in the ocean's depths”
-Miguel Hernandez,Blasphemous 2

SFF books coming in February 2025,Fantasy,1i909ne,2025-01-24 12:05:29,68,0.96,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1i909ne/sff_books_coming_in_february_2025/,EmmalynRenato,,"SFF here means all speculative fiction (fantasy, science fiction, horror, alternate history, magical realism etc).

The following SFF books will be published in the U.S. in February 2025. Other countries may differ.

If you know of others, please add them as comments below. If I've made any mistakes, just let me know, and I'll fix them up.

The published book formats are included with each entry (mostly hardcover and/or trade paperback with the occasional ebook). This information is obtained from the isfdb website which lists one format type for each entry but mostly omits ebook entries. If it's a new hardcover and/or trade paperback book, it's very likely that an ebook is also coming out at the same time.

DWT243: Dad Delivers Respite as The Gods Crash Down Upon Earth with Wind & Rain Aplenty ⛈️ (25th January 2025),DadsWeeklyTreble,1i8z6h5,2025-01-24 11:20:19,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DadsWeeklyTreble/comments/1i8z6h5/dwt243_dad_delivers_respite_as_the_gods_crash/,Dad1903,,"Testing testing; check one two – DWT is live once again on Reddit!

Terrific, terrific stuff



------------------------

------------------------
------------------------

Welcome back hombres ✌️


The throb of disappointment still nags at Dad after last week... a last minute winner for wigan, meant yet another frustration of the utmost in the month of January 😤. Tis the way of it sure... any cunt could add Liverpool to their coupon and claim genius - Dad's more a cunt who seeketh wisdom of the less obvious ✌️. To Dad's Eyes - Stevenage seemed a solid selection... guess fucking not. The fact wigan went on to lose in midweek at home to relegation-threatened Burton, heaped a nice shovelful of salt into the fucking wounds... timing be everything hombres 😑

Close attention being paid then; Dad's been poring over the FotMob Statistics, hunting eagerly for the delicious tidbits indicating hope in certain areas. As such - a solid set of cunts backed this week: expectations are high that things'll be back on track in the hunt for Double-DWT participation 👊 . Chomping at the bit Dad is by fuck... we get that shot, we arenae looking back: That's Dad's Aim 🎯. A few vivid dreams had regarding such participation... notes being chucked William Nilliam into the air - a truly glee-packed feeling it brings; no oft Dad isnae waking up with a contented smile etched across the face 😄... and that's just at the thought of it occurring - imagine if... hoo mama 😭🤞

Weather be an issue the now of course; Dad Decided no to hold off this time but: all hope piled into the basket, in anticipation of stuff going to plan. Let us trust in the powers that be, assisting us in search of Wonder 🙂. For sure, it'd be a real gift from the Gambling Gods... Dad's sensing they're perhaps starting to feel sympathy for Dad's Plight; the ongoing letting go of the reigns and letting magic hopefully occur HAS to be rewarded at some stage - surely to fuck. Starts tomorrow all being fucking well 🤘

Let's see what happens 🤘


------------------------
------------------------
------------------------
------------------------

DISCLAIMER: Dad is shit at this. As such, do not under any circumstances, take Dad's Advice seriously. By all means - show solidarity with a tiny fragment of your incomings if you are absolutely comfortable with doing so - but please be very aware, that Dad is in no position to provide owt other than polite thanks for the moral support. Other than that, alls there is, is a solid chance of disappointment.

------------------------
------------------------
------------------------
------------------------

Ok - serious pish out the way - let's delve in to the fucking numbers 🙌 


**CURRENT DWT TOTAL FOR JANUARY 2025 STANDS AT: £29.72**

**CURRENT DWT RUNNING TOTAL IN 2025 STANDS AT: £29.72**

**CURRENT DWT RUNNING TOTAL OVERALL STANDS AT: -£1266.86**

**CURRENT DWT RUNNING TOTAL TOWARDS NEXT DOUBLE-DWT STANDS AT: £67.34**





------------------------
------------------------
------------------------
------------------------


So without further ado, please allow Dad to unveil the next offering in this epic journey, one that aims to have the wheels placed back on the rails with a sizeable wedge of bangers slipped into the hand:

+ **Immediate fortune-reversal for Stoke since booting Pelach... suddenly Stoke have become a team again**

+ **Two terrific performances OTR, including Cup progression over Sunderland for new Boss Mark Robins - debut home victory incoming**

+ **Been solid in the league have oxford of late tbf... still managed to lose handsomely in the Cup to lower league opposition - ropey**


Havenae time to fuck about Stoke - apparently summat they are well aware of 👍. A magnificent Extra Time win over Sunderland in the Cup, proves to many (Dad included), that the Mark Robins Mantra hath been adopted with aplomb 😎. The battling away draw with WBA proves the recent resilience isnae just flash-in-the-pan-type stuff... they've sussed it. All adds up to winning at home for the first time under Robins - cannae see owt other than a solid and comprehensive victory, over a team with just 1 win from 13 OTR.


------------------------
------------------------
**CARDIFF**
------------------------
------------------------

+ **A crushing win in the South Wales Derby for Cardiff - confidence doth flow 🍷**

+ **Unbeaten now in 7 across all comps - solid as fuck they've finally become 🪨**

+ **Just the 1 win OTR for visitors derby - couple that with a run of defeats from their last 4, doesnae seem like there's much going on to trouble a jubilant Cardiff team**


The recovery was quiet yet effective going into Sat'days cunting of swansea... modest in terms of goals scored etc... but the turnaround was undeniable. An impressive win away to Watford started the magic: throw on top of that a terrific away win over Sheffield U in the Cup, the recent fightback from 2 down to grab a point away to Millwall and of course yon destruction of the seeming solid-Swansea - there's little to scoff about when talking Cardiff's Credentials. On the other hand, derby have fallen to bits after a spell of trundling along picking up points here and there. Completely arid as of December 29th - the hunt for valuable points'll continue for at least another week ✌️


------------------------
------------------------
**NOTTS COUNTY**
------------------------
------------------------

+ **5 wins from their last 6 have Notts County: The drive to auto-promotion well underway**

+ **Goals raining in during the spell: 16 for the love of fuck. Steering clear of injury hath terrific results ⚽**

+ **Was goals galore last time these two met: County even gave bromley a 2-goal lead within 6 minutes, afore going on to destroy them 2-4**


Progress hath been back to terrific since the injury-hit spell between mid-Nov through mid-Dec; as long as all the top cunts are available, Notts C are a tough set of cunts to beat. Indeed, just the unstoppable Walsall have managed that feat since Dec 21st... and they had a couple big, big chances did Notts C in that affair. Proved to them they cannae fud about - the pace is relentlessly being set, winning always is all that can be done... so far so fucking good then 👍.

Review 5-Day Seoul Itinerary?,solotravel,1i8xoku,2025-01-24 10:16:17,3,0.8,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1i8xoku/review_5day_seoul_itinerary/,pluvoxphile,Itinerary,"Hello! Visiting Korea from February 24th morning till February 28th evening. I know it's gonna be cold, but have heard it is near New York in February temperatures, so I have packed for this. Here is my plan, let me know if it is okay or if there are any major sights I am missing out on. I have not really planned food, since it looks like most nice places don't let a single person in, so any food recommendations for solo travelers would be nice.

I'm really into league of legends LOL so I wanted to try to do some league-related things, any other recommendations for that would be nice :) Not super big on museums, but a little fascinated by North Korea/DMZ area, so my main goal here is to do the DMZ tour.

**February 24th (Sights)**

* Arrive from Tokyo at 11:35am, go through immigration, check into hotel
* Gyeongbokgung Palace.+ Plaza + LCK Arena
* bukchon Hanok Village
* Cheonggyecheon stream
* N Seoul Tower at night (if time, depending on how long above things take/how tired I am)

**February 25th (DMZ)**

* Full day DMZ Tour -- thinking of doing [https://www.vviptravel.com/tours/dmz-red-suspension-bridge-tour](https://www.vviptravel.com/tours/dmz-red-suspension-bridge-tour)

**February 26th (Shopping)**

* Hongdae area morning shopping (cafe recommendations from friend, Basecamp PC Bang)
* National Museum
* Myeongdong Shopping evening
* Maybe go to bar? Friend says foreigner-friendly bars are in 홍대 and 이태원

**February 27th (League of Legends day lol)**

* LoL Park + Mouse Potato
* Gwangjang market
* T1 Headquarters in Gangnam + explore Gangnam boutique stores

**February 28th**

* Miscellaneous -- parks, maybe war museum, walk along old city wall, anything I couldn't really get to earlier"

5-day Seoul Itinerary in February,koreatravel,1i8svdj,2025-01-24 05:59:16,6,0.87,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1i8svdj/5day_seoul_itinerary_in_february/,pluvoxphile,Itinerary,"Hello! Visiting Korea from February 24th morning till February 28th evening. I know it's gonna be cold, but have heard it is near New York in February temperatures, so I have packed for this. Here is my plan, let me know if it is okay or if there are any major sights I am missing out on. I am also solo traveling, so have not really planned food, since it looks like most nice places don't let a single person in -- any food recommendations for solo travelers would be nice.

I'm really into league of legends LOL so I wanted to try to do some league-related things, any other recommendations for that would be nice :) Not super big on museums, but a little fascinated by North Korea/DMZ area, so my main goal here is to do the DMZ tour.

**February 24th (Sights)**

* Arrive from Tokyo at 11:35am, go through immigration, check into hotel
* Gyeongbokgung Palace.+ Plaza + LCK Arena
* bukchon Hanok Village
* Cheonggyecheon stream
* N Seoul Tower at night (if time, depending on how long above things take/how tired I am)

**February 25th (DMZ)**

* Full day DMZ Tour -- thinking of doing [https://www.vviptravel.com/tours/dmz-red-suspension-bridge-tour](https://www.vviptravel.com/tours/dmz-red-suspension-bridge-tour)

**February 26th (Shopping)**

* Hongdae area morning shopping (cafe recommendations from friend, Basecamp PC Bang)
* National Museum
* Myeongdong Shopping evening
* Maybe go to bar? Friend says foreigner-friendly bars are in 홍대 and 이태원

**February 27th (League of Legends day lol)**

* LoL Park + Mouse Potato
* Gwangjang market
* T1 Headquarters in Gangnam + explore Gangnam boutique stores

**February 28th**

* Miscellaneous -- parks, maybe war museum, walk along old city wall, anything I couldn't really get to earlier"

Must be an active player good at making high points in all chests but we’re looking for members that excel in leagues and arenas. We’re full of high point earners, lots of (fair) trading, fun, help and always hit chest 6. We also have our own exclusive Discord server which out is a requirement to join. Must be active and we have a minimum 7k point min. requirement for every chest. We’d love for you to join our team and our discord server. HOW TO FIND US! Put the biohazard ☣️ emoji before and after Alliance name and include a space before and after the emojis. So it will look like this: ☣️ Fusion Dragons ☣️ Ignore the triangle ⚠️ or ❕emojis that shows in the pics. I’m not sure why that’s there but it isn’t when you search so don’t put the caution or exclamation emoji in when searching for our alliance. Just the ☣️ with the spaces between the biohazard emojis and the alliance name. No need to submit profile or points. As long as you got the criteria we’re looking for and have a minimum of 50,000 MPs, you can join. It’s open.

Hacked and nothing even matters!,riotgames,1i8q7nk,2025-01-24 02:37:00,0,0.5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/riotgames/comments/1i8q7nk/hacked_and_nothing_even_matters/,Pristine_Depth_2125,,"To start this off my main email i made as a teenager was hacked and with it they password recovered everything from me! after a few days of support with facebook tiktok discord everything else i got it all back and added 2FA and a bunch of security features. With all this said I havnt played league in a while and was wondering if they got my lol account. So i went to log in and found out they didnt get into my league account. Even though my account wasnt hacked i wanted to add 2FA on my riot account just to lock it down after this whole hacker fiasco i went through. I logged into the website and went to my profile and it pops up an email verification and to type in code sent to my registered email. This was one of the things i wanted to change as the email i used was my old old one that was hacked and I already made a brand new one that i locked down. With all this said now i waited and waited and the verification code never came. I tried again and again for days and never got one. So decided to google it and found riots system has issues with hotmail accounts and just never sends the codes. People all over the internet said they have had this issue and to just make a ticket and riot will change it for you. I make a ticket and say this same stuff and riot wants all this info about first skin i bought with RP and tft arena boards battle pass yada yada. My account is like 10-12 years old and they want info about when i first made it that relates to RP... like how am i supposed to remember any of that. My user name is literally a acronym for my real life name and birth year and sent them my ID photo showing it all matches my user name, listed every single friend i have with there IRL names locations who i play with all the time and have for 10+ years everything i can literally think of and they still say its not enough.. So basically i never can change my password or email ever even if i do get hacked one day. I feel helpless and dont know what to do. Cus the hackers are still trying to access stuff of mine every day and dont want them to get ahold of my league account but also dont want riot to lock it or something if they wont give me access because i cant prove it good enough for them..."

For some odd reason, when NB rolls around, it allows for custom lobbies, unlike any other RGM. With Riot's recent focus on making Arena lobbies basically a custom game, why has this attention been neglected for other modes? I would love to play games of urf or one for all or whatever the RGM is at the time with a group of friends. 

Really sad that a lot of people almost consider League a singleplayer game with the endless possibilities available just inches from the hands of Riot. I understand that the client was the bottleneck before, but, at least in my opinion, the client seems more capable of things than ever now. We have all sorts of improvements and graphics and games within the client but can't make a custom urf lobby? Would love to see Riot make this possible or at least work towards it."

HLM26 wishlist,HockeyLegacyManager,1i8mynh,2025-01-23 23:09:33,11,0.76,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/HockeyLegacyManager/comments/1i8mynh/hlm26_wishlist/,bigjam987,Suggestion,"Hey all, I would like to pitch in my views on what I think should be added into HLM26.

1) Ownership and Finances
This is the main upgrade for HLM that I would like to see. An advanced (ideally optional) ownership system. Essentially every team has a set amount of money they can work with each season. Toronto in real life is worth an estimated $4B meanwhile the Columbus Blue Jackets are valued at $1B. My idea is that you can set certain aspects of the team with your given budget. An example would be putting something like $10M into coaching budget, and having a remaining budget to work with player salaries, arena renovations and advertising (more on those later)

1A) No salary cap, but not unlimited money
This ties in with the financial situation of your team. Pre 2005 there was no Salary Cap and the NHL worked more like the MLB where larger markets could spend more on players. This will definitely improve the historical gameplay and add more challenge to smaller market teams if you wish to enable this mode

1B) Arenas and Relocations
Arenas are the heart of your team. Depending on the performance of the team you will get better or worse attendance that also hurts or helps your team’s revenue for the season. Over time your stadium will need to be repaired and you can also renovate the stadium. I also would really like to see a proper relocation system implanted as some of the most fun stories ive had is with relocating franchises that boom right after relocation. Also you should be able to view the franchise’s history pre-relocation 

2) QOL
This section will be for small rapid fire QOL changes not in that much detail

2A) View historical playoff brackets, team standings and player statistics from previous seasons

2B) Player moods, how happy they are with the current team (you can turn this off)

2C) Winter Classics/Stadium Series games, normal games against big rivals but played outside. Just a fun special little event and nothing crazy

2D) More banners for Divisional championships and Presidential Trophy Winners, also the ability to set custom retired numbers. You can also choose to retire a number league wide under league settings if you wish

2E) Activate/Deactivate certain leagues on an already created file

2F) Individual team HOF’s for the players that shouldn’t have their number retired but still be honored by their team

This is just a collection of ideas I think would add some more depth into the game and improve it for the better. Please let me know what you think of these suggestions or if you need any clarification on them "

I can’t understand WHY for the love of Amari didn’t RY update the endpage maps to include the Isle Kingdoms. The only plausible reason I can think of would be the immediate giveaway that they were going to be going there, and that’s why the map needed to be updated. Buuut… almost everyone had pretty much guessed we’d be going to the isles this book. Right from the blurb and excerpts itself. It wouldn’t have hurt to update the map to include the isles and the northern regions. 

That said. I can’t WAIT for all the fan art. Not just of the maps, but of the places themselves. I’m most excited to see fan art of Zehyllna and its capital. The waterfalls and the amphitheater? Sounds amazing omg. Also, the temple arena at Unnbriel. Which places are you guys most excited for, for the fanart? And to all the talented artists among us out there: I am not-so-patiently waiting for your skills to bring these places to life 😍"
