## 🦀 Anza SVM API

The idea of a Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) is generating some conversations and excitement.

Similar to Ethereum's evolution with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), SVM projects are now looking at ways to leverage Solana's advanced transaction processing capabilities for various innovative applications.

But what the ""SVM"" actually is varies among Solana developers.

Some view it as the entire transaction processing pipeline, from validator runtime to program execution, while others consider it the lower-level eBPF virtual machine responsible for executing programs.

Most new SVM projects adopt the broader definition, including the complete transaction processing system.

In order to make the SVM more available to other projects, Anza has released the **solana-svm** Rust crate, which provides developers with tooling to build SVM projects.

The Anza SVM is a specialized API designed for building applications that leverage the unique transaction processing capabilities of Solana, not for apps that are already being built to run on Solana now.

The SVM's architecture offers a range of opportunities for Solana and beyond Solana validator, such as building off-chain services that simulate Solana's transaction processing, an execution layer for rollups, which execute transactions or blocks without the full validator or consensus protocol, or as an extended SVM with custom functionality.

As the Solana matures and the SVM ecosystem expands, new use cases and innovations will emerge. The rise of SVM projects will usher in a new era of Solana tooling to harness the full potential of SVM, growing the entire Solana ecosystem.

Kraken Listing Coming,WEN_,1cxij3x,2024-05-21 16:54:17,10,0.82,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1cxij3x,AdministrationCute56,,If you scroll right you’ll see that WEN is on the shortlist on Kraken’s website to be listed on the exchange. It’s being evaluated and vetted. You can check it out directly on their official website through this link https://www.kraken.com/listings I’ve been doing my research on wen and studying the team. I hope they roll out marketing and get more listings soon. Whats your thoughts on this? We’re very sideways as a of recently with really no significant news or developments. Of course you’ve got your FUD but that’s normal. It took many meme coins that are in the billions right now at least a year and definitely long months of sideways actions and dips. It’s almost like an initiation ritual but I’ll continue to be patient with WEN it’s been roughly 2 months since its previous ATH by my calculations it should get moving soon. The key here is trust the market never the team or the shillers who have WEN in their name. Only the market can dictate who wins. I think the market is on our side for all of us that have invested because greed will inevitably come swooping in to make an easy double or triple. The memes pumping hard today will take much more money to get another 20% as they grow. One thing I like about WEN is its relatively low market cap at around 130-140m give or take a few million. I think reaching 1 billion is possible with a few good catalysts and obviously then we can all choose to make our decisions but as a meme coin I think this one is strong it’s just new right now. Anyways I’m being patient on my end but Id like to hear your thoughts on how your plan is drawn up.

Solana Ecosystem Braces for Massive Liquidity Injection in April as 8+ Projects Prepare Token Launches: Here is everything you should know,solana,1btc84v,2024-04-01 14:57:34,13,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1btc84v/solana_ecosystem_braces_for_massive_liquidity/,Rare-Bridge839,DeFi," Solana is poised for a record-breaking liquidity injection this April as approximately eight major projects launch their tokens and distribute highly anticipated airdrops to the Solana community. This unprecedented series of events promises a significant boost to on-chain liquidity and signals a vibrant chapter for Solana's rapidly evolving ecosystem. April is by far the biggest Airdrop month for the Solana ecosystem.

## Wormhole Leads the Pack with Cross-Chain Boost

Wormhole, the leading cross-chain interoperability protocol, is kicking off the liquidity event. [On April 3rd, over 400,000 wallets across multiple blockchains](https://solanafloor.com/news/wormhole-w-airdrop-claim-date-announced-for-april-3rd-heres-everything-you-need-to-know), including Solana, will receive the $W token airdrop. As the token debuts on the Solana network, Solana users are set to benefit significantly from this launch.

Zeus, a communication layer bringing seamless Bitcoin-Solana integration, has earmarked an impressive 300,291 addresses for the Airdrop. Eligibility criteria encompass $JUP voters, zuPoint holders, and DappieGangNFT holders, underscoring Zeus's focus on rewarding its loyal community.

## Tensor's $TNSR Airdrop Fuels Solana NFT Activity

[Tensor, responsible for over $2 billion in lifetime NFT trading volume and dominance in Solana's NFT sector](https://solanafloor.com/news/tensor-solanas-top-nft-marketplace-introduces-tnsr-token-airdrop-details-coming-soon), has yet to confirm an exact date, but early signs suggest an April rollout.

A ""Z-Score"" system rewards active participation, hinting at a sizable airdrop. Zeta's seed funding and ambitious plans for a Solana-based L2 DEX rollup add even more weight to this highly-anticipated event.

## io.net Powers AI on Solana in Anticipation of Massive $IO Airdrop

Addressing the demands of decentralized AI, io.net recently secured a $1 billion valuation while raising $30 million. [On April 28th, they will launch their $IO token airdrop](https://solanafloor.com/news/io-net-is-launching-a-massive-airdrop-on-solana-in-april-your-guide-to-maximum-allocation), rewarding GPU suppliers and users who participate in their community quests.

Tensor Co-Founder Teases Imminent Release,solana,19dpssj,2024-01-23 09:36:07,5,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/19dpssj/is_tnsr_token_coming_soon_tensor_cofounder_teases/,Rare-Bridge839,NFT/Gaming," In an exciting development for the Solana NFT community, the founders of Tensor, a leading NFT marketplace on the Solana blockchain, have hinted that they are nearing the conclusion of Season 3. This hint was dropped during a recent [Twitter Spaces conversation with Backpack founders](https://x.com/tensor_hq/status/1748338543188201484?s=20), with the co-founder remarking that they are in the ""final innings"" of the current season. This comment is sparking anticipation within the crypto community, as it is widely interpreted as a precursor to the much-awaited launch of Tensor's new digital token, $TNSR, signifying a pivotal moment in the platform's journey.

Since its inception, Tensor has dramatically reshaped the landscape of NFT marketplaces on Solana. Launching its third season on July 29, following the successful conclusion of its second season, Tensor has consistently dominated the Solana ecosystem, accounting for 70-80% of the blockchain's trading volume. This dominance has seen Tensor surpass Magic Eden, which held the top spot for two years, highlighting the platform's rapid growth and popularity.

The anticipation for the $TNSR token is further fueled by the innovative reward system introduced in the previous seasons. Seasons 1 and 2 rewarded participants with treasure boxes containing shards vital for minting the exclusive Tensorians NFT collection. Significantly, some of these treasure boxes include $TNSR tokens, which will become accessible once the token is officially launched.

Analysts speculate that $TNSR could emerge as a large-cap token within Solana, given Tensor's track record of occasionally surpassing BLUR, the leading NFT marketplace on Ethereum, in trading volume. [BLUR's significant market cap of $700 million underscores ](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/blur)the potential magnitude of $TNSR's entry into the market.

Furthermore, the timing of the $TNSR token release, closely following the $JUP airdrop by Jupiter, adds to the excitement within the Solana community. This launch is poised to be one of the biggest airdrops on Solana since the inception of the blockchain's airdrop season in November 2023.

While the exact rewards for farmers remain to be seen, the general sentiment is one of optimism. The launch of $TNSR is a significant event for Tensor and its users. As the Solana community eagerly awaits the arrival of $TNSR, the potential impact of this new token on the market dynamics and the future of digital asset trading remains a topic of widespread interest and speculation.

This is an update to show the progress since then.

In the below, you'll see a sneak-peak of the primary product name (""TNSR"").  TNSR = Tensor, because it's made of vectors.  We're using FD.io's VPP for a dataplane.

Scalability of VPP is far beyond what FreeBSD or linux kernel networking can achieve.  We'v tested to 40Gbps IPsec on a pair of i7-6950x based routers with QuickAssist crypto offload.  The same platform will forward at 42Mpps. Others have tested VPP on the new Intel Scalable Xeons to 1tbps. https://fd.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2017/06/FDio-Datasheet_May-2017.pdf

There should be a product announcement next week.  We should be shipping in Q1 of 2018.
