Bybit mixed Apex APE with APECoin APE in their halal token certification ,CryptoCurrency,1h22wae,2024-11-28 13:50:19,0,0.2,11,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h22wae,mrtac96,DISCUSSION,"Bybit has released a list of tokens deemed halal (permissible) according to Islamic Sharia law. However, there seems to be a significant error in their listing.
The platform has mistakenly included ApeX, a perpetual decentralized exchange (DEX) that is explicitly forbidden (haram) under Islamic law. This oversight is particularly concerning as Bybit initially used the ApeX name and logo in their listing but on detail page bybit to refer to ApeCoin, a cryptocurrency associated with NFTs.
As user wont bother to read the detail pdf, 
this apparent blunder raises serious questions about the diligence and accuracy of Bybit's Shariah compliance efforts. It's crucial for platforms offering Islamic financial services to maintain the highest standards of accuracy and transparency to ensure that users can make informed decisions.

Airdrop galore - (Surprise) LayerZero second claim and EigenLayer Season 2 is here! Sharing the steps to check and claim your allocation,ethtrader,1flv5u1,2024-09-21 00:39:50,6,0.8,91,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1flv5u1/airdrop_galore_surprise_layerzero_second_claim/,Every_Hunt_160,Original Content,"Hello fellow farmers,

After the Fed Cut Pumpa, Farmers have been blessed with extra magic Internet Money yesterday - lets get into it!

**1) LayerZero**

Yesterday, we were hit with a surprise drop from LayerZero - nobody was actively farming, but  they announced they would re-allocate extra ZRO us.

There are **2** qualifying criteria and you would get extra ZRO: 1) those who successfully claimed on season and 2) You used LayerZero (e.g Stargate) at least once after the first claim.

Allocation is based: on a 'pro rata' distribution: 1) if you were allocated more ZRO on your first claim presumably you get more for this reallocation. 2) And the more gas fees you spent, the more ZRO you also get. (Tweet below explains fully)

https://preview.redd.it/pu9ulgk093qd1.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9adff5f99821e65adfe92f3717805630ebf45ed

Their official tweet link here: [https://x.com/LayerZero\_Fndn/status/1837228529282334736](https://x.com/LayerZero_Fndn/status/1837228529282334736) 

**How to check and claim extra ZRO:** 

Step 1: Go to the official site only: [https://layerzero.foundation/claim](https://layerzero.foundation/claim) 

Step 2: Paste your wallet address, or connect wallet and check. You can see how many you were reallocated

https://preview.redd.it/ckzx2ole93qd1.png?width=1160&format=png&auto=webp&s=09bf63f0f652fcd70aef9f528518ab800cf2aa6b

So I got 88 ZRO on my main wallet, and I only made about 4-5 swaps all under 10 cents gas fees in the months after the first claim. 

Imo this is actually a **very good and juicy** allocation considering the low effort, considering 1 ZRO is trading over $4 at current time!

Step 3: For the claim, note you must claim on the same chain as your first claim (ARB for me). Note that currently at the time of this post, there are some issues with donating Eth on Arb before you can claim - but no rush as you have **30 days to claim your extra ZRO.**

So, LayerZero has a very juicy second drop considering you didn't have to actively farm for that.

So now let's get to the second drop - not as juicy as ZRO, but still a nice extra bonus:

**2) EigenLayer Season 2**

Ok farmers, so the key thing to note for this is that for this allocation a number of $EIGEN is going to the Liquid Staking Protocols (EtherFi/Swell etc) and this will not be reflected in the original EigenLayer claim page for S2 (which frankl;y will only give a Happy Meal amount if you qualified)

**1) First place to check - Eigen Claims Portal**

Details on this tweet:

https://preview.redd.it/qsy5tpvta3qd1.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=d70d77913c067378a18098bb787d92abbfdb80c1

Official tweet : [https://x.com/ether\_fi\_Fdn/status/1837299489998016538](https://x.com/ether_fi_Fdn/status/1837299489998016538)

Okay, so for the first Season 1 claim I was able to claim around 110 Eigen (after their 100 $Eigen bonus)

And when I check on [claims.eigenfoundation.org](http://claims.eigenfoundation.org) for my S2 claim, I was only allocated .. 5 $Eigen. Yes, -96% decrease when the number of Eth I restaked was the same lol - and I believe I still have to pay mainnet fees to claim.

But better luck checking with LSPs:

**2) EtherFi $Eigen S2:**

Go to, and check [https://x.com/ether\_fi\_Fdn/status/1836927661656146411](https://x.com/ether_fi_Fdn/status/1836927661656146411) 

https://preview.redd.it/nf2ssragb3qd1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=47c98cddbfe74159094b7cfa7addd14b31bd41d7

So here, I got 12 Eigen on the same wallet, 2x the amount as the official Eigen claims page.

**3) Swell $Eigen Checker**

Go to: [https://x.com/swellnetworkio/status/1837116680117649816](https://x.com/swellnetworkio/status/1837116680117649816) 

https://preview.redd.it/sft2fgbpb3qd1.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5df4eb68ace6072273ac7b3a669a24171bde2c4

From Swell I was able to get 18 $Eigen, even more than EtherFi.

So in total on my wallet I was able to get just 30-40 $Eigen for Season 2 (have not checked for Renzo and other potential drops). Still only around a quarter compared to Season 1, but at least it's not just a measely 5 $Eigen from the main eigen checker page. 

As I said earlier the real meat is in Season 1 (where everyone who qualified would be given 100 $Eigen - trading $3-$4 on pre-market if I recall correctly) - season 2 is still an additional bonus and free money tho so can't really complain much

**4) Bonus drop - EtherFi S3!**

Yes lads, EtherFi **Season 3 checker dropped BEFORE Swell Season 1**

Go to: [https://claim.ether.fi/](https://claim.ether.fi/) to check both your $EthFi season 3 and $Eigen s2 allocation (click continue on the page):

https://preview.redd.it/0kupjnjlc3qd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b14aa341174e82d077338e3ccd6d90c12886bdc

2.5% was allocated for S3 compared to 5% for Season to S2. I checked my allocation, it was roughly half the number of EthFi I got for S2, so the numbers are accurate.

**Conclusion:**

So that's it my farmers! I really liked these allocations as we were being rewarded for passive farming - I wasn't really pushing any buttons to get rewarded as the work was already done many months before.

So did you qualify? If you liked this content, please engage and share your thoughts in the comment section - this OC post took me close to 40 minutes to make, and sometimes it is sad to see such posts sometimes get a fraction of the engagement of a link post. Hope you found this useful!"

How Do Crypto Airdrops Work? Explore Upcoming Airdrops with ChangeNOW,ChangeNOW_io,1d2mwp6,2024-05-28 11:57:37,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChangeNOW_io/comments/1d2mwp6/how_do_crypto_airdrops_work_explore_upcoming/,NewslessDermis,,"# Hey there, crypto curious Redditors! Ready to snag some free tokens falling from the digital sky? Let‚Äôs dive into the world of crypto airdrops!

# Understanding Crypto Airdrops

Crypto airdrops are a cool marketing strategy in the crypto world where projects give away free tokens to their community members. This boosts awareness, adoption, and rewards loyal users. Airdrops can come in various forms, from completing simple tasks to just holding certain tokens in your wallet.

Types of Airdrops:

* Standard Airdrop: Like a surprise gift for signing up with your wallet address ‚Äî no strings attached.
* Bounty Airdrop: Complete tasks like following social media channels, retweeting, or joining Telegram groups to earn tokens.
* Holder Airdrop: Already holding certain cryptocurrencies? You might find some extra tokens in your wallet, like finding money in your old jeans!
* Exclusive Airdrop: For the loyal fans and early birds who‚Äôve been there from the start.

# What is the Purpose of Airdrop in Crypto?

* **Increase Awareness:** Spread the word about new projects.
* **Boost Adoption: I**ncentivize users to try out the platform or protocol.
* **Reward Loyalty:** Early supporters get rewarded, like a thank you note but in crypto!

# How Do Airdrops Work?

1. Announcement. The project announces the airdrop through their official channels (website, social media, forums).
2. Eligibility Criteria. They specify what you need to do to be eligible ‚Äî holding a specific token, completing tasks, or just registering with your wallet address.
3. Snapshot. For holder airdrops, a snapshot of the blockchain is taken at a specific time to record eligible addresses.
4. Distribution. Tokens are distributed to eligible addresses either automatically or through a claim process.
5. Claiming Process. Sometimes, users need to claim their airdropped tokens by connecting their wallets to a specific website and following instructions.

# Notable Upcoming Airdrops of 2024

**1. LayerZero (ZRO) Airdrop**

The LayerZero (ZRO) airdrop is generating a lot of buzz. Set for 2024, this airdrop marks a milestone for LayerZero, focusing on cross-chain interoperability. A snapshot taken on May 1, 2024, will determine the ZRO token allocation to eligible participants. To qualify, you need to interact with LayerZero‚Äôs ecosystem, like using Stargate Finance, bridging funds via the Aptos Bridge, and engaging with the Testnet Bridge. LayerZero Labs is aware of potential Sybil attacks and has measures in place to ensure fair distribution.

**2. zkSync Airdrop**

zkSync is another hot Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, using zero-knowledge proofs for fast and cost-efficient transactions. To be eligible, you should interact with the zkSync network by bridging assets, trading, and using zkSync-based apps. The airdrop is expected around June 13, 2024.

**3. ZKX Airdrop**

ZKX, a perpetual trading protocol on StarkNet, is all about democratizing access to global yields. Launched in 2022, ZKX has secured $4.5 million in funding and attracted big names like StarkWare, Amber Group, and Huobi. They've dedicated 15% of their token supply to airdrops, so keep an eye out!

Farming 101 strategies that you can use across almost all projects ,ethtrader,1cus0ax,2024-05-18 03:40:19,6,0.62,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1cus0ax/farming_101_strategies_that_you_can_use_across/,Every_Hunt_160,Original Content,"What‚Äôs good EthTrader fam and farmers,

3 days ago I made a short post on the top projects I am farming : https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/s/Nxlvym6gHS

Even though I have been making farming posts for months, from time to time I still see beginners commenting on how to farm. Seems like not everyone is on board the farming train yet!

So this is a post for beginners on how to start farming across Layer 2s.

*Note that I have replaced the a word to ‚Äòfarming‚Äô because Ruggit keeps locking my account if I say the forbidden word.

1) Increase transaction volume by making swaps on DEXes/bridges

This is the most important tip I‚Äôd say, for almost all projects transaction volume is one of the main criteria and the way to boost your volume is by making swaps or bridges on the blockchain. 

So you need to: 1) Identify the top DEXes for the Layer 2 - for example, for Scroll I use ambient.finance and Izumi the most. Take note that Eth -> Weth swaps are not counted, so swap from Eth to a stablecoin and back to Eth.

Tips for choosing your DEX: You can compare the slippage between the DEXes by putting example 0.1 Eth (do not click swap) and see how many stablecoins each DEX will give you.

2) For bridging, I like to bridge to another layer 2 that you can farm (e.g Scroll to Base, or you do dual farming by swapping LINEA to Arbitrum using Stargate which utilises LayerZero which has future seasons of farming).

Let me give you a criteria of a 3 in 1 farming: When you make a bridge on Jumper, LINEA to Arbitrum , and select the Stargate option: You are farming 1) Jumper token , 2) ZRO token, and 3) LINEA all with a single swap. Now THAT is true efficiency !

2) Increase contract interactions/Dapp interactions

So this is another important criteria, usually farmers aim for at least 25 different contract interactions per Layer 2.

How to do it? Interact with more Dapps and also different tokens/NFTs per layer 2.

Giving an example:

1) There are more than 5-10 DEXes on Scroll. You may only use 1 or 2 of them because of slippage- but make one interaction on others (Syncswap/Sushi/SpaceFi) because each new DEX counts as a new contract interaction- you can swap just a very small amount on Dapps you ‚Äòdon‚Äôt like‚Äô

2) Cheap interactions: Buy cheap NFTs on element.market , use cheap protocols like dmail or gas.zip to increase contract interactions- don‚Äôt spam your transactions as you don‚Äôt want to be flagged though.

3) Increase number of unique months/weeks of transactions

Increasingly, projects are filtering out those with less than 2 months of contract interactions as more and more farmers join the space.

My tip is: Get your very first transaction in as soon as possible, even if it is a busy week for you to farm. This is for evidence of ‚Äòrecord‚Äô since the number of months starts counting from your first transaction.

After, try to make swaps once a week, at a minimum once a month for every project you are farming.

4) Add liquidity for multiplier

I‚Äôve seen this to be a multiplier in more and more projects, in fact LINEA and Scroll now has a liquidity campaign.

There are risks of impermanent loss on many pools though. My tip is to minimise risk, join a single sided pool (e.g on Stargate you can just deposit Eth, no risk of impermanent loss) or join a stablecoin pool like USDC-USDT on a DEX.

5) Maximise efficiency by doing dual farming

Like above, I already gave you an example on how a single swap on Jumper gave a 3 in 1 farm.

Tip is to identify which Layer 2s and protocols you can farm and do your farming there.

This way, even if one of the project flunks on TGE you can spread your risk across many different projects . It‚Äôs fun to farm as many as possible anyway !

So that‚Äôs it fellow farmers and aspiring farmers. My top 5 tips to all beginners out there.

If you are new , I hope it breaks down the mystery on how farmers farm and you enjoyed this post. Good luck to everyone !"

"Sharing the top 10 most promising projects I am farming, and whether it is too late to get in!",ethtrader,1bvjdeo,2024-04-04 06:02:57,35,0.96,120,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1bvjdeo/sharing_the_top_10_most_promising_projects_i_am/,Every_Hunt_160,Original Content,"Hi all,

After the high engagement on my last post [https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1brb953/the\_top\_10\_airdrops\_in\_2024\_my\_personal\_opinion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1brb953/the_top_10_airdrops_in_2024_my_personal_opinion/) , I decide to create yet another casual/fun guide on the top projects I  farming, and whether it is too late to start.

So in no order of ranking/importance..

1. **LINEA** : If you are a farmer, LINEA is probably near or at the top of your list recently in the last month.

**Is it too late**: Today is the last day of Linea Park! So yes it is too late to get started from scratch, but if you have farmed this and completed their PoH before remember to complete whatever tasks are left.

2. **LayerZERO**: Another top one, with 300m funding this is one of the most heavily funded and hyped projects out there.

**Is it too late:** This is a 50-50. $ZRO is due to launch by 30 June (from what i've read on X, they did not officially say it), so technically is sounds like there is time but the farming has been going on for over a year so I also wouldn't be surprised one bit if anyone who starts now will be excluded.

**3. ZKSYNC** : One of the most, if not the most hyped farmed projects out there, found on my previous list as well.

**Is it too late**: Most likely yes, snapshot and token always seems to be imminent and rumours that snapshot is already taken (but not confirmed). But those who already have transactions, advise to continue making it as this may help criteria like transaction volume/paymaster transaction count.

**4. SCROLL** : One of the underfarmed gems out there imo, as I explained in my last post above - I also expect a significant drop from this if you qualify.

**Is it too late**: Finally, this is one where I can say I'm quite confident it's not too late to get started - there's no indications or rumblings that a snapshot is imminent. So if you are new, this one should be on your list!

**5. Hyperlane** : Another interoperability chain I am farming. Similar to Wormhole and LayerZero - I have an earlier farming guide on this (you can add bridge.inevm to that list to farm Injective chain)

**Is it too late:** Just like Scroll, this one you have a decent chance that it is not too late to get started and you may still qualify if you start now!

**6. EtherFi/EigenLayer** : There are various protocols to farm EigenLayer, like EtherFi, Swell, Renzo, KelpDao etc

**Is it too late**: No it is not too late - but if you only join now and are putting in a little, note that you are disadvantaged since lots of whales are farming for a long time and already have a big portion of the points compared to you, so it may not be worth it. EtherFi season 2 is also in place so dual farming there.

**7. Zora**: One of the more promising Layer 2s being farmed, they have decent funding too.

**Is it too late**: I don't think its too late, the problem is that you may not qualify - it is unclear whether they will actually do a drop and it might favour actual creators since they are strongly on the NFT side of things. Still probably worth a punt if you don't mind risking your gas fees.

**8. Taiko** : One of the most hyped Layer 2s from 2023.

**Is it too late**: It may seem a bit late since their mainnet is launching at the end of April. But I think there is still a decent chance anyone who uses the testnet anytime before the mainnet can qualify. Since this is testnet no harm transacting if you have time since it's all free (sepholia eth is used for gas fees, no real money lost) - this is definitely still worth to do with the low risk, but if you are farming you MUST complete the proof of humanity on Galxe.

**9. Jumper** : My top bridge to farm currently

**Is it too late:** Nope, it is not too late, and I'd advise to put in your first transaction there between Layer 2s ASAP. They are integrating Scroll soon as well so this would be one of my top places to do dual farming when that happens!

**10. BASE/PolygonZKEVM :** As I explained in my last post:  I am putting these 2 names together, because it is unclear whether they  will actually do an airdrop. But if either of one does it, it will  definitely be in the top 10 because Coinbase and Polygon are the biggest  crypto companies around. 

**Is it too late:** I don't think its too late to get started since there are no imminent snapshot. The risk is that there is a real risk in not getting anything at the end of it, but its worth to make some transactions there 'just in case' - there's a risk to take (losing on gas fees) for disproportionately large gains imo. Maybe this is one for the more experienced farmers and not the first project you start off on.

So that's it! So as you might see, in this space the earlier you get started and put your first transaction in the Layer 2/protocol, the more beneficial it is.
