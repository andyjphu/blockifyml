"Element Wallet x Coinbase: ""Send a Friend CORE"" Rewards Guide",CoinBase,1i0qee5,2025-01-13 17:20:28,0,0.2,2,https://www.elementwallet.link/join?referral_code=zJ9mOM,saifsamir,,"Hey everyone! Here's a quick guide to earning up to $18 in CORECHAIN rewards with Coinbase's Learn and Earn program.

Steps to Get Started:

1. Open an Element Wallet

While signing up, you’ll see a field for a referral code. You can use my link:
https://www.elementwallet.link/join?referral_code=zJ9mOM
OR manually enter the referral code: zJ9mOM


2. Complete the First Quest ($5 CORE)

Set up a new CORE wallet address in Element Wallet.

Transfer 2.1 CORE from your Coinbase wallet to your new CORE address.


3. Complete the Second Quest ($3 CORE)

Send/receive CORE with a friend in Element Wallet.


How to Complete the Second Quest with Me:

If you didn’t use my referral code, you can still add me as a friend manually in Element Wallet: @Samir

DM me in the app and send at least 1 CORE using the $ sign in the peer chat.

Type ""Done"" in the chat after sending.

Request the same amount back from me (click the $ sign and use the request option).

If you get a request error, make sure we’re added as friends in the app first.


Mission Complete:

Once everything is done, open your Coinbase app, and you should see the $3 CORE reward for completing the ""Send a Friend CORE"" quest.

Core (CORECHAIN) - A Deep Dive into Recent Developments and Market Dynamics  
  
Abstract  
  
This analysis explores Core (CORECHAIN), a burgeoning Bitcoin-aligned, EVM-compatible layer-1 blockchain, in light of its recent market performance and ecosystem expansions. We delve into Core's unique Satoshi Plus consensus mechanism, combining Delegated Proof of Work and Delegated Proof of Stake, highlighting its potential to enhance Bitcoin's utility in DeFi. Following a significant price surge after Coinbase's inclusion in its listing roadmap, this paper evaluates Core's market cap growth, trading volume, and the impact of new partnerships like Bifrost Network's BTCFi integration. We analyze the surge in Total Value Locked (TVL), surpassing $1 billion, and the staking of over 5,300 BTC on Core, underscoring its role in Bitcoin DeFi (BTCfi). Additionally, the paper covers the launch of new products like the Coretoshi NFT campaign and the adoption of Core's Dual Staking by Hashnote Labs. Through technical analysis, social media sentiment from posts found on X, and future outlook, this study provides insights into Core's trajectory, challenges, and strategic roadmap, offering a comprehensive view of its standing and potential within the cryptocurrency landscape.

Since its listing, $CORE has experienced some shaky times, dropping to its all time low in November ‘23 at $0.34. Since then it’s been clawing back ground, rising to $3.77 in April ‘24, then back down to a low of $0.76 at the start of November ‘24.  By the end of November, it had climbed back to $2.09 before dipping again to $0.96 just ten days later during the major market dip. Just three days later, it’s back to $1.31.

The floor is rising up to meet the falling ceiling. 

My prediction: sometime between March and May 2025, the price will stabilize around the $2.00 mark. It’ll remain at that price point until the end of summer 2025 when it’ll break out to a new ATH, close to $8.00, then steadily fall back to around $6.00 where it’ll rest and establish a new floor.

One requirement is to open an Element Wallet. You will notice a field to enter referral code field when signing up for new account. You may visit this link [https://www.elementwallet.link/join?referral\_code=nfiBRr](https://www.elementwallet.link/join?referral_code=nfiBRr) Or manually enter referral code:  
`nfiBRr`

After this you setup a new CORE wallet address and send CORE to it to complete $5 quest.  
Next quest of $3 CORE is to send/receive CORE from friend within the Element Wallet.

In case you didnt use my referral, you can manually add friend or DM with people search:

>\``@4EverMaAT`\`

Then send me a small amount of CORE via Element wallet peer send.  There is a $ sign in the peer chat (DM) and you can send money that way. Try not to send more than 0.20 CORE.  

And type at least one additional message in the peer chat.

Then you must ""**request**"" the CORE back (click on the $ sign and request the same amount back.).  

If you get an error with the request, make sure you add me as a friend first in Element app.  And send in-app message.
Also try to clear app cache.  (both Coinbase amd Element app).  Restart both apps.  Then open Coinbase app and continue quest from there (which should auto-open Element app again).

Note that a *proper* **`request`** is what triggers the quest reward, So any core sent will be considered as donations.  I do my best to make sure you do it in the correct order.  I helped over 100 people; please follow the steps I provide.

~~First 5 people to do this will get a double bonus of maximum core 0.20 of CORE token on top of the returned amount.  This is a thank you for others helping me complete the mission.~~

Here's my referral link as when you sign up after down loading the Element wallet it'll ask for a referral code when your signing up. Not sure exactly what you it I get from you using a referral code but after you get the $5 in core for completing that quest the next Quest for $3 is you have to add a friend in your wallet and send them a Lil bit of core and then that friend sends you that core right back and you earn $3 of core for completing that quest. I'm currently stuck on this part as I have no friends to send or receive core from since I just started doing all this 10 mins ago haha. So I'd appreciate anyone who would add me as a friend so we can send each other the core real quick and get our free $3 of core and be able to move on the mext Quest which is $5 more of free core for staking some core through the wallet. So anyone else doing these Core Quests in coinbase app please send me a friend request in the Element wallet chat so we can help each other out and get all our free core fast as there's no telling when the price of this could shoot up or down like we've seen in some of these previous coinbase quests.
Thanks again for taking the time to read this and hopefully we can help each other out c:

Gavin Wood releases the JAM Gray Paper on the future of Polkadot ,CryptoCurrency,1c736be,2024-04-18 09:20:37,28,0.83,21,https://graypaper.com/,Shiratori-3,PROJECT-UPDATE,"10 years after Gavin Wood wrote the Ethereum Yellow Paper. Tweet source: https://twitter.com/gavofyork/status/1780897336857698418 

Abstract. 
*We present a comprehensive and formal definition of Jam, a protocol combining elements of both Polkadot and Ethereum. In a single coherent model, Jam provides a global singleton permissionless object environment—much like the smart-contract environment pioneered by Ethereum—paired with secure sideband computation parallelized over a scalable node network, a proposition pioneered by Polkadot.*

*Jam introduces a decentralized hybrid system offering smart-contract functionality structured around a secure and scalable in-core/on-chain dualism. While the smart-contract functionality implies some similarities with Ethereum’s paradigm, the overall model of the service offered is driven largely by underlying architecture of Polkadot.*

*Jam is permissionless in nature, allowing anyone to deploy code as a service on it for a fee commensurate with the resources this code utilizes and to induce execution of this code through the procurement and allocation of core-time, a metric of resilient and ubiquitous computation, somewhat similar to the purchasing of gas in Ethereum. We already envision a Polkadot-compatible CoreChains service.*"

Friendly reminder that BCH is the only of the top 3 cryptocurrencies that can scale. Remember when price was at $300 and confidence was low just before price shot to parity ? that's where we are now in the cycle. Don't let your emotions influence your investments.,btc,7hxkcr,2017-12-06 06:59:03,146,0.71,133,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7hxkcr/friendly_reminder_that_bch_is_the_only_of_the_top/,zhell_,,"**Bitcoin Core** has already proven that it can not scale and their only short term solution is to let the mempool clog up and fees rise.

**Ethereum** has been totally devastated by the first popular dapp game that is not even ressource-intensive compared to other games. Devs don't know what to do short term but to let the fees rise.

**Bitcoin Cash** has rising transactions count since october and a LOT of room to grow even with the current blocksize. Another blocksize increase to 32MB is already considered in less than 6 months by coordinated dev teams for May 15, 2018.

BCH transactions counts chart https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-bch.html#3m

source for 32MB blocksize increase https://nchain.com/en/blog/bitcoin-cash-development-testing-accord/

**Xapo** is finally finished selling their users's BCH holdings, it is actually quite amazing that the BCHUSD price was rising during their selling window. Whales have been accumulating BCH at a cheap price knowing it will rise fast later.

Here is a textbook example of an **accumulation phase** in trading, look how this is exactly the same as the current BCHUSD 3h chart:
http://www.tischendorf.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/RDWR-Radware-Weekly-Chart-Price-Target.png

**BCH** has been gaining momentum lately as exchanges add BCH pairs, the community has shown how powerful we are when acting in coordination to make exchanges list it under it's correct name, some crypto-ATM companies started to add BCH support, merchant adoption is on the rise and a lot of projects are under way now that bitcoin is free to grow again. All of this shows rising fundamentals while the price looks weak, which means the opportunity to buy into now before both realign with each other is huge. This is another $300 to $1500 kind of opportunity.

More than anything, BCH is still the only version of bitcoin that can realize the dream of **peer-to-peer electronic cash**. This is the only true ""support zone"" any cryptocurrency can have: users using it in real day-to-day lives is what forces the price to stay above a certain level. **We are slowly building the strongest support a cryptocurrency can have just like the early days of bitcoin, price was weak back then, but see how that worked out.**

_____

u/maurinohose adds some very interesting points

> How bitcoin cash will scale;

> Graphene for block-propagation, then the blocks can be 16GB or more when needed. The block-size becomes irrelevant, just as it was in the whitepaper.

> To minimize storage costs - any variant of rolling UTXO commitments.

> That is all.

> Also remember that any increase in block-size, like from 1MB to 8MB means the energy expended for PoW is now 8 times more effective, the energy/hashrate needed to make a block - doesnt matter if its making a 1MB or 16GB block, but bigger block means the energy used pays for more transactions. A 1GB block is 1 000 more energy-effecient than a legacy corechain."

If other exchanges continue to support both, will you deny your users access to the CoreCoins that you are holding the keys too?  Will you give them the option only to Withdraw Core coins?

Possible attack against supermajority forks... or not?,btc,44cud6,2016-02-05 15:58:58,2,0.75,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/44cud6/possible_attack_against_supermajority_forks_or_not/,hateneedingaccounts,,"Was pondering bitcoin classic's awesomeness, and it occurred to me. Suppose an attacker doesn't like Classic and controls, say, 25% of hashing power. So they activate Classic, then suppose Classic hits the 750/1000 blocks threshold, and 4 weeks later we start seeing the first 2MB blocks. At this point the attacker restores Core, suddenly the CoreChain overtakes the ClassicChain again, and all Classic nodes naturally follow the longer CoreChain and our beautiful 2MB blocks join the great white blockchain in the sky where all good blocks go. This would be a very damaging credibility hit against Classic, and would give the naysayers lots of enthusiasm for telling us ""told you so"" on how hard forks are very dangerous.

Please tell me either that I'm wrong, or that someone more clever than me has already thought of how to defend against this... AND coded it into Classic.
'Cos if not, then 95% would be a safer supermajority, as an attacker would need 45% of the Ph/s to execute this attack."
