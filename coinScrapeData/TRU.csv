I Reviewed The LG 50 inch UP7000 Series 4K LED UHD Smart webOS TV 50UP7000PUA: Is This Budget 4K TV Worth It?,readbeforebuying,1gwmzwc,2024-11-21 13:50:24,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/readbeforebuying/comments/1gwmzwc/i_reviewed_the_lg_50_inch_up7000_series_4k_led/,shopboopthesnoots,,"# 

Looking for a new TV to upgrade your home entertainment? I recently got my hands on the LG 50-inch UP7000. This 4K smart TV has a lot to offer for its price.

 [\*Update\* This is the Amazon link we bought from that had a limited time discount. Click to see if it's still available](https://t.co/rpaDMLmw4H)

The picture quality impressed me right away. The 4K resolution makes everything look super sharp and detailed. I noticed the colors look vivid and the contrast is good too. When I watched some fast-paced sports, the motion looked smooth thanks to the TruMotion 120 feature.

https://preview.redd.it/u79don0kwa2e1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81e0e3ae0098744a79017ec7678eaf5a6ab45f54

The smart features are pretty handy. I like that it works with Google and Alexa voice assistants. The built-in apps give me access to lots of streaming options. The interface is easy to use, but it can be a bit slow at times.

One thing I'm not crazy about is the sound. It's okay for everyday watching, but it lacks depth for movies. You might want to add a soundbar if you're big on audio quality.

# Bottom Line

The LG 50-inch UP7000 is a solid choice if you want a 4K smart TV without breaking the bank. Its picture quality and smart features make it worth checking out.

# Engaging Entertainment with the LG 50 inch UP7000 Series 4K TV

I've been using this LG TV for a while now, and I'm impressed with its entertainment features. The 4K display brings movies and shows to life with sharp, vivid images. I love how easy it is to access streaming apps like Netflix and Disney+ through the webOS platform.

The TV's TruMotion 120 technology makes fast-paced sports and action scenes look smooth. I noticed less blurring during quick camera movements. Gaming on this TV is also fun thanks to the Game Optimizer mode.

One downside I found is that the built-in speakers aren't great. I ended up adding a soundbar for better audio. The smart features can also be a bit slow to respond at times.

Overall, I think this LG TV offers good value for watching shows, movies, and sports in 4K. Just keep in mind you may want to upgrade the audio for the best experience.

# Real 4K UHD Resolution

I was blown away by the crisp, clear picture on this LG TV. The 4K UHD resolution brings out amazing detail in everything I watch. Movies and shows look so lifelike, it's like I'm right there in the scene. Colors pop and look rich and vibrant. Dark scenes have deep blacks with lots of shadow detail. The 50-inch screen is a great size for my living room - big enough to be immersive but not overwhelming. Fast-moving action stays smooth thanks to the TruMotion technology. HDR content looks especially good, with bright highlights and a wide range of tones. For the price, I'm really impressed with the picture quality this TV delivers.

# Enhanced Viewing with Quad Core Processor 4K

I was blown away by the picture quality on this LG TV. The 4K resolution makes everything look crisp and lifelike. Colors pop off the screen, and dark scenes have deep blacks. I noticed smooth motion when watching sports and action movies. The quad core processor seems to handle everything well. Menus and apps load quickly.

One small issue is that the picture looks best when viewed straight-on. It's less sharp from side angles. But for most viewing, it's not a problem.

The TV has lots of smart features and streaming apps built-in. I like having easy access to Netflix, Disney+, and other services. The interface is pretty easy to use too.

Overall, this LG delivers great 4K picture quality at a good price. It's a solid choice for anyone wanting to upgrade to 4K.

# Fast-Paced Action with TruMotion 120

I noticed a big difference when watching sports and action movies on this LG TV. The TruMotion 120 technology makes fast-moving scenes look smooth and clear. It reduces blur and sharpens details, displaying up to 120 frames per second. This means I can see every play in a football game or every punch in an action sequence without any blurriness. While it's not true 120Hz (the TV has a 60Hz native refresh rate), the TruMotion feature still improves motion handling noticeably. For gamers, there's also a Game Optimizer mode to reduce input lag. The picture quality is great for a TV in this price range, but very fast motion can still look a bit choppy at times.

# Smart Connectivity

I found the smart features on this LG TV to be pretty solid. It runs on webOS, which is easy to use. I could quickly access streaming apps like Netflix. The TV works with both Google Assistant and Alexa, which is handy for voice control. I liked being able to mirror my phone screen using Miracast or AirPlay. The built-in Wi-Fi connected smoothly to my home network. There's also an Ethernet port if you prefer a wired connection. One downside is that the included remote lacks an Alexa button, so you'll need a separate smart device for full voice assistant features. Overall, the smart connectivity options are good, but not groundbreaking.

# Audio and Game Optimizer Features

I really enjoyed the audio and gaming features on this LG TV. The sound quality was clear and balanced, making movies and shows come to life. But what impressed me most was the Game Optimizer mode. It cut down on lag and made games feel smoother. I noticed less screen tearing too. The TV also works with Alexa and Google Assistant, which was handy for changing channels or adjusting volume hands-free. While the 60Hz refresh rate isn't the highest, TruMotion 120 tech helped smooth out fast action. Gamers will like the auto low latency mode (ALLM) for less input lag. Overall, the audio and gaming features add a lot of value to this 4K TV.

# Pros and Cons

I've spent some time with the LG 50-inch UP7000 and have formed a clear picture of its strengths and weaknesses. Here's what I found:

# Pros

* Great 4K picture quality
* Easy setup process
* Smooth motion handling
* Voice control compatibility
* Gaming features

The UP7000 delivers crisp, clear 4K visuals that really pop. I was impressed by how easy it was to set up and start watching. The TruMotion 120 technology makes fast-moving scenes look smooth. I liked being able to control the TV with voice commands through Google and Alexa. Gamers will appreciate the Game Optimizer mode and ALLM for better performance.

# Cons

* Limited viewing angles
* Basic remote control
* Confusing smart TV interface
* Sound quality issues

Picture quality drops when watching from the sides. The included remote lacks some features found on higher-end models. I found the webOS interface hard to navigate at times. Some users, myself included, noticed sound inconsistencies that were distracting during quieter scenes.

While the UP7000 offers good value for a 4K smart TV, it does have some drawbacks to consider. Your needs and budget will determine if it's the right fit for your home.

# Customer Sentiments

I've noticed mixed feelings about this LG TV. Many users praise its clear, sharp picture and easy setup. The 4K display gets high marks for image quality, especially when viewed straight on. I found the smart features and viewing options to be plentiful, though some think the interface is clunky.

A few minor issues pop up in reviews. Some mention sound inconsistencies or off-angle viewing being less crisp. There's also confusion about the remote - not all models seem to include Alexa functionality as expected.

Longevity is hit or miss. While many enjoy their TV for years, I saw a few reports of screens failing after 3-4 years. Overall, most owners seem satisfied with the value for the price, even with a few quirks. The picture quality is the standout feature that keeps users happy.

# Conclusion

After spending time with the LG 50-inch UP7000, I'm left with mixed feelings. The 4K picture quality is impressive, offering sharp and clear visuals that enhance the viewing experience. The TV's smart features and app selection are decent, giving access to popular streaming services. But the interface can be clunky, and some users might prefer adding a separate streaming device. Sound quality is hit-or-miss, with some reports of audio issues. While it's a good budget-friendly option for those wanting a large 4K screen, it's not without flaws. Consider your priorities and expectations before making a decision. If picture quality is your main concern and you can overlook some usability quirks, this TV could be a solid choice."

The Huawei Watch Guide V2,HuaweiWatchGT,1g67ctc,2024-10-17 21:59:13,34,0.97,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/HuaweiWatchGT/comments/1g67ctc/the_huawei_watch_guide_v2/,gamefan5,,"[https://freeimage.host/i/dyJrJp9](https://freeimage.host/i/dyJrJp9)

Hello! Welcome to my Huawei Watch Guide VERSION 2!!!!

Thanks to everyone that read and enjoyed the first version. I'm republishing the guide with a huge modification: A table of comparison between all the watches! This will help in organizing the info so much better.

So to start, I've seen so many people ask about which kind of watch to buy and there has been a lot of confusion over what to buy. Namely because there are so many choices and models with confusing names.

Hopefully, this guide can help clear up some confusion and also tell a few key differences that Huawei won't tell you. 


First, there are many model series and here are the current ones thus far:


- [Band](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9VRXn)

- [Fit](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9VedQ)

- [GT](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9WHEG)

- [Ultimate](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9WMaR)

- [Watch](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9XqSR)

- [Watch Buds](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9ePJs)

- [D](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9kghQ) 

Here's a table of comparison of every series of watches. And of course, the information **is about the recent models of each series unless otherwise stated**:

*Available in certain markets only

**Another Note:** For the GT5/GT5 Pro, everything that is map related requires downloading an offline map with Huawei Health. For the Watch series, you don't need to do so. It will show you a map automatically, because of its connection with your phone. (And because it's technically Android.)

I highly suggest you keep reading if you want more details (with pictures!) and my opinion on each series. I even touch on older models of some of the series.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

[**HUAWEI BAND**](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9VRXn) series:  
Huawei Band are basically the entry line of Huawei watches. They've changed shape over the years but they tend to be rectangular. Before the Band 6, they actually looked like watchbands. The Band 6-7 are quite slim and look like the previous Huawei Fit watches but starting with the 8, it took a boxy distinctive rectangular shape. 

Some of the features from the latest Band 9 (at this time of writing)

- Very slim, light and rectangular 
- 9 axis IMU sensor(For the first time in the series)
- Optical HR sensor
- Sleep tracking
- SpO2 measurements
- Pulse Wave Arrhythmia Analysis (it's like ECG but with a PPG sensor, instead of an actual electrocardiogram)
- Stress monitoring
- Cycle Calendar
- Over 100 Workouts
- Calendar app (starting with the Band 9)
- Notifications with emojis and quick replies 
- Tap to wake feature! 
- 5 ATM Water resistant
- 9 to 14 days of battery life.

A little fun fact! The ""Tap-to-wake"" feature seems to be exclusive to this series 🤣


My opinion: It's a fitness tracker through and through. Very cheap and for its price, it can be quite good. Performance may vary, depending on the wrist you have. But the HR is good for its price. It's a good entry.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------


[**HUAWEI**](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9PGpt) [**WATCH FIT**](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9VedQ) series:

Ahhh, the Fit series. They're pretty much the ""affordable"" GT series of the lineup, although both series are different in design:

- They're rectangular (The Fit 3 decides to adopt a square form with a rotating crown)

They're meant to be affordable, trendy and comfortable to wear. And honestly, I love wearing my Fit 3 for walks and running. Very lightweight.

Features (Fit 3):

- Square à la Apple Watch (Previous models are rectangular)
- 9-axis IMU sensor 
- Ambient- light sensor (this is absent in previous models)
- GPS and compass
- Optical HR sensor (TruSeen 5.5 algorithm)
- SpO2 Measurements
- Stress tracking 
- Sleep tracking with breathing
- Pulse Arrhythmia Analysis (Absent in previous models)
- Remote shutter (Huawei and Iphones only)
- Cycle Calendar
- Over 100 workouts 
- Smart suggestions and Fitness Courses with animations
- NFC (Only available in the Grey and White with leather band models)
- Bluetooth Calling
- Calendar App (starting with Fit 3)
- Stay Fit app (calorie tracking, etc) (Starting with the Fit 3)
- Petal Maps (Starting with Fit 3)
- Huawei AppGallery app
- Music Storage 
- Rotating Crown and Side button (RC is absent in prev. models)
- 7-10 days of battery life

A few notes:  
Skip the Huawei Watch Fit new and Fit SE. They should never be on your radar. Buy a Band 9 instead, if you want something cheaper.

[The Huawei Watch Fit 2](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9PGpt) is still a great performer to this day and it certainly has its fans, due to its excellent Heart Rate sensor and algorithm despite it lacking some of the newest features of the Fit 3. Note that it is still on HarmonyOS 2 and if I recall, there are very few (if any) emojis that are displayed in the messages you receive. If that's a problem for you, consider getting the Fit 3.


My opinion: I honestly think this is the best model to start with, without spending too much. The Fit 3 is an all rounder that should definitely serve most people's needs. Yes, it does look like an Apple Watch, but at the same time, I'd say that's an advantage, as it makes the watch sit flush on the wrist, which makes it so comfortable to wear. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**[HUAWEI WATCH GT](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9WHEG)** series:

The Huawei Watch GT series is arguably the most popular and known series of the Huawei watches lineup. It's also the one that has the most models.

And the funny thing about it is... most of them are still decent/great to be used to this day.

List:

- [Huawei Watch GT2](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9tkaj)/[GT2e](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9DpJj)
- Huawei Watch GT3 ([41mm](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9bskv) and [46mm](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9mATQ))
- [Huawei Watch GT3 SE](https://freeimage.host/i/dyHdn6B)
- [Huawei Watch GT3 Pro](https://freeimage.host/i/dyHFLKl) [41mm (Ceramic Build/Sapphire Glass)](https://freeimage.host/i/dyHzMHx)
- [Huawei Watch GT3 Pro 46mm](https://freeimage.host/i/dyHcGBR) (Titanium Build/Sapphire Glass)
- [Huawei Watch GT Runner](https://freeimage.host/i/dyHVgoX) (The case is made of polymer-fiber, which is fancy word for plastic. That's actually an advantage for a watch focused on running)
- [Huawei Watch GT Cyber](https://freeimage.host/i/dyHNXVI) (Its gimmick is that you can change the case and bezel)
- [**Huawei Watch GT4 (41mm and 46mm)**](https://freeimage.host/i/dyHsSMg)
- **Huawei Watch GT5 ([41mm](https://freeimage.host/i/dyHmlgn) and [46mm](https://freeimage.host/i/dyHmkdu))**
- [**Huawei Watch GT5 Pro 42mm (Ceramic Build/Sapphire Screen)**](https://freeimage.host/i/dyqSest)
- [**Huawei Watch GT5 Pro 46 mm (Titanium/Sapphire Screen)**](https://freeimage.host/i/dyqUlp4)

*Bold indicates the GT watches that are still officially supported by Huawei. That being said, sometimes Huawei does drop a few surprise updates for the older models that aren't too old.

The GT series tend to be stylish and distinctive between both sexes (unlike the Fit series that are unisex). They are fitness trackers with some decent smartwatch features. They aren't as extensive as what you'll find in a Galaxy Watch or an Apple watch. That being said, if you don't need much from a watch, they certainly do the job with plenty of battery life to spare. 

Features mostly found in the GT series:

- Accelerometer 
- Gyroscope
- Magnetometer
- Optical HR sensor (TruSense algorithm with the GT5/TruSeen 5.5+ with the GT4)
- Barometer
- Temperature sensor ( Skin temperature measurement)
- Ambient Light Sensor
- SpO2 Measurement
- Stress tracking 
- Sleep tracking with breathing
- Pulse Arrhythmia Analysis (Absent in previous models/has been added to the GT3 Pro in recent updates)
- Electrocardiogram (ECG) (Only available in GT3 Pro and GT5 Pro)
- Arterial Stiffness analysis (Only Available in GT3 Pro and GT5 Pro)
- Cycle Calendar AND tracking
- GPS and compass
- Bluetooth Calling
- NFC
- Music Storage  
- Remote shutter (Huawei and Iphones only)
- Over 100 workouts and exclusive workouts involving the Altimeter and Barometer (Golf, Hiking, etc)
- Diving features and workouts with EN13319 certification (GT3 Pro and GT5 Pro only)
- 5 ATM Water Resistance (IP68 as well for GT3 Pro)
- Calendar App (starting with GT4)
- Stay Fit app (calorie tracking, etc) (Starting with the GT4)
- Petal Maps (Starting with GT4)
- Huawei AppGallery 
- 5-7 days of battery life (41mm)
- 9-14 days of battery life (46mm)


Starting with the GT5 series:
- Offline Map Support for Walking/Running and Cycling workouts and Trail Mode for hiking enthusiasts. 
- Huawei Sunflower Positioning System (Fancy marketing term for Better GPS accuracy)
- Golf Mode with more than 15000 map courses worldwide (GT5 Pro Only)
- RouteDraw (Basically the watch randomly plans a route for you for walking/running/cycling)
- Keyboard support for custom replies
- Voice to Text (Seems to be only available with Huawei phones)
- Watch Screenshot (Can't believe it took this long)
- IP69K rating 

My opinion: The most popular and well-known series for a reason. They are at the forefront in showcasing Huawei's progress with Health Wellness and fitness in wearables.
And they do it while having a sense of flair and style that are quite reminiscent of real mechanical watches. While they do suffer from a lack of third-party apps, Huawei is slowly getting the essentials right. And the battery life is absolutely top-notch. Personally, I've moved away from WearOS and I am not in any rush of going back soon.  
It's somewhat of a balance between smartwatch features, a fitness tracker without being too focused like Garmin, and actually looking great on the wrist.

Although, more features wouldn't hurt!

Personally, for any newcomers looking into this series, I'd recommend starting with the [**Huawei Watch GT5**](https://freeimage.host/i/dyHmkdu) because it has some significant features that were requested for so long (the keyboard and offline maps being big ones), that the other models do not. And it just looks good honestly. If you want some of the bells and whistles, then the [GT5 Pro](https://freeimage.host/i/dyqUp6X) is also an excellent choice.
Their new TruSense sensor looks promising but the results between people seem to be inconsistent. It seems decent but not extraordinary yet, as Huawei tries to make it be. Should be further tuned with future software updates though, as they have done many many times.

A few honorable mentions:

For those that want a green watch or seem to prefer the [**Huawei Watch GT4**,](https://freeimage.host/i/dyHsSMg) it's also a cheaper and solid option. It should get the upgrade to HarmonyOS 5 later on, but whether it gets some or all the features of the GT5 remains to be seen.

The [**Huawei Watch GT3 Pro**](https://freeimage.host/i/dyqrMge) is another great alternative, due to its HR performance and a lot of people love its looks. Just take note that it will no longer get new features as the 2 years of support has just ended. It did get HarmonyOS 4 though, with improved HR accuracy and notifications wake up screen. 

The [**Huawei Watch GT Runner**](https://freeimage.host/i/dyq42Q2) is another fan-favorite due to its long battery life, plastic case and breathable band which makes it very suitable to the audience it is aimed at. I've heard that the HR is excellent on this and it is very comfortable to wear during long periods. Unfortunately, it is discontinued. So finding one is quite an arduous task.

Please, don't pick any of the GT2 series. A LOT has changed since then.

TL;DR: If you're not sure, just pick the GT5, it should serve you nicely. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 **[HUAWEI WATCH ULTIMATE](https://freeimage.host/i/dZ9AHFe)** series:

The most expensive and luxurious series in the lineup.

Comes in 4 different colors:

- Blue
- Black
- Green (New)
- [Gold](https://freeimage.host/i/dZ9R30X) (Ultimate Design series)*
- [Sapphire Blue Gold](https://freeimage.host/i/2cmUXkv) (Ultimate Design series)


*And yes, real gold is used here. More on that later

In terms of features, honestly, it's heavily similar to the GT series prior to the GT5. So what makes it different?

Well, it takes all of the aspects of the GT series and pushes them further. The result is that it's basically... hmm... a stylish Huawei-fied flagship Garmin Watch. Oh yes, that's a perfect description.

For the build:
Instead of Stainless Steel (GT) and Titanium(46mm)/Ceramic Build(42mm) of the GT Pros


- The watch bezel and rear case is made of nano-tech ceramic
- The front case is zirconium-based liquid metal

Translation: It's made with premium materials found in luxurious watches and it is also very tough, durable and corrosion-resistant (and undoubtedly the heaviest watch Huawei has made yet).

- For the **gold** version, the watch bezel has six segments of 18 karats Physical Vapor Deposition gold laid at the edge of the ceramic bezel. and the watch case is made of liquid metal. The crown and buttons are also 18k gold and titanium alloy. All these fancy words meaning that it is basically a bling bling watch. It's also the heaviest one out of the 4 models.

In addition:

- LTPO AMOLED screen
- They all have 3 buttons instead of 2.
- 10 ATM water resistance, EN13319 diving certification up to 100 meters. Scuba diving approved.

As for the features that are notable to the Ultimate series:

- Expedition Mode (think Hiking Mode but better). Allows you to keep you on track and save landmarks so that you never get lost. A bit more on that later...
- Exclusive multiple Diving workouts with proper diving tools as well.
- Hover Timer and Apnea Training (diving stuff)
- ECG/Arterial Stiffness


**THE GREEN VERSION** has been revealed a year later, with the GT5 and GT5 Pro. While it is still the same product has the Ultimate Blue/Black/Gold, it comes with HarmonyOS 5.0. Which means, there are some differences...

- Expedition mode finally supports proper offline contour maps. Making it a somewhat suitable alternative from the expensive Garmin watches.
- Comes with a keyboard (Yes, custom replies ahoy!)
- Golf Mode with more than 15000 map courses worldwide
- Watch Screenshot
- If I am not mistaken, RouteDraw should also be included

Now, I know what you're thinking. ""What about the other 3 colors?"" Don't worry, you'll get all of these features in a future OTA update, confirmed by Huawei itself. 

- Battery Life: 8 to 14 days

My opinion: Essentially, you're looking at this for two reasons.  
If you are a real outdoorsman; We're talking hiking, diving, any outside activities. And with the new Gold mode, it is apparently a solid choice for golfers, according to this [review](https://www.golfmonthly.com/reviews/gps/huawei-watch-ultimate-green-edition-review).

Either that or

You want something on your wrist that really stands out. Because let's be honest, the Ultimate is not only large but very eye-catching. Whether the design looks good or not, that's up to the person looking at it. Personally I find the Voyager blue to look like the Rolex Submariner and put them side by side, the similarities are striking.

Not that it is bad, but it shows that the Ultimate is inspired by Haute Holorgerie. 

It may sport the name ""Ultimate"" but frankly you're getting a pimped up GT watch here and skipping it won't make you miss much from it. You can get much of its offerings for much less. A GT5 Pro would cover a lot of the needs it also offers.

But if you have money to splurge and really want to stand out, then why not? Personally, I think there should be more stylish tech watches. Other options these days are far too bland and uninspiring (I'm looking at you, Samsung.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


[**HUAWEI**](https://freeimage.host/i/dZ54Ii7) [**WATCH**](https://freeimage.host/i/dZ7zZ1R) series: 

The most misunderstood wearable lineup of Huawei (more on that later). 
It is also the first series of watch the brand has established, with Huawei Watch 1 and Watch 2 using Google's AndroidWear at the time. 

But then, everything changed when the Huawei Ban was enforced in the US, effectively barring Google from working with Huawei. And this is the one lineup that's suffered the most.

Starting with the Huawei Watch 3 series, it went off to use their own HarmonyOS skin on top of Android (More on that later.)

At the same time, it is arguably still the best wearable lineup Huawei has made.

For the most recent 4 series:

- Comes in [Stainless Steel Black](https://freeimage.host/i/dZ7n5Ou) for the 4 
- Comes in [Blue](https://freeimage.host/i/dZ7IILb) or [Titanium](https://freeimage.host/i/dZ54kWN) with either leather brown strap or the titanium strap for the 4 Pro
- Also comes in a special [Titanium Black](https://freeimage.host/i/dZ7YGAQ) for the 4 Pro Space Edition.
- The Regular 4 Pro's case is made out of Aerospace-Grade Titanium
- The Space Edition's case is made out of Aerospace-Grade DLC Titanium with a ceramic bezel. 
- The Space Edition gets one exclusive watchface, other than that, it is the same experience
- They all have the same spherical Sapphire Screen (Indeed, the screen isn't flat. It is domed and it's on purpose.)

Features of the Watch series

- Accelerometer 
- Gyroscope
- Magnetometer
- Optical HR sensor (TruSeen 5.5+ with the Watch 4 HarmonyOS 4.2 update)
- Barometer
- Temperature sensor ( Skin AND Body temperature measurement)
- Ambient Light Sensor
- SpO2 Measurement
- Stress tracking 
- Sleep tracking with breathing awareness
- Pulse Arrhythmia Analysis (Absent in previous models)
- Electrocardiogram (ECG) (Only available with Watch 4 series)
- Arterial Stiffness analysis (Only Available with Watch 4 series)
- Cycle Calendar AND tracking
- Hyperglycemia (Blood Sugar) Evaluation (Only available with the China variant of the Watch 4 series)
- Vascular Evaluation (China variant of W4 series Only)
- Health Glance 2.0 
- High altitude Monitoring (Watch 4 series only)
- GPS and compass
- WiFi/Esim Connection
- Bluetooth and ESIM calling
- SOS contacts and Fall Detection 
- NFC
- Music Storage  
- Custom replies Keyboard support with Voice-To-Text
- Voice Recording
- Over 100 workouts and exclusive workouts involving the Altimeter and Barometer (Golf, Hiking, etc)
- Diving features and workouts with EN13319 certification to 30m (Watch 4 series only)
- Walk/Run/Cycling with map and routing supported
- 5 ATM Water Resistance
- Calendar App and Widget support! (Watch 4 with HarmonyOS 4.2)
- Stay Fit app (calorie tracking, etc) (Watch 4 series with HarmonyOS 4.2)
- Petal Maps with Map navigation and routing support
- Huawei AppGallery app with a greater number of apps supported
- Supports Sideloading 3rd Party apps 
- Up to 3 days of battery life (Watch 4 Standard Mode)*
- Up to 4.5 days of battery life (Watch 4 Pro Standard Mode)*

I know what you're thinking. The battery is quite bad in comparison to the other series. But why? Well, as mentioned previously, the Watch series are actually Android watches with a HarmonyOS custom skin on top. For HarmonyOS 4.2 on the Watch 4, it's based on Android 12. 

Because of the Android kernel, this makes it possible to sideload 3rd party apps outside the Huawei AppGallery, with the Android Bridge Debug. Installing GSpace allows you to install the WearOS store and install some of the many apps inside it as well. Some exceptions like Google Pay/Wallet won't be supported though, and also this will reduce your battery life further.

[An example of WhatsApp in the watch](https://freeimage.host/i/dZWGJx2) 

While this is great, what truly makes the Watch series exceptional is the inclusion of the **Ultra-long Battery Life Mode (UBLM). **

Originally introduced with the Watch 3 Series, it's a mode that essentially turns your watch into a GT series watch. This is especially true with the Watch 4 series. For a technical explanation, The Watch 3 and Watch 4 series are dual-kernel watches, having both the HarmonyOS based on Android and the HarmonyOS based on the proprietary LiteOS firmware made by Huawei (the very same firmware used in the GT watches.

While Ultra-long Battery Life is activated:  

- Wi-Fi/Esim is disabled
- No keyboard support, only Quick replies
- No Third-Party apps support
- Huawei AppGallery App is missing
- Petal Maps is missing 
- Voice Recording is missing
- Offline Map support is missing
- Health Glance 2.0 is missing

That's pretty much it. You can still take or make Bluetooth calls, do workouts, check the weather, notifications, ECG/Arterial stiffness, pretty much the same things you would do with a GT watch.

Even better, you can also download watchfaces while in UBLM (Only with Watch 4 series). They are essentially watchfaces from the GT series of watches. 

As for the battery life:

Up to a whopping 21 days with a Huawei Watch 4 Pro (Same for the 3 Pro)
Up to 14 days with Huawei Watch 4 (as well as the 3)

Mention and notes:

The **[Huawei Watch 3 series](https://freeimage.host/i/dZhPARs)** isn't as great as its newest counterpart, the Watch 4 series. In fact, of all the watches ever released by Huawei, I think it's the one that suffered the most, due to many glaring issues and poor support all around. 

- Despite the issue being fixable in many (not all!) cellphones, the weather app has issues in printing out some of the data in watchfaces. 
- The Android version is too old to support the most recent wearOS apps and GSpace, which makes the sideloading experience quite difficult.
- Its calendar app is only compatible with Huawei phones. 
- From my own experience, the health tracking, honestly, is not that great. And the Sleep Tracking is horrendous on it. 

However, the 3 Pro is very stylish. I think I prefer its design more than the 4 Pro. 

What would have made this watch finally great, is simply one more update: HarmonyOS 4.0. Unfortunately, that was only released with the china variant...

That being said! It is possible to import the [Huawei Watch 3 Pro](https://freeimage.host/i/dZhpCpS) [New](https://freeimage.host/i/dZhy5Vn)!
It's essentially a refresh of the Huawei Watch 3 Pro, but with ECG included with it. That being said, I think you'll need a chinese account for that particular feature, but I may be wrong. It gets the HarmonyOS 4.0 update as well.
So for those that aren't too keen on the Huawei Watch 4 design, this could be an alternative.

Note that the China variant of Huawei Watches also supports the English language. I can personally vouch for that 100%.


My opinion on the series and take on its future: The Huawei Watch 4 Pro is, in my opinion, the best of Huawei's entire watch lineup at the time of writing, due to its sheer versatility and beauty. However, there have been a few inconsistencies at times, from Huawei themselves, like the Weather app no longer working for every W4 owner in Standard mode (server issues?!). It's kinda weird. The watch is great, but I think most people will find the GT series enough, due to its simplicity in setting up.  It also helps that the GT5 also gets a few features from the watch series, like a keyboard.

But for those that love to tinker stuff, add features and whatnot, that is the one, without a doubt... And it looks premium as well. 

As for its future, I suspect the Huawei Watch 4 series will be the last of the series to have Android of any form as Huawei will move on to HarmonyOS Next, which completely ditches the Android Linux Kernel. While China will gain a lot, Global consumers may lose a lot. I still suspect that Huawei will implement features that they couldn't have before, now that they'll have full control on its platforms. It'll be interesting to see what they do and how they will stand out from the competition.

From chinese sources, there are rumors that the Huawei Watch 4 will also get HarmonyOS 5. (At the very least, the China Variant.) If it does, I'll be sure to make a post about it. But I will probably not update.

------------------------------------------------------------------

[**Huawei Watch Buds**](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9ePJs)

Huawei labels them under the ""Watch"" series but it functions just like a GT device.

It's essentially a watch that also has earbuds inside them.
Basically a watch that is also an earbuds case.

- 80+ workouts included
- Earbuds have noise canceling (3 hours of audio-playback/2 hours of calling)
- Earbuds can be instantly used for replying to calls (the watch itself doesn't have a speaker
- The rest of the features, check the GT section. Note that for very obvious reasons, it doesn't have any form of water-resistance. That also means no workouts involving water. 

Its battery life is up to 3 days.

My opinion: If you want a watch and wireless earbuds, I guess that could be a solution. It is certainly a unique twist! But depending on whether you are really a sports person, this may not be the best choice. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

[**HUAWEI**](https://freeimage.host/i/dmJqQzG) [**WATCH**](https://freeimage.host/i/dmJBImg) **D** series

The most unusual and unique watch series of the lineup. But arguably the most useful.

The ""D"" series are special watches that are able to measure your blood pressure. I'll be mostly talking about the D2 because the changes are very significant.

Of course, we've heard of watches that can measure blood pressure while being calibrated with a blood pressure monitor (i.e. Galaxy Watches 4 and Up) so what makes this one different?!

**The watch ITSELF is an actual blood pressure monitor.**
One could say that the TruSense sensor was made specifically with this device in mind. 

Of course, for such important features to be even usable, the watch has to be (and is) medically certified. Both in China and Europe. 

So the D2 comes with [two Blood Pressure (BP)](https://freeimage.host/i/dmMht4a) related features: **Ambulatory Blood Monitoring** and **Anytime BP measurements**

**Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM)**

This feature measures your blood pressure at preset intervals in a 24-hour period, and it calculates your average for the whole day, daytime and nighttime and analyzes your BPM rhythm. The data is used for hypertension and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular assessment. 

**Anytime BP measurements**

As the name says, you can choose to take the measurements anytime, without set intervals.


Now what makes this all possible? Of course, the TruSense sensor is part of the equation. But what makes the watch rather unique, is the unique strap that it comes with!

It's a strap that comes with an airbag inside (that can also be detached). The airbag inflates during blood pressure measurements, constricting your arm, like a usual blood pressure monitor. This increases the accuracy of your heart rate measurements and also makes sure that the PPG sensor can get your blood flow correctly with minimal issues.

[The airbag inflating, under the strap](https://freeimage.host/i/dmjN5xf)

[https://freeimage.host/i/dmjNDen](https://freeimage.host/i/dmjNDen)

It's also awfully quiet, while it does this.


Of course, the D2 can also act like a regular Huawei Watch.  You can choose NOT to use the BP features.

And the features are pretty much the same as the GT series... But in a Square Form factor!!! I'll put in bold the things its brother (Fit 3) does not have!

- Accelerometer 
- Gyroscope
- Magnetometer
- **Optical HR sensor (TruSense algorithm)**
- **Barometer**
- **Temperature sensor (Skin temperature measurement)**
- Ambient Light Sensor
- SpO2 Measurement
- Stress tracking 
- Sleep tracking with breathing
- Pulse Arrhythmia Analysis 
- **Electrocardiogram** 
- **Arterial Stiffness Detection**
- Cycle Calendar **AND tracking**
- GPS and compass
- Bluetooth Calling
- NFC
- Music Storage  
- Remote shutter (Huawei and Iphones only)
- Over 80+ workouts and exclusive workouts involving the Altimeter and Barometer (Golf, Hiking, etc)
- 5 ATM Water Resistance
- Calendar App 
- Stay Fit app (calorie tracking, etc)
- Petal Maps 
- Huawei AppGallery 
- 6 days of Battery Life (Note that if BP measurements aren't used, you can squeeze in a bit more)
- 1 Day of battery life with ABPM enabled

Essentially, one could call this a Huawei Watch ""Fit 3 Pro"". And the improvements are well worth it. Note that the Fit 3 straps cannot be used with the D2, as the attachments are different. Note that because it is kind of a niche product, third party bands may be difficult to find, for it. 

*Note that HarmonyOS 5.0 has recently been released for it, but it doesn't add the new features found in the GT5 series and Ultimate. 

My opinion: The first ""D"" watch certainly looked like a useful device but it looked ugly to wear. The ""D2"" improves over the first in every single way, both in style and functionality. If you want a watch and something to monitor your blood pressure in a proper way, without the need of external accessories, this could be an interesting product to consider. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'll skip the Huawei Watch kids series. 

So if you've made it here, then congratulations. 

Few notes to mention (The first note, I have mentioned before, with the comparison table):

Some features like:


- Golf Mode
- RouteDraw
- NFC Payments
- ECG/Pulse Wave Arrhythmia Analysis/Arterial Stiffness/Blood Pressure Measurements 
- etc

are not available in all countries. Make sure the region you've chosen supports it. Some features like the keyboard and voice replies **for the GT series** are device dependent. A few like the Celia Assistant are both regional and device dependent. 😓

If you are in the US, make a Huawei account that doesn't have the US as its region, else a lot of the features will be disabled. Depending on your device, this will either be easy as pie, or a daunting task. 

Huawei tends to make two variants of their watches: A Chinese model and a Global model. Needless to say, the Chinese model usually has better support and more features than the Global model. This is especially true with the Watch Series. While there are a few differences, they can pretty much work worldwide and best of all, in perfect english. 

A few third-party apps in the App Gallery that I'd like to recommend for the Fit/GT/Ultimate/D series:

- Navigation: This app makes it able to read directions from Google Maps directly from your watch. Extremely useful while driving and cycling and a worthwile alternative.

- Calculator: I mean, it's simple but it works. Especially if you need to do a quick math for paying something. Note that Huawei has included their own, in recent devices.

- Events G-Calendar: For those that don't have the calendar app, this is a suitable alternative. It can even show the entire month and each events that goes with the day selected.

- For Spotify Controller: The only one that I haven't tried since I seldomly use Spotify. But I've heard that it works.



**A NOTE ABOUT ACCURACY AND TESTING**

**Make sure you read plenty of reviews/anecdotes and test the device yourself, and not just base your entire opinion on one video, as lazy research.** I know a lot of you swear by The Quantified Scientist videos to make your decisions but this is only a sample of 1 (and he himself says this). It's very informative but what works for him, may not work for you and vice-versa. **From my personal experience, I found that out the hard way.**

So, research well your devices and make a compilation of results!

And lastly, enjoy your watch. Those that are more adventurous will get the most out of it.

A Huawei Watch Guide for Beginners,HuaweiWatchGT,1fz9e4j,2024-10-08 16:13:41,98,0.99,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/HuaweiWatchGT/comments/1fz9e4j/a_huawei_watch_guide_for_beginners/,gamefan5,,"[https://freeimage.host/i/dyJrJp9](https://freeimage.host/i/dyJrJp9)

Hello! Welcome to my Huawei Watch Guide.

I've seen so many people ask about which kind of watch to buy and there has been a lot of confusion over what to buy. Namely because there are so many choices and models with confusing names.

Hopefully, this guide can help clear up some confusion and also tell a few key differences that Huawei won't tell you. 


First, there are many model series and here are the current ones thus far:


- [Band](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9VRXn)

- [Fit](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9VedQ)

- [GT](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9WHEG)

- [Ultimate](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9WMaR)

- [Watch](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9XqSR)

- [Watch Buds](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9ePJs)

- [D](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9kghQ) 

[**HUAWEI BAND**](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9VRXn) series:  
Huawei Band are basically the entry line of Huawei watches. They've changed shape over the years but they tend to be rectangular. Before the Band 6, they actually looked like watchbands. The Band 6-7 are quite slim and look like the previous Huawei Fit watches but starting with the 8, it took a boxy distinctive rectangular shape. 

Some of the features from the latest Band 9 (at this time of writing)

- Very slim, light and rectangular 
- 9 axis IMU sensor(For the first time in the series)
- Optical HR sensor
- Sleep tracking
- SpO2 measurements
- Pulse Wave Arrhythmia Analysis (it's like ECG but with a PPG sensor, instead of an actual electrocardiogram)
- Stress monitoring
- Cycle Calendar
- Over 100 Workouts
- Calendar app (starting with the Band 9)
- Notifications with emojis and quick replies 
- Tap to wake feature! 
- 5 ATM Water resistant
- 9 to 14 days of battery life.

A little fun fact! The ""Tap-to-wake"" feature seems to be exclusive to this series 🤣

**DOES NOT HAVE**:

- WI-Fi and E-Sim
- Bluetooth Calling (Has no speaker)
- GPS and Compass(it relies on your phone GPS)
- NFC
- Altimeter 
- Barometer
- Body Temperature sensor
- NFC
- Stay Fit App
- Petal Maps 
- Music Storage 
- Huawei AppGallery



My opinion: It's a fitness tracker through and through. Very cheap and for its price, it can be quite good. Performance may vary, depending on the wrist you have. But the HR is good for its price. It's a good entry.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------


[**HUAWEI**](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9PGpt) [**WATCH FIT**](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9VedQ) series:

Ahhh, the Fit series. They're pretty much the ""affordable"" GT series of the lineup, although both series are different in design:

- They're rectangular (The Fit 3 decides to adopt a square form with a rotating crown)

They're meant to be affordable, trendy and comfortable to wear. And honestly, I love wearing my Fit 3 for walks and running. Very lightweight.

Features (Fit 3):

- Square à la Apple Watch (Previous models are rectangular)
- 9-axis IMU sensor 
- Ambient- light sensor (this is absent in previous models)
- GPS and compass
- Optical HR sensor (TruSeen 5.5 algoritm)
- SpO2 Measurements
- Stress tracking 
- Sleep tracking with breathing
- Pulse Arrhythmia Analysis (Absent in previous models)
- Remote shutter (Huawei and Iphones only)
- Cycle Calendar
- Over 100 workouts 
- Smart suggestions and Fitness Courses with animations
- NFC (Only available in the Grey and White with leather band models)
- Bluetooth Calling
- Calendar App (starting with Fit 3)
- Stay Fit app (calorie tracking, etc) (Starting with the Fit 3)
- Petal Maps (Starting with Fit 3)
- Huawei AppGallery app
- Music Storage 
- Rotating Crown and Side button (RC is absent in prev. models)
- 7-10 days of battery life

**DOES NOT HAVE**

- Wi-Fi/Esim
- Altimeter 
- Barometer
- Body Temperature

A few notes:  
Skip the Huawei Watch Fit new and Fit SE. They should never be on your radar. Buy a Band 9 instead, if you want something cheaper.

[The Huawei Watch Fit 2](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9PGpt) is still a great performer to this day and it certainly has its fans, due to its excellent Heart Rate sensor and algorithm despite it lacking some of the newest features of the Fit 3. Note that it is still on HarmonyOS 2 and if I recall, there are very few (if any) emojis that are displayed in the messages you receive. If that's a problem for you, consider getting the Fit 3.


My opinion: I honestly think this is the best model to start with, without spending too much. The Fit 3 is an all rounder that should definitely serve most people's needs. Yes, it does look like an Apple Watch, but at the same time, I'd say that's an advantage, as it makes the watch sit flush on the wrist, which makes it so comfortable to wear. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**[HUAWEI WATCH GT](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9WHEG)** series:

The Huawei Watch GT series is arguably the most popular and known series of the Huawei watches lineup. It's also the one that has the most models.

And the funny thing about it is... most of them are still decent/great to be used to this day.

List:

- [Huawei Watch GT2](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9tkaj)/[GT2e](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9DpJj)
- Huawei Watch GT3 ([41mm](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9bskv) and [46mm](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9mATQ))
- [Huawei Watch GT3 SE](https://freeimage.host/i/dyHdn6B)
- [Huawei Watch GT3 Pro](https://freeimage.host/i/dyHFLKl) [41mm (Ceramic Build/Sapphire Glass)](https://freeimage.host/i/dyHzMHx)
- [Huawei Watch GT3 Pro 46mm](https://freeimage.host/i/dyHcGBR) (Titanium Build/Sapphire Glass)
- [Huawei Watch GT Runner](https://freeimage.host/i/dyHVgoX) (The case is made of polymer-fiber, which is fancy word for plastic. That's actually an advantage for a watch focused on running)
- [Huawei Watch GT Cyber](https://freeimage.host/i/dyHNXVI) (Its gimmick is that you can change the case and bezel)
- [**Huawei Watch GT4 (41mm and 46mm)**](https://freeimage.host/i/dyHsSMg)
- **Huawei Watch GT5 ([41mm](https://freeimage.host/i/dyHmlgn) and [46mm](https://freeimage.host/i/dyHmkdu))**
- [**Huawei Watch GT5 Pro 42mm (Ceramic Build/Sapphire Screen)**](https://freeimage.host/i/dyqSest)
- [**Huawei Watch GT5 Pro 46 mm (Titanium/Sapphire Screen)**](https://freeimage.host/i/dyqUlp4)

*Bold indicates the GT watches that are still officially supported by Huawei. That being said, sometimes Huawei does drop a few surprise updates for the older models that aren't too old.

The GT series tend to be stylish and distinctive between both sexes (unlike the Fit series that are unisex). They are fitness trackers with some decent smartwatch features. They aren't as extensive as what you'll find in a Galaxy Watch or an Apple watch. That being said, if you don't need much from a watch, they certainly do the job with plenty of battery life to spare. 

Features mostly found in the GT series:

- Accelerometer 
- Gyroscope
- Magnetometer
- Optical HR sensor (TruSense algorithm with the GT5/TruSeen 5.5+ with the GT4)
- Barometer
- Temperature sensor ( Skin temperature measurement)
- Ambient Light Sensor
- SpO2 Measurement
- Stress tracking 
- Sleep tracking with breathing
- Pulse Arrhythmia Analysis (Absent in previous models/has been added to the GT3 Pro in recent updates)
- Electrocardiogram (ECG) (Only available in GT3 Pro and GT5 Pro)
- Arterial Stiffness analysis (Only Available in GT3 Pro and GT5 Pro)
- Cycle Calendar AND tracking
- GPS and compass
- Bluetooth Calling
- NFC
- Music Storage  
- Remote shutter (Huawei and Iphones only)
- Over 100 workouts and exclusive workouts involving the Altimeter and Barometer (Golf, Hiking, etc)
- Diving features and workouts with EN13319 certification (GT3 Pro and GT5 Pro only)
- 5 ATM Water Resistance (IP68 as well for GT3 Pro)
- Calendar App (starting with GT4)
- Stay Fit app (calorie tracking, etc) (Starting with the GT4)
- Petal Maps (Starting with GT4)
- Huawei AppGallery 
- 4-7 days of battery life (41mm)
- 8-14 days of battery life (46mm)


Starting with the GT5 series:
- Offline Map Support for Walking/Running and Cycling workouts and Trail Mode for hiking enthusiasts. 
- Huawei Sunflower Positioning System (Fancy marketing term for Better GPS accuracy)
- Golf Mode with more than 15000 map courses worldwide (GT5 Pro Only)
- RouteDraw (Basically the watch randomly plans a route for you for walking/running/cycling)
- Keyboard support for custom replies
- Voice to Text (Seems to be only available with Huawei phones)
- Watch Screenshot (Can't believe it took this long)
- IP69K rating (GT5 Pro only)

**DOES NOT HAVE**:
- WiFi/Esim
- A few exclusive features only found in the Watch Series

My opinion: The most popular and well-known series for a reason. They are at the forefront in showcasing Huawei's progress with Health Wellness and fitness in wearables.
And they do it while having a sense of flair and style that are quite reminiscent of real mechanical watches. While they do suffer from a lack of third-party apps, Huawei is slowly getting the essentials right. And the battery life is absolutely top-notch. Personally, I've moved away from WearOS and I am not in any rush of going back soon.  
It's somewhat of a balance between smartwatch features, a fitness tracker without being too focused like Garmin, and actually looking great on the wrist.

Although, more features wouldn't hurt!

Personally, for any newcomers looking into this series, I'd recommend starting with the [**Huawei Watch GT5**](https://freeimage.host/i/dyHmkdu) because it has some significant features that were requested for so long (the keyboard and offline maps being big ones), that the other models do not. And it just looks good honestly. If you want some of the bells and whistles, then the [GT5 Pro](https://freeimage.host/i/dyqUp6X) is also an excellent choice.
Their new TruSense sensor looks promising but the results between people seem to be inconsistent. It seems decent but not extraordinary yet, as Huawei tries to make it be. Should be further tuned with future software updates though, as they have done many many times.

A few honorable mentions:

For those that want a green watch or seem to prefer the [**Huawei Watch GT4**,](https://freeimage.host/i/dyHsSMg) it's also a cheaper and solid option. It should get the upgrade to HarmonyOS 5 later on, but whether it gets some or all the features of the GT5 remains to be seen.

The [**Huawei Watch GT3 Pro**](https://freeimage.host/i/dyqrMge) is another great alternative, due to its HR performance and a lot of people love its looks. Just take note that it will no longer get new features as the 2 years of support has just ended. It did get HarmonyOS 4 though, with improved HR accuracy and notifications wake up screen. 

The [**Huawei Watch GT Runner**](https://freeimage.host/i/dyq42Q2) is another fan-favorite due to its long battery life, plastic case and breathable band which makes it very suitable to the audience it is aimed at. I've heard that the HR is excellent on this and it is very comfortable to wear during long periods. Unfortunately, it is discontinued. So finding one is quite an arduous task.

Please, don't pick any of the GT2 series. A LOT has changed since then.

TL;DR: If you're not sure, just pick the GT5, it should serve you nicely. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 **[HUAWEI WATCH ULTIMATE](https://freeimage.host/i/dZ9AHFe)** series:

The most expensive and luxurious series in the lineup.

Comes in 4 different colors:

- Blue
- Black
- Green (New)
- [Gold](https://freeimage.host/i/dZ9R30X) (A.K A Ultimate Design)*


*And yes, real gold is used here. More on that later

In terms of features, honestly, it's heavily similar to the GT series prior to the GT5. So what makes it different?

Well, it takes all of the aspects of the GT series and pushes them further. The result is that it's basically... hmm... a stylish Huawei-fied flagship Garmin Watch. Oh yes, that's a perfect description.

For the build:
Instead of Stainless Steel (GT) and Titanium(46mm)/Ceramic Build(42mm) of the GT Pros


- The watch bezel and rear case is made of nano-tech ceramic
- The front case is zirconium-based liquid metal

Translation: It's made with premium materials found in luxurious watches and it is also very tough, durable and corrosion-resistant (and undoubtedly the heaviest watch Huawei has made yet).

- For the **gold** version, the watch bezel has six segments of 18 karats Physical Vapor Deposition gold laid at the edge of the ceramic bezel. and the watch case is made of liquid metal. The crown and buttons are also 18k gold and titanium alloy. All these fancy words meaning that it is basically a bling bling watch. It's also the heaviest one out of the 4 models.

In addition:

- LTPO AMOLED screen
- They all have 3 buttons instead of 2.
- 10 ATM water resistance, EN13319 diving certification up to 100 meters. Scuba diving approved.

As for the features that are notable to the Ultimate series:

- Expedition Mode (think Hiking Mode but better). Allows you to keep you on track and save landmarks so that you never get lost. A bit more on that later...
- Exclusive multiple Diving workouts with proper diving tools as well.
- Hover Timer and Apnea Training (diving stuff)
- ECG/Arterial Stiffness


**THE GREEN VERSION** has been revealed a year later, with the GT5 and GT5 Pro. While it is still the same product has the Ultimate Blue/Black/Gold, it comes with HarmonyOS 5.0. Which means, there are some differences...

- Expedition mode finally supports proper offline contour maps. Making it a somewhat suitable alternative from the expensive Garmin watches.
- Comes with a keyboard (Yes, custom replies ahoy!)
- Golf Mode with more than 15000 map courses worldwide
- Watch Screenshot
- If I am not mistaken, RouteDraw should also be included

Now, I know what you're thinking. ""What about the other 3 colors?"" Don't worry, you'll get all of these features in a future OTA update, confirmed by Huawei itself. 

- Battery Life: 8 to 14 days

**DOESN'T COME WITH**:

- WI-FI/Esim
- Exclusive features from the Watch series

My opinion: Essentially, you're looking at this for two reasons.  
If you are a real outdoorsman; We're talking hiking, diving, any outside activities. And with the new Gold mode, it is apparently a solid choice for golfers, according to this [review](https://www.golfmonthly.com/reviews/gps/huawei-watch-ultimate-green-edition-review).

Either that or

You want something on your wrist that really stands out. Because let's be honest, the Ultimate is not only large but very eye-catching. Whether the design looks good or not, that's up to the person looking at it. Personally I find the Voyager blue to look like the Rolex Submariner and put them side by side, the similarities are striking.

Not that it is bad, but it shows that the Ultimate is inspired by Haute Holorgerie. 

It may sport the name ""Ultimate"" but frankly you're getting a pimped up GT watch here and skipping it won't make you miss much from it. You can get much of its offerings for much less. A GT5 Pro would cover a lot of the needs it also offers.

But if you have money to splurge and really want to stand out, then why not? Personally, I think there should be more stylish tech watches. Other options these days are far too bland and uninspiring (I'm looking at you, Samsung.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


[**HUAWEI**](https://freeimage.host/i/dZ54Ii7) [**WATCH**](https://freeimage.host/i/dZ7zZ1R) series: 

The most misunderstood wearable lineup of Huawei (more on that later). 
It is also the first series of watch the brand has established, with Huawei Watch 1 and Watch 2 using Google's AndroidWear at the time. 

But then, everything changed when the Huawei Ban was enforced in the US, effectively barring Google from working with Huawei. And this is the one lineup that's suffered the most.

Starting with the Huawei Watch 3 series, it went off to use their own HarmonyOS skin on top of Android (More on that later.)

At the same time, it is arguably still the best wearable lineup Huawei has made.

For the most recent 4 series:

- Comes in [Stainless Steel Black](https://freeimage.host/i/dZ7n5Ou) for the 4 
- Comes in [Blue](https://freeimage.host/i/dZ7IILb) or [Titanium](https://freeimage.host/i/dZ54kWN) with either leather brown strap or the titanium strap for the 4 Pro
- Also comes in a special [Titanium Black](https://freeimage.host/i/dZ7YGAQ) for the 4 Pro Space Edition.
- The Regular 4 Pro's case is made out of Aerospace-Grade Titanium
- The Space Edition's case is made out of Aerospace-Grade DLC Titanium with a ceramic bezel. 
- The Space Edition gets one exclusive watchface, other than that, it is the same experience
- They all have the same spherical Sapphire Screen (Indeed, the screen isn't flat. It is domed and it's on purpose.)

Features of the Watch series:

- Accelerometer 
- Gyroscope
- Magnetometer
- Optical HR sensor (TruSeen 5.5+ with the Watch 4 HarmonyOS 4.2 update)
- Barometer
- Temperature sensor ( Skin AND Body temperature measurement)
- Ambient Light Sensor
- SpO2 Measurement
- Stress tracking 
- Sleep tracking with breathing awareness
- Pulse Arrhythmia Analysis (Absent in previous models)
- Electrocardiogram (ECG) (Only available with Watch 4 series)
- Arterial Stiffness analysis (Only Available with Watch 4 series)
- Cycle Calendar AND tracking
- Hyperglycemia (Blood Sugar) Evaluation (Only available with the China variant of the Watch 4 series)
- Vascular Evaluation (China variant of W4 series Only)
- Health Glance 2.0 
- High altitude Monitoring (Watch 4 series only)
- GPS and compass
- WiFi/Esim Connection
- Bluetooth and ESIM calling
- SOS contacts and Fall Detection 
- NFC
- Music Storage  
- Custom replies Keyboard support with Voice-To-Text
- Voice Recording
- Over 100 workouts and exclusive workouts involving the Altimeter and Barometer (Golf, Hiking, etc)
- Diving features and workouts with EN13319 certification to 30m (Watch 4 series only)
- Walk/Run/Cycling with map and routing supported
- 5 ATM Water Resistance
- Calendar App and Widget support! (Watch 4 with HarmonyOS 4.2)
- Stay Fit app (calorie tracking, etc) (Watch 4 series with HarmonyOS 4.2)
- Petal Maps with Map navigation and routing support
- Huawei AppGallery app with a greater number of apps supported
- Supports Sideloading 3rd Party apps 
- Up to 3 days of battery life (Watch 4 Standard Mode)*
- Up to 4.5 days of battery life (Watch 4 Pro Standard Mode)*

I know what you're thinking. The battery is quite bad in comparison to the other series. But why? Well, as mentioned previously, the Watch series are actually Android watches with a HarmonyOS custom skin on top. For HarmonyOS 4.2 on the Watch 4, it's based on Android 12. 

Because of the Android kernel, this makes it possible to sideload 3rd party apps outside the Huawei AppGallery, with the Android Bridge Debug. Installing GSpace allows you to install the WearOS store and install some of the many apps inside it as well. Some exceptions like Google Pay/Wallet won't be supported though, and also this will reduce your battery life further.

[An example of WhatsApp in the watch](https://freeimage.host/i/dZWGJx2) 

While this is great, what truly makes the Watch series exceptional is the inclusion of the **Ultra-long Battery Life Mode (UBLM). **

Originally introduced with the Watch 3 Series, it's a mode that essentially turns your watch into a GT series watch. This is especially true with the Watch 4 series. For a technical explanation, The Watch 3 and Watch 4 series are dual-kernel watches, having both the HarmonyOS based on Android and the HarmonyOS based on the proprietary LiteOS firmware made by Huawei (the very same firmware used in the GT watches.

While Ultra-long Battery Life is activated:
- Wi-Fi/Esim is disabled
- No keyboard support, only Quick replies
- No Third-Party apps support
- Huawei AppGallery App is missing
- Petal Maps is missing 
- Voice Recording is missing
- Offline Map support is missing
- Health Glance 2.0 is missing

That's pretty much it. You can still take or make Bluetooth calls, do workouts, check the weather, notifications, ECG/Arterial stiffness, pretty much the same things you would do with a GT watch.

Even better, you can also download watchfaces while in UBLM (Only with Watch 4 series). They are essentially watchfaces from the GT series of watches. 

As for the battery life:

Up to a whopping 21 days with a Huawei Watch 4 Pro (Same for the 3 Pro)
Up to 14 days with Huawei Watch 4 (as well as the 3)

Mention and notes:

The **[Huawei Watch 3 series](https://freeimage.host/i/dZhPARs)** isn't as great as its newest counterpart, the Watch 4 series. In fact, of all the watches ever released by Huawei, I think it's the one that suffered the most, due to many glaring issues and poor support all around. 

- Despite the issue being fixable in many (not all!) cellphones, the weather app has issues in printing out some of the data in watchfaces. 
- The Android version is too old to support the most recent wearOS apps and GSpace, which makes the sideloading experience quite difficult.
- Its calendar app is only compatible with Huawei phones. 
- From my own experience, the health tracking, honestly, is not that great. And the Sleep Tracking is horrendous on it. 

However, the 3 Pro is very stylish. I think I prefer its design more than the 4 Pro. 

What would have made this watch finally great, is simply one more update: HarmonyOS 4.0. Unfortunately, that was only released with the china variant...

That being said! It is possible to import the [Huawei Watch 3 Pro](https://freeimage.host/i/dZhpCpS) [New](https://freeimage.host/i/dZhy5Vn)!
It's essentially a refresh of the Huawei Watch 3 Pro, but with ECG included with it. That being said, I think you'll need a chinese account for that particular feature, but I may be wrong. It gets the HarmonyOS 4.0 update as well.
So for those that aren't too keen on the Huawei Watch 4 design, this could be an alternative.

Note that the China variant of Huawei Watches also supports the English language. I can personally vouch for that 100%.


My opinion on the series and take on its future: The Huawei Watch 4 Pro is, in my opinion, the best of Huawei's entire watch lineup at the time of writing, due to its sheer versatility and beauty. However, there have been a few inconsistencies at times, from Huawei themselves, like the Weather app no longer working for every W4 owner in Standard mode (server issues?!). It's kinda weird. The watch is great, but I think most people will find the GT series enough, due to its simplicity in setting up.  It also helps that the GT5 also gets a few features from the watch series, like a keyboard.

But for those that love to tinker stuff, add features and whatnot, that is the one, without a doubt... And it looks premium as well. 

As for its future, I suspect the Huawei Watch 4 series will be the last of the series to have Android of any form as Huawei will move on to HarmonyOS Next, which completely ditches the Android Linux Kernel. While China will gain a lot, Global consumers may lose a lot. I still suspect that Huawei will implement features that they couldn't have before, now that they'll have full control on its platforms. It'll be interesting to see what they do and how they will stand out from the competition.

From chinese sources, there are rumors that the Huawei Watch 4 will also get HarmonyOS 5. (At the very least, the China Variant.) If it does, I'll be sure to make a post about it. But I will probably not update.

------------------------------------------------------------------

[**Huawei Watch Buds**](https://freeimage.host/i/dy9ePJs)

Huawei labels them under the ""Watch"" series but it functions just like a GT device.

It's essentially a watch that also has earbuds inside them.
Basically a watch that is also an earbuds case.

- 80+ workouts included
- Earbuds have noise canceling (3 hours of audio-playback/2 hours of calling)
- Earbuds can be instantly used for replying to calls (the watch itself doesn't have a speaker
- The rest of the features, check the GT section. Note that for very obvious reasons, it doesn't have any form of water-resistance. That also means no workouts involving water. 

Its battery life is up to 3 days.

My opinion: If you want a watch and wireless earbuds, I guess that could be a solution. It is certainly a unique twist! But depending on whether you are really a sports person, this may not be the best choice. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

[**HUAWEI**](https://freeimage.host/i/dmJqQzG) [**WATCH**](https://freeimage.host/i/dmJBImg) **D** series

The most unusual and unique watch series of the lineup. But arguably the most useful.

The ""D"" series are special watches that are able to measure your blood pressure. I'll be mostly talking about the D2 because the changes are very significant.

Of course, we've heard of watches that can measure blood pressure while being calibrated with a blood pressure monitor (i.e. Galaxy Watches 4 and Up) so what makes this one different?!

**The watch ITSELF is an actual blood pressure monitor.**
One could say that the TruSense sensor was made specifically with this device in mind. 

Of course, for such important features to be even usable, the watch has to be (and is) medically certified. Both in China and Europe. 

So the D2 comes with [two Blood Pressure (BP)](https://freeimage.host/i/dmMht4a) related features: **Ambulatory Blood Monitoring** and **Anytime BP measurements**

**Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM)**

This feature measures your blood pressure at preset intervals in a 24-hour period, and it calculates your average for the whole day, daytime and nighttime and analyzes your BPM rhythm. The data is used for hypertension and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular assessment. 

**Anytime BP measurements**

As the name says, you can choose to take the measurements anytime, without set intervals.


Now what makes this all possible? Of course, the TruSense sensor is part of the equation. But what makes the watch rather unique, is the unique strap that it comes with!

It's a strap that comes with an airbag inside (that can also be detached). The airbag inflates during blood pressure measurements, constricting your arm, like a usual blood pressure monitor. This increases the accuracy of your heart rate measurements and also makes sure that the PPG sensor can get your blood flow correctly with minimal issues.

[The airbag inflating, under the strap](https://freeimage.host/i/dmjN5xf)

[https://freeimage.host/i/dmjNDen](https://freeimage.host/i/dmjNDen)

It's also awfully quiet, while it does this.


Of course, the D2 can also act like a regular Huawei Watch.  You can choose NOT to use the BP features.

And the features are pretty much the same as the GT series... But in a Square Form factor!!! I'll put in bold the things its brother (Fit 3) does not have!

- Accelerometer 
- Gyroscope
- Magnetometer
- **Optical HR sensor (TruSense algorithm)**
- **Barometer**
- **Temperature sensor (Skin temperature measurement)**
- Ambient Light Sensor
- SpO2 Measurement
- Stress tracking 
- Sleep tracking with breathing
- Pulse Arrhythmia Analysis 
- **Electrocardiogram** 
- **Arterial Stiffness analysis **
- Cycle Calendar **AND tracking**
- GPS and compass
- Bluetooth Calling
- NFC
- Music Storage  
- Remote shutter (Huawei and Iphones only)
- Over 80+ workouts and exclusive workouts involving the Altimeter and Barometer (Golf, Hiking, etc)
- 5 ATM Water Resistance
- Calendar App 
- Stay Fit app (calorie tracking, etc) (Starting with the GT4)
- Petal Maps 
- Huawei AppGallery 
- 6 days of Battery Life (Note that if BP measurements aren't used, you can squeeze in a bit more)
- 1 Day of battery life with ABPM enabled

Essentially, one could call this a Huawei Watch ""Fit 3 Pro"". And the improvements are well worth it. Note that the Fit 3 straps cannot be used with the D2, as the attachments are different. Note that because it is kind of a niche product, third party bands may be difficult to find, for it. 

*Note that HarmonyOS 5.0 has recently been released for it, but it doesn't add the new features found in the GT5 series and Ultimate. 

My opinion: The first ""D"" watch certainly looked like a useful device but it looked ugly to wear. The ""D2"" improves over the first in every single way, both in style and functionality. If you want a watch and something to monitor your blood pressure in a proper way, without the need of external accessories, this could be an interesting product to consider. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'll skip the Huawei Watch kids series. 

So if you've made it here, then congratulations. 

Few notes to mention:

Some features like:


- Golf Mode
- RouteDraw
- NFC Payments
- ECG/Pulse Wave Arrhythmia Analysis/Arterial Stiffness/Blood Pressure Measurements 
- etc

are not available in all countries. Make sure the region you've chosen supports it. Some features like the keyboard and voice replies **for the GT series** are device dependent. A few like the Celia Assistant are both regional and device dependent. 😓

If you are in the US, make a Huawei account that doesn't have the US as its region, else a lot of the features will be disabled. Depending on your device, this will either be easy as pie, or a daunting task. 

Huawei tends to make two variants of their watches: A Chinese model and a Global model. Needless to say, the Chinese model usually has better support and more features than the Global model. This is especially true with the Watch Series. While there are a few differences, they can pretty much work worldwide and best of all, in perfect english. 

A few third-party apps in the App Gallery that I'd like to recommend for the Fit/GT/Ultimate/D series:

- Navigation: This app makes it able to read directions from Google Maps directly from your watch. Extremely useful while driving and cycling and a worthwile alternative.

- Calculator: I mean, it's simple but it works. Especially if you need to do a quick math for paying something. Note that Huawei has included their own, in recent devices.

- Events G-Calendar: For those that don't have the calendar app, this is a suitable alternative. It can even show the entire month and each events that goes with the day selected.

- For Spotify Controller: The only one that I haven't tried since I seldomly use Spotify. But I've heard that it works.



**A NOTE ABOUT ACCURACY AND TESTING**

**Make sure you read plenty of reviews/anecdotes and test the device yourself, and not just base your entire opinion on one video, as lazy research.** I know a lot of you swear by The Quantified Scientist videos to make your decisions but this is only a sample of 1 (and he himself says this). It's very informative but what works for him, may not work for you and vice-versa. **From my personal experience, I found that out the hard way.**

So, research well your devices and make a compilation of results!

And lastly, enjoy your watch. Those that are more adventurous will get the most out of it. 

If there's something I've missed that could be important to add, feel free to mention it in the comments. I'll edit the guide and add things in the future as well."

Trend Following Strategies in Cryptocurrency Trading: A Case Study on TrueFi (TRU)  
  
Abstract  
  
This abstract outlines an in-depth analysis of trend following strategies applied to TrueFi (TRU), a notable player in the DeFi lending market, within the volatile cryptocurrency trading landscape. Utilizing both technical and fundamental analysis, this study explores how TRU's integration into DeFi, particularly through its Trinity protocol for real-world asset tokenization, impacts its suitability for trend following. The research delves into historical price trends, volatility measures, and the application of various trading indicators like MACD, Bollinger Bands, and candlestick patterns to predict TRU's price movements. Additionally, sentiment analysis from real-time X posts provides insights into market psychology affecting TRU's trends. The analysis also considers strategic entry and exit points, position sizing, and the use of leverage through TrueFi's lending protocol. This case study not only assesses TRU's performance against traditional trend following metrics but also examines its potential as a trend-following asset in a diversified crypto portfolio, offering practical insights for traders interested in leveraging DeFi innovations for enhanced trading strategies.

"WTT: Red Panda Context v2, Diamond Quantum Leap, Mythos Golden Fleece MTSU, Tanabe Dumkudo, more <==> WTTF: loud pedals, high gain amps, doomy guitars",letstradepedals,1f50htb,2024-08-30 13:08:04,6,1.0,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/letstradepedals/comments/1f50htb/wtt_red_panda_context_v2_diamond_quantum_leap/,Brain_sack,,"Updated list with [pictures](https://imgur.com/a/jpjbLSx). For clarity, I have two lists – **List 1 (bold)** are the pedals I’m looking to wheel n deal for other pedals, normal letstradepedal stuff; *List 2 (italicized)* is gear I’m willing to trade but only for high-gain amp heads or certain guitars –  i.e. ‘feelers’. For the gear in *List 2*, I’m not interested in swaps – I’d rather keep it all but am willing to let them go in exchange for things I really want, which I’ll specify below. For both lists, I’m cool with packaging multiple pieces to get equal value.

 

**LIST 1**

**WTT:**

* ~~**MXR Carbon Copy**~~(traded)
* ~~**MXR Phase 90**~~(traded)
* ~~**MXR Clone Looper w/ 2x Tap Tempo**~~(traded)
* ~~**Boss Harmonist PS-6**~~(traded)

* ~~**Land Devices Domino**~~(traded)
* ~~**Tanabe.tv Dumkudo**~~(traded)
* ~~**Red Panda Context v2 with Remote 4**~~(traded)

**WTTF: boost, eq, overdrive, fuzz. Thru-hole ~~Boss GE-7 and~~ Boss SD-1 or SD-1W are top on my list of wants. Anything loud and rowdy, vile and grungy, or interesting. Things that will goose a crunchy amp or tighten up a distorted amp. Open to offers but I’ve got loads of gear and particular tastes – I want mostly old or vibey stuff (I don’t mean vibrato lol), not so into new things – though I occasionally fall in love with modern pedals like the Tensor. I’m a soldering fool and have been circuit-bending and modding for 20 yrs, so thru-hole pedals are what I like.**

Guitars I’m interested in: Dunable USA, Jackson USA, 80s Les Paul’s, 80s G&L, Obstructures, EGC/Travis Bean, Robot Graves, 1970s up to “U” series BC Rich, will consider Japanese or Korean 7-strings by Jackson, Schecter, ESP. Maybe birch 4x12 cabs if you can ship (I’d pay shipping). Willing to package multiples to get values right. Can do PayPal g&s escrow for insurance if you’re worried – I’m legit though. This post is not for business, this is all for and from my personal collection, but I can share my guitar and amp repair/modding business details to help settle any distrust for higher end gear swaps.*"

# Fat Witch Summer by Lizzy Ives

""This teen roadtrip fantasy takes place in an alternate Earth, specifically an alternate United States, where witches have been in power for centuries and the world revolves around magic. The worldbuilding is so fresh and fun, with almost a hint of parody at times, and the ensemble of characters are loveable. It also lightly tackles issues of society and identity, especially body image and education.""

\~ Cedar McCloud

[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BRW38ZGG](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BRW38ZGG)

# Miss Percy's Pocket Guide to the Care and Feeding of British Dragons by Quenby Olson

""Did you know Lucy Maud Montgomery and Terry Pratchett collaborated on a book about dragons? You know now.""

\~ Bjørn Larssen

""Aside from having a wonderful (and long) title, the book is an easy read with a phenomenally written middle aged MC. The prose is witty, the parenthetical asides funny, and the entire book is a cozy read that was just what I wanted. Unless you hate cozy reads, this is one I don't think you can go wrong with. ""

\~ Calvin Park

""It's a delightful tale about a woman in her forties finally taking charge of her own story and going on the adventures she's always dreamed of and we need more stories like it in the world.""

# Banebringer by Carol A. Park

Banebringer, by Carol A. Park, because of its combination of slowburn romance with epic fantasy.

\~ Angela Boord

A dark but not bleak story in a compelling world with an interesting approach to its magic system, as well as a believable, fun romance sprinkled in.

\~ Travis M. Riddle

A fantastic high fantasy. I loved the books for the depth of the characters and and the pace of the story.

\~ Coleman Alexander

[https://www.amazon.com/Banebringer-Heretic-Gods-Book-1-ebook/dp/B07C29DQH5/](https://www.amazon.com/Banebringer-Heretic-Gods-Book-1-ebook/dp/B07C29DQH5/)

# Children by Bjørn Larssen

Dark humor combine with brutally stark character portrayal.

\~ Angela Boord

Imagine you are a son or daughter of gods: self-involved, uncaring, selfish gods who either ignore you completely or use you for their own ends. Now read Children--if you dare.

\~Marian L Thorpe

Children turns familiar myths on their head, defying expectations whilst staying true to their source. If you enjoy Nordic mythology and prefer your fantasy on the grimdark side, Larssen’s distinctive voice is likely to appeal to you.

# Legacy of the Brightwash by Krystle Matar

A masterful piece of character-driven fantasy in a gritty Victorian-inspired setting.

\~ Angela Boord

Legacy of the Brightwash has one of the most well realized characters I've read in a long time. It's dark as hell and deeply, wonderfully and horrifically human all at the same time.

\~ C.M. Caplan

I love this one because the writing is gorgeous, there's an intriguing murder mystery, and it is Gaslamp/Victorian Grimdark, so yeah that's awesome, right!? Also some of the best characterization and deeply personal interactions you will find in a fantasy book.

\~ Nick Borelli of Out of This World SFF

""Grimdark gaslamp with romance! A dark story showing both the best and worst of humanity with incredible characters that step out of the pages.""

\~Tru Skies

""Characters you love from the first page facing wonderfully real dilemmas in a gritty, fascinating world. Plus stunning, evocative writing and all the emotional trauma.""

# The Oasis Trials by Heidi Catherine and Tamar Sloan

""Perfect for fans of all things YA dystopian. Set on a floating garbage patch in a world ravaged by climate change, the characters must face trials set by a leader who might not be telling the full truth. This series scratches that Hunger Games itch!""

\~ Jordan Rivet

[https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B09H2FGXWV](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B09H2FGXWV)

[https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0C1NR6D7P](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0C1NR6D7P)

# A Thousand Li: The First Step Tao Wong

This one is a classic cultivation fantasy, where we follow a young protagonist as he was taken from his village and ends up joining a sect of cultivators. Wong does an excellent job of making the genre accessible for westerners. Again, the characters are what truly shine in this one, though the setting is also excellent.

\~ Calvin Park

\~ Christopher Warman

""Rosero’s writing has a distinctive style that’s all her own and she should be on everyone’s radar in the world of fantasy literature.""

# Isaree of the Wild Isles by Noor Al-Shanti

No one actually recommended this, but as I'm running the sale and asking a bunch of others to put their books on sale, I thought I might as well throw mine in as well. This one's a slightly dark, somewhat cozy, single-POV epic fantasy adventure.

\~ Bjørn Larssen

""Regency faerie tale queen Olivia Atwater takes a leap into the contemporary with this charming tale of little temptations. But instead of faeries, you'll find gender-bending angels with penchants for gambling and chocolate. There's a bit of a Good Omens dynamic at work but with more personal rather than global stakes, and just when you think it's all going to be cocoa and karaoke a more dangerous threat steps into the scene. But don't worry. This is, after all, an Atwater tale, so we can guarantee it will all end up working out splendidly.""

""One of my top reads of 2023. Replacement follows the story of Jane, a forgotten clone in a factory-like facility where most of the others are part of larger ""batches"" who have been cloned/designed to take on specific roles in society. Jane is yearning and searching for ""batchmates"" and for answers. She wants to know who ""sponsored"" her to be cloned in the first place and why. To connect with her identity. This was a great, well-written read that had mystery and explored the ethical issues that arise from cloning in an entertaining way. ""

# Sapience: A Collection of Science Fiction Short Stories by Alexis Lantgen

Sapience is a fascinating collection of sci-fi short stories. It features a variety of stories that range from gritty and thought-provoking to futuristic fairy tales. Among my favorite stories is Chrysalis, the tale of a woman stranded in a broken vehicle on Europa's surface. It has such an unexpected, almost poetic ending, and that ending then weaves itself into the stories that follow. I also really loved The Last Bird and Swan, two related stories about mechanical birds that manage to be both tragic and uplifting.

This book is a strong follow up to Sapience, Alexis Lantgen's first short story collection. I'm a particular fan of The Lost Cat, a unique vampire story, and Braids, an interesting tale of feminine power and magic. I'd also love to see more stories about Nikolas, a creative, demon-hunting take on St. Nicholas. Alexis balances light & darkness well in this charming, thought-provoking collection.

These guides are aimed at the following players:

* New players
* Casual Players
* Older Gamers

The intention is that if you're looking to improve and improve your overall skills and adapt is the reason I made this guide. Now reading, following, and buying any of the equipment outlined is not going to turn you from a 0.6 KD player to a 3KD player who is going to go drop an MGB. However, you will solidify your skill and game mechanics to get you out playing like ass to something more respectable, like a trash can.

If you're just casually playing with no interest improving this likely isn't for you but you can still pick up some tips to help out your gameplay.

If you're the kind of player who has dropped the game a lot and maybe you're a bit older but you're not yet ready to rollover in your casket because you still can do it, this is also for you.

This comes from a console players perspective, I cannot offer much assistance for graphic and other computer settings, I am sorry for that. If there is anything I've picked up that can help PC players I'll throw it in if I can.

**-Brief Introduction-**

This is typically where people post their COD CV.  I been playing a long time and my ass has been getting fucked for a long *ass* time. Yet, I persevere. I started this game with a 0.8KD but have managed to make it up to a 1.05 with a lot of hard work. Surely, I won't be getting any contracts with a CDL team or a successful Twitch channel but I did improve and faced the same hardships as many of you folks. I want to bestow everything I've learned both from Reddit, YouTube, and my general experience.

I am going to break this up into three main parts:

1. Equipment
2. Settings
3. Gameplay/Training
4. Conclusion/Questions

So if you don't give a shit about what accessories and equipment you can look into you can look at settings and discussing gameplay elements to level up.

**1. Equipment**

Since COD4 people were always seeking an advantage and the big advantage back then was getting a headset to hear enemy footsteps. Things have changed since then, there's tons of different controllers and *legit* devices to squeak out an advantage.

**You do not need to spend any additional money if you do not want to do so.**

However, many of your opponents have and if you have the financial means to get better equipment by all means do so but I want to stress, you can still improve without having to drop a dime into other shit. The only thing I would strongly recommend if you have any money is to at least invest in a decent headset at the bare minimum but again...you really don't have to.

So let's go over a few pieces of equipment that can greatly help you.

**-Headsets-**

There are literally thousands of headsets from all different price points that you can look into using to up your game.  Many people will tell you that Turtle Beach headsets are probably the best headsets to get. Lol, just kidding. They're actually pretty average but I've used plenty of them over the years and they are certainly serviceable.

So what headset should you look into buying? Here's a few, but I strongly recommend doing a little bit of research before committing to a purchase. I would recommend utilizing[ \~https://www.rtings.com/\~](https://www.rtings.com/) to review most equipment as their reviews and testing are pretty reliable.

That's a list of 20 headsets of varying price level, quality, and usage. Double check that the headset works for you console. The Audeze one is just a troll pick but if you want to flex your money. By all means.

One factor to keep in mind is battery life, breathability, and comfortability. I personally have used the HyperX Cloud and if anyone tends to get earaches often from using headsets I strongly endorse this. I also use the Rig 900 Max and I've really enjoyed it. Again, do the research, try them out and find the one the best fits you and your budget.

**Sound EQ**

If you're a PC player you do have a special setting that is not really available for console users for EQ Loudness Equalization. This can assist with you hearing footsteps even better. Regardless of your skill level, if you're a PC player you should have this on because 100% of other PC players are going to have this on.

[\~Ja3Yun- How to enable Loudness Equalization\~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMwg0iNesJ0)

Don't want to watch the video? No Problem!

1. Right-click the speaker icon on your taskbar and go to “Sounds”.
2. In the “Playback” tab find the device with a green tick mark (Your default device).
3. Right-click that device and go to “Properties”.
4. Select the “Enhancements” tab.
5. Make sure the “Loudness Equalization” setting is turned on.
6. Click “OK” to confirm the settings.
7. Head into a game with the enhanced audio.
8. To turn this setting back off simply follow the steps and deselect the “Loudness Equalization”.

Now you really can't get the exact 1:1 settings as you could with the Windows LE setting but there are options for select headsets where you can try to achieve similar results which would be.

**Dolby Atmos App**

If you have a headset that supports Dolby Atmos and you have the app and have purchased the rights or got a license for using it. You can configure this by downloading the app to your console and I have followed different settings but I recently utilized a video from[ \~Jbord\~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3RbGOQpK_w) to help configure my headset for better sound EQ.

Just like the headsets, these settings can change and between Jbords I had another but I apologize, I don't remember which YouTube video I got these from, I just remember taking a screen shot on my phone but I also liked this profile. I am still trying to determine which one is better.

Now there are some notes on the PS5 (and I am unsure on Xbox) that there is a slight audio delay when using Dolby Atmos.

You probably recognize there is no specific number on the settings so the +1 and -1 is something you just have to track while adjusting the sliders. Not intuitive at all but it works.

**Is this really THAT important?**

Honestly, yes. It seems silly to have to go through all these things but if you even want to be on equal footing with other players. You got to be able to hear footsteps. Any information that lets you get any advantage is worth it.  This might take a little time to configure but it is totally worth it.

**In Game Sound Settings**

My recommendation is to make sure **Master Volume**  is 100, Dialogue is 30 and that Music is turned off (for Multiplayer) that way you don't get distracted by any other sounds. Now which audio setting you use between (Home Theater, Soundbar, Headphones, Headphones + Bass and TV(might be additional settings on PC) is a tough one to opine on which one is truly the best. You will have to mess around, even though I use a headset I have kept my sound settings on Soundbar and it's been pretty easy to pick up footsteps and other shuffling sounds. So you'll have to tinker a bit to find what sounds best to you.

**What if I don't even want to use a headset?**

Don't. It does give you an advantage but you can still get similar performance from a good speaker or sound bar setup. Sometimes, you don't want to wear a headset and a good speaker system shouldn't be an issue but the big thing is family, roommates and what time you're playing. Not everyone wants to hear loud shooting and you cursing at the game. So that's why headsets are prioritized.

**2. Monitor VS TV? Does it actually matter?**

This has gone on for a long time on whether it really matters if you play a huge TV or a small monitor and is there going to be a huge performance boost or loss?

The answer is, yes. Yes it does matter **BUT** it only really matters in the upper echelon of play or pro players in a pro environment.

Whether you are playing on an 82"" TV or a 23"" Monitor; what matters is the time it takes for you to acclimate to the screen size and your sitting position.

""but on the big TV, your eyes have to scan whereas on a monitor all the information is right there to see.""

True, if you play on a big TV there is a bit more scanning but again, as you adapt, this all gets done subconsciously and you don't even remember scanning. Having a monitor that is smaller so you don't have to scan does mean you'll be able to process screen information just a bit faster.

Remember, we're all pretty much trash and if you're reading this then you may only see a slight benefit whereas actually above-average players are going to get more utilization from a smaller screen.

Play what you can play on and what you enjoy. Whether it's a huge ass TV, a projector (please don't) and a monitor. What you need to focus on is the refresh rate and input lag. Those are the big factors you need to keep in mind. For consoles we are only allowed up to 120hz via an HDMI 2.1 cable but if you're on a PC; the sky is the limit and your budget.

**Controllers and Other Things**

I am primarily a console player so I play with a controller. I am not super well versed in what the absolute best mouse & keyboard is for the game. So respectfully, I am just going to focusing on controllers. If anyone has recommendations for special settings and keyboards/mouse. Just message me and I'll edit it into this guide with credits.

You **do not** have to go out any buy the most expensive fancy controller to do well but they certainly do help especially with back pedals/buttons being very popular and I would not be surprised in the future if these become the norm for console controllers.

**Why are back buttons so important?**

It's about having the option to had additional input without requiring you to take your thumb off the sticks and your fingers off the triggers. This essentially allows you to respond quickly to threats while maintaining accuracy.

Though just having back buttons on a controller makes them great, the ergonomic placement of the pedals is very important so your hand doesn't cramp up.

**Controllers**

[\~Elite V2 Controller for Xbox/PC\~](https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Elite-Controller-Starter-Bundle/dp/B082LNJ927/ref=sr_1_4?crid=IAFLT5S1H89A&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.82bPmN7SnngR_XypzHkOoELlLBdVBjdFV0HnO1pb3vSoQWvIOqBx8Cwaq6v2__RwfOYqyR0bk1lUmnCQVOxVwS8WHv2ze8nDL-KEza7YIlvPKM2OObdk7Ht0df04YUEIhR6UUCwIjEYoSuy4fMr2NuIJ3SGN1KiO6ZvOTyOfKXLmvwpMqDJYlqH06H3FPcDY5Rh5MXNBm5yQrOAmNqXiWcGBkmsHaLuadGI9efl36as.jcMsXFkiCP9mfO4VAQY7sTUqZmI05u71En-92-YlOso&dib_tag=se&keywords=elite+series+2+controller&qid=1722177623&sprefix=Elite+%2Caps%2C171&sr=8-4)

This is a fairly decent controller and the one I use the most often. It has a very long battery life and if you pick up the starter kit you get the controller case you can set your controller in to charge. You can also swap out the sticks and the D-Pad. You can find cheaper Elite controllers without the case and additional accessories.

It feels like a pretty good controller but I will caution you of a few things about this controller.

The bumper buttons are trash and tend to break or wear out often, especially on the original elite controller. I have gone through 3 Elite controllers and 2 V2 controllers due to this. I have also invested in trying to repair them and it's just a pain in the ass to do.

The other issue is the trigger stop switches plastic knob will eventually fall off. While not the most detrimental thing in the world but for a $200 controller this shouldn't even be an issue.

Stick drift also can become a thing (especially if you're tac-sprinting everywhere or playing G3T H1gh3r but I will say the controller stick drift on the new controllers isn't a huge issue and I only had to replace mine after 2 years.

What I will encourage to those of you looking to invest in this controller. Get extended warranties and special insurance if you can because YOU WILL have to use it. If you don't and it's out of warranty I think it was about $80 to warranty it through Microsoft. So still cheaper than buying a completely new controller.

You can set up multiple profiles through the Accessory App on Xbox to change what the 4 back pedals do because maybe you're not always playing COD and you're playing another game, so being able to toggle through the profiles on the controller itself.

I have to say these are really good controllers especially for the build. Highly recommend to people transitioning to use controllers on PC because the face buttons and triggers feel very clicky. The only draw back to the controller is the back pedal placement. Not ergonomic at all so you have to hit them very awkwardly and prolong use can cause joint pain if you have tiny little baby fingers like me.

A lot of positive reviews for these controllers and they also have interchangeable sticks and button configurations which you can have 6 face buttons which likely is targeting those who play fighters, so if you do, you can have best of both worlds. Use Hall Effect sticks which is good. I am planning on picking one up in the future to try it out.

I did have an opportunity to use this controller and while the build quality is solid and having the able to edit the button mapping on the controller was nice. This had a lot of connectivity issues and there were issues where it would just ignore input on the sticks. This has a lot of kinks to fix but it is also plausible I got a dud.

Here's also a good list of other controllers that are wired and at difference price points.

**Other Equipment Choices**

**1. Pedals-** I love my foot pedal and while it seemed pretty awkward at first to use it didn't take long to get accustomed to it. This allows you to again free up your fingers and is a great alternative to using back buttons or a custom controller.  I use this[ \~pedal\~](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08MC4PFHY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which gives you 3 of them. You can map them for jumping, melee, Focusing(which is great for my old man snipers out there, since you don't have to press a stick in) and if you want to be super cheeky. You can also map R-Stick down so you can control recoil with your foot and only use your fingers to adjust for horizontal. It's not exactly perfect though but you can use it as such.

**2. Gyro Aiming**

While you can aim with the PS5 controller using Gyro controls the X-Box requires an additional accessory, the[ \~BIGBIG Won Controller\~](https://www.amazon.com/BIGBIG-WON-Paddles-Controller-Attachment/dp/B0B91WQK8B) attachment which **can only be used** with a default Xbox controller. Does not work with the elite. You also get back pedals so not a bad deal.

**2. Settings**

**Button Layout- Tactical**

I strongly recommend switching to tactical as this replaces your melee (from R-Stick Press) to B (on Xbox Controller) allowing you to crouch and prone with your stick without the need of taking your finger off and maintaining your aim and accuracy. On the flip side, it's slightly harder to melee off of reflex since you have to take your finger off the stick. This can typically be remedied by using back pedals but if you're just using a standard controller and you're going to go full Mike Meyers, then it might not be beneficial to switch this.

**Bumper Jumper**

If you do not want to invest in another control you can use this setting to be able to jump with the bumpers of your controller vs A. What this does, is allow you to keep your finger on the sticks to maintain accuracy and aiming. Takes a little bit of getting used to do, so if you don't have back pedals, this is a good option to look into.

There's a lot of different settings in this game which can you alter and change to improve your game so review Part 2.

➫ After the debate between Trump and Biden, became clear who would be the next president  
  
Why? The debate took place without any prompts or preparation, and Biden couldn't even form coherent sentences...  
  
So, Trump is likely to win

What's this real-world asset tokenization is all about? Here are some crypto projects and tokens to keep an eye on (and money too),ethtrader,1d9gcnu,2024-06-06 07:54:24,10,0.85,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1d9gcnu/whats_this_realworld_asset_tokenization_is_all/,coindoing,Original Content,"Have you kept up with the cryptocurrency rollercoaster?

And it's not just a cool gimmick; it's shaking up the finance world big time. See, the idea is to marry the stability of real-world assets with the cool tech of blockchain and DeFi.

# Recent examples of RWA:

Billionaire Michael Novogratz's Galaxy Digital Holdings recently disbursed a loan of several million dollars, secured by a 316-year-old Stradivarius violin. This is the power of asset tokenization.

Big names like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton are already dipping their toes in this pond, launching their own tokenized funds. Franklin Templeton has launched the BENJI token, while BlackRock has launched the BUIDL token.

And the scope? Oh, it's huge! You can tokenize both tangible items (like gold) and intangibles (like your favorite song). Basically, if it's valuable and tradable, it's fair game.

But why's everyone hyped about tokenization? Well, think about it: DeFi promised to revamp how we swap stuff around, right? Real-world asset tokenization is just extending that promise to everything we trade, making markets more transparent, secure, and fair.

# RWA Challenges:

Now, let's talk about the challenges. First up, regulation. It's like navigating a maze right now. Then there's liquidity, making sure there's enough action in the market. And lastly, education. Not everyone gets the blockchain jargon yet, you know?

But hey, we're making progress! Stablecoins, backed by real-world cash, are already a hit. Gold tokens are also catching up. Even US Treasury bonds are getting token treatment.

And guess what? This tokenization train is just chugging along. By 2030, we're talking about a $16 trillion market! That's some serious cash.

# RWA-related Crypto Projects:

Now, how can you ride this wave? Here is a list of 6 projects (on Ethereum) to keep an eye on (maybe invest in, for long-term gains, not financial advice):

**Chainlink (LINK):** They're the bridge between real-world data and blockchain. My personal prediction is that Link will sit comfortably in the top 5 cryptocurrencies in the future.

**Pendle Finance (PENDLE):** They're all about selling future returns. Pendle is a DeFi protocol that allows users to tokenize and trade future returns. This is a novel approach to tokenization, providing users with a multitude of options to manage their yields.

**Ondo Finance (ONDO):** They're making bond markets more accessible on the blockchain. The Ondo DAO entrusts ONDO token holders with shaping its future, enabling it to continue its mission of democratizing access to institutional-grade finance.

**Polytrade (TRADE):** A one-stop-shop for all tokenized assets. Industry giants Mastercard, Polygon, Alpha Wave, and Matrix Partners support and partner with Polytrade. Using its own RWA-focused ERC-6960 technology, Polytrade enables users to discover, trade, fractionalize, cross-chain bridge, leverage, trade, and simply do more with RWAs.

**TrueFi (TRU):** Through the use of $TRU-governed smart contracts, TrueFi links lenders, borrowers, and portfolio managers in an on-chain credit infrastructure.

**Clearpool (CPOOL):** The first-ever marketplace for institutional liquidity. Institutional borrowers can get unsecured loans directly from the DeFi ecosystem through Clearpool, which is a decentralized capital markets ecosystem.

Phew! That was quite a ride, huh? So buckle up, folks! We're headed into the future, where everything's tokenized, from your grandma's antique teapot to that fancy yacht you've been eyeing. Welcome to the world of finance 2.0! You know what? Ethereum is playing a huge part in the future of finance. EEE: Eventually, Everything will be Ethereum.

An Unnecessary Ode and Euology to Fallout ( TV Show ),Fallout,1c710za,2024-04-18 07:32:13,1,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1c710za/an_unnecessary_ode_and_euology_to_fallout_tv_show/,PreacherVan,Discussion,"  

Oh hey. So this my uncreative review of the series, heavy on spoilers, kind of late to the table, lots of water.

About why it’s in my system and why I need to get it out at all, I’ve been playing Fallout games now and then since the year 2000. Wouldn’t call myself a fan, more of an appreciator. I’ not obsessed with it, it didn’t “change my life/ helped me in the toughest moments/ saved my marriage” or else, I just enjoy the setting and the story, coz I like post-apoc in general, and this is one of the most original iterations of it. Favorite official Fallouts are 2 and New Vegas, but truly favorite Fallouts for me are actually unofficial mod games, Nevada, Sonora, Tales From the Commonwealth and Salt Lake Stories. I mod myself too (In life, I’m a writer and a war photographer, at the moment a bit on the downside of things, hence why I “have” time for this), so the idea of “canon” and “tru” for me is fluid, and really defined by one quality: solid writing. You can sell me a Bambi movie with Gojira in it, if you can justify such a union.

And now on the show. I entered in with the lowest expectations, being ready to*,* at the very least, enjoy it for visuals only, forgetting the story. Watching the trailers and seeing who are guys behind the whole show (pardon my pun), I knew it’s going to go into the general Fallout 4/76 direction, so was kind of mentally prepared for it. Or so I thought. Because it went a tiny bit differently.

I kind of loved the first episode. Even though it’s straight away all but confirmed what’s it going to be and there were parts that were off, overly forced and Hollywoodish, the atmosphere that was built up felt really top, and the story developed in a sort of interesting direction.

Second and third episodes are probably the most misleading, because it suddenly starts feeling like the worst Marvel have to offer, and I was about to actually lose interest in continuing, until the fourth episode hit, with fifth and sixth episodes probably being my favorite. Seven and eight… They did not lost the edge, but let me get back to them later, in a broader way.

First, let’s mention the main characters and some ingredients. Lucy is a nice central engine, she is what she’s supposed to be mostly, and the actress does the good job in showing her “evolution’ from naivety to true grit (Granted, the evolution ain’t over by the first season, but what I’ve seen so far was quite right). I’ve been a fan of Walton Goggins for a very long time, so I don’t think I can be impartial to his performance, yet the Ghoul section sometimes (And kind of often) comes off as someone in the writing team saying “We Really need to show that this guy is a bastard nowdays” in a very unnatural manner (Cannibal moment, as one example). Without these though, I guess his arc, both pre-war and wasteland parts, are my favorite character arcs on the show along with, surprisingly to myself coz I didn’t expect it’s going to be so, Norm, Lucy’s brother. Speaking of ghouls, they are my least favorite visual adaptation from the show. Forgetting Cooper just being Red Skull’s ripoff and the “Malibu’ hair of most of them, they in general are very lazily done. I guess the creators just used the “basically Fallout zombies” line as an excuse to make cheap, generic, modern flick filler zombies to save some money (Lucy’s mother being the only exception to that so far, in quality if not originality ).

Last of the main trio, is Maximus, and he’s “complicated”, just like his “Brotherhood”. If they continued with what was seeded in the first episode, he might have been my favorite on the show, but the character is very uneven, like there were some arguments about where they want to go with him, and those arguments continued till the end of the filming of the first season. On one side, he looks like a tortured, bitter, lost young soul searching for his recognition and place in this world, ready for some sinister and manipulative actions to get there (At first I was convinced he was the one who crippled his only friend’s leg after all), and at the same time, seemingly ready to give up ambitions to experience someone’s kindness, compassion and feel at peace, things he surely was lacking since childhood. And then there’s idiot savant Maximus, whose actions are there either for lowest “Haha, it’s funny, doesn’t matter if it destroys everything we established so far and makes characters look like total morons” type of Marvel humor, or to express naivety, stupidity and detachment from reality that even Lucy, waving her gun to greet a stranger, doesn’t possess. He’s the only character on the show so far who’s really only still alive because of the plot armor, with the furthest he could have gotten to be there any realistic consequences to his actions, is that meeting with the Brotherhood elder, holding a “fake’ Enclave scientist’s head. I guess it’s time to mention “BoS”. Which these guys are definitely not. They are neither Classic Fallout BoS, nor Fallout 3 nor even Fallout 4 version. These guys might sort of pass as an interpretation/ “lost chapter” (I guess they aren’t supposed to be West Coast with their lil prydwens and all) but honestly, they are different enough to be a very weird thing as an introduction to Brotherhood of Steel to a casual viewer. Which is a pity because I actually liked them, I liked those heavy medieval, despotic vibes in them, their theme is one of my favorite pieces of the Show’s score… And I just think, wouldn’t that be nice if they were completely their own thing, or maybe even parasites that rose on the bones of some destroyed Brotherhood chapter…

That flows us into talking about writing, themes. If I would separate the show from its setting and progenitor, it’s a neatly written but greatly uneven modern “Hollywood” series. It has enough smarts and wowness to keep a more fussy viewer going, but at the same time it has so many illogical and forced and just “why” moments too. And that is the problem, when comes to a Fallout adaptation. Someone said in their review that this series has the best story since New Vegas, but the bar set by that game is high, and the bar set by everything that followed is low. You don’t need too much to jump over the story of Fallout 4 or, excuse my language, Fallout Shelter and 76, if you could find stories there. Honestly, in story terms, it’s better than F03 even, but again, that’s not the high bar, and I’m saying it not as a hater of that game. It’s just Bethesda’s Fallout… is not very qualified in that department. Their games are not about stories, themes, they are about atmosphere and sandbox… And this show… Has the best “Bethesda+” story, and at the same time, this show, is kind of a nail to the coffin of the O.G. It goes with a grinder over everything that was before the new IP holders, and it does it in a way that isn’t even “disrespectful” as some would say. “Nukin’” the West Coast lore (And that’s what happened. It’s not about NCR, Legion or whatever other “lil’ things”. It’s everything. The Shady Sands nuke is a very unceremonious jump-over-the-shark kind of macguffin, that is there to give an excuse to do whatever you want there, and everything else might as well never happened. There’s no good story behind it, there’s no justification for it from storytelling point of view, the show’s writing doesn’t use it in that kind of way. Nukes don’t erase the footprints of history so easily, as the nukes that destroyed Fallout world show it very clearly. “The Nuke” that fell on Shady Sands might as well been a spell because nothing on the West Coast resembles anything from F01/2/New Vegas. It does resemble F03/4/onward though. Very clearly) is just a casual banality of business, of the new IP holders and them seeing something artistic as only a brand. There’s no ill or sinister laughter behind it. There’s no meaningful themes. Vault-Tec (Though I’m sure it’s gonna turn out to be Enclave behind them, which doesn’t change anything much, if only making this writing a bit less “thuggysmurfish”-silly) being the evil masterminds, the history being shaped by seemingly “immortal beings” with tentacles in  every major events ala Moldaver, a fella in power armor defeated by a bear, going out of his way to antagonize the only person who can save him, because the plot needs Maximus to wear the power armor… It’s not a bad or lazy writing, not in a literal sense anyway, or hate to Ne Vegas or whatever… It’s just simply, those things don’t matter. Fallout now is a static pulp-fantasy world in a short sci-fi skirt. It’s just a brand. The kind of thing you’d sell in every form, anywhere, from Congo to China, that’s why you’ll omit any mention of it in your story. That's not what Fallout supposed to be, and this is not a ""multiverse of madness"", where every Fallout is ""the right one."" Nobody thinks for some reason, that rewriting ""1984"" as a swashbuckler comedy adventure that you can sell coffee mugs with, will give it justice, or that ""everyone can have their own ""1984"". But I guess someone does think so. And I guess, someone will sell it so one day. And I guess, there’s going to be points about how ""everyone can have their own ""1984"".

So did I like the show? Yeah, I did. Like I would a bottle of Cola on a hot day. And just like that bottle would leave me thirsty, this show also left me empty, thinking about a few things. About corporations, IPs, China, flexibility of public. Fallout show shows that you can kill a mockingbird, tear of its wings, roast it in its screams… As long as you do it in a tight performance, it will be a bestseller. No matter if his singing was a shine on your morning. It’s not like I didn’t know that. It was just a bit of a final drop on the ash pile, which funnily enough, made me cough. But I guess that’s not a part of this “fan” review."

I've recently had the chance to try out the TruGlo 4x32 Rangefinding/Trajectory Compensating Crossbow Scope, a nifty piece of equipment for enthusiastic crossbow users like me. The scope's main highlight was its ability to find the range and calculate the correct trajectory for my crossbow bolts. In my experience, this feature proved to be quite handy in my local archery range, particularly for those days when the wind and temperature were unstable.

One of the things that stood out to me was the scope's robustness. It was designed to handle the harsh conditions of the outdoors, as evidenced by the sturdy aluminum body and the shock-resistant construction. This scope also offered a generous 4-inch eye relief, a feature that helped protect my eyes during those blustery hunting sessions.

The scope's lenses were fully-coated, making them highly resistant to glare, a common concern for crossbow users shooting in low-light conditions. Additionally, the durable leavespring for windage and elevation adjustments were a welcomed bonus, allowing me to finetune my shots with ease.

On the downside, one of the screws on the scope rings was stripped, a minor issue that wasn't a deal-breaker. I also discovered that the scope wasn't rated specifically for a particular crossbow speed. To achieve optimal accuracy, I had to adjust the scope manually, which was a bit tricky and time-consuming.

Regardless of these minor downsides, the TruGlo 4x32 Rangefinding/Trajectory Compensating Crossbow Scope proved to be an essential piece of equipment in my hunting arsenal. Its ease of use, durable construction, and helpful features make it an excellent choice for anyone seeking to upgrade their crossbow hunting experience.

I recently had the opportunity to try out the Killer Instinct Lumix 4x32 Ir-E Crossbow Scope. This black 1021 model was a great addition to my hunting gear, providing exceptional clarity thanks to its multicoated optics and 1-inch mono tube construction. The fast focus eyepiece is a game-changer, allowing me to quickly adjust my sight even when on the move.

One feature that stood out was the illuminated cross-hair reticle, which came in both blue and red. It was perfect for low-light situations, making it easier for me to spot my target. I appreciated the adjustment click value of 0.5 inches at 100 yards, as it gave me accurate and consistent shot adjustments.

However, there were a few downsides to this otherwise great scope. The exit pupil was smaller than I would have liked, making it a bit more challenging to see the cross-hair reticle at times. Additionally, the scope's weight was lighter than expected, which might not have been ideal for everyone.

Overall, I'm happy with my experience using the Killer Instinct Lumix 4x32 Ir-E Crossbow Scope. It's a quality product with some small drawbacks, but its pros certainly outweigh the cons. If you're in the market for a reliable crossbow scope, this one is definitely worth considering.

Over the past few weeks, I've been using the IRAYUSA InfiRay Rico G 384 3X 35mm Thermal Crossbow Scope as my primary hunting accessory. At first, the compact design took me by surprise, but it quickly grew on me as I realized how efficiently I could carry it in my hunting bag. The 1024x768 AMOLED display provides a crisp view, even in low light conditions. The scope's image correction feature made identifying game easier than anticipated, resulting in successful hunts.

Battery life was a concern initially, but the built-in battery, combined with the two field-swappable IBP-2 batteries, provides an impressive 11+ hours of runtime. However, I did find the manual controls a bit cumbersome at times, and I wished for an option to switch between automatic and manual modes. Despite these minor drawbacks, the IRAYUSA has proven itself to be an excellent tool in the field, and I look forward to using it on future hunting trips.

The Explore Scientific ED127 Essential Series Air-Spaced Triplet Refractor is a powerful and versatile tool for any astro enthusiast. With its triplet apochromatic lens system, this telescope delivers crisp, clear images with minimal distortion. The fully multicoated optics and Extra-Low Dispersion glass help eliminate chromatic and spherical aberrations, resulting in stunning views of celestial objects from the Moon to deep sky objects like nebulae and galaxies.

As a reviewer, I spent several nights using this refractor, and I must say it was a pleasure to observe the night sky. The scope's portability made it easy to set up and dismantle, allowing me to grab it and go within minutes. Its adjustable orientation and position, combined with its two-speed rack-and-pinion focuser, made fine-tuning a breeze and ensured a comfortable and enjoyable viewing experience.

In my pursuit of a new spotting scope that could enhance my wildlife viewing and target shooting experiences, I stumbled upon the SVBONY SV28 Spotting Scopes. From the moment I opened the package, I was impressed by its sleek exterior and sturdy construction.

One feature that stood out to me was its range of magnification capabilities - the SV28 allowed me to adjust the magnification according to my target distance, providing crystal clear image quality. The lens was exceptionally sharp, making it perfect for both target shooting and observing nature. Another aspect I appreciated was the ease of focus adjustment, ensuring that every detail was visible no matter the distance.

However, I have to say that the tripod that came with the unit seemed a bit lackluster compared to my usual tripod. I ended up using my own sturdier tripod, but it was still nice to have the option included in the package. Additionally, while the phone adapter was a nice addition, I felt it could have been more user-friendly.

Overall, the SVBONY SV28 Spotting Scopes exceeded my expectations, offering outstanding clarity and exceptional value for its price. Though there were a few minor quibbles, I would definitely recommend it to others in search of a reliable, affordable spotting scope for their outdoor adventures.

The Sky Watcher Esprit Refractor is a versatile and powerful telescope that I've had the pleasure of using for astrophotography. Its 100mm air-spaced ED APO Triplet optics, crafted from top-quality FPL-53 ED and Schott BK-7 glass, have made a significant difference in the clarity and sharpness of my images. The included thread-on doublet field flattener corrects any distortion at the edges, ensuring my shots are crisp from one end to the other.

One of the standout features is the 2.7-inch linear power focuser, which brings celestial objects into perfect focus. The dew shield is also a great addition, retracting to make the telescope 7 inches shorter for easier storage and travel. The accessory selection is impressive, including a 2-inch dielectric diagonal, a 9x erector finderscope, and a Cannon 48mm T-Ring photo adapter.

While the Esprit Refractor has its pros, there are a couple of cons that I've encountered. The first is that the focuser takes some time to get used to and may require some experimentation to find the perfect position for your camera. Additionally, the accessories are of varying quality – some are excellent, while others feel a bit cheap compared to the overall quality of the telescope.

Overall, the Sky Watcher Esprit Refractor has been a reliable and high-performing tool for my astrophotography endeavors. With its top-notch optics, included accessories, and ease of use, it's a great choice for those looking to capture stunning celestial images.

The fully coated optical glass lens provided clear and bright imaging. One of the best features was the fine adjustment lever, which allowed me to effortlessly adjust the viewing position.

The telescope felt sturdy and well-built, made of premium materials. The included smartphone adapter made it convenient to capture stunning images of celestial objects. The star finder quickly located objects and the 45° orthogonal prism displayed the ortho-rectified true color image comfortably.

I also appreciated the adjustable aluminum tripod, which was easy to set up and provided a stable platform for viewing. The travel bag made the telescope portable and easy to store.

When I first took the Night Owl 3X Digital Monocular out for a test run, I was blown away by the ease of use and the incredible image quality it provided. Navigating the various features like adjusting the infrared intensity and digital zoom was a breeze, and capturing crystal-clear pictures and videos right to the microSD card was impressive.

However, despite the impressive features, I soon discovered some downsides to the Night Owl Optics 3X Digital Monocular. The battery life only lasted about 2.5 hours, which I found disappointingly short, especially when I was out in the field for extended periods of time. Additionally, the blurry screen made it difficult to see objects more than 5 feet away, limiting the effectiveness of the monocular.

Overall, the Night Owl 3X Digital Monocular is a powerful tool for night vision, but its limitations in battery life and screen quality make it less than ideal for outdoor enthusiasts who need a reliable and long-lasting tool.

I recently tried out the 70x WiFi Digital Telescope, and let me tell you, it had its fair share of pros and cons. The most noticeable aspect was the 70X manual focus, providing a crisp and clear view of distant objects. The 2MP camera was another standout feature, capturing detailed images and videos seamlessly.

However, there were a few drawbacks. The 50-meter wireless distance limit felt a bit restrictive at times, especially when trying to observe objects from afar. Additionally, the battery life, although decent, could have been longer for extended use.

Overall, the 70x WiFi Digital Telescope was a solid choice for anyone looking to capture and view distant objects, but it could be improved with a few minor tweaks.

When I first got this Amscope telescope for my son, I was surprised at how easy it was to set up. The tripod was sturdy and the adjustment knobs were simple to use. The magnification range was impressive, going from 35x to a whopping 350x! The 3X Barlow lens and two eyepieces really made a difference in what we could see in the night sky.

One thing I really liked about this scope was its light-gathering power. It gathered 100 times more light than our old telescope, making it much easier to spot celestial objects. The 90-degree prism also made it easier to view objects in the sky.

However, there were some cons to this telescope. The eyepieces could have been of better quality, as they were a bit blurry at high magnifications. Additionally, the altitude-adjustment knob on the tripod could have been more precise, making it a bit harder to find objects in the sky.

Overall, the Amscope-kids telescope was a great choice for my son's first foray into astronomy. Its ease of use and impressive magnification range made it a joy to use.

One of the primary factors to consider when purchasing a 3X Scope is the magnification. A 3X Scope typically offers 3 times the magnification of a regular sight. If you require even greater magnification, you may want to consider a 6X or 9X Scope instead. Always ensure that the chosen magnification is appropriate for your intended use, whether it be hunting, target shooting, or competitive sports.

### Durability

The durability of a 3X Scope is crucial, especially in harsh environments or during intense usage. Look for scopes made from high-quality materials such as aircraft-grade aluminum, which provides both strength and lightness. Additionally, check the scope's waterproofing and fog-resistant properties to ensure it performs optimally in any weather conditions.

### Ease of Use

Your chosen 3X Scope should be easy to use and adjust for optimal performance. Consider a scope with a clear, bright, and sharp optical image. Additionally, user-friendly features such as adjustable focus and windage/elevation controls can significantly improve your shooting experience.

### Field of View

The field of view (FOV) refers to the width of the visible area through the scope. A larger FOV is generally preferred for quick target acquisition and better situational awareness. However, a wider FOV may also result in less magnification. Consider your specific needs and choose a scope that strikes the right balance between FOV and magnification.

### Maintenance and Support

A good warranty and customer support can greatly enhance your experience with a 3X Scope. Many manufacturers offer warranties that cover defects or damage, providing peace of mind during your ownership. Additionally, a reputable brand will likely provide comprehensive user manuals, online tutorials, and access to professional technicians should you require assistance with your scope.

In summary, when selecting a 3X Scope, consider factors such as magnification, durability, ease of use, field of view, and maintenance/support. By evaluating these aspects, you can ensure that you make the best possible purchase for your intended applications. Happy shopping!

My latest revision idea for a potential NBCU-WBD merger,MediaMergers,1bjq2s6,2024-03-20 18:12:43,8,0.79,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/MediaMergers/comments/1bjq2s6/my_latest_revision_idea_for_a_potential_nbcuwbd/,BamaLover4life,Merger,"So, I’ve come up with a new idea on how an NBCU-WBD merger would go.

Comcast would purchase most of the movie and TV entertainment assets of Warner Bros Discovery (film, TV, Streaming, gaming) and the DC Comics division. This also includes international networks although some of them will be spun off or shut down. The News division and most of the sports division would be spun off into a separate company and some cable networks from the combined two companies (aka non-core ones) would be either shut down or also sold off. there would be executive changes too and there would be a mix of NBCU and WBD Execs.

Here is what Comcast would purchase:

Movie studios:

Warner Bros

New Line Cinema

DC Studios 

Spyglass Media Group (minority stake)

Television Production:

Warner Bros Television Studios

Alloy Entertainment

Telepictures

Cartoon Network Studios

Williams Street

Food Network 

Motor Trend

Animal Planet

Travel Channel

Science Channel

Investigation Discovery

Oprah Winfrey Network

TBS

TNT

TCM 

Cartoon Network

This also includes all of their international counterparts.

The non-core networks (which are not globally known around the world) will not be included in the merger these include:

Discovery Life

Discovery Family

Discovery Familia

Cooking Channel

Destination America

American Heroes Channel

TruTv

They will all be either shut down, sold off, or spun off into a separate company except TruTV, which would be rebranded into a full-time sports network

Streaming:

DC Entertainment

MAD Magazine

TNT Sports:

Bleacher Report

Living

Rush

6’eren

Discovery Tamil

Kanal 4

Kanal 5

TV5

Kanal 9

Kanal 11

TNT Series

TNT Sports (Latin America and Brazil)

Some of these networks will be shut down or merged into other channels

Here’s what would not be included in the deal and what would be divested to other companies, shut down, or sold off:

CNN Global (This means CNN and all of its international counterparts as well as HLN, with all of HLN’s true crime programming being moved to ID along with Oxygen’s programs)

TNT Sports UK (50-50 venture with BT Group). WBD’s 50 would be sold back to BT Group.

Rooster Teeth (being shut down and certain assets being sold off)

The non-core networks:

Discovery Life

Discovery Family (60% stake possibly sold back to Hasbro).

Discovery Familia

Cooking Channel

Destination America

American Heroes Channel

TruTv

Sports:

Eurosport (most of the networks would be sold or shut down to avoid having a monopoly of sports networks overseas with Sky Sports, some of these channels might even be rebranded into Sky Sports channels)

Golf Digest

TNT Sports UK (50-50 venture with BT Group). WBD’s 50% stake would be sold back to BT Group.

TNT Sports Box Office (50% stake sold back to BT Group)

Global Cycling network

Movie studios:

Warner Bros Pictures Animation (Operations would be merged into Illumination Entertainment)

Television Production:

Warner Horizon Unscripted Television (operations would be folded into Universal Television Alternative Studio)

Streaming:

Discovery+(Discovery+ would be shut down along with Peacock and both services would be merged into Max, with all library content and original programming from the services being moved to Max. Peacock and Discovery+ originals like Super Soul, Kendra Sells Hollywood, Trixie Motel, Conjuring Kesha, Ghost Brothers Lights out, Ghost Adventures: House Calls, Passport to Love, 90 day Journey, The Jack Osbourne collection of series, Bel Air, Ted, Twisted Metal, Shark Academy, Street Outlaws spinoffs, In the Know, Poke Dace, Brave New World Bupkis, Apples Never Fall ,The Congenital, The Best Man Final Chapters, Mrs. Davis, Vampire Academy, Queer as Folk, Joe Vs Carole, Angeline, Wolf Like Me, The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls trip, The Traitors, Love Island USA, Love Island Games, Paris in Love, Vanderpump Dogs, So Dumb It’s Criminal, Couple to Throttle, The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning and many more would all now be branded Max Originals alongside the existing max originals. In addition, Max would be renamed to HBO Max since Peacock doesn’t have worldwide recognition. Max would also inherit all of Peacock’s features like their curated digital linear channels, live coverage of NBC programming, Live sports events, the entire WWE Network Library, 24/7 coverage of the local NBC Affiliates, and more.)

Boomerang (The boomerang streaming service would also be shut down with all programming being moved to Max)

Player.pl

CNNgo app (CNN won’t be part of the merger due to antitrust concerns and possible laws stating that you can’t own two news companies at the same time (CNN and NBC News cannot be part of the merged company at the same time. One of them has to go and that would be CNN) so this is out of the picture.)

International Networks:

Discovery Historia

Discovery History (UK and Ireland)

9Rush

World Heritage Channel

Really

Quest

Quest Red

Canal+ Poland (32% stake sold to Canal+ Group)

TNT Novelas

Discovery World (Latin America)

Raze

Fatafeat

Space

Discovery Home and Health

Golf Channel Latin America

Kutonen (merged into 6’eren)

NewsHub (being shut down in June)

Frii

Cartoon Network HD+ (merged into the main Cartoon Network India channel which would now broadcast in HD full-time)

Home Media:

Warner Bros. Discovery Home Entertainment (operations would be folded into Universal Studios Home Entertainment with Warner Bros. Home Entertainment becoming a brand label to distribute films and shows from the former Warner Bros Discovery).

Warner Bros Theme Parks:

(5% stake of Parque Warner sold back to Parquet Reunidos)

Discovery Destinations

Like I said before, All of those would be either shut down, sold off to other companies, or spun off into their own separate companies Warner Bros World Abu Dhabi and Warner Bros Movie World would either have to be rebranded into Universal Studios theme parks or have the licensing agreement terminated. Six Flags deal with Warner Bros would likely be terminated with all Warner Bros properties being moved into Universal Theme Parks which would probably end their agreement with Marvel at Universal Orlando and characters like Spider-Man and the Hulk would now be in Walt Disney World.

Now here’s what would remain on the NBCU side of the combined company following the merger and what would not:

I still think the combined company would still be called Discovery NBCU would consist of 3 to 4 divisions in the company and would be led by executives from both Comcast NBCU and WBD with Comcast shareholders holding a controlling stake. 

The NBCUniversal Media Group would renamed as the Discovery NBCU Media Group and would serve as the TV networks and streaming division for the combined company and be a successor to the WBD US Networks Group.

Unfortunately, the cost of mobile devices and service plans can be a barrier, creating what's known as the 'digital divide'.

The good news is that various government assistance programs exist to provide free touchscreen phones to those in need. These programs are designed to ensure that all citizens, regardless of their economic status, have access to the essential communication tools of the modern age.

By bridging the digital divide, these programs not only connect individuals to their loved ones but also open doors to numerous opportunities—be it in education, employment, or healthcare. Understanding and accessing these resources can be a game-changer for many, and this guide is here to help you through every step of the way.

# Understanding Government Phone Assistance Programs

In the United States, there are several government programs dedicated to providing telecommunications services to low-income individuals. Two of the most prominent programs are Lifeline and the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). These programs are designed to make communication services more affordable and accessible.

**Lifeline Program:** Lifeline is a federal program that lowers the monthly cost of phone and internet services. Qualified subscribers can receive a discount on individual monthly telephone service, broadband Internet service, or bundled services purchased from participating providers. Eligibility for the Lifeline program is based on either an individual’s income level (at or below 135% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines) or if they participate in certain federal assistance programs such as Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), or Supplemental Security Income (SSI).

**Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP):** ACP is a newer federal program created to help households struggling to pay for internet service. This program offers a discount on monthly broadband bills for qualifying low-income households. Along with the discount on broadband service, eligible households can also receive a one-time discount to purchase a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet from participating providers.

These programs are funded and regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and are part of a larger effort to ensure all Americans have access to communication services. To qualify, applicants must meet certain criteria, which typically revolve around income level or participation in other federal assistance programs.

# Common Questions and Concerns

**1. What is the Quality of the Free Phones Provided?**

**Answer**: The quality of free government phones varies, but most are basic to mid-range smartphones. While they may not have all the features of high-end models, they are generally sufficient for everyday use, including calls, texts, internet browsing, and basic apps.

**2. Can I Upgrade My Free Government Phone?**

**Answer**: Yes, in many cases, you can upgrade your government phone. Some service providers allow you to upgrade to a better model for a fee. The availability and cost of upgrades depend on the provider and the phone model you’re interested in.

**3. Are There Any Hidden Fees or Costs?**

**Answer**: Government phone programs like Lifeline are designed to be free or low-cost. However, it's important to read the terms and conditions carefully. Some providers might charge for certain extras or non-standard services. Always clarify any potential costs before signing up.

**4. How Do I Maintain My Eligibility for the Program?**

**Answer**: To maintain eligibility, you typically need to recertify your status annually. This process involves submitting documentation that proves you still meet the eligibility criteria. Failure to recertify can result in the termination of your service.

**5. How Can I Avoid Scams Related to Free Government Phones?**

**Answer**: Be cautious of offers that seem too good to be true. Apply for a free government phone only through recognized service providers or directly through the official Lifeline or ACP program websites. Never give out personal information to unverified sources, and report any suspicious offers to the appropriate authorities."

**Official FAQ:**

See official [Ultra Mobile FAQ](https://www.ultramobile.com/faq/) and [Terms and Conditions](https://www.ultramobile.com/mobile-plans-terms-conditions/)

**Troubleshooting Guide / Issues with Network/Calling/Messages / What are APN settings?**

If you have no signal, seem stuck on 2G, low bars, or dropped/choppy calls or extremely slow speed, please follow this troubleshooting guide which fixes almost all issues or at least determines the root cause (location, phone, SIM, account).

* If on Android, follow the below, which is more detailed than  [ultramobile.com/setup/android/](https://www.ultramobile.com/setup/android/).
   * Go to Settings then the following to add APN
      * Samsung: Connections > Mobile Networks > Access Point Names
      * Pixel: Network and Internet > SIMs > \[Ultra SIM\] > Access Point Names
      * OnePlus: Wi-Fi & network > SIM & Network > \[Ultra SIM\] > Access Point Names
   * Tap the 3-dot menu in the top-right > *Reset to default*.
   * Add +
   * Name: Ultra
   * APN: Wholesale (make sure W is capitalized)
   * MMSC: [http://wholesale.mmsmvno.com/mms/wapenc](http://wholesale.mmsmvno.com/mms/wapenc) (Some people have used [http://mms.msg.eng.t-mobile.com/mms/wapenc](http://mms.msg.eng.t-mobile.com/mms/wapenc) and gotten to also work)
   * MMS port: 8080 (leave blank if using [t-mobile.com](http://t-mobile.com) in MMSC above)
   * MCC: **Leave as is, never change** : 310
   * MNC: **Leave as is, never change** : SIMs issues starting in 2022 are 240, older ones are 260.  If you try to change it the APN will not save.
   * APN type: default,supl,mms,ia
   * APN protocol: IPv4/IPv6
   * APN roaming protocol: IPv4/IPv6
   * MVNO type: GID (option only on some devices such as Pixel and OnePlus)
   * MVNO value: 756D (option only on some devices such as Pixel and OnePlus)
      * *Save*
* For iPhone you cannot set APN yourself, it should set automatically.
   * Check for carrier update: Settings > General > About > Carrier update
   * Reset Network Settings: Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings (note: you will loose saved WiFi passwords and Bluetooth pairing).  Then do full reboot by powering off and on.
   * If that fails you can bypass automatic APN by going to [unlockit.co.nz/fw/](https://www.unlockit.co.nz/fw/), select Create APN on the bottom, United States and carrier Ultra Mobile or T-Mobile, Create APN, Download Profile, then go to Settings\\Downloaded Profile and Install the profile.
* If you have an older SIM (pre 240 MNC such as 260 MNC), and you want 5G UC access on Android, it is recommended to order a new replacement SIM or eSIM. For Androids only the 240 MNC SIMs have 5G UC access. Apple can get 5G UC bands on older SIMs but will not show the 5G UC logo.
* Try turning Airplane mode on and off.
* Turn 5G off and then back on, for Pixels maybe even leave it off
   * Apple: launch Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data Options > Voice & Data > LTE.
   * Android: launch Settings > Connections > Mobile networks> Network Mode > 4G/3G/2G (auto connect)
   * Android/Apple: After it connects change it back to 5G/4G/3G/2G (auto connect) or 5G Auto.
* Pixel Modem issues: Pixel (especially 4-6a) phones have notoriously bad modems and firmware as it will try to connect to ""faster"" tower/band even when the signal is way worse than a ""slower"" band, causing no/low signal or slow speeds - this affects all T-Mobile carrier customers including Ultra.  You have two work-arounds to this issue:
   * Settings > Network & internet > Adaptive connectivity > Adaptive connectivity Enable/disable
   * Keep 5G off when driving, or even off at all times if you are on the edge of one 5G tower/band's range.
* Log into your Ultra account on the app/site to make sure your account is active and you have 4G/5G data left (""Unlimited"" plan throttles after 40 GB).
* Try reseating the SIM card by taking it out and back in securely.
* Try the SIM in a different device, and/or make sure your device is not just ""compatible"" with Ultra and T-Mobile but is ""fully compatible"" by having all LTE bands, especially [band 71](https://www.tmoband71.com) - see below section ""**What Devices work with Ultra Mobile?""** for checking true compatibility, as the Ultra compatibility checker is not the most accurate.
* Try multiple locations.  Since Ultra runs on T-Mobile there could be a T-Mobile outage in your area so check by using [downdetector.com/status/t-mobile/map/](https://downdetector.com/status/t-mobile/map/) which uses crowd-sourced data from Ookla SpeedTest app and social media to detect outages, or ask neighbors on T-Mobile carriers if they have issues including calling/visiting local T-Mobile/Metro stores.
* Check your coverage area for T-Mobile by following below section ""**Will Ultra work at my location**"" as *actual* coverage area is different than what Ultra/T-Mobile says.
* If the SIM does not work at all in multiple devices and locations the SIM may be bad so you can order a replacement SIM using the Ultra site/app, or contact Ultra support for a free one if site/app order will charge you the normal $10.  Also if you have a Pixel and an older 260 SIM, it is recommended to order a newer SIM or eSIM if you want 5G UC access

**Issue getting/sending MMS/SMS/RCS/iMessage (Android phones)**

* If you ever had your # on iPhone, if iMessage is still set up for you phone # you will not get messages from iPhone users. You will have to deregister you phone # from iMessage by following [https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage/](https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage/)
* Go to *Settings > Network & internet > SIMs > Access Point Names* and tap the 3-dot menu in the top-right > *Reset to default*. and then redo the APN steps in top of this post.
* Try both MMSC and MMS port settings listed in APN settings at the top of this post.
* Clear the app cache for messages app: Settings  > Apps & notifications  > See all 'xx' apps > Messages > Storage & cache > Clear cache > Clear storage.
* On your messaging app settings, go to Settings > Chat features > Turn off RCS and MMS off, then turn back on and verify the #.
* Update person you are having trouble receiving/sending message from/to's contact as *not* Android instead just ""Phone"" or ""Mobile""
* Try different messaging app such as [Google Messages](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.messaging&hl=en_US&gl=US).
* Have any person with an iPhone who you cannot get/send messages from/to do the below troubleshooting steps to fix on their end

**Issue getting/sending MMS/SMS/RCS/iMessage (iPhones)**

* If you ever had your # on Android phone, if your phone # is still registered by Google, you will not get messages from Android users sending RCS or through Google Messages. You will have to deregister your phone from RCS Messages by following [https://messages.google.com/disable-chat](https://messages.google.com/disable-chat)
* Settings > click on the Apple ID > Names, Phone numbers, emails. Make sure your number is set for iMessage.
* Settings, Messages, Send & Receive and ensure that your number is selected and not your email address.
* If an Apple user is having trouble getting or sending messages with you, [turn off iMessages and FaceTime from your phone](https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage/), wait 10-15 minutes, then re-enable it
* If an Android/dumb phone user is having trouble getting or sending messages with you, ensure MMS and Group Messaging is on by going to Settings > Messages >  MMS Messaging \[Slide On\] & Group Messaging \[Slide On\]
* Sometimes Android users try sending you RCS messages which iPhones cannot get.  In which case you will have to have **each person sending you a message do the following**:
   * If they ever had their # on iPhone, if iMessage is still set up for their phone # they will not get messages from iPhone users like yourself. They will have to deregister their phone # from iMessage by following [https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage/](https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage/)
   * Have them clear app cache for messages app: Settings  > Apps & notifications  > See all 'xx' apps > Messages > Storage & cache > Clear cache > Clear storage.
   * On their messaging app settings, go to Settings > Chat features > Turn off RCS and MMS off, then turn back on and verify the #.
   * Update your contact on their phone as *not* Android/Google instead just ""Phone"" or ""Mobile""

**Enabling/Issues with WiFi Calling**

* [Make sure your phone supports WiFi calling](https://www.ultramobile.com/wifi-calling-text/).
* First enable the feature on the Ultra App/Website dashboard including adding your emergency 911 Address by going to Settings > Phone > WiFi Calling.
* Enable it in your phone settings when simultaneously on both a good cellular network connection and on WiFi. If trying to activate overseas, you may be able to do if you are on a VPN to the US, but may need to do *immediately* after a network reset.
* Some phones (especially Pixels) may require you to reset network settings after turning on WiFi calling (warning - you will lose saved WiFi passwords and Bluetooth pairings).  Network reset: From a Home screen, swipe up to display all apps. Navigate: Settings> Reset options > Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth > Reset settings. If prompted, enter the PIN, password or pattern and tap Reset Settings to confirm.
* If having trouble while on Wi-fi calling, VPN and/or modem/router firewall settings may be conflicting so either disable VPN on your phone when doing WiFi Calling/texting, disable WiFi Calling altogether, or disable/tweak your router firewall.
* Software updates and some full reboots may require WiFi calling to be reactivated before use, so you would need to be on both cellular and WiFi and then turn off and turn on WiFi calling in your phone settings, and then you may need another network reset.
* Some models of Androids are ""software locked"" to a carrier, so would need unlocked ROM or otherwise hacked to remove bloatware and allow WiFi calling on all networks.

**Enabling/Issues with Visual Voicemail**

* On Apple make sure there is not a carrier update - Settings > General > About > Carrier update (if available)
* On Android, Disable Visual Voicemail (VVM) in your phone settings
   * From a Home screen, open the Phone icon (Phone by Google app, icon is blue old-school phone on white background).  If this phone icon is not on your home screen, swipe up to display all apps then tap the Phone icon.
      * Note for Samsung phones: There is a [Phone by Google](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.dialer) app and a [Samsung Phone](https://galaxystore.samsung.com/prepost/000004312796?langCd=en) app, you have to open the Phone by Google app to change settings, [get from store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.dialer) if not installed.
   * Phone App > ... Menu icon > Settings > Voicemail > Visual Voicemail.
* Reboot phone
* Dial in to Ultra voice mail 855-616-9530, make sure your password is set and a greeting is selected. You may have to record an actual greeting. After all steps you can later get rid of to go to standard one if you want.
* To reset your voicemail password, type #PWD# on your keypad and hit “Send.”
* Disable Wi-Fi
* Enable VVM in Phone app settings, give it about 5 mins.
* Have someone call you and leave a new message, see if you get notification and VVM.
* Re-enable Wi-Fi
* You can use Phone App/Voicemail to change greeting or go back to a standard one.

Also note that not all Androids support Visual Voicemail on Ultra, and sometimes an OS update will add Visual voicemail support and other times it removes it. The reason is manufacturers don't test all the dozens of combinations of model and OS updates specifically on Ultra (which has its own APN and VV settings) and dozens of MVNOs (would be over 1000 tests a year if they did), just the big 3. This is why [Ultra says Visual Voicemail is not supported on all Android devices](https://www.mintmobile.com/help/how-do-i-set-up-visual-voicemail/), as they cannot control what OEMs do, and you can't complain if it is not supported, and if it is supported is a bonus.  If your native phone app does not support, you can use 3rd party app like YouMail or Google Voice.

**When entering password it says it is incorrect, even though you know it is correct and have already reset it.**

Is your password more than 20 characters? The password setting part of the site lets you type more than 20 character but truncates the password to 20, but password entry doesn’t truncate. So if you set it longer just use the first 20 characters.

**Where should I buy Ultra phones as both a new and current customer? / Does Ultra ship their own phones or use a 3rd party? / Are phones from Ultra locked?**

* You can order from [phones.ultramobile.com](https://phones.ultramobile.com/).  However, these are shipped and fulfilled from a 3rd party [Quality One](https://q1w.com).
* iPhones and Samsung Galaxy phones purchased any of the above ways are locked to Ultra for a year, but other manufactures (Pixel, OnePlus, Motorola) are not locked.
* If you want to return a phone you must return both SIM and phone within 7 days, and fill out RMA form at both [phones.ultramobile.com/RMA.html](https://phones.ultramobile.com/RMA.html)
* You can get a new unlocked or T-Mobile locked phone from a retail store/online or direct from the manufacturer.  You can trade in your old phone for a credit through the manufacturer (Apple, Samsung, Google), or sell your old phone on Swappa/Back Market/eBay/Facebook/etc
   * If you want a new iPhone DO NOT buy from Retail (BestBuy, Target, Amazon, etc) as it will be flex locked to Mint and hard to ever get unlocked, you should get direct form Apple (Store or on-line). Apple will not tell you this but you can finance an iPhone Pro or Pro Max (not standard or SE) using Apple Card and get unlocked, just select T-Mobile when financing and when it askes for account info do ""set up later"". When setting up the new iPhone on screen that says “Transfer your Phone Number” and ask for your T-Mobile phone number and last four of social, DO NOT enter anything and click ""Continue"" at the bottom. You will get a pop up that says “Unable to Verify Account"" click ""Try again” and do this three times. On the third time, under the ""Continue"" button, you get a new option called “Not Now” click ""Not Now"" then ""OK"" then continue the setup as normal. See this video: [https://youtube.com/shorts/1NHGMxulELM?si=jTdQQ7FyRq5yXO\_u](https://youtube.com/shorts/1NHGMxulELM?si=jTdQQ7FyRq5yXO_u)
* You can also buy an used, refurbished, or even new phone on [Swappa.com](https://swappa.com/buy/phones), [Back Market](https://www.backmarket.com/en-us), eBay, Facebook Marketplace, or anywhere else.  Just make sure it is not locked to another carrier (phones locked to T-Mobile post-paid work on Ultra) and is compatible with Ultra/T-Mobile (see below)

**How do I return a Phone and/or SIM from Ultra? How do I get refunds?**

* If you want to return a SIM purchased on Ultra's site, retail location (Target, Best Buy, Amazon) or an activation after a trial fill out return form on your account within 10 days of purchase
* If you want to return a phone from [phones.uttramobile.com](http://phones.uttramobile.com) you must fill out RMA form at [phones.ultramobile.com/RMA.html](https://phones.ultramobile.com/RMA.html) within 7 days of purchase
* If you want to return a phone and SIM combo DEAL, you must do *both* of the above within 7 days of purchase.
* If you missed the 7-day window, DM r/MintMobileAlex after you have filled out the form above with the return ticket information, and explain the extenuating circumstances
* Retail locations (Target, Best Buy) may allow you to return through them but most likely not unless it is damaged and you want an exact replacement.
* After 7 days there is no partial refunds on any leftover months, and renewals after the first activation have no refunds at all.

**What Devices work with Ultra Mobile? / What bands and technologies are required?**

The official way to check for device compatibility is to use the Ultra Mobile app for [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ultra-mobile/id1463041935) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.uvnv.ultramobile&hl=en_US&gl=US) or use the website [device checker](https://www.ultramobile.com/byop/); but those don't give band level detail (some phones may be ""compatible"" with Ultra but may not support all bands so might not get signal in your area) and the 3rd party database of supported IMEIs on the compatibility checker may be out of date. Also note international models are less compatible, for instance even the newest international models of iPhone and Samsung Galaxy do not have band 71, and even though newer Chinese company phones support US 5G bands they still do not support US *5G carrier aggregation band combos* which mean they do not work on 5G in the US.  For best results look up your phone on one or more of the following:

* [GSMarena.com](https://www.gsmarena.com) (expand Network section at top of phone details) or manufacturer website to see what technologies and bands are supported, making sure you look at *EXACT* model including country/region codes.
* [frequencycheck.com](https://www.frequencycheck.com/carrier-compatibility/L6rBL/mint-mobile-united-states/devices) can easily show which T-Mobile/Ultra LTE/4G bands your phone supports (must know the *exact* model #).
* [cacombos.com](https://cacombos.com), an advanced site which for each phone shows 4G/NR(5G) bands and 5G carrier aggregation combos. You would need to check a phone supports both 4G and NR bands to form 5G nBands.

Make sure the phone supports VoLTE and the below bands:

* Required Bands: 2, 4, 5, 12
* Highly Recommended Bands, especially in rural and suburban areas: 66, 71 (if your phone does not support, you will loose over 1/3 the US coverage area)
* Optional bands on former Sprint network (being phased out for 5G use): 25, 26, 41
* Optional newer bands, used in combo Wi-Fi/Cell repeaters in select highly populated areas such as airports, universities, and high-rise apartment/commercial buildings: 46 (RX), 48 (CBRS)
* 5G Bands: n71 (Low-band), n41 (Mid/C-Band), 25/n258, 26/n260 & n261 (mmWave/High-band)

Note that phones locked to T-Mobile should work with Ultra, but make sure your phone is unlocked from other carriers such as AT&T, Verizon, and other T-Mobile MVNOs.  Various IMEI unlock checkers are available online (such as [this one from Swappa](https://swappa.com/imei)), but the best is to check with each carrier especially the carrier the phone was last on.

**What Flip Phones/dumbphones works with Ultra?**

Make sure to get a flip/slide/""feature"" phone with 4G/LTE Band 71, VoLTE, and WiFi calling - those are actually few and far between.

* The best ones are the Nokia 2780 Flip and the 6300 4G.  They supports all bands, VoLTE, WiFi calling, run KaiOS, have email, and come preloaded with (deletable) Facebook, WhatsApp, and YouTube apps.
* The Nokia 2760 Flip also is fully compatible but is only sold locked to TracFone or StraightTalk so you would have to wait out on those networks for 60 days before unlocking and being able to use a Ultra SIM.
* The Nokia 225 4G is a cheaper alternative ($49.99) and will work but is missing band 71 so will not be the best reception in some areas.
* See details on the above phones and buy direct at https://www.hmd.com/en\_us/feature-phones.
* Also check out r/dumbphones for recommendations or to ask advice.

**What is Ultra's coverage and expected speed? Will Ultra will work at my location?**

For the best answer get a 7-Day Trial from [Ultra](https://www.ultramobile.com/trialplan/) (physical SIM or eSIM), [BestBuy](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/ultra-mobile-starter-sim-kit-purple/5706132.p?skuId=5706132), or [Target](https://www.target.com/p/ultra-mobile-starter-sim-kit/-/A-79395435). Retail SIMs costs $2 but get a $5 credit when you sign up from a trial. Note that activating from a trial makes you no longer eligible for promotional prices or referral credit, and you will have to pay taxes and fees, versus if you bought a 3/6/12 month bundle at retail then taxes and fees are included.

Note that Ultra's ""Unlimited"" plan is throttled after 40 GB to a 3G speed of 500kbps, so check your usage and make sure you use less than 40 GB/mo or else Ultra is probably not the best solution for your needs.

Ultra runs on T-Mobile networks so will get the same coverage except it does not get domestic roaming (on AT&T, Verizon, US Cellular, and other small regional carriers such as ACS/GCI in Alaska) that T-Mobile post-paid or pre-paid does.  Ultra is “deprioritized” (on QCI 7) meaning it will get slower speeds than most T-Mobile plans (that are on QCI 6).  How much slower depends on the exact second how many people are on the same tower & band compared to the capacity of the tower/band, but with speeds *usually* between 20-90% of T-Mobile Magenta/Pre-Paid customers at the same time & location. For examples see these [4G](https://youtu.be/fkYZtzOFWko) and [5G](https://youtu.be/hZ84QNSGDHA) Mint (same as Ultra) to T-Mobile Speedtest comparison videos, but your experience may vary. Note that 8-10 MBPS is good enough for 1080p HD video playback so anything more than 10 MBPS is not beneficial for most everyday uses. Check coverage, bands, and speed maps at these crowdsourced locations:

* [CellMapper app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cellmapper.net.cellmapper&hl=en_US&gl=US) (Android only) or CellMapper web based [4G map](https://www.cellmapper.net/map?MCC=310&MNC=260&type=LTE&mapType=roadmap) & [5g map](https://www.cellmapper.net/map?MCC=310&MNC=260&type=NR&mapType=roadmap) - Also shows **individual tower and band map**, useful if your phone does not support all bands.
* [CoverageMap](https://map.coveragemap.com) and select T-Mobile.  Has **speeds** and comparison to other networks
* [OpenSignal App](https://www.opensignal.com/apps) (Apple and Android). Has **speeds, signal**, and comparison to other networks
* [CoverageCritic.com/map](https://coveragecritic.com/map/) - select T-Mobile. Has **signal** and comparison to other networks

""Official"" T-Mobile coverage:

* [ultramobile.com/coverage](https://www.ultramobile.com/coverage/) map comes from T-Mobile and is the ""**theoretical maximum**"" coverage by T-Mobile engineers, does not accurately reflect interference.

**How does Ultra Mobile compare to Carrier X?**

While you can ask in this sub, get a more objective opinion in r/NoContract

**Does Ultra work in Tablets, Laptops, or HotSpot Modem/Routers? Will USB tethering work?**

Ultra officially supports Apple/Android tablets. It unofficially supports Chromebooks and Laptops (Win/Mac/Linux) and HotSpot routers, so should work but Ultra support may or may not help you get it working.  Note on Unlimited plan only 10GB of ""HotSpot"" data is allowed and this data limit applies to all data on tablets, computers, HotSpot modems, routers, or tethering through USB.  Any attempt to ""jail-break"" devices to swap ICCID to get around HotSpot limit is against [Ultra Terms and Conditions](https://www.ultramobile.com/mobile-plans-terms-conditions/) and may result in account termination and device blacklist with no warning or refund. See r/Rural_Internet, [https://www.rvmobileinternet.com/planpicks/?fwp\_data\_plan\_device\_types=hotspot](https://www.rvmobileinternet.com/planpicks/?fwp_data_plan_device_types=hotspot), and [https://cellularinternet.info/plans.html](https://cellularinternet.info/plans.html) for better options for HotSpot device carriers.

**Does or will Ultra Mobile support SmartWatches (Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy Watch)? Can I answer calls/messages to my phone on a SmartWatch?**

Ultra does support ""bargain"" SmartWatches that have a physical SIM slot (not eSIM) but it will have it's own number and not be able to answer phone calls/text from your phone unless connected using Bluetooth.  As for supporting Apple Watches and Samsung Galaxy Watches, see Ultra CTO u/rizwank's [answer as to why it is ""far away""](https://www.reddit.com/r/mintmobile/comments/ezq491/mint_mobile_apple_watch_support/fgu7qpk/) (and see his [update in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/mintmobile/comments/q301ey/any_update_on_apple_watch_support/hg9u8u6/)). In addition to eSIM, Apple/Samsung/Google SmartWatches require OEM to set up carriers on their servers (which it only does for carriers that sell its devices), and in order to have phone and watch share the same phone #, Ultra would need an additional technology called IMS / call path routing, and this technology costs tens of millions of dollars and has only ever been done by mobile networks operators (MNOs) or cable companies, all of which are multi-billion dollar companies much larger than Mnt/Ultra. Basically Ultra will only support if both T-Mobile lets Mint/Ultra use their IMS infrastructure, and Apple/Samsung/Google sets up Ultra on their end.  After T-Mobile buys out Mint & Ultra, this is more likely to happen but not guaranteed as even Metro by T-Mobile does not support and they were purchased by T-Mobile years ago.

If you want to use an AppleWatch with cellular and have Ultra Mobile on your cell, do the following:

* Use an iPhone/iPad/Mac with a different Apple account to [set up Apple Family Sharing](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201088) and invite the apple account your phone is on to join your family group
* Use your family iPhone/iPad/Mac (different from one you want to pair) to [set up the AppleWatch on the same Apple account as your phone and get a TruPhone eSIM for your Apple Watches at $10 a month or $99/yr ($8.25/mo)](https://web.truphone.com/us/about/newsroom/how-to-add-a-mobile-plan-to-your-apple-watch/)
* Set up [conditional call forwarding](https://www.mintmobile.com/help/how-to-turn-on-off-call-forwarding/) (dial \*\*61\*\[new number\]# to turn it on and ##61# to turn it off) from your phone to the new Truphone number (so if you don’t answer on your iPhone, it will then forward the call to your watch).
* Set up Voicemail on the TruPhone line as with call forwarding if you don't answer either the VM would be on AppleWatch line.
* Log into all your apps that you want notifications for on your Watch on the device that set it up, which again must be on a different Apple account then your phone,
* If you want to use ApplePay to pay with your watch, you will need to [Set Up Apple Cash](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207886) and [Set up Apple Cash Family](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211324) and add the Apple account of your phone to Apple Cash Family
* All the above will allow your Apple Watch (even when not in Bluetooth range) to answer calls from your phone line as well as read/send iMessages (*not* SMS/MMS) to/from your phone # and share app usage/data with phone using you Apple account.
* [It is missing some features including most Health Statistics and using ApplePay with credit cards (unless you set up Apple Cash Family per above)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211768#features)
* Outgoing calls/SMS/MMS from Watch would be on a separate line, and you cannot get SMS/MMS on Watch (you can only get iMessages), but other than that would be almost the same functionality as having the same carrier for both but is way cheaper as you can spend less than $25 for both versus minimum $80 to keep them the same carrier (Visible being the only cheap exception).

**Will my phone still get software/firmware updates while on Ultra?**

* For iPhones, Pixels, Motorola, and OnePlus you should get the same updates as on other carriers, might be a few days behind the first people as they postpone to spread download load.
* For Samsung phones since they make customer firmware based on the country and carrier code (CSC code) it depends on the *EXACT* model you have if Samsung releases updates for the unbranded CSC code XAA for that exact model.  The short answer is if your *EXACT* phone model ends in ""U1"" (i.e. SM-G991U1) you will get updates but they might be a month behind major carriers, but if your *EXACT* phone model ends in ""U"" (i.e. SM-G991U) then you will not get updates unless you do one of these three things:
   * Find an active T-Mobile SIM card (borrow from friend, or maybe go to T-Mobile store if they are nice) and stick in your phone and perform a Network reset which will change the CSC code to TMB.  Then request update.  Then swap SIM cards back.  This is the easiest method by far, but you will need to do each time you want an update.
   * Follow instructions online on on how to change your phone CSC code and change to TMB, then request update.  Top google results are [https://www.getdroidtips.com/how-to-change-csc-code-on-any-samsung-galaxy-device/](https://www.getdroidtips.com/how-to-change-csc-code-on-any-samsung-galaxy-device/) or [https://www.droidwin.com/change-csc-codes-samsung/](https://www.droidwin.com/change-csc-codes-samsung/)
   * Look at [xda-developers.com forums](https://forum.xda-developers.com/) on how to install a downloaded official or custom ROM for newer OS.  Download official ROMS from [https://www.sammobile.com/firmwares](https://www.sammobile.com/firmwares) and search for the latest T-Mobile (TMB) or USA (XAA) one for your exact model #. It may matter if the model ends in a U or U1, but is best to install the U1 model to override the U model to make your phone unbranded and get updates automatically. Or use a custom ROM at your own risk.

**Does Ultra charge taxes and fees?  If so what are they?  Can and do these fees change?**

When buying a 3/6/12 month bundle with Ultra from a retail location (Amazon, BestBuy, Target) Ultra eats taxes and fees on the first three months and counts it as marketing expense to get new customers.  However if you sign up direct with Ultra through app/website, as well as all renewing customers, Ultra makes you pay most of taxes as separate line items, but between 5%-40% in cellular taxes Ultra pays on your behalf to governments is still hidden in price as [Federal, state, and local taxes and fees make up 15-45% of all your wireless bills (depending on where you live and which plan you get)](https://taxfoundation.org/wireless-taxes-cell-phone-tax-rates-by-state-2022/) so can be as high as 45% for those living in Chicago or Baltimore due to much higher state and local taxes. However all customers are charged the same taxes and fees, making customers in low tax states like Idaho and Nevada subsidize Ultra's tax payments for customers in high tax cities and states. See [Ultra Terms and Conditions](https://www.ultramobile.com/mobile-plans-terms-conditions/) section 10 for a full breakdown of the *fees* but some *taxes* are separate and not in the terms as tax rates change quarterly but Taxes and fees are usually between 8%-10% depending on plan. The ZIP code you enter and what plans and length determine the tax & fees, and not until you enter this information and almost checkout can taxes be calculated based on the current rate - you still have time to cancel ordering/renewing before paying.

Ultra does change *fees* about once every couple years (usually by less than 20 cents/mo) and does send message out to all its users before increasing its fees.  However *taxes* may increase on next renewal without warning beforehand - complain to elected officials about any increases in taxes.

**What’s the deal with Ryan Reynolds? Mint Mobile? / Who owns Ultra Mobile?**

See announcement [T-Mobile reaches agreement to acquire Mint Mobile](https://www.reddit.com/r/mintmobile/comments/11rw5qv/tmobile_reaches_agreement_to_acquire_mint_mobile/) as a sale of Mint/Ultra Mobile to T-Mobile is pending and should be completed towards the end of 2023.  Mint Mobile (formerly ""Mint SIM"") was started as a subsidiary of [Ultra Mobile](https://www.ultramobile.com/).  Both companies share many technologies and customer support, but they have individual plans and billing and SIMs are not compatible.  Ultra Mobile focuses on more international calls and roaming use and if you frequently call or travel internationally may be a better deal for you, otherwise Mint is cheaper.  Ryan Reynolds bought a minority share of Mint and Ultra Mobile and is Mint spokesperson in many of their ads.

**Who is UltraMobileAllie and why should I contact him/her/them?**

>[Wrapped Luna (WLUNA)](https://www.terra.money/) is an Ethereum token that’s intended to represent Terra (LUNA) on the Ethereum blockchain. It is not LUNA, but rather a separate ERC-20 token that’s designed to track LUNA’s value. WLUNA was created to allow LUNA holders to trade, hold, and participate in decentralized finance (“DeFi”) apps on Ethereum. Through a WLUNA partner, 1 LUNA can be exchanged for 1 WLUNA, and vice-versa.

"A random discovery, or how i torture myself for 2 days listening to EurT.",houkai3rd,17yt5a0,2023-11-19 04:07:33,1,0.56,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/houkai3rd/comments/17yt5a0/a_random_discovery_or_how_i_torture_myself_for_2/,atlc040,Fluff / Meme:Felix-thonking:,"How did this start?

Well i suppose it started last week, you know 11/11, armistice day, or remembrance day or veteran day. But in this subreddit it is known as Elysia's birthday, or more artistically, Elysia simping day. 

I never liked Elysia. The only perfection is fakery, and everything about her feels fake, even her birthday feels ""chosen"" rather than natural. 

And her image song ""TruE"", its a mediocre song, even the lyric doesn't makes sense.... 

Wait.... why is the E capitalized? Now... I want... need to find out why.

Is it reversed? Eurt, well, the only entry for Eurt is from urbandictionary which is obviously True spelled backwards. So that is a dead end there....

But what about swapping the capital letters?

The word Erut, which is not an English word, but is there another language which this is a word?

On wiktionary, there is actually an entry for Erut:

Old Irish: Erut or Airut: Second person singular of Ar. 

Ar, ""Because of"",  So in Old Irish Erut means ""Because of you"", that is the same name as her short. (and while i was looking up stuff on old irish. I noticed that Fischl is probably adapted from the Old Irish word for Raven : Fiach)

Airut is also Finnish for messenger, curious...

And now i am wondering are there any more secrets in the song. Could there be... Backmasking. 

Backmasking means hiding a message in an audio that will only be heard when the audio is reversed. So how to reverse a MP3, MP3 files are divided into frames, each frame contains roughly 0.026 seconds of audio. Each frame is self-contained and can be played by a MP3 player. So to reverse a MP3, I will need to reverse the orders of the frames. But programming language does not read a file as frame, it reads a MP3 byte by byte, so i will need to write a program that examine each header and calculate the byte of the frame based on FrameSize = 144 \* BitRate / SampleRate + Padding, read every frame and reorder them... time to start coding...NAH TOO LAZY

I opened Audacity to reverse a TruE (ED version) mp3, so i guess it is call EurT?  

And i proceed to force myself to listen to this monstrosity for 2 days, and now i am going crazy, i think i hear something, but maybe i don't. But here is the audio, maybe you can make something out!!!!

[https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mrin6jfhjtdlfs7x8traj/TruE-Ed-Ver.-\_Reversed.mp3?rlkey=kvxoqfnh6k2p95s79nc772xnr&dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mrin6jfhjtdlfs7x8traj/TruE-Ed-Ver.-_Reversed.mp3?rlkey=kvxoqfnh6k2p95s79nc772xnr&dl=0)

P.S. I don't really hate Elysia, i just need to build a story on why i tortured myself for 2 days listening to this.

# A Necromancer Called Gam Gam by Adam Holcombe

""Because cozy-feeling necromancer SFF is another thing I never thought I needed""

\~ Kerstin Espinosa Rosero

""Because nobody else can make you feel this protective over undead and alive characters at the same time.""

\~ The Shaggy Shepherd

I recommend a Necromancer Called Gam Gam

# Blood Over Bright Haven by M. L. Wang

# Children by Bjørn Larssen

Dark humor combine with brutally stark character portrayal.

\~ Angela Boord

Imagine you are a son or daughter of gods: self-involved, uncaring, selfish gods who either ignore you completely or use you for their own ends. Now read Children--if you dare.

\~Marian L Thorpe

Children turns familiar myths on their head, defying expectations whilst staying true to their source. If you enjoy Nordic mythology and prefer your fantasy on the grimdark side, Larssen’s distinctive voice is likely to appeal to you.

\~ Tim Hardie

# Curse of the Fallen by H. C. Newell

""Classic dark fantasy with a modern take that reminded me of The Witcher and Skyrim!""

\~ Sadir S. Samir

# Legacy of the Brightwash by Krystle Matar

A masterful piece of character-driven fantasy in a gritty Victorian-inspired setting.

\~ Angela Boord

Legacy of the Brightwash has one of the most well realized characters I've read in a long time. It's dark as hell and deeply, wonderfully and horrifically human all at the same time.

\~ C.M. Caplan

I love this one because the writing is gorgeous, there's an intriguing murder mystery, and it is Gaslamp/Victorian Grimdark, so yeah that's awesome, right!? Also some of the best characterization and deeply personal interactions you will find in a fantasy book.

\~ Nick Borelli of Out of This World SFF

""Grimdark gaslamp with romance! A dark story showing both the best and worst of humanity with incredible characters that step out of the pages.""

\~Tru Skies

""Characters you love from the first page facing wonderfully real dilemmas in a gritty, fascinating world. Plus stunning, evocative writing and all the emotional trauma.""

\~ CM Debell

[https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08S3M3J9K](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08S3M3J9K)

# The Many Shades of Midnight by CM Debell

""I loved this book. Rich environmental themes and stunning writing marry well to create a captivating plot, but it's the characters that really blow me away. This is a story that breathes on and off the page.""

\~ Sarah Chorn

[https://www.amazon.com/Many-Shades-Midnight-C-Debell-ebook/dp/B0BQCNLDX8](https://www.amazon.com/Many-Shades-Midnight-C-Debell-ebook/dp/B0BQCNLDX8)

# The World Maker Parable by Luke Tarzian

""Dark fantasy at its darkest and most mind twisting. Otherworldly in tone and setting, this book takes you on a trip that will blow your mind. Emotional, stark, beautiful prose, this is a novel that takes hold of you and won't let go.""

\~ Nick T. Borelli

\~ H. C. Newell

[https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0BBXWQD3R](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0BBXWQD3R)

# A Quiet Vengeance by Tim Hardie

""Quiet? I’d say it's simultaneously dark, escapist, fascinating, elegant, visceral, and entertaining. One of my favourite reads of the year so far. Also: NIMSAH.""

\~ Bjørn Larssen

[https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0C1NR6D7P](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0C1NR6D7P)

# A Thousand Li: Books 1-3 by Tao Wong

This one is a classic cultivation fantasy, where we follow a young protagonist as he was taken from his village and ends up joining a sect of cultivators. Wong does an excellent job of making the genre accessible for westerners. Again, the characters are what truly shine in this one, though the setting is also excellent.

\~ Calvin Park

[https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B091D9CZCY](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B091D9CZCY)

# Burn Red Skies by Kerstin Espinosa Rosero

""Burn Red Skies has one of the most incredible takes on dragons I've ever seen. Besides that (and airships) it has an incredibly compelling cast of characters that come from a very diverse array of backgrounds. It's great to see them all come together in the end.""

\~ Christopher Warman

""Rosero’s writing has a distinctive style that’s all her own and she should be on everyone’s radar in the world of fantasy literature.""

\~ Tim Hardie

[https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08MYVM54X](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08MYVM54X)

# Children of the Dead City by Noor Al-Shanti

No one actually recommended this, but after asking so many other awesome authors to put their books up for sale I figured I'd offer my epic fantasy standalone up as well.

\~ Noor Al-Shanti

[https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07SSMQ7BL](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07SSMQ7BL)

[https://www.kobo.com/ca/en/ebook/children-of-the-dead-city](https://www.kobo.com/ca/en/ebook/children-of-the-dead-city)

# Daughter of the Sun by Amanda Auler

""The story is not what it seems, and once you finish, you will immediately want to turn around and read it again!""

\~ Angela Boord

[https://www.amazon.com/Daughter-Sun-Mothmar-Amanda-Auler-ebook/dp/B0B833T727](https://www.amazon.com/Daughter-Sun-Mothmar-Amanda-Auler-ebook/dp/B0B833T727)

# Flesh Eater by Travis M. Riddle

This one starts as a heist story and becomes one part romance and one part redemption story. I think the thing I loved the most about it was the characters, and especially the MC. Riddle has a way of writing characters that feel like someone from the next apartment over, and I love it.

\~ Calvin Park

[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LMSGFDB/](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LMSGFDB/)

# Of Thieves and Shadows by B. S. H. Garcia

I recommend Of Thieves and Shadows by B. S. H. Garcia

\~ H. C. Newell

[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BS6B9PRM](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BS6B9PRM)

# Queens of the Wyrd by Timandra Whitecastle

This book was simply amazing and great fun. You can't beat a band of aging shield maidens going out on one last epic adventure! Cannot recommend enough!

\~ Lyra Wolf

THE Thor: Ragnarok-inspired Viking mum fantasy you have been looking for. Half-giant Lovis just wants to raise her daughter in peace, but when fellow shieldmaiden Solveig arrives to put the warband back together, Lovis can't say no. Cue Ragnarok. This book is written with vivid attention to detail, a fantastic grasp of military history, and immersive, thrilling battle scenes which create a feast for the imagination's eye. Add in the brisk pacing, and this is probably the closes thing you'll get to reading an action movie this year!

\~ Suzannah Rowntree

[https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B094DVFPBJ](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B094DVFPBJ)

NOTE: only on sale from Aug18th-20th, so grab it fast!

# Shadows of Ivory by TL Greylock

""Shadows of Ivory by TL Greylock is an awesome adventure fantasy that's basically Indiana Jones with a conscience meets Lord of the Rings with a dash of Assassin's Apprentice.""

\~ Virginia McClain

[https://www.amazon.com/Shadows-Ivory-Godforged-Chronicles-Book-ebook/dp/B08BS251QL](https://www.amazon.com/Shadows-Ivory-Godforged-Chronicles-Book-ebook/dp/B08BS251QL/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Shadows+of+Ivory&qid=1662155124&sr=8-1)

# Spit and Song by Travis M. Riddle

Wonderful stand alone fantasy adventure with non traditional races and a sub theme on the struggles of being an artist.

\~ D. P. Wooliscroft

Emotional, character-driven fantasy. Two broken people set out to better their lives and end up finding friendship.

\~ Calvin Park

Great story exploring themes of friendship and imposter syndrome.

\~ Steven McKinnon

[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZC9F4Y2](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZC9F4Y2)

# The Blood Tainted Winter by T L Greylock

An absolutely amazing vision of Ragnarok.

\~ Clayton Snyder

I loved her norse-inspired trilogy ...which is out as a box set called Song of the Ash Tree!

\~ Timandra Whitecastle

[https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0166PLKL0](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0166PLKL0)

# The Brightest Shadow by Sarah Lin

Sarah Lin's The Brightest Shadow is an absolute blast- it's existentialist epic fantasy mixed with a heavy dose of wuxia. It's filled with fascinating cultures, fast paced fights, and highly memorable characters.

\~ John Bierce

[https://www.amazon.com/Brightest-Shadow-Sarah-Lin-ebook/dp/B0856ZMG9Z/](https://www.amazon.com/Brightest-Shadow-Sarah-Lin-ebook/dp/B0856ZMG9Z/)

\~ H. C. Newell

[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09N2534ZP/](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09N2534ZP/)

# The Wrack by John Bierce

Intricate worldbuilding and a realistic, if not terrifying, depiction of a disease spreading through a country lends itself to a uniquely-crafted tale.

\~ Travis M. Riddle

[https://www.amazon.com/Wrack-John-Bierce-ebook/dp/B086WLH8TW](https://www.amazon.com/Wrack-John-Bierce-ebook/dp/B086WLH8TW)

# Blood Bounty by Liza Street

I have a special love for Blood Bounty, by Liza Street. It's a dark historical fantasy with a weird wild west vibe, and I don't think I've ever read anything else quite like it. Vampires and gunslingers apparently go together well!

# Burning Bright by Melissa McShane

Men and women with superpowers in an alternative Regency England? It should surprise no one that I love this book. There are dangerous pirates, a dashing Royal Navy captain, a female heroine who chooses danger and adventure over the constraints of an arranged marriage... plus badass magic. I love how Elinor's power is perceived as both incredibly valuable and highly dangerous, which adds richness and complexity to the magic of this series.

# Fortune's Fool by Angela Boord

Wonderful character-driven story with excellent world building.

\~ Quenby Olson

A fascinating world with deep characters, split across two timelines that complement and enrich each other in great ways that keep you hooked on the story the entire way through.

\~ Travis M. Riddle

This is a fantastic sweeping epic romantic fantasy with lush world-building and engaging characters. If you like big epics, deep characters, and a world you can really get immersed in, this is right up your alley.

\~ Carol A. Park

A fantastic romantic fantasy with incredible world building and utterly compelling characters.

\~ Krystle Matar

A stunning and sprawling nonlinear narrative that manages to make first person feel epic, viscerally compelling, and personal in a cocktail I haven't seen since Robin Hobb.

# The Fire in the Glass by Jacquelyn Benson

The Fire in the Glass, by Jacquelyn Benson, is an intriguing Edwardian fantasy mystery which follows a Cassandra-esque prophetess trying to catch a serial killer. Its historical research is superb, and I particularly enjoyed the realistic portrayal of the time period's mediums.

\~ Olivia Atwater

An epic historical fantasy mystery set on the eve of World War I. Lily Albright has a gift - she sees visions of the future - but can she fight fate to save the lives of those she loves? I really loved watching Lily accept and level up her powers, and the sense of coming doom and supernatural conflict surrounding the looming World War I was delightfully epic, plus there was an achingly tender romance.

# Leveled up Love: A Romantic Comedy by Tao Wong & A. G. Marshall

A gamelit romantic comedy, was absolutely delightful from start to end. Zack Moore is trapped in a dating sim that forces him to clean up his life and date women in order to earn gaming time. But as Zack is about to learn, true love can't be reduced to an algorithm. This is not just an addictive story with characters who'll win your heart despite all their flaws, it also pulls no punches when confronting the protagonist with the consequences of his actions. I ADORED the epic character arc in this book as Zack goes from zero to hero.

# The Crew by Sadir S. Samir

""A highly entertaining fantasy comedy with an unrelentingly wacky sense of humour that perfectly hit the mark for me.""

\~ Phil Williams

“The Crew is a fast-paced, action-packed story with a team whose members possess the glorious disfunctionality of The Guardians Of The Galaxy characters and a leader whose personality, humour and even some parts of his backstory resembles Deadpool’s.""

\~ Mitriel Faywood

[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BG1CBSRY](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BG1CBSRY)

# The Temptation of Dragons by Chrys Cymri

Delightful. Vicar White attends to ho-hum church duties while on the side she ministers to creatures in a parallel world that she can access only through Morey, a smart-mouth Gryphon who's also a fundamentalist Christian. White is a liberal.

\~ Gloria Piper

# Why Odin Drinks: Humorous Norse Mythology Retelling by Bjørn Larssen

Some of it is just plain funny (even though I like celery.) Some of it is dark humour, a satirical comment on the world. I loved it.

\~ Marian L Thorpe

Larssen appears to be on a path to inheriting the esteemed Terry Pratchett's throne as the best fantasy satirist to-date.

\~ P. L. Stuart

The kind of book where you find yourself reading out your favourite passages to whoever happens to be sitting nearby, whether they asked you to or not! I’m not sorry.

# A Gamble of Gods by Mitriel Faywood

""Super ambitious debut novel that mixes both Fantasy and Sci-Fi and gave me vibes of both Indiana Jones and The Mummy!""

\~ Sadir S. Samir

""It’s an exciting, imaginative, and well-written debut that feels different to the kinds of story I’ve read before.”

\~ Mark Lawrence

“A book spanning so many genres—science fiction, high and low fantasies, comedy, romance—could easily have become an unfocused mess. But Faywood pulls it off brilliantly, making A Gamble of Gods a joy to read. So, grab yourself a big vat of popcorn to munch on as you enjoy this blockbuster debut.”

# On Lavender Tides by Travis M. Riddle

If you love Pokemon and want Pokemon with a twist in a secondary world with characters that feel like they're the still-maturing young adult from the apartment next door, then this is one you'll enjoy. I thoroughly enjoyed the Pokemon-esque aspects of the Jekua in this tale, and Riddle's slow, meandering coming-of-age worked for me.""

# Sand and Storm by Stella Dorthwany

Sand and Storm by Stella Dorthwany is the romantic fantasy you'd get if you mashed up Harry Potter with Indiana Jones and The Mummy. Faryn, an intern archaeologist, is swept up into an adventure with a professor also known as Heartbreaker of the Year. Meanwhile her cousin Cora, a mage in an arranged marriage, is about to uncover a sinister magical plot. This story is packed with adventure, magic, wit and had me laughing out loud on every other page!

# Sapience: A Collection of Science Fiction Short Stories by Alexis Lantgen

Sapience is a fascinating collection of sci-fi short stories. It features a variety of stories that range from gritty and thought-provoking to futuristic fairy tales. Among my favorite stories is Chrysalis, the tale of a woman stranded in a broken vehicle on Europa's surface. It has such an unexpected, almost poetic ending, and that ending then weaves itself into the stories that follow. I also really loved The Last Bird and Swan, two related stories about mechanical birds that manage to be both tragic and uplifting.

\~ Sarah Mensinga

[https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07N74LCGH](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07N74LCGH)

# Saints and Curses: A Collection of Fantasy Short Storiesby Alexis Lantgen

This book is a strong follow up to Sapience, Alexis Lantgen's first short story collection. I'm a particular fan of The Lost Cat, a unique vampire story, and Braids, an interesting tale of feminine power and magic. I'd also love to see more stories about Nikolas, a creative, demon-hunting take on St. Nicholas. Alexis balances light & darkness well in this charming, thought-provoking collection.

How TrueFi's Credit Model Facilitates Uncollateralized Lending with TRU,u_OnchainReport,11rtai1,2023-03-15 07:12:29,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_OnchainReport/comments/11rtai1/how_truefis_credit_model_facilitates/,OnchainReport,," While [$TRU](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TRU&src=cashtag_click) and [$TUSD](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TUSD&src=cashtag_click) may be used in conjunction with each other in certain contexts, they are not directly related and serve different functions within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. 

 [$TRU](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TRU&src=cashtag_click) is the native token of the TrueFi protocol, providing uncollateralized lending to businesses and individuals on the Ethereum blockchain through smart contracts and off-chain credit assessment, offering more flexible lending options. 

 [$TUSD](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TUSD&src=cashtag_click), or TrueUSD, on the other hand, is a stablecoin that is designed to provide a stable and reliable cryptocurrency pegged to the value of the US dollar.  TUSD is compliant with US regulatory requirements, such as anti-money laundering and KYC regulations. 

 [$TRU](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TRU&src=cashtag_click)'s utility includes governance, staking, and liquidity provision, offering rewards and incentivizing participation in TrueFi's lending pools. 

 [$TRU](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TRU&src=cashtag_click)'s tokenomics include a burn mechanism and partnerships with well-known DeFi projects like Chainlink and Uniswap, helping to increase TrueFi's visibility and provide additional liquidity options for [$TRU](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TRU&src=cashtag_click) holders. 

 TrueFi's community-driven approach to governance ensures that the platform's development and growth are aligned with the interests of its users."

TRU is the native token of the TrueFi protocol and is used for: TrustToken holders ultimately have a say over who is a credible borrower in the prediction market. TRU gives the holder the ability to rate credit for third parties. Through TRU credit rating, a permissionless system of credit can be built which operates purely through incentives. TRU owners have part ownership in building a new credit system."
Bitcoin and Ethereum rose in Thursday morning trading.,ASTL_Token,11fx6j3,2023-03-02 03:11:38,6,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASTL_Token/comments/11fx6j3/bitcoin_and_ethereum_rose_in_thursday_morning/,ASTL-Token,,"Bitcoin is up 2.11% over the past 24 hours to $23,639, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Ether rose 3.57% to $1,663 on the week, up 1.24%.

Polygon rose 4.52% to $1.25. On Wednesday, the blockchain platform launched Polygon ID, a product based on zero-knowledge proofs (ZK) technology that allows users to issue verifiable credentials without revealing personal information. Litecoin rose 4.21% to $97.74. On Tuesday, crypto intelligence company IntoTheBlock reported that about 53% of Litecoin holders are making a profit, up from a low of less than 15% in 2022. Litecoin replaced Shiba Inu as the 10th largest volatile cryptocurrency by market capitalization and gained 2.76% in a week.

The total capitalization of the crypto market has grown by 1.57% over the past 24 hours to $1.08 trillion. And the total trading volume over the past 24 hours increased by 13.91% to 48.60 billion US dollars.

China's February manufacturing activity data, released on Wednesday, returned to a nearly 11-year high, reflecting the country's lifting of the Covid zero policy and offering signs that the world's second-largest economy could help lift global trade and investment. However, US stocks closed broadly lower on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was virtually unchanged with a 0.02% drop, the S&P 500 fell 0.47% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.66%. Inflation and the interest rate policy of the Federal Reserve remain in the spotlight in the US. Reuters reported that there is discussion among Fed officials about whether more or less rate hikes are needed, and holding rates higher for longer is a more appropriate policy to bring down inflation and secure a soft landing for the economy. Recall that the Fed set US interest rates in the range of 4.5% to 4.75% in February, the highest since October 2007.

The little-known $TRU cryptocurrency has risen in price by almost 60% in a week after a massive crypto whale amassed about $1.18 million worth of it. Although the current market capitalization of this token is below the $100 million mark. The crypto whale bought 7.32 million TrueFi tokens ($TRU) worth about $500,000 on leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance earlier this week, according to data from blockchain monitoring service Lookonchain. Blockchain data shows that more than 17.6 TRU tokens were bought in the last week, worth more than $1.18 million. TrueFi is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that aims to provide unsecured loans to its users through a peer-to-peer mechanism. The platform assesses the borrowers' eligibility for loans using its own credit scores, thereby eliminating the need for a third party to repay a loan. Unlike traditional DeFi lending protocols that rely on over-collateralized lending, TrueFi provides borrowers with predictable loans, allowing lenders to earn attractive returns. According to Coinbase, the long-term goal of the platform is to create an automated, market-driven credit score and lending protocol.

The TrueFi platform has multiple features, including an exit anytime feature that allows them to provide loans without a lock-up period, competitive returns on many assets, and default protection with the TrueFi Secure Assets Funds for Users (SAFU) and staking mechanism. As a result of the accumulation of the whale, its price has increased by more than 57% over the past week. The cryptocurrency is up over 133% in the last 30 days and over 258% year to date. Prior to the whale accumulation, some analysts believed the price surge could be driven by news that Binance would mint hundreds of millions of dollars worth of TrueUSD (TUSD) stablecoin after the New York City Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) ordered Paxos to stop minting Binance's BUSD token last month. However, the TRU price spike could be the result of confusion as TrueUSD appears to no longer be owned by Archblock, the company behind TruFi (formerly TrustToken). In 2020, Rafael Cosman, co-founder of Archblock, announced that ownership of TUSD is moving to an Asian consortium that will partner with Tron to design and develop the product."

Arris G36 Cable Modem / WiFi Home Network / TrueNas running Plex Issues -- Port Number trouble,HomeNetworking,zuhu66,2022-12-24 15:18:01,1,0.6,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/zuhu66/arris_g36_cable_modem_wifi_home_network_truenas/,showcasefloyd,,"Hey there,

So I'm not all that well versed in home networking which is why I'm looking for some trouble shooting help. I guess I know just enough to get myself in trouble. Anyhow, I recently purchased a new Arris G36 Cable Modem/WiFi Router Combo for my home and I'm having issues. Before this I was on a NetGear C7000 Modem/WiFi Router which never had any issues but was not giving me good speeds anymore, so I wanted to upgrade.

Everything works well except when I try to access any services running on my home Nas that happend to have a port number attached to the IP address. I'm running TruNas and use it mostly for Plex and backing up files. The Nas is connect to my Modem Router via an Ethernet cable, but the rest of the computers in our home are on WiFi.  Anything hardwired with an Ethernet connect works fine.

So now to the point. My Plex server runs on my home network at [192.168.0.99:32400](https://192.168.0.99:32400) (the standard Plex web interface). But nothing I change or try in the Modems Admin interface allows me to connect to it this way. It's being blocked somewhere for some reason, but I have no indication where or why. Because it will work when I restart the Jail on the TrueNas Server that Plex is running in. In then stops again if I reboot the machine I'm using or change Wi-Fi network I'm connect to.

What could cause such odd behavior.

Thanks in advance."

I bought the 16 day plan. When it says unlimited internet for 16 days…is it truly unlimited or “unlimited” until I’ve used 15GB? 

Or is it unlimited for 16 days and then I have 15GB of data to use after the 16 days? 

And what does it mean by free wifi? Does the carrier True have different wifi hotspots around Thailand?"
"[Reality TV] The rise and fall of To Catch a Predator, and how Chris Hansen scammed fans and completely ruined his reputation",HobbyDrama,zf5q52,2022-12-07 11:31:56,7705,0.98,340,https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/zf5q52/reality_tv_the_rise_and_fall_of_to_catch_a/,PlsNope,Heavy,"(cw: grooming, suicide)

# What is To Catch a Predator?

Doubtlessly if you've been on the internet anywhere from 2006 to about, well, now, you're at least aware of To Catch a Predator's existence on the surface. Most notably from the [Chris Hansen meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/people/chris-hansen) of him telling people to ""take a seat"". 

To Catch a Predator (or TCAP for short) was a recurring segment on the news show Dateline NBC. Originally titled [Dangerous Web](https://to-catch-a-predator.fandom.com/wiki/Bethpage,_Long_Island), the show was about the simple concept of setting up dates online for sex with men who thought they were illegally meeting a minor, when in reality these minors were adults posing as children in 2000s chatrooms on places like AOL and Yahoo. These volunteers were part of the watchdog group ""Perverted Justice"" (and the sketchy story of that vigilante group, their origins, their forums, and their eventual collapse is a whole other topic I can't get into here) that NBC paid as consultants to do the online decoy work and collect evidence. 

The men chatting with the decoys would arrive at the sting house after confirming their intent to have sex only to be met by Dateline correspondent Chris Hansen who would conduct a brief interview questioning them on their illegal actions and motives before revealing the operation to be a hidden camera sting—usually causing the suspected predator to flee immediately.

The first two investigations were done without law enforcement and so the men would simply leave the house afterwards, though Perverted Justice would give the evidence they collected to law enforcement after the investigation leading to the prosecution of some of these men, most notably [Rabbi David Kaye](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/bethesda-synagogue-grapples-with-presence-of-rabbi-convicted-of-sex-crime/2012/10/26/a6549984-1a0c-11e2-aa6f-3b636fecb829_story.html) who has been in and out of prison ever since. The third investigation in Riverside, California was the first one to feature a parallel investigation with law enforcement, leading to the arrest of an astounding fifty two men over three days on their way out of the sting house after their interaction with Chris Hansen. 

To Catch a Predator proved to be a monumental hit for NBC, quickly becoming Dateline's most viewed recurring segment and leading to a spin-off show, *Predator Raw*, as well as countless reruns and marathons on MSNBC. Numerous opinion essays and thought pieces were written about this new cultural behemoth ranging from high praise to harsh criticism to everything in-between. TCAP was parodied in [South Park](https://youtu.be/RbnyRgbANHc), [Arrested Development](https://youtu.be/-UJwzudybj8), and even in the opening segment of the 2006 Emmy's hosted by Conan O'Brien with a cameo by [Chris Hansen himself](https://youtu.be/PiLzHh4ixlY). 

Some media critics and journalists criticized TCAP for being so sensationalized and being [more entertainment than news](https://archives.cjr.org/feature/the_shame_game.php?page=1). Charlie Brooker, creator of the television show *Black Mirror*, wrote a scathing article attacking TCAP for alleged entrapment and the questionable nature of [airing these men on national television when they haven't been convicted of a crime at the time](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/may/31/features16.theguide6). Charges were dropped against some men in the Fort Myers sting after Perverted Justice refused to hand over a copy of their hard drive when a judge ordered them to, claiming that the hard drive crashed and was disposed of—leaving an open question to many about the reputation of the group. Still, the show was a cultural phenomenon and undeniably captivating television. 

## The Downfall and Cancellation of TCAP

Things started to really unravel for Dateline during a sting in Murphy, Texas. First, there was heavy pushback from the local community when they learned the sting was in the town including an old man saying [""Don't mess with Murphy!""](https://youtu.be/EbrbO8TWfHo) at a town hall which became a meme in the TCAP fandom. 

Second, and most importantly, was the issue of Louis Condrat. Louis Condrat was the assistant DA of the neighboring Kaufman County at the time of the Murphy sting, and he surfaced chatting with a Perverted Justice decoy posing as a 13 year old. Condrat allegedly claimed to be a 19 year old teenager during these conversations, engaged in sexually explicit chat, and sent the decoy naked pictures found online portraying them as though they were of himself. Perverted Justice claimed that Condrat was deleting his social media accounts like MySpace leading them to believe he was trying to cover his tracks and had become aware of Dateline being in the area, prompting law enforcement to go to his home to arrest him before he could destroy evidence or flee, with Chris Hansen and a camera crew right behind them to film the whole thing. 

Here is where things get murky. Dateline alleges that they didn't want to capture the arrest at his home, with Chris Hansen claiming that it would be ""more compelling television"" if they had arrested him at his office instead of his house. The warrants for Condrat's arrest and for the search of his home were signed at 2 P.M., but neighbors say Dateline and police were [loitering in the area hours before since the early morning, seemingly waiting for the warrants to be signed](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a3271/predator/). Also, Chris originally lied and said Perverted Justice wasn't with Dateline and himself when they went to Condrat's house, but relented and said they might have been when an interviewer proved at least one member was.

Realizing he was home, a SWAT team entered Condrat's home with a Dateline camera crew not too far behind. Officers were met by Condrat himself holding a handgun in a hallway in the house. He told the officers he wasn't going to hurt anyone and then shot himself in the head. [He was pronounced dead from his self inflicted gunshot wound shortly after.](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna15592444)

This suicide became national news, and a [flurry of criticism was thrown at Dateline and Chris Hansen](https://web.archive.org/web/20070109174347/http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2006/03/28/publiceye/entry1445230.shtml). All of the men caught in the Murphy sting had their charges dropped. Suddenly TCAP's close association with law enforcement and their proclivity to create news was getting more and more negative attention. Advertisers began to withdraw their ads during TCAP segments and higher ups at NBC began voicing their displeasure at the ballooning budgets of these investigations and explicit nature of the program. Condrat's sister [sued NBC for $105 million](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2008-jun-25-fi-predator25-story.html) claiming their actions were journalistically unethical and led to her brother's suicide. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court. 

TCAP as a segment only lasted a couple more investigations after the Murphy sting before coming to an end. While the popular assumption is that Condrat's suicide and his sister's lawsuit is what led to the cancellation, Chris Hansen claims that NBC was already planning on ending new investigations before the Murphy catastrophe because TCAP had become the most expensive Dateline segment by far, and that NBC was sitting on so much extra footage of unaired material that they could cut it into *Predator Raw* episodes and rerun those for big ratings on the cheap. 

### What happened after TCAP?

Chris Hansen remained a correspondent on Dateline and tried replicating the TCAP magic with segments like To Catch an ID Thief, To Catch an i-Jacker (a really lame sting about people stealing blocky 2000s iPods left out in the open), and To Catch a Con Man. None of these captured the ratings or attention of the original, however, and after GE sold NBC reruns of TCAP and Predator Raw on MSNBC started to cease as upper management began to change. 

Chris Hansen was caught having an affair with a [young news anchor at an NBC affiliate](https://people.com/celebrity/chris-hansen-caught-cheating-on-his-wife/) which did not help endear him with his new bosses, who chose not to [renew his contract in 2013](https://www.businessinsider.com/nbc-drops-chris-hansen-2013-8) after he had spent 20 years with the network. 

Hansen bounced around for a couple years, doing a few projects here and there, and then in 2015 he had a big announcement…

#### Hansen vs. Predator 

A Kickstarter suddenly dropped for a new television program called *Hansen vs. Predator*. This program would follow the typical TCAP formula of men coming over to a sting house thinking they were going to meet a minor for sex only to be met by Chris Hansen and then arrested by law enforcement right afterwards. This time around a new watchdog group would play the online decoys as Perverted Justice had dissolved years earlier (and trust me, I really could do a whole other write-up just on them). 

The Kickstarter was aiming for a $400,000 goal, but after months of fundraising the campaign lowered the goal to $75,000, [eventually reaching $89,000](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1606694156/hansen-vs-predator). The Kickstarter promised mugs, T-shirts, and other assorted merch to backers. 

The sting was filmed in Fairfax County, Connecticut, leading to the arrest of ten men. Afterwards, with the footage of the sting supposedly on the way, Hansen became the host of Crime Watch Daily, a syndicated true crime show. Crime Watch Daily picked up the Hansen vs. Predator sting for their show and it quickly became their most popular segment with [the Jeff Sokol interview](https://youtu.be/zJIlftta6fk) racking up over 55,000,000 views on YouTube and randomly going viral on TikTok seemingly once every couple months. 

##### How Chris Hansen Scammed Fans

The unedited footage of these interviews and arrests was apparently still on the way to Kickstarter backers, but that just like the promised merch was nowhere in sight. Soon, backers began flooding the comments of the Kickstarter page [demanding to know where their money was going](https://apnews.com/article/fbc6558a93994e06abd7cecaf56c6d9d). Hansen promised backers would receive their awards by December of 2015 but no one had [gotten anything by August of 2016](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/crowdfunding-donors-accuse-chris-hansen-of-scamming-them-into-funding-new-sex-predator-show/). 

> ""You deal with kickstarter to help these people out.. to get screwed over by someone you’ve seen on tv.. kind of hurts,” said one backer. 

> “We got scammed! We really need to get a hold of some news outlets to set up a sting on Chris Hansen. when he shows up, we can instruct him to have a seat and pull all of the updates they promised us and grill the shit out of them. It really is sad that they screwed us over so badly.” says another. 

Eventually, backers began receiving their rewards, albeit a long time after being promised them. One backer said he had his mug arrive two and a half years after it was supposed to have shipped. Some backers (including myself lol) never got their rewards at all. 

What was most infuriating to fans during this protracted dance between backers and Hansen were his repeated assurances that rewards were right around the corner and that the footage of the sting was coming up soon. Many fans of his earlier work couldn't help but walk away feeling like they got scammed by someone they once looked up to, or at least enjoyed the work of a lot. 

###### Chris Hansen's Arrest and Other Scams 

In the summer of 2017, Hansen wrote a $13,000 check to a company making promotional items for him for Hansen vs. Predator. However, this check bounced. After months of back and forth, Chris wrote another check to this company in April of 2018 but this check also bounced. A felony warrant was then issued for his arrest in Connecticut for writing bad checks. Chris turned himself in and though [the case was eventually dropped] (https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bad-check-case-involving-catch-predator-host-chris-hansen-resolved-n962956) it still left many fans shaking their heads at the man who once wore a five digit Rolex on his wrist during his Dateline days. 

There is a plethora of other shady stuff Chris has done in the years since. Including [shilling for a scam ""Escobar folding phone"" being sold by literally Pablo Escobar's brother](https://youtu.be/O8FJSjy3bXA). 

YouTuber Theo Vonn flew Chris out to Las Vegas to appear on his show and while there Chris allegedly [racked up a huge hotel and spa bill expecting Theo to pay for it and argued with his team about it](https://youtu.be/2xc165t8UT8). Chris was [evicted from his Manhattan apartment](https://www.tmz.com/2019/01/17/chris-hansen-evicted-manhattan-apartment-rent-to-catch-a-predator/) after not paying rent and his Connecticut home was foreclosed on by the bank. Not to mention his exorbitant credit card debt. Needless to say, it's apparent Chris has a bad handle on his financial situation.

Chris launched a website for his Hansen vs. Predator series and promised new high quality investigations for a subscription of $90 a year. After one video however the site fell dormant despite Chris promising new videos for months afterwards, and instead started a [new series on his YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/aA30cz88eWE) that was universally panned for the low production quality and that the men caught were arrested before the interview with Chris, leading to rather boring and uninteresting videos. 

Bizarrely, Chris Hansen also started ""investigating"" YouTuber and alleged groomer Onision for his inappropriate relationships with underaged fans. Investigating in quotes because many felt Hansen had unfairly jumped onto the story after others had done all the work, and Hansen just joined in to take the story and sell it as a documentary to Discovery+. This culminated in an almost comedic video where Chris arrives at Onision's house with a camera crew just for Onision to call 911. Just to emphasize how bizarre this is [Onision withdrew a lawsuit against Chris Hansen after he accidentally served a totally different man named Chris Hansen the papers](https://www.insider.com/onision-drops-chris-hansen-lawsuit-after-wrong-person-served-papers-2020-1).

There's more that can be added to this section, honestly. It's kind of overwhelming the amount of suspect behavior Chris has engaged in since being let go by NBC, but you get the point. 

###### Where Are Chris and the Predator Investigations Now?

Chris appeared briefly on [The Boys season two](https://youtu.be/-5X0MdGgPlg), which, good for him for getting that bag in a respectable way, I guess. 

In 2020 he started a podcast titled ""Predators I Caught"". Each week he takes a different man caught in one of the stings he's been a part of and does a reading of their chatlog, an overview of his confrontation with them, and what they've been up to since the sting. [Formulaic to a fault](https://reddit.com/r/FansHansenvsPredator/comments/xzd168/type_things_chris_says_every_podcast_ill_start/), it's still somewhat interesting to hardcore fans to hear Chris read chatlogs uncensored for once, and occasionally but rarely he divulges some actual new and interesting information. 

Just recently on Thanksgiving Day his new series titled *Takedown with Chris Hansen* started airing on the true crime streaming service he's a part of: TruBlu. [Despite many in the fandom wondering if this was a scam originally](https://reddit.com/r/FansHansenvsPredator/comments/z5c3rl/after_trublu_fails_and_vanishes_do_you_think_well/), TruBlu is a real service and the new show is also real. This series follows the more traditional TCAP and Hansen vs. Predator format of Chris confronting a suspected predator before arrest, though most of the men immediately try to leave. Probably because the sting house is an empty double-wide trailer with [a visible GoPro camera mounted on the fridge that Chris has to pick up off the floor and put back on top at one point](https://www.reddit.com/r/FansHansenvsPredator/comments/z4qehn/in_the_semi_truck_thomas_episode_chris_literally/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). A long, long departure from the TCAP days of renting out massive multi-million dollar mansions with dozens of expensive hidden cameras. 

Chris also just this Monday announced upcoming live shows in Las Vegas where he promises to record a podcast with the audience, show some never before seen footage, do a Q&A, and have some meet and greets. [Some in the fandom speculating this is a test for a national tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/FansHansenvsPredator/comments/zecfjg/hansen_is_having_a_tcap_convention_in_vegas_is/). Maybe expect PredatorCon to come to a city near you, complete with people cosplaying as their favorite registered sex offender from the shows. 

Despite all the controversy, fans of TCAP and HVP are some of the most weirdly devoted fans out there, capable of quoting countless lines to each other ad infinitum and noticing every little detail from so many repeated watchings. And for some reason to us fans it never gets old."
