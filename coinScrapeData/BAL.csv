Is this the best way?,debtfree,1i9b938,2025-01-24 20:04:07,3,0.81,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/debtfree/comments/1i9b938/is_this_the_best_way/,Renzoruken95,,"I started to get into debt before Covid living beyond my means and once Covid started i just snowballed into a pit of debt reaching about 43k by the end of it. I was stupid and broke in my early 20s.

Now In my late 20s i have seriously taken a step to regain my finances by progressing in my field of work and here is my current plan I'm working with. My debt was originally across 4 different CCs.

I originally got approved for a very high interest Personal Loan for 29k through USAA at the beginning of 24 and put the entire balance of my highest bal/apr which was 19k. I then took the remaining 10k and put it on the next highest card (I was paying min payments of ~400/month and the apr was just killing me) I then was paying the personal loan +2 CCs a month of around ~1200.

Recently I was approved for a SOFI personal loan for 40k/60mo. I have moved my balance over to that and all my cards except a remaining balance of $1700 as I had a car problem. The 1700 is on a Discover card and i actually got a 0%apr for 12 months when I called them before the charge.

At this point I pretty much have around 3k in stocks and no other savings besides a 401k. My only other main bills are a 450/mo car loan (pays off 3/2026),and a ~1900 housing/ins/utilities monthly bill. Im paying 500/mo towards the 1700 on the cc. The personal loan is 886/mo. My current income is about 4000/month. 

I know in about 3-4 months when I pay off the $1700 debt my goal is to roll over the $500/mo paid towards the cc into the personal loan monthly payment. But when it comes to March of 2026. Would the smartest choice be to also roll the $450 into the personal loan payment or start setting that aside for emergency funds? If I roll everything together by 3/26 I should be able to also get it paid off in ~1-1.5 years early.

Throughout this entire ordeal I've made it very clear to myself that I wanted to take care of this on my own and that I wouldn't try and take a shortcut by trying Bankcruptcy or similar ways."
Growing Instability Observed in Konya Province Turkey & Sinkhole Proliferation after 2012,Disastro,1i95u9e,2025-01-24 15:59:08,20,0.96,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Disastro/comments/1i95u9e/growing_instability_observed_in_konya_province/,ArmChairAnalyst86,,"There are certain subsidence hotspots around the world for a variety of factors which are not all the same from place to place. I often reference this part of Turkey but today we are going a bit deeper.

Today a few relevant stories broke. [The first is the collapse of a 4 story apartment building in Konya](https://apnews.com/article/turkey-building-collapse-people-trapped-c8ed35d0c0c4e2252dadaf52b77cf01e). The second is the [report of a 30 meter deep sinkhole forming in a poor farmers field](https://x.com/Xnews_with_grok/status/1882649336745693443). Unfortunately, there are about 14 just like it in close proximity and over [2600 of them in the region](https://watchers.news/2022/10/02/more-than-2-600-sinkholes-identified-in-konya-turkey/) which is up from the [660 figure given in 2021.](https://watchers.news/2021/04/26/600-large-sinkholes-konya-turkey-2021/) These are not your average sinkholes mind you.

[Sinkholes](https://reddit.com/link/1i95u9e/video/eyeayw4fvzee1/player)

The entire Konya plain is suffering from this phenomenon. Its largely blamed on groundwater use. To be sure, groundwater plays a key role. Human activity plays a role in groundwater. However, to prematurely attribute this exclusively to the domain of anthropogenic activity misses the larger pattern and factors in play. As a useful comparison, South Dakota is experiencing a very similar pattern in their subsidence with these massive holes forming in primarily agricultural areas. However, these sinkholes are moving closer and closer to residential areas. There was a lawsuit thrown out against mining companies in South Dakota because of state immunity but also because the gypsum is claimed to have been extracted from the surface and not underground. They claimed this would have happened anyway and the thousands of ancient sinkholes in the region attest to that.

Why would two regions separated by continents observe the same phenomenon accelerating at exactly the same point in time? The thing is, its much more than two regions. In each investigation, I have noted the years 2012, 2014, 2017, and 2020 references widely. Additionally, there are many ancient sinkholes in the region. All over the world there are sinkhole hotspots like this from ancient times, and we cannot reliably attribute them to our activity. Yet, its only in recent decades that we have seen such a wild proliferation of them, along with proliferation of many other phenomena which I do not consider as unfortunate coincidence. Subsidence is taking off at alarming pace and the world is starting to notice. New Orleans and Florida are not suffering from drought or similar features, yet they are showing the same signs. Because of uniformity doctrine, our paradigm cannot even entertain the possibility that we are in fact seeing an acceleration in all geophysical processes and geological processes. Look at the African Rift. Right as Ethiopia entered into major volcanic crisis, a study came out saying that the timeline for the African rift separation has accelerated by millions of years off the initial estimate based on the previous measurements. Now its much much faster. They still say 500K years, but this assumes a constant rate of change, but their study is reporting the rate of change is accelerating. That is the key finding. Not the timeline.

It was recently discovered that the Konya Plain is experiencing something called ""lithospheric dripping"". Essentially while the ground is uplifting, isolated parts drip downward.

https://preview.redd.it/d9qbusatxzee1.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=22358612aa815fb0f3c375e328a18f836e2a139e

The map above identifies dripping hotspots detected thus far and I included the image for Konya.

You don't see any of these factors mentioned in public discourse on the topic. Its all about drought, groundwater use, irrigation, etc. You have to see past the policymaking. It serves no practical use to tell these people that there is no stopping this. Might as well focus on what we can affect, which includes groundwater use, but make no mistake. This is a geological process. Always has been and always will be. The earth is littered from features from previous episodes of instability. We are still in the latent phase of this episode, but clearly things are picking up. You may disagree with me on root origins and scope, but there is no denying the uptick and the consequences regardless.

Here was a key statement in the Turkey investigation.

*‚ÄúThe key conclusion of this work is that basin evolution and plateau uplift may be linked in a multistage process of lithospheric removal within a large-scale orogenic plateau system. Supported by geological, geophysical, and geodetic data,* ***our model results explain the enigmatic active subsidence*** *of the Konya Basin amidst the rising Central Anatolian plateau interior,‚Äù the researchers concluded.*

Here is more information and studies on this particular region. Subsidence occurs in many forms and through many processes, but it is undeniable that those processes have kicked into a much higher gear. Full disclosure, I used a chatgpt search to compile the results coherently and was quite impressed with the results.

Several studies have highlighted significant land subsidence issues in various regions during the years following 2012, 2014, 2017, and 2020:

**Coachella Valley, California (2010‚Äì2017):** Research indicates that subsidence rates during 2010‚Äì2017 were generally less than half of those computed for 1995‚Äì2010, with reductions up to 75%. Notably, the northern part of the valley experienced uplift of up to 60 mm between 2014 and 2017.

[PIAHS](https://piahs.copernicus.org/articles/382/809/2020/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Mexico City, Mexico (2014‚Äì2017):** A study assessing land subsidence risk in Mexico City found that approximately 15.43% of the population resided in intermediate to very-high-risk zones between October 2014 and October 2017. The analysis indicated that around 12% of the urbanized area had exceeded an angular distortion threshold of 0.002 radians, above which structural damage is more likely.

[PIAHS](https://piahs.copernicus.org/articles/382/583/2020/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Houston, Texas (2014‚Äì2020):** Analyses of land subsidence rates in large coastal cities revealed that Houston experienced the fastest peak subsidence rates in the United States, averaging about 17 millimeters (0.67 inches) per year from 2014 to 2020.

**Iran (2014‚Äì2020):** A study analyzing satellite data from 2014 to 2020 found that 3.5% of Iran's land area is subsiding due to excessive groundwater extraction, primarily for irrigation. The most affected area is Kerman province, with subsidence rates exceeding 35 cm per year, impacting infrastructure such as airports, roads, and railways.

One final note on the groundwater. It was recently reported in the journals that humans have altered the obliquity and the length of day significantly by groundwater use and climate change. There were headlines like this.

""Earth has tilted 31.5 inches, and humans are 100% to blame"" - [Earth.com](http://Earth.com)

[NASA-Funded Studies Explain How Climate Is Changing Earth‚Äôs Rotation](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-funded-studies-explain-how-climate-is-changing-earths-rotation/)

Well lets see how the ones NASA didn't fund fared.

[Length of Day Variations Explained in a Bayesian Framework](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024GL111148)

*In Figure*¬†[*1*](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024GL111148#grl68411-fig-0001)¬†*we show the LOD observations as well as their secular trend, the reconstructed climatic effects (barystatic), and the residuals after removing them, which will be compared to the reconstructed LOD from geomagnetic observations.* ***The climatic effects prior to the onset of climate change in the industrial era feature various long-period fluctuations (multidecadal to millennial), with maximum amplitudes of about 0.4¬†ms. These effects are not only anti-correlated with fluctuations observed in LOD (Pearson correlation of¬†‚àº‚àí0.55) but they are also smaller by a factor of¬†‚àº10 than the fluctuations observed in the LOD record that have an amplitude of around 4¬†ms (Figure***¬†[***1c***](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024GL111148#grl68411-fig-0001)***). Although the uncertainties in these reconstructions remain large, it is unlikely that the climatic effects can be considered the cause of the observed fluctuations. This shows that some other processes must be contributing to these large fluctuations. It has long been known that core processes are the most likely candidate for explaining these fluctuations (Munk & MacDonald,***¬†[***1960***](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024GL111148#grl68411-bib-0040)***), which our results also imply***\*\*.\*\*

It looks like they went right to the ""core"" of the issue. Their data suggests climate related, or barystatic changes are minor. Regardless of where they came from, from us or the natural variation in climate. They used an inner earth model with magnetohydrodynamics incorporated because the electrical properties are key. They are saying that the earths core is responsible for the length of day glitches which stem from effects on earths rotation, which was blamed on human groundwater use in the NASA funded study.

I didn't see any major news outlets report this study though. Why would they? Wouldn't want to confuse the public or anything....

Again, in every scenario, here is what you must do to truly understand what is happening to our planet. When you see a phenomena, go find when it happened before, usually in the geological record. Investigate the cause given. Learn the geophysical factors they don't like to talk about anymore in favor of an anthropogenic dominated paradigm. Then, go look in the real world and see if you can find evidence of those factors at work. Then, with that understanding in mind, apply anthropogenic activity secondarily. These processes happen with or without us. We are contributing and doing so significantly, but there needs to be balance. I am tired of the media and mainstream science giving you a multiple choice question with only one answer. I am here to provide that balance. It hasn't made me many friends, but if you have been riding with me these past few months, you must see it too...

Great changes are materializing. Slowly and gradually, but this is the latent phase and that is expected. The transformation of the planet is a process, not an event. Creation is inherently a destructive process. The two are inextricably linked together. People are watching their neighborhoods burn, fall into the ground, washed into the sea, blown to bits, and great upheaval on our planet beginning to take form and they are angry about it. They see it as all man's doing because that is what they are told over and over and over without any balance. If you are expecting mainstream science to be objective, you can stop. They wont be. They cant be. I prefer accuracy over agenda, no matter how well meaning. My social responsibility lies with figuring out what the hell is going on. 

The fact is there are many researchers and scientists out there looking into the geophysical forcing and they write papers just the same, but who gets to decide what papers run in the media outlets? Who gets to decide which  ones you see and don't see? Most people are not going to comb the literature themselves. They just want to be told what is happening. They don't understand anything about the geological record and the riddles of earths past that the uniformity doctrine has never been able to explain. They don't understand that even in the Holocene, there has been significant upheaval. The reason why is because science and policy can no longer be separated. The IPCC makes the rules and they have been clear about the lengths they will go to in order to control the narrative because if they don't, you will see what you are not supposed to see too early.

As long as it can be pinned on humans in total, people will believe it can be fixed, or at least could have been. It keeps the party going while the band plays on like the Titanic. Don't get me wrong. We affect our environment profoundly. We should do everything that we can to get our house in order. We wont... but we should. We should mitigate and improve everything we can but we also must be objective and see past the strategy coming down from the top. The earth, sun, and galaxy do not give a damn for our words on pages. We have placed essentially arbitrary limits on what they are capable of and in what time frame but it was never up to us."

```sql
CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE dbo.spm_LoanReamort_LoanBalanceHistory
(
    @participantId BIGINT,
    @operatorId INT,
    @loanBalances dbo.udt_DateDollarAmount READONLY
)

BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;
    DECLARE @now DATETIME = GETDATE();
    
    CREATE TABLE #NewLoanBalHist
    (
        par_idb BIGINT NOT NULL,
        loabh_effect_dt DATETIME NOT NULL,
        loabh_amt DECIMAL(19,2) NOT NULL,
        created_cdt DATETIME NOT NULL,
        modified_dti DATETIME NULL,
        operator_nid INT NULL
    );

    -- Populate the temporary table with the input data
    INSERT INTO #NewLoanBalHist (par_idb, loabh_effect_dt, loabh_amt, created_cdt, modified_dti, operator_nid)
    SELECT
        @participantId,
        lb.effectiveDate,
        lb.dollarAmount,
        @now,
        @now,

    FROM @loanBalances AS lb;

    IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM #NewLoanBalHist)
    BEGIN
        DECLARE @minDate DATETIME, @maxDate DATETIME;

        -- Get the minimum and maximum dates from the temporary table
        SELECT 
            @minDate = MIN(loabh_effect_dt),
            @maxDate = MAX(loabh_effect_dt)
        FROM #NewLoanBalHist;

        BEGIN TRY
            BEGIN TRANSACTION;

            -- Delete records within the date range
            DELETE FROM dbo.LoanBalHist
            WHERE par_idb = @participantId 
            AND loabh_effect_dt BETWEEN @minDate AND @maxDate;

            -- Insert new records
            INSERT INTO dbo.LoanBalHist (par_idb, loabh_effect_dt, loabh_amt, created_cdt, operator_nid)
            SELECT par_idb, loabh_effect_dt, loabh_amt, created_cdt, operator_nid
            FROM #NewLoanBalHist;

            COMMIT TRANSACTION;
        END TRY
        BEGIN CATCH
            PRINT 'An error occurred. Rolling back transaction';
            ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
            THROW;
        END CATCH
    END

    DROP TABLE #NewLoanBalHist;
END
```

### Key Points:

- **Single Transaction**: All operations are wrapped in one transaction for data consistency. If an error occurs during the DELETE or INSERT, the whole operation will be rolled back.

- **DELETE First**: This approach deletes all records within the date range before inserting new data. This means any existing records in that range will be removed, potentially leading to data loss if there are records in `LoanBalHist` for `par_idb` and dates that aren't in your new data set.

- **INSERT**: After clearing the range, it inserts all new records from `#NewLoanBalHist`.

- **Performance**: This could be faster than updating or merging if the number of new records is significantly less than existing ones, but it does mean you lose historical data within that range that isn't replaced by new data.

- **NOLOCK**: Since you've mentioned using `NOLOCK`, you might want to apply it to the DELETE operation if you're comfortable with the potential for dirty reads or missed deletes due to concurrent transactions:

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM dbo.LoanBalHist WITH (NOLOCK)
  ```

  However, be cautious as this can lead to issues with data consistency if other processes are modifying `LoanBalHist` at the same time.

- **Considerations for Large Data**: If `LoanBalHist` is very large or if the date range covers a lot of records, this DELETE operation could be time-consuming. You might still need to consider batching or other optimization strategies if performance is an issue. 

This approach is straightforward but remember, it doesn't update existing records; it only deletes and inserts. If you need to preserve some data or manage updates, you'd need to modify this procedure further or combine it with another strategy."

Just wondering if I can get some advice towards my credit situation because I don't really know what i'm doing, and I think I am hurting my credit. I am 19 yrs old. I have one credit card, it is secured with a maxed out bal of $500. I was in a position where I was using the card for everything and paying it off up to three times a month but as of recently I got a apartment that costs a lot more than my past situation, and rent comes first so my priority hasn't been paying down the card. Its sat for months with a maxed out balance, while I paid minimums. I recently applied for a loan they ran my credit and it was 611, and just mos ago it was 750. I don't want to go into the 500's. I've contemplated getting another card so my utilization went down by opening a second account.  Its such a small debt that people recommend I pay it off and only use it for my subscriptions (50 a month) and pay it off. But the most I could put toward it is about 200 a month meaning it'll take me another 3 mos to pay it down. I'm feeling stuck and scared to do anything with my credit because everything I do to make it better, only makes it worse."

**What am I missing?¬† What is my next move?** ¬†Keep going as is? ¬†(so far, I‚Äôve been maxing out 401k, then saving/investing as much cash as possible to non-taxable (incl ESPP)) ¬†¬†I maxed out my 401k the last 2 years, but I feel like my net worth is retirement heavy ‚Äì so I think I should put more $ into non-taxable‚Ä¶ I just put $30K in late Dec/early Jan so returns aren‚Äôt great yet.¬† ¬†I think I could benefit from a collateral loan in the future to start a small business, since I don‚Äôt own a home, so was thinking I could beef up the non-taxable account for that purpose? ¬†¬†I‚Äôve been very lucky in my IRA with the tech stocks - just riding the wave.¬† ¬†But I feel like I need a better plan/strategy. ¬†¬†It seems very random & lucky. ¬†¬†

My (arbitrary) number is about $1.6-$1.8M before retiring (not sure what age that will happen‚Ä¶ 50? 55?) and plan to work a lower paying, more enjoyable job (eg library assistant or plant nursery worker) to cover some of my recurring expenses + have health insurance + socialize. ¬†¬†Not sure if I will ever be able to buy a house ‚Äì was house poor once and I don‚Äôt want to be again.  *Dream Life: Buy land and build a house - maybe have a small farm or other type of business on the property. :)*

I didn‚Äôt think I would make this kind of money, so I missed the boat on the roth conversions while I was at a lower income‚Ä¶ **what other things should I prep for or change?** I've seen my NW skyrocket over the last year and I want to make sure I'm maximizing my situation. TIA!"

Er der nogen af jer der har erfaring med Prednisolon?,ADHDanmark,1i6w9ia,2025-01-21 18:09:55,3,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDanmark/comments/1i6w9ia/er_der_nogen_af_jer_der_har_erfaring_med/,Anonymous_user_2022,,"Kort opsummering: Er der nogen af jer, der har erfaring med at Prednisolon har haft en positiv virkning p√• jeres ADHD symptomer; is√¶r inden i blev udredt?


Den lange udgave kr√¶ver lidt baggrundshistorie. Vores s√∏n blev udredt for ASD p√• OUH b√∏rne psyk sidste √•r. Det fik mig til at f√• s√∏ge en ""second opinion"" hos en privatpraktiserende efter en tr√¶ls oplevelse med det offentlige system¬π. Jeg fandt s√• ud af at jeg ogs√• havde ADHD. Efter den diagnose var vi til en opf√∏lgende samtale p√• OUH om vores s√∏n, hvor jeg spurgte til om han ogs√• kunne t√¶nkes at have ADHD. Vi fik at vide han var blevet screenet, uden at der var fundet nogen grund til at g√• videre med det. Men, p√• det seneste er vi begyndt at se ham have en adf√¶rd, der for os er sv√¶r at skelne fra ADHD. 

Ja, jeg ved det, ADHD er en designer-diagnose og yada-yada-yada. Det er ikke der vi er, endsige vil hen. Jeg vil hellere have en afkr√¶ftelse.

I dag kom vi til at tale om ADHD, og vi kom til at t√¶nke p√• en perirode for 4 pr siden, hvor han blev behandlet for MCD¬≤ med en ret voldsom dosis prednisolon i 9 m√•neder. Dengang s√• vi hans personlighed √¶ndre sig, fra ""almindeligt ligeglad, dovent barn"" til att lave lektier samme dag han fik dem, selv tage initiativ til at hj√¶lpe med at holde orden p√• huset (opvaskemaskine, genbrug, vasket√∏j, rydde op p√• eget v√¶relse). Vi t√¶nkte ikke s√• meget over det dengang, da det egentlig passede meget godt ind i den typiske aldersm√¶ssige udvikling. Vi t√¶nkte heller ikke s√• meget over det, da effekten forsvandt da han stoppede med Prednisolon, fordi det p√• det tidspunkt lignede pr√¶matur teenageritis. P√• det tidspunkt havde vi ikke den fjerneste ide om at han kunne have ASD. Havde vi vidst det den gang, ville vi nok have t√¶nkt lidt mere over det.

Men nu kommer sp√∏rgsm√•let s√•: Er der nogen af jer andre der har oplevet noget tilsvarende, enten hos jer selv, eller hos jeres b√∏rn, og efterf√∏lgende har f√•et en diagnose p√• ADHD, eller har en ADHD diagnose, og har oplevet en forbedring af jeres symptomer midlertidigt. Min Google-fu er ikke god i dag, s√• jeg f√•r lige s√• mange forskellige svar som en 8-bal kan give. Som jeg skrev ovenfor, vil vi hellere have afkr√¶ftet ADHD, men vi st√•r desv√¶rre i en situation, hvor han bliver mere og tr√¶t og marginaliseret i skolen. Med min egen oplevelse af psykiatrien p√• Fyn, og den √•benlyse forskel p√• diagnostiske kriterier, er jeg mest stemt for at finde en privatpraktiserende, der kan lave den udredning. Men inden jeg uds√¶tter ham for det, vil jeg gerne h√∏re om der er nogen af jer med tilsvarende forl√∏b, og hvad i efterf√∏lgende er kommet frem til omkring ADHD

Jeg beklager at jeg har skrevet en halv roman. Jeg takker alle jer, der i det mindste har l√¶st hertil, ogs√• selv om i ikke har et svar. 


1. Jeg havde en forf√¶rdelig oplevelse i distriktspsykiatrien i Middelfart for 8-10 √•r siden, hvor jeg grundkl√¶ggende fik at vide jeg ikke  kunne have ASD, fordi jeg havde et k√¶ledyr som barn og i√∏vrigt ikke s√• ned i gulvet. Det l√¶gger min basis for hvor lidt jeg tror p√• den offentlige pykiatri p√• Fyn. Der er eksempelvis flere b√∏rn og unge i Slagelse kommune med en ASD diagnose end der er p√• hele Fyn. 

2. Minimal change disorder. Det er en sygdom hvor nyrerne udskille for meget protein, hvilket f√∏r til ophobning af v√¶ske p√• grund af √¶ndring i kroppens osmotiske balance. Prednisolon hjalp ikke, s√• vi havde senere to √•r hvor han fik immund√¶mpende medicin som ellers gives til modtagere af organtransplantationer. Heldigvis virkede det fors√∏g :)"
Noob questions regarding the qudelix 5k 2.5mm output power.,iems,1i6t2h4,2025-01-21 15:56:26,2,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/iems/comments/1i6t2h4/noob_questions_regarding_the_qudelix_5k_25mm/,User430-ten,General Advice,"Hi all! I have a qudelix 5k on its way since my other amp/dac (xDuoo Link2 Bal Max) crapped out. With the latter, it has a 4.4mm balanced output plug that supplies a great deal more power for my iems and headphones. Most of my headphones have the option of 4.4mm or 3.5mm by swapping cables. Just realized the qudilex 5k has a 2.5mm balanced for the extra power output. 

My question is if using the 3.5mm termination (unbalanced) connected to a 2.5mm male adaptor to get the unbalanced max power from the amp or will it still perform at the unbalanced lower power because of the 3.5mm cable? Would I need to use the 4.4mm and then a 2.5mm male end adaptor to get it or does it not matter as long as it's going into the 2.5mm plug in the amp? 

Thanks! "
"So, i¬¥m on page 600 of crown of swords, this series has definitly changed my life and i¬¥m only halfway, also, again like on previous posts, i have some questions i think i should already know im afraid to google.",WoT,1i69897,2025-01-20 22:18:21,45,0.95,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/1i69897/so_im_on_page_600_of_crown_of_swords_this_series/,Fun-Draw5327,A Crown of Swords,"So far, i¬¥m loving the series, between some of this books i¬¥ve been reading some of the Mistborn, Stormlight and even The Name of the wind, and yet i think the wheel of time will forever hold a special place in my heart, after all, i only started reading on August last year when i bought The Eye of the world for mere curiosity, i¬¥ve never read something before that and now it just feels like a part of me, sometimes when im reading i look at the pile of the 15 books on the shelf, i see ""A Memory of Light"" still on plastic wrapper and i feel a little empty already. I think WoT will forever be my favourite series even if its just the first one.

So, there are some thing i still dont understand when they happen but i feel like i should alread knew if i paid attention.

1.- Whats the difference between the one power and ""the true power""? When Moghedien is talking with Moridin (who the fu\*\* is that btw??) she talks like he is channeling something different from saidar or saidin ""the true power"" and mentions the black dots in his eyes, i thought the connection with the Dark one only allowed you to channel whitout going crazy like Asmodean said, is this a different source of power?

2.-What makes the dice roll in Mat¬¥s head? The dice keep rolling and i have no idea what makes them roll or stop, i dont even have clues. It kinda just happens.

3.- I¬¥m pretty sure Lews Therin is real, Cadsuane says all male channelers hear voices when they start to go crazy, but i¬¥m sure Lews Therin has said some things that prove he is real, things Rand has no way of knowing, like teaching him to FU\*\*ING OBLITERATE a 6 thread shielding, but there are other things, im quite sure, can someone help me remember them? Lews cant be just his mind if he says things Rand cant know, he is real, he has to be, i juts know it

4.- Whats the difference between ""travel"" and?... well, in spanish is ""Razar"", the thing people do when they step in a plataform and move in a black space, arent both supposed to take you to different places? isnt just use travel easier? are there instances of people doing it in previous books? i think Rand did it at the end of book one, and the he did something to bal¬¥zamon, i dont remember what exactly.

5.- While everyone is talking about the drama in the white tower, Pevara and Seain talk about some things that happened after the Aiel war, and mention how some sisters died, are these the same deaths that happened in New Spring? When Siuan goes to see Moraine after meetin with Cadusane and she is losing her sh\*\* crying because the sisters that the previous Amylrin send to search for the dragon are falling one by one in ""Mysterious ways""?

6.- Is the number of women channelers just bigger than the male channelers? I dont think an exact number of male and female channelers are said in the books, but when Taim started to recruit male channelers, he had like a couple of hundred, that compared to the hundreds of aes sedai from the white tower plus the ""rebels"" made some sense, like, there were more women channelers, but just looking for the males gave the sense that they were balanced, just people werent looking, now this crazy 400 year old lady comes out of nowhere and says ""oh yeah, we have 2,000 somewhere"", are they just simply more women with the power or is Mazrim and his boys not searching hard enough?

7.- When Lan is talking to Nynaeve (omg finally they are togheter) he starts explainig what happens to a guardian when his Aes Sedai dies, everyone is saying that he goes big sad, ""i want to die"" and bla bla bla, but when i was reading this specific part of him explaining it seems like theres something more to it, like a terminal illness or something, is he just going to die no matter what? is that what happens or did i just missinterpreted something? Also, did he had sex with the green aes sedai that took him after moraine? i dont remember her name.

8.- Was the ""fight"" between Rand and Perrin anti-climatic? i thought him and Perrin were on the same page with staying togheter for the Min visions, and yes, they were angry because of the aes sedai, but the thing with the ""i banish you Perrin go away"" felt...werid, idk, did i miss something?

Ok, i think thats it, i would appreciate your answers and i some of this things are just RAFO i would understand, thank you! this sub has really helped make this series a lot more engaging"

The Craftsman brand was launched in 1927 by Sears, with the name reportedly purchased for $500 from the Marion-Craftsman Tool Company. It quickly became known for its high-quality tools and lifetime warranty, making it a favorite among farmers and tradespeople. By the 1930s, Craftsman introduced innovations like vanadium steel wrenches, which were thinner yet significantly stronger than their predecessors. In 1934, Craftsman launched its first lawnmowers, offering significant cost advantages over competitors.

During World War II, Craftsman tools were widely used in defense industries, airplane manufacturing, and technician training, solidifying its reputation for durability and reliability. By the 1950s, the brand expanded with tools tailored for suburban homeowners, including riding mowers and versatile power tools. Its mobile tool trucks, introduced in 1950, revolutionized tool sales by bringing products directly to mechanics and businesses.

Craftsman tools became an essential part of American households and industries throughout the 20th century, establishing itself as a symbol of innovation and trust.

Spiritual advice: Are dhampyres bound to Coldharbor?,TamrielTales,1i2d960,2025-01-15 20:16:48,3,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TamrielTales/comments/1i2d960/spiritual_advice_are_dhampyres_bound_to_coldharbor/,Strix86,Beyond Timeline,"My(27 argonian) grandfather(153 nord) keeps insisting that I should let him turn me into a full vampire for my own soul. He believes that because vampires are Molag Bal‚Äôs creation as his insult to Arkay‚Äôs balance of life and death, any children vampires would have would also belong to him. 

He argues that a living, breathing soul descended from an undead would be the final cherry on top to Bal‚Äôs insult and therefore an excellent candidate for a champion of Coldharbor. If I stay a dhampyre and age and die like any other mortal, I‚Äôd visit Coldharbor much sooner. But if I ‚Äúembrace my heritage,‚Äù and become a full vampire, I‚Äôm more likely to be on better terms there when/if I do die.

I *could* try to devote my soul to another daedra or aedra, but I haven‚Äôt been one much for religion as a lukiul from Leyawin. Should I take my chances with staying a dhampyre, or becoming a full vampire?"

[](/HOU)Texans @ [](/KC)Chiefs|4:30p ET on ESPN/ABC/ESPN+|[](/KC)Chiefs|***Confidence: Medium*** - The Texans showed grit on defense in their wild-card win against the Chargers, with their edge rush creating problems and their corners stepping up. They‚Äôll look to disrupt Mahomes, but the Chiefs‚Äô offense will counter with a patient and methodical approach. Kelce and the TE group will exploit short-to-intermediate routes to sustain long drives, while Mahomes mixes in timely downfield shots after setting up the run game to keep the Texans‚Äô defense guessing. With Mahomes fresh and poised to extend plays with his legs, the Chiefs have the upper hand. Meanwhile, the Texans may struggle offensively, as Stroud‚Äôs options are limited outside of Collins, and Mixon could find running lanes scarce against KC's defense.
[](/WAS)Commanders @ [](/DET)Lions|8:00p ET on FOX|[](/DET)Lions|***Confidence: Medium*** - The Lions‚Äô defense has held its own despite injuries and is aiming to get healthier in time to face Daniels. His dual-threat ability‚Äîlaunching deep passes and escaping outside the pocket‚Äîmakes this a challenging matchup for Detroit. Washington‚Äôs offense will need to stay aggressive, leaning more on Daniels‚Äô playmaking rather than a traditional power run game. On the other side, the Lions are primed to capitalize on the Commanders‚Äô struggles against the run, with Gibbs leading the ground game and St. Brown exploiting the slot. While Daniels will showcase flashes of brilliance, Goff and the Lions' balanced attack will prevail, securing their second consecutive NFCCG appearance.

[](/LAR)Rams @ [](/PHI)Eagles|3:00p ET on NBC/Peacock|[](/PHI)Eagles|***Confidence: Medium*** - In their Week 12 meeting, the Eagles overpowered the Rams thanks to a dominant showing from Barkley, who rushed for 255 yards and two TDs, and Brown, who hauled in eight receptions for 109 yards and a TD. Despite the lopsided score, most team stats were relatively even‚Äîexcept on third down, where Philly thrived while the Rams were a dismal 0-for-8. The Rams‚Äô young defense shined last week with a record-setting nine sacks against the Vikings, but facing Hurts and stopping Barkley presents a much tougher challenge, especially in cold road conditions.
[](/BAL)Ravens @ [](/BUF)Bills|6:30p ET on CBS/Paramount+|[](/BUF)Bills|***Confidence: Low*** - In their Week 4 matchup, the Ravens cruised to a win at home, taking advantage of an injury-depleted Bills defense. Baltimore shut down Cook and Allen's rushing attack while piling up yards on the ground with Henry and Jackson. This time around, the Bills are healthier and won't be dominated the same way, but vulnerabilities remain‚Äîespecially against the run. Jackson's steadiness in downfield passing and his dual-threat ability give the Ravens the edge. Coming off a confidence-boosting win over the Steelers, Jackson has outperformed Allen in MVP-worthy metrics this season and looks ready for another big playoff performance, even on the road. This one is the hardest to predict, but I'm staying with the home team on this one.

Well people... It's here. Yes, finally. What a ride.

This has been the most exhaustive, complete, one of my hardest projects to take and to give to an entire community... for free! It's the peak and ending of a true passion about getting this beautiful game to be more known to people that maybe forgot about the PES franchise or thought that there aren't good football games to revisit. There are, even when we are in a somewhat ""dark era"" for football games.

As always, MegaPatch has existed to enhance and to complete the experience for Football Life. Football Life, as stated by SmokePatch team, its a lightweight game to be easily downloaded and played in almost any device, so it includes just the basics. MegaPatch tries to add everything possible to redo almost every aspect of the game, and give it that true premium feeling.

You know that as I always stated, this game has already reached a peak in terms of modding, so don't expect anything new like 2.Bundesliga working, new leagues or UCL new format, animations, celebrations or whatever. This game is 5 years old, accept it, enjoy it and play it to the end.

This marks my personal end on supporting this game, as I want to put to rest one of the games that I've played the most in these past 5 years. A lot of things feel familiar to me, I know what to exploit, what to do and what to expect or not, so I just need to explore new horizons. Those new horizons, yeah, its the only one out there and its EA FC 25, which I'll be testing and trying with some mods to see how it behaves and changes. I didn't touch a FIFA game since FIFA 19 deeply, so it's a new level for me. Yeah, we all know that we are all here because you can't stand EA FC gameplay and I agree, but its the only game that can give you an actual football experience without needing to collect 200 mods to make it pretty.

Also, I want to play other games! I got a new computer back in December so I have enough power to play all my backlog games which is pretty huge (as I came from a i5-3450 and GTX 960 2GB lol) so my activity on this Reddit will be decreasing over the time. I'll still be a moderator, of course, and still giving insights and getting the banhammer out if needed. There are some things still to be released such as new stadium packs and the last version of the facepack with tons of new faces and fixes (yeah, van Dijk, De Bruyne and all those).

Remember, this patch has the essential: entrances, scoreboards, new menus, custom soundtrack, font, enhanced players, etc. No faces, stadiums or adboards are included as they are considered as an addon due its huge size.

There is a saved stream I did yesterday that showcases a lot of things: [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2350726388](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2350726388)

So no more words, as it isn't a true farewell for now. Let's get it on what does this patch have in detail:

**WHAT DOES MEGAPATCH 3 BRING**

* Changed overalls, roles and positions for a lot of players. This means that the game has a wider gap between the low tier players versus the elite top players, leading to better differences between them when playing and also more realistic behaviour in the game due to that. Expect huge differences playing with a top tier vs low tier team.
* Transfers made up to 6th January (some later ones too) for all leagues.
* A special 4 min tribute intro video with the best of 23/24 season (video by Colo).
* New classic clubs replacing the FL25 default ones: Real Madrid 04/05, Inter Milan 05/06, FC Barcelona 06/07, AC Milan 88/89, Arsenal FC 03/04, Manchester United 98/99, Liverpool 04/05, Juventus 02/03.
* Rest of assigned important players are into new teams that I created. South America Titans (mix of classic and modern American/South America players), European Gen XY (best of until early 2000s), European Gen Z (best of starting from 2005 until recently retired players), European Gen Mix (mixture of pre-2000s and post-2000s players) and World Classics (mixture of African, Asian and others). There are two unassigned teams ""Retired Players"" and ""Retired Players 2"" to avoid them appearing in Master League. They aren't mean to be played.
* The Player Dynamic Model by minhanh150 with better player modeling as a base and accessories on the most famous players, like grip sox, long socks, baggy shirts, etc.
* Football4Life 4.4 Gameplay Mod included. Your favourite one!
* Included some alternative gameplays in a separate folder in case you want to try other ones (DT18 files). Basically are PES 2017, PES 2019 with some tweaks, eFootball 25 and two extra gameplays (eSim and Liberty).
* Klashman tactics applied so each team should be playing differently and not the ""long ball"" all the time (also with F4L 4.4 mod and the tweak on Long Ranger on a lot of players, it should be less frequent).
* New market values based on Transfermarkt recent updates from December 2024 for a lot of players. It will make good players harder to sign by you and the CPU. Don't expect to sign top players in your first or second season if you're a 2nd division team.
* The 2nd/3rd Goalkeeper choice for the CPU SHOULD be fixed 90% of the times, as the overall changes and reputation changes inside the database affected that.
* Updated lineups for a lot of teams (which means badly injured players will be reserve, such as Rodri, Carvajal, Militao, etc). Mostly for the known teams, as I don't have enough data to others.
* Goalnets updated by FicaBre with better goalnet sounds and post sounds (no more OOOOOOOOH from the crowd on missed chances like in MegaPatch 2.3)
* Updated NT call-ups for a lot of teams, based in Transfermarkt. I know the last matches are a little bit ""unrealistic"" in terms of definitive National Team Squads, but we are in a period of just friendlies or competitions that aren't that important so there have been some alternative players called up. So no EURO 2024 squads, as there were a lot of retired players since then (Kroos, Gundogan, Sommer, Neuer, Griezmann, Di Maria, Giroud, Luis Su√°rez, etc)
* New soundtrack with 129 songs that you can listen on Spotify here. All of them are 2024 and 2025 released songs from all genres!:¬†[MegaPatch 3 Soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5I8hyOtjJUkHmXLMJdmdn0?si=babff81963a940e8)
* New theme and font. There are also 4 menu alternatives with 4 different player showing at the main menu, explained in the TXT attached.
* Boots assigned for more than 300 players with latest models (Adidas F50, Predator, Puma, New Balance Tekela, Nike Mercurial, etc)
* Scoreboards updated and with multiple TV logos.
* Kits updated for most leagues. Also includes a lot of special kits such as Barcelona Coldplay and 125th anniversary, 2026 leaked kits for Barcelona and Real Madrid, Leipzig 4th kit, Aston Villa anniversary kit, Bayer Leverkusen anniversary kit, Arsenal ""No More White"" kit, etc.
* Also teams that have their different kit versions for domestic leagues and European Competitions, are there (Aston Villa, Bayern Munich, Leverkusen, Dortmund, Sporting CP, etc.)
* Ballpack with more than 1200 balls and assigned to each league.
* Entrances updated and improved for lot of leagues. Ligue 1 has McDonald's one, UCL new anthem and looks, Bundesliga has the balloon at the center of the pitch, Liga Argentina has the arch and extras, etc.
* Goalsongs for most important teams.
* MenuServerMax from Jemp with new look at the prematch screen + gameplan screen for each competition.
* Updated chants for some teams.
* Announcer speaker added as a mod to shout some names, substitutions and extra time in some languages depending on the league you're playing on.
* New angle cameras for Broadcast and Stadium settings with new values designed for a lot of stadiums.
* New PenaltyCam angle for both teams (goalkeeper and shooter).

**KNOWN BUGS**

* The Player Dynamic Model has visual bugs on EDIT mode. This is something that can't be fixed, but don't worry, it will work fine when ingame.
* Player specific Dynamic Model won't work with generic faces. It needs faces to bet put on. You can download the Facepack V5 here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SPFootballLife/comments/1gkef78/release\_face\_collection\_v5\_for\_fl25\_05112024\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPFootballLife/comments/1gkef78/release_face_collection_v5_for_fl25_05112024_the/)
* MenuServerMax keeps the latest league background and stays until you go to another screen. It's just a small visual bug but it is how it works.
* Sometimes, soundtrack can be silent. Usually it autofixes when loading another screen ingame.
* Not a bug but the South American Titans is still Zalgiris Vilnius on purpose. You can still edit that team via the internal editor, or the ejogc editor.
* I didn't have any crash on long Master Leagues nor playing normal matches. All related crashes are because you're not probably using the proper EXE, not limiting the game with VSync or maybe related to the e-Cores of Intel processors.

**INSTALLATION**

*BEFORE DOING ANYTHING:*

*If you have external video adboards, our face collection (SmokePatch facepack won't be affected) or any stadium pack from anywhere, just cut and save the respective folders before installing this! Usually they are:*

* *Faces in SiderAddons/livecpk*
* *Ref Faces in SiderAddons/livecpk*
* *Classic Faces in SiderAddons/livecpk*
* *Adboards in SiderAddons/content*
* *stadium or stadium-server folder in SiderAddons/content -> RENAME YOUR STADIUMS FOLDER TO ""stadium-server"" IF ITS NOT NAMED LIKE THAT*
* *Yes you need to start a new ML/BAL Career after this.*

1. Go to your main SP Football Life 2025 (usually located in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\SP Football Life 2025) folder and DELETE your actual SiderAddons folder (backup first what I said above!)
2. Extract all the files that you see inside the MegaPatch 3 RAR over the game folder.
3. To make the Player Dynamic Model work, now the main executable will be named PES2021.exe and the way to execute the game is from the ""MegaPatch 3.bat"" that is given. NOTE:
4. Check ""MegaPatch 3.bat"" file with Notepad to see if the path that contains ""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\SP Football Life 2025"" matches your actual path where you have your FL2025 for both Sider.exe and PES2021.exe. Could be that you have the game in another location so you need to change it.
5. \*\*INTEL 12/13/14 GEN USERS: Read this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SPFootballLife/comments/1i2gihs/custom\_bat\_file\_for\_launch\_pes2021exe\_with\_intel/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPFootballLife/comments/1i2gihs/custom_bat_file_for_launch_pes2021exe_with_intel/)
6. You can make a shortcut of this ""MegaPatch 3.bat"" to have a proper launcher. It basically executes Sider.exe + the new PES2021.exe pointing to PES21Hook.
7. Put the EDIT000000000 file in the Documents\\KONAMI\\eFootball PES 2021 SEASON UPDATE\\2025\\save folder. Overwrite the file.
8. FIX: Download the Entrance Fix for Competitions and replace the Entrance.lua in ""SP Football Life 2025\\SiderAddons\\modules"" folder. It's a very small file.
9. Check the two Alternative Gameplay + Alternative Menus folders if you're interested. They have explanations in TXT.
10. Execute the game as an admin always from that new shortcut you made!
11. Remember to disable ingame music in Game Settings -> Soundtrack by unchecking the songs to enjoy the soundtrack :)

***FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS***

* Q: Do I need to start a new ML or BAL?
   * A: Yes, absolutely. All the work made in database and EDIT requires a new one.
* Q: Will be there a winter transfer update after it ends?
   * A: Yes, I want to make one, but probably it will be around February or March to be aligned with American leagues. No promises yet.
* Q: Does it mean that we will have more realistic Master Leagues?
   * A: Yup. With more injuries, not so unrealistic transfers, not the top tier teams at the bottom in the first season without nonsense.
* Q: There will be new adboards, facepack and stadiums?
   * A: Yes, but after the MegaPatch is released. There will be a new final V6 facepack adapted to it with some of the new classic players added and thousands of updates in the actual ones, more stadium packs and adboards updated, as an addon, not included in the patch.
* Q: How much size it will take?
   * A: It's 38,6 GB compressed RAR, 55GB extracted.
* Q: Will you explain how to modify the database to change or add teams?
   * A: I'll try to make several streams to show you the ejogc editor to make changes. I already showed it a little on my past streams in [Twitch.tv/Gondowan](http://Twitch.tv/Gondowan)
* Q: What does it require?
   * A: Just Football Life 2025 and its update 1.5. Follow the instructions when I'll do the post and you will be fine.

**CREDITS**

As always, this wouldn't be possible without all the modding community that still supports PES 2021. I suggest all of you to go to their EvoWeb threads and thank them, also every facemaker or kitmaker you see in Twitter/X that does it for free.

As the community is decreasing every year (greed, people jumping to eFootball or EA FC or just no motivation to continue modding anymore) this is really hard to keep up. There are a lot of names, but you know who they are: Hawke, minhanh158, Ficabre, zlac, Holland, jibibi, EDWARD77777, Fallons, NFS\_FM, juce, pmalulu24, Tanker01, MeroMero\_08, fdseven, Tiozinho, the VirtuaRED and Ultimate Master League teams and many more.

Of course, in case you want to support all my work, you can do it via Ko-Fi here. I'll appreciate it a lot, and also some of this money has been given to some modders to respect their work:

Thank you all again, and enjoy, even if its for a last time! See you in the pitch as always."

GMGN On-Chain Trading Tool,AllCryptoBets,1hyrohk,2025-01-11 03:35:55,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllCryptoBets/comments/1hyrohk/gmgn_onchain_trading_tool/,montorul,News,"GMGN, is making waves in the cryptocurrency world with the launch of its cutting-edge platform designed to enhance the way traders engage with the rapidly evolving meme token market. Built on advanced artificial intelligence, [GMGN.dev](http://GMGN.dev) offers a comprehensive suite of tools aimed at helping users discover, analyse, and trade meme tokens with greater speed, accuracy, and confidence.

https://preview.redd.it/o1or26q2tbce1.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0abefd95d23d3b0b4fa13c8eaf4e9e0982fd833f

With the growing popularity of meme tokens, such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and many others, the market has become a fast-paced and sometimes unpredictable environment. The whimsical nature of meme tokens, combined with the high volatility of the cryptocurrency space, can make navigating this landscape a daunting task for traders. However, GMGN is changing the game with its AI-powered tools, which offer real-time insights, security checks, and advanced trading strategies that simplify and improve the trading experience.

**Empowering Traders with AI-Driven Tools**

At the core of GMGN‚Äôs platform is a robust set of features tailored to the unique needs of meme token traders. These tools not only provide critical market data but also ensure that users are equipped with the resources needed to make informed decisions in the highly dynamic world of meme tokens. Key features of the GMGN platform include:

Contract Security Checks**:** One of the biggest challenges facing meme token investors is ensuring the legitimacy and security of the tokens they wish to trade. GMGN.dev addresses this issue by conducting thorough contract security checks. These checks include evaluations for liquidity pool burns, honeypot risks, contract renouncement, and mintability. This information helps traders quickly identify whether a token is secure or if it poses potential risks, allowing them to make safer investment decisions.

Insider Tracking**:** Understanding the behaviour of early adopters is crucial in the meme token space, where initial momentum can significantly influence a token‚Äôs price. GMGN.dev‚Äôs Insider Tracking feature allows users to monitor the holdings of early investors, including the first 70 buyers of a given token. By tracking their movements, traders can gain insights into potential profitable opportunities and make more strategic investment decisions.

FOMO Alerts**:** One of the key challenges in the meme token market is the fear of missing out (FOMO) on new and promising tokens. To combat this, GMGN.dev offers real-time FOMO alerts. These notifications alert users to newly launched tokens that are gaining traction, enabling traders to capitalize on emerging trends before they peak. The speed at which these alerts are delivered ensures that users can act quickly, often ahead of the broader market.

Smart Money Tracking**:** Successful trading often involves following the money ‚Äì specifically, tracking the actions of traders who consistently make profitable decisions. GMGN.dev‚Äôs Smart Money Tracking feature enables users to observe and analyse the strategies of top-performing traders. By replicating these strategies, users can enhance their own investment outcomes, benefiting from the expertise of more experienced market participants.

Price Chart Integration**:** GMGN.dev offers seamless integration of price charts directly into the user‚Äôs trading interface. This feature allows traders to monitor token price movements in real time and make data-driven decisions. The integration of price charts also helps users analyse trends, identify entry and exit points, and execute trades at the most opportune moments.

R u g Pull Warnings**:** In the world of meme tokens, r u g pulls ‚Äì where developers abandon a project and take investors‚Äô money ‚Äì are a significant concern. [GMGN.dev](http://GMGN.dev) takes this issue seriously by providing real-time rug pull warnings, particularly on the Solana blockchain, where meme tokens are especially prevalent. By alerting users to potential s c a m s, the platform helps protect traders from losing their investments to fraudulent schemes.



**A Commitment to Security and Transparency**

GMGN has placed a strong emphasis on ensuring that its platform not only delivers powerful trading tools but also maintains the highest standards of security and transparency. The contract security checks are a key feature that underscores this commitment, giving users the ability to evaluate the safety of a token before making an investment. The platform‚Äôs user-friendly interface simplifies this process, allowing even novice traders to assess the risk factors of various tokens quickly.

In addition to its security checks, GMGN offers transparency by providing users with actionable data on the behavior of early adopters and top-performing traders. By tracking these key market participants, users gain access to valuable insights that can guide their trading strategies. This level of transparency is essential in a market where information can be the difference between a successful trade and a costly mistake.

**Revolutionizing the Meme Token Trading Experience**

With the launch of GMGN, traders now have access to a platform specifically designed to address the challenges and opportunities presented by the meme token market. The combination of AI-driven insights, real-time alerts, and security checks creates a comprehensive trading experience that empowers users to navigate the meme token space with confidence.

GMGN‚Äôs CEO, **Jerry Ma**, commented on the platform‚Äôs launch: ‚ÄúWe saw a clear need for a tool that would help traders safely and effectively engage with the meme token market. The volatility of this space is both a challenge and an opportunity, and with GMGN.dev, we‚Äôre providing traders with the resources they need to succeed. Our platform is built on AI technology that can process vast amounts of data in real time, helping users make smarter decisions, faster.‚Äù

Bal-Bas-Beta in Fantasy Strike,FantasyStrike,1hxp0z3,2025-01-09 17:22:51,7,0.9,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyStrike/comments/1hxp0z3/balbasbeta_in_fantasy_strike/,Leodip,Fantasy Strike,"Bal-Bas-Beta, also known as BBB, is a robot built by Geiger, an advanced version of the clockwork soldiers Onimaru uses, which excels at making cold calculations and minimizing risks by keeping the opponent at range where it has incredible advantage. In Yomi, whenver BBB hits the opponent, the game mode is set to ""ranged"", where its opponent's throws do not reach and their attacks do not combo. At the same time, BBB's attacks become very fast and it can also retrieve special attacks used to avoid giving up its advantage by wasting important cards.

Ideally, BBB in a fighting game would be Street Fighter's Dhalsim, since he has stretchy limbs and all. However, since Argagarg already fits the role, I thought of getting inspiration from ARMS' Min Min, with the unique ability of being able to manage two arms at the same time in a completely independent way.

**Bal-Bas-Beta, Clockwork Guardian**

6 HP

**Special mechanics**

* **Heavy**: BBB is heavy, and doesn't know how to jump. The J button makes it do a small awkward hop in place. Slow and very low jump, more like a taunt than a true jump. Very occasionally, you could jump over a low sweep attack like Midori's bA, but the timing it would take makes it unfeasible for viable use, and is more of a [Luigi's down taunt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqAA3iKivdo) kind of thing.
* **Multitasking**: BBB has two limbs, controlled respectively by the A and the B button, and they act completely independently. As such, nA and nB, fA and fB, and bA and bB all do exactly the same thing, just with different arms. As the two limbs act independently, you can perform fB while bA is happening, for example. This is NOT a cancel, but think of it as controlling two identical characters at the same time, each with their own animation and frame data.

**Heavy** is entirely a joke mechanic, mostly to remove BBB's ability to jump. **Multitasking** is the real core of BBB. Being able to perform multiple attacks at the same time is incredibly powerful, but it also introduces a lot of new concepts that don't apply to other characters. For example, saying that an attack is negative for BBB simply means that the opponent recovers before the limb(s) used in that attack can recover. However, this says nothing about the other limb, so for example even though fA is unsafe on block, you can use fB to punish attempts at punishing it.

All of BBB's normal attacks involve extending one of its limbs. While a limb is extended, BBB cannot move, defend, or jump, but can use other attacks that use the non-extended limb. An extended limb is a long hurtbox that can be hit by the opponent at any time.

Finally, before moving onto the moveset, a note about notation: the two arms are identical, so if a combo says fA->bB, it might very well be fB->bA, but not fA->bA.

**Moveset**

* nA and nB: BBB extends its limb diagonally and hits in the air. Good anti-air priority, but slow, making it difficult to use on reaction as an anti-air.
* fA and fB: BBB extends its arm forward, punching the opponent. Startup is slow, but the attack travels through the screen until it hits an opponent (similar to a projectile) or has extended full screen, so the exact frame data depends on the distance between BBB and its opponent. Does chip damage, applies a lot of pushback, but is punishable on block. Generally, the pushback is enough to make the attack safe on block UNLESS you are already at full screen. A blocked fA at close range pushes the opponent at mid-range, and a blocked fA at mid-range pushed the opponent to full screen. As such, fA->fB is a blockstring that pushes the opponent from close quarters to full screen with 2 hits of chip. 
* bA and bB: BBB flicks its arm as a whip low to the ground, KDs on hit and does chip damage. VERY slow and negative, but safe on block, it is mostly used to make a fA safe at distance and apply additional chip.
* C: Junkshot. BBB starts spinning very quickly, hitting with its limbs a total of 4 times in front of him (and 2 chip damage). Reflect projectiles that would hit BBB during the attack. Unsafe on block. Junkshot uses both limbs in this attack, so you cannot use it if any limb is extended UNLESS you are special canceling the extended limb's attack (e.g., fA->C works, but fA->fB->C doesn't because while you are canceling fB into C, fA still has an extended limb). Junkshot is mostly used to reflect projectiles, but you can also use it to cancel a blocked full screen fA if you didn't commit to bB to cover it. None of the attacks combo into Junkshot, but it has niche application in dealing 1 ensured chip damage in close range from bA->C.  
* T: BBB extends both arms towards the opponent, grabs them and smashes them back at full screen. Can only be used if both arms are not in use. Cannot be Yomi countered, but if the throw whiffs (because opponent jumped or attempted to Yomi counter), BBB loses its balance and falls to the ground, giving the opponent ample time to get closer.
* S: has two versions, depending on how close you are to the opponent (c.S if you are within range, f.S if you are far)
   * c.S, Piston Hurricane: flurry of fast punches. Similarly to Junkshot, can only be used if both limbs are retracted or only 1 is extended and you are special canceling into this. A 1 damage reversal that is plus on block, allowing you to follow-up with fA->fB to send the opponent at full screen on block.
   * f.S, Beta Thrust: basically identical to fA, but uses ALL non-extended arms (i.e., if both are retracted, it uses both; if only 1 is retracted, it only uses that 1), and is MUCH faster both in startup and in recovery, being neutral on block. If it uses both limbs, it deals 2 damage (one per limb), otherwise only hits for 1 damage. In general, only using 1 limb is better since it leaves the other one open. For example, bA->f.S->fA->bB is a true safe blockstring that hits for 4 points of chip damage. It is BBB's only tool to hit-confirm (fA -> f.S for 2 damage in total) and, although unlikely, it is possible to do a 3 damage combo using f.S. In particular, f.S -> fA -> fB is 3 damage, however it requires f.S to use only 1 limb, so you can use it by purposely whiffing a nA or during fA/bA recovery as a frametrap.

**Combos, blockstrings and frametraps**

As you might guess, frame data is going to be hell on this guy, so instead of accurately describing how fast certain attacks are to figure out whether stuff combos into other stuff, I'll just explicitly mention what works and what doesn't.

* fA on hit:
   * fA->bB hits for 2 damage and is safe BUT you cannot hit confirm bB since it is very slow except on CH.
   * fA->f.S hits for 2 damage with hit-confirm in case you just want to cash in the extra damage
   * fA -> C kara cancel into f.S hits for 3 damage. In this case, you use the first frames of C to retract the extended limb, then f.S to hit with both limbs.
* fA on block:
   * fA->fB is a frametrap, but you need to time the inputs right. If you mistime it, you'll be punished for 1 damage every single time (2 for certain supers). As a frame trap, if the opponent gets CH by fB, you can hit-confirm with another fA.
   * fA -> bB a much better frametrap since the bB can not be punished (except with a reversal), but requires more precise timing as bB has few active frames and you must commit to it early because of how slow bB is.
   * fA -> C makes fA safe every time on block and can be confirmed into, but removes pressure from the opponent, so it's a backup move in case you were waiting to hit confirm fA -> f.S.
* bA on hit: KD, so no combo are allowed, but you can setup good meaty blockstrings.
* bA on block:
   * bA->fB is a frametrap, and bA->fB->fA is a double frametrap, but it is completely overshadowed by the following.
   * bA->bB is a frametrap, with the option to go into bA->bB->fA and bA->bB->fA->fB for a triple frametrap.
   * bA->C is 1 chip damage guaranteed at close range, but punishable.
* nA on hit
   * nA->C CAN hit the opponent with the last hit from C if the anti-air hit very close to BBB, but it is unreliable at best.
* T:
   * bA can be performed meaty to catch jumps and resetting to KD.

**Closing remarks**

BBB is very technical execution-wisely, since having two independent limbs means you need to manually time everything, rather than rely on cancels or buffered attacks. It is incredibly weak to jumps, but at full screen its inevitability is possibly stronger than Arg. With almost every attack dealing chip, you can expect to deal maybe even most of the damage through chip damage if you manage to keep the opponent at bay. At close range, BBB lacks any reversal outside c.S, and all of the other attacks are remarkably slow. However, managing to catch the opponent with a fA rewards a reset to full screen easily.

I'm not a big fan of stretchy arms characters (Arg/Dhalsim), so I'm not sure whether the character would be considered fun to play as/against. On the other hand, I packed it with timing mixups, which I absolutely love, which makes it very important for the BBB player to get a feel for the opponent's rhythm while not dropping any info about your own."

[Los Angeles, 1913](https://preview.redd.it/fj2w4l95bybe1.png?width=1159&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4c57408c58a7b2f70a708e6322a88076c028fd7)

The dawn broke over Los Angeles Bay, its golden light stretching across the water, bathing the anchored ships in a hazy, gilded glow. On the wharf, a few early risers‚Äîdockhands, fishermen, and the occasional sailor‚Äîwent about their business, their movements a symphony of creaks, shouts, and clanging tools. In the distance, the dark silhouette of a German vessel loomed against the horizon, drawing curious glances from the gathered crowd.

The ship bore the unmistakable markings of the Imperial German Navy, its iron hull a stark contrast to the more familiar merchant vessels of the harbor. It had arrived unannounced in the early hours, slipping into port with an almost ghostly silence. No fanfare, no diplomatic envoy‚Äîonly the quiet hum of its engines and the whispers it stirred among the dockworkers. As the gangplank descended, a group of tourists embarked on their journeys, however one lone figure emerged from the shadow of the ship‚Äôs deck. Clad in a long, weathered trench coat and a wide-brimmed hat pulled low over his face, the man exuded an air of mystery that immediately commanded attention. A black mask covered the upper half of his face, revealing only a strong jawline and piercing eyes that seemed to scan the crowd with measured intensity. The dockworkers paused, their chatter falling to an uneasy silence as the man stepped onto the wharf. He moved with a deliberate, almost regal bearing, his boots clicking against the worn wooden planks. In one gloved hand, he carried a leather satchel, its corners scuffed and worn, and in the other, a simple walking stick.

&#x200B;

‚Äú*Who‚Äôs that, you reckon?*‚Äù one dockhand whispered to his companion.

&#x200B;

‚Äú*Don‚Äôt know,*‚Äù the other replied, his voice low. ‚Äú*But he don‚Äôt look like no sailor.*‚Äù  


The stranger said nothing as he approached the customs officer, who stood at his post with a clipboard in hand. Hundreds of thousands of immigrants had come into Los Angeles before, the ""Flavor Wave"" of the Meyer and outgoing Fish administrations had brought in a hailstorm of foreigners, to the chagrin of the nativists. The officer, a stout man with a bushy mustache, seemed momentarily taken aback by the figure before him but quickly recovered his professional demeanor.

&#x200B;

‚Äú*Name and purpose of visit?*‚Äù the officer asked, his pen poised over the clipboard.

&#x200B;

The stranger hesitated, as if weighing his words carefully. Then, in a voice that was both gravelly and refined, he replied, ‚Äú*I am a citizen returning home.*‚Äù

&#x200B;

The officer frowned. ‚Äú*Name?*‚Äù

The man removed his hat and mask in one fluid motion, revealing a face that had once been known to every corner of the nation. The graying hair and lines of age had done little to diminish the unmistakable features of a Bull Moose. Gasps rippled through the small crowd, disbelief mingling with shock as the realization set in. Theodore Roosevelt, the Rough Rider, a hero of the War of the Continental Alliance, the fiery former Representative of New York, and the man presumed dead for nearly eight years, now stood before them alive and in the flesh.

&#x200B;

‚Äú*By God,*‚Äù the customs officer stammered, nearly dropping his clipboard. ‚Äú*It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs you.*‚Äù

&#x200B;

Roosevelt offered a wry smile, though his eyes betrayed a weariness that spoke of untold hardships. ‚Äú*Yes.*‚Äù he said simply.

&#x200B;

The news spread like wildfire through the city and beyond. Within hours, newspapers across the nation carried the headline: ***THEODORE ROOSEVELT RETURNS FROM THE DEAD!*** The mysterious circumstances of his disappearance and the equally enigmatic nature of his return ignited a flurry of speculation. Where had he been? How had he survived? And why had he returned now? As Roosevelt made his way through the throngs of reporters and well-wishers that had gathered, he remained tight-lipped, offering no answers to the barrage of questions hurled his way. Yet his mere presence was enough to send shockwaves through a country still grappling with the scars of revolution, famine, and political upheaval. So, that elephant in the room stood still. What had happened to him?  


**Roosevelt's Odyssey I: South America**

[A photo of the Federacion Obrera Regional Argentina \(Argentina Regional Worker's Federation\), the labor wing of the Revolutionary Social Union after taking over the Argentine government](https://preview.redd.it/8041igzytybe1.png?width=1268&format=png&auto=webp&s=76d57523e93ad57d363554f79e20bb7a22ab5df7)

The skies above Argentina roared with turmoil as Theodore Roosevelt sat in the cramped cockpit of a biplane, scanning the horizon. He had just embarked from Bahia Blanca. Below him, the land stretched out in a quilt of chaos. Smoke rose in dark plumes from burning fields and cities, the first flames of the Argentine Revolution. It was supposed to be a brief reconnaissance trip‚Äîa daring gesture for a man known for his relentless spirit. But as the aircraft hummed through the heavy air, Roosevelt‚Äôs instincts prickled.

&#x200B;

His pilot, a young Argentinian named Francisco, leaned back and shouted over the roar of the engine. ‚Äú*Sir Roosevelt, we must turn back soon! These skies are dangerous!*‚Äù

&#x200B;

Roosevelt grinned, his teeth bared in a display of confidence. ‚Äú*Nonsense! Just a little farther. We need a clearer view of the countryside!*‚Äù

&#x200B;

Suddenly, a sharp crack split the air, followed by the jarring hum of something piercing the fuselage. Roosevelt's grin vanished as the biplane lurched violently to the side.

&#x200B;

‚Äú*¬°Dios m√≠o!*‚Äù Francisco yelled. ‚Äú*We‚Äôve been hit!*‚Äù

&#x200B;

Roosevelt‚Äôs hands gripped the sides of the cockpit as the plane spiraled downward, the earth rushing toward them in a dizzying blur. The crash was thunderous, metal screaming against the ground as the aircraft crumpled upon impact. Roosevelt felt his body tossed like a ragdoll, then everything went black. When he awoke, the world was eerily silent. The wreckage of the biplane lay scattered around him, its twisted remains glinting faintly in the dim light of dawn. Francisco was nowhere to be seen. Roosevelt groaned, his body aching from the crash, but to his astonishment, he was alive. He took stock of his surroundings. The plane had come down in a dense patch of pampas grass, the softness of the ground sparing him from a worse fate. His left arm throbbed painfully, likely sprained, but he could walk. Roosevelt staggered to his feet, brushing dirt and blood from his face.

&#x200B;

‚Äú*Thank heaven for small mercies,*‚Äù he muttered to himself.  


The first few days were a blur of survival. Roosevelt scavenged what he could from the wreckage‚Äîan emergency knife, a canteen, and a few supplies. The Argentine Revolution raged all around him‚Äîfueled by rage of anti-Americanism‚Äîwith factions of soldiers and rebels clashing violently. The distant echoes of gunfire and the sight of smoke trails in the sky were constant reminders of the danger he faced. Roosevelt moved cautiously, his natural instinct for strategy guiding him through the chaos. He avoided the main roads, knowing they would be swarming with fighters, and instead relied on his knowledge of maps and the stars to navigate. By the fourth day, he stumbled upon a small, abandoned farmhouse. The place was ransacked, likely by revolutionaries or fleeing families, but it offered temporary shelter. Roosevelt rested there for a night, nursing his wounds and gathering his thoughts. He knew he had to head north, toward Brazil, where he might find safety. The Brazilian government and public were still grateful for the American support in their campaign against Argentina.

&#x200B;

As weeks turned into months, Roosevelt‚Äôs journey became a test of endurance and willpower. He learned to adapt to the land, foraging for food and purifying water from streams. His fluency in Spanish after being imprison in Buenos Aires and his gift for diplomacy proved invaluable when he encountered small groups of villagers or guerrilla fighters. In one particularly harrowing encounter, Roosevelt narrowly escaped capture by a band of revolutionaries. Spotted while crossing an open field, he was forced to flee into the dense jungle. The chase lasted for hours, and by the time he lost his pursuers, he was covered in cuts and drenched in sweat. Yet even then, his indomitable spirit refused to falter.

&#x200B;

‚Äú*This is nothing compared to Buenos Aires' prison camps,*‚Äù he muttered, clenching his fists.  


By December, Roosevelt crossed the border into Brazil. Exhausted and emaciated, he was taken in by a remote missionary outpost deep in the Amazon. The missionaries were astonished by his tale, though they barely recognized the once-vibrant politician before them. Roosevelt spent weeks recovering under their care, regaining his strength and plotting his return to the United States. But word soon reached him that his disappearance had been widely publicized, and many believed him dead. The chaos of the revolution had erased any trace of his crash, leaving no one to question the official narrative.

&#x200B;

‚Äú*Perhaps it is better this way,*‚Äù he mused to himself one evening, staring into the flickering light of a campfire. ‚Äú*A man presumed dead has the freedom to move unseen.*‚Äù  


Roosevelt's survival instincts and charisma carried him through the turmoil of the Brazilian wilderness. For two years, he lived among small villages in Brazil, learning from local communities, working alongside them, and earning their respect. After so many years in the local lands, he eventually grew to be almost fluent in Brazilian Portuguese. These years of obscurity gave Roosevelt time to reflect on his life and goals, but his restless spirit yearned for more. In late 1907, opportunity presented itself. Roosevelt managed to board a cargo ship bound for Manila under the guise of a simple traveler. By mid-1908, he arrived in the Philippines, a land simmering with discontent under colonial rule. He spent the next year exploring the islands, immersing himself in their culture and politics, and observing the brewing unrest.

**Roosevelt's Odyssey II: The Philippines**

 

Roosevelt initially resided in the bustling city of Manila, the colonial capital, where Spanish and now German influences blended with the vibrant local culture. Fascinated by the island‚Äôs diverse history, Roosevelt immersed himself in its rich traditions, befriending locals and learning Tagalog. He often found himself wandering through the city‚Äôs markets, where the scents of tropical fruits mingled with the aroma of freshly cooked adobo and pancit. Eager to avoid drawing attention, Roosevelt found work as a clerk for a local trading company. The work was mundane, but it provided him with enough to live modestly while allowing him time to write in his journal. His writings during this period reveal a man deeply reflective of his circumstances, grappling with his displacement yet marveling at the Filipino society under the German colonial administration.

Roosevelt soon learned of the growing divide among Filipino revolutionary leaders Emilio Aguinaldo and Andr√©s Bonifacio. Aguinaldo, a pragmatic military leader, commanded a well-organized force, while Bonifacio, the ideological ""Father of the Revolution,"" led a looser coalition of rebels who clung to the dream of total liberation. The schism weakened the resistance, and by late 1909, Bonifacio‚Äôs position had become perilous. When Bonifacio succumbed to malaria in October 1909, Aguinaldo seized the opportunity to invade the rival territories, seeking to consolidate power. Roosevelt recognized the urgency of the situation. He infiltrated Bonifacio‚Äôs fractured camp and offered his services as a military strategist to Artemio Ricarte, one of Bonifacio's trusted lieutenants.Roosevelt's keen understanding of military tactics and his ability to inspire confidence proved invaluable to the beleaguered Bonifacio faction. He advised Ricarte on fortifications, supply chains, and guerrilla warfare, gradually turning the tide against Aguinaldo's forces. He was now known locally by the war name ""**Theodoro Hontiveros**,"". Roosevelt's charisma and undeniable knack for leadership galvanized the rebels, who began to see him not as a foreigner but as one of their own.

&#x200B;

Under Ricarte's command and with Roosevelt's strategic input, the Bonifacio faction fought a grueling yearlong campaign against Aguinaldo‚Äôs forces. By late 1910, Ricarte had unified the rebel territories under his control. Victory was not merely a military triumph‚Äîit was a symbolic one, restoring hope to a fractured movement. Roosevelt, or ""Hontiveros,"" was hailed as a hero, his name spoken with reverence in rebel strongholds and villages alike. In early 1911, with the rebel lands unified and relative stability achieved, Roosevelt returned to Manila. Though his involvement in the revolution had been covert, whispers of his deeds spread quickly. In the eyes of many Filipinos fighting up north against the German colonial administration, he was a liberator, a man who had stood with them in their darkest hour. Despite offers of power and prestige, Roosevelt declined, seeking instead to continue his journey of self-discovery. ""Theodoro Hontiveros"" was no longer just a name whispered in the jungles of the Philippines, it was a title bestow upon those who were adaptable against the ravages of the world.

**Roosevelt's Odyssey III: East Asia**

He had spent nearly a year in the rebel-controlled areas of the Philippines, away from the socialized city-life. Yet, even after the thrill of battle and the prestige of his role in the revolution, Roosevelt‚Äôs thirst for adventure and knowledge was far from quenched. He decided that his trip back home should be postponed. He was sure his wife would understand. Roosevelt's first destination after leaving the Philippines was Saigon, in French Indochina. The region was under heavy French colonial influence, a fact that Roosevelt was keen to observe firsthand. As he disembarked from his ship, the humid air of Saigon hit him, and the bustling streets, filled with both native Vietnamese and French expatriates, greeted him with a mixture of colonial opulence and the palpable tension of resistance brewing beneath the surface. Statues of the late Emperors Napoleon I, Napoleon II, Napoleon III, and Napoleon IV loomed over much of the city center.

&#x200B;

In Saigon, Roosevelt spent several months, traveling throughout the countryside and observing the dynamics between the French colonists and the indigenous population. He noted the French emphasis on economic exploitation of the land, their role in the cultivation of rubber and rice, and the increasingly vocal nationalist movements that were starting to emerge in the region. Roosevelt, ever the pragmatist, expressed his belief that colonial powers should work with the local peoples for mutual benefit, a viewpoint that often put him at odds with the French authorities, who viewed the Vietnamese population as subjects to be controlled. Yet it wasn‚Äôt the political realities of French Indochina that most captivated Roosevelt‚Äîit was the complexities of the region‚Äôs cultural landscape. He delved into the local traditions, learned about the Confucian influence on Vietnamese society, and marveled at the resilience of the people. His interactions with local Vietnamese leaders and intellectuals provided him with deeper insight into the realities of life under colonial rule, a theme that would shape his worldview in the years to come.  


By the end of 1911, Roosevelt made his way to the island of Taiwan, then under Japanese rule following the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki. Taiwan was a strategic island in the Pacific, vital to Japan's growing empire. Roosevelt was both fascinated and disturbed by the speed and efficiency with which the Japanese had integrated Taiwan into their empire, and he was particularly struck by the contrast between the modernization of the island and the lingering feudalism that persisted in the countryside. In Taihoku, Roosevelt spent time learning about the Japanese administration of the island. He was impressed by the Japanese efforts to modernize infrastructure, build railroads, and create a modern public health system. However, he was also deeply critical of the harsh treatment of the indigenous Taiwanese people and the imposition of Japanese culture on a diverse island population. During his time in Taiwan, Roosevelt observed the tensions that simmered between the Japanese settlers and the native Taiwanese population, which had long been subject to the imperialist expansion. Roosevelt‚Äôs experiences in Taiwan gave him a greater understanding of Japan‚Äôs aggressive imperialism in the region, further fueling his belief that the United States should maintain a strong military presence in Asia to protect its interests, even as he advocated for a more ethical and just approach to governance.  


By 1912, Roosevelt had grown increasingly interested in China, a nation on the cusp of great change. After leaving Taiwan, Roosevelt traveled to Peking, where he witnessed firsthand the final days of the Qing Dynasty. The 1911 revolution that had toppled the Qing was still fresh in the minds of the Chinese people, and the newly-formed Republic of China was struggling to establish its footing. In Peking, Roosevelt had the opportunity to meet with both Chinese revolutionaries and diplomats from foreign powers. He was particularly fascinated by the rise of Sun Yat-sen and his movement, which sought to establish a republican China free from imperial rule. Roosevelt, who had long been an advocate for democratic reforms, found himself sympathetic to Sun Yat-sen‚Äôs vision for China‚Äôs future, but he was also keenly aware of the challenges the country faced in breaking free from centuries of imperial rule. He allegedly had met Dr. Sun during his visit, though that story had not been confirmed.

&#x200B;

However, Roosevelt was confirmed to have met Sun's closest lieutenant's, the young Lt. Chiang Kai-shek, who reported saw the undercover Roosevelt as an odd and ambitious man who spoke to non-sensical visions. Roosevelt‚Äôs time in Peking was marked by his deepening interest in China‚Äôs internal struggles and the external pressures that threatened its sovereignty. He was especially vocal in his belief that the United States needed to shift its foreign policy toward a more active role in China‚Äôs development, promoting stability, democracy, and economic growth. Roosevelt would often engage in heated debates with European diplomats, who were largely concerned with maintaining their own imperialist footholds in China, and American businessmen, who were eager to open new markets for trade. Roosevelt also visited American-occupied Fujian, being reportedly impressed the innovations of the region compared to the rest of China. Roosevelt‚Äôs experience in China further solidified his conviction that the United States should lead the charge for global peace and prosperity, not just for its own benefit but for the benefit of all nations. His engagement with Chinese revolutionaries and political leaders marked a pivotal moment in his ideological evolution, as he began to view America not only as a beacon of freedom but also as a potential global leader in promoting democratic ideals.

**Roosevelt's Odyssey IV: Homecoming**  


Alas, the decision to return home was never one that Roosevelt made lightly. After almost eight years of wandering the globe, escaping revolution, aiding rebels, and observing the geopolitical shifts in the Far East, Roosevelt stood at the precipice of his journey‚Äôs final chapter. His time spent traveling across Asia, from the tumult of the Philippine islands to the corridors of power in Peking, had profoundly reshaped his perspective on the world. Yet, despite the exhilaration of adventure and the intellectual stimulation he found in foreign lands, there was an undeniable pull to return to the United States. It was a pull that called to him with the promise of unfinished business, of a country in need of leadership at a time of unprecedented change. The decision came to Roosevelt one crisp morning in late December 1912, as he stood on the deck of a German cargo ship docked in Manila Bay. The Philippine sun was setting behind him, casting long shadows over the harbor. Roosevelt leaned against the wooden railing, gazing out at the darkening horizon. In his mind, the images of his travels and his military successes in the Philippines, his efforts in aiding Artemio Ricarte, and his observations of the emerging world powers‚Äîparticularly Japan‚Äîswirled together. But beyond all that, he knew one truth: America was at a crossroads, and it needed him once more. He had long been fascinated by the forces that were shaping the future of nations. In Saigon, he had witnessed the brutal power of colonialism. In Taipei, he had seen the speed of Japanese modernization. In Peking, he had observed a nation on the brink of transformation, struggling between revolution and chaos. Yet, for all the insights he had gained, Roosevelt realized that his work was not yet done. The United States, for all its triumphs and troubles, remained his true calling.

&#x200B;

‚Äú*I‚Äôve seen what the world has to offer,*‚Äù Roosevelt mused quietly to himself. ‚Äú*Now, it‚Äôs time to see what I can offer to it.*‚Äù  


In the years following his disappearance, Roosevelt had been transformed. Gone was the brash, swaggering political figure who had led the Rough Riders during the South American War, and in his place was a man who had witnessed the fragility of global empires and the delicate balance of power. Yet, despite his intellectual evolution, Roosevelt could not shake the deep-rooted belief that the United States, in all its flaws, held a special place in the world. The country had been his life's purpose, the arena in which he had won his greatest victories and confronted his fiercest enemies. It was now time to reenter that world, to shape its future once more. But the political landscape of the United States had shifted in his absence. The nation had undergone upheaval, with the old power structures and political establishments being challenged by the winds of reform. It was a new era, one that needed new leadership‚Äîa leader who could unite the fractured nation and guide it through the storm of economic inequality, military overreach, and global competition.

&#x200B;

The election of 1912 was nearing its conclusion, and Roosevelt, aware of the momentous political shifts, began to think more seriously about re-entering public life. In Asia, he had remained largely out of the political spotlight, but he had kept a careful eye on the developments back home. The rise of the Homeland and Visionary parties, the continued dominance of old money in the form of the money interests, and the ongoing struggles between business elites and labor movements all weighed heavily on his mind. Roosevelt knew the country needed someone who could balance reform with order, someone who could dismantle the monopolistic forces while retaining the strength of America‚Äôs military power. The final push to return came when he heard of the political shifts back in America. The country was struggling under the weight of political stagnation. The Social Revolution of 1905‚Äî and of course the Revolutionary Uprising of 1909‚Äî had left deep scars, and though the Second Bill of Rights had established a ""degree of welfare"" for the working class, it had also opened the door for rising radicalism. The nation‚Äôs need for stable leadership was more apparent than ever. The chaos of the past was finally catching up to the present, and Roosevelt knew that it would take someone with a strong sense of direction, someone who had seen the horrors of revolution firsthand, to steer the ship.

&#x200B;

He would not return simply as a politician or as a leader of the Progressive cause; he would return as a man who had seen the world in its rawest form. His experiences in Brazil, the Philippines, and China had strengthened his belief in America‚Äôs role in global affairs, and it had confirmed that the United States must regain its strength‚Äînot just militarily, but economically and socially. Roosevelt had come to see America not only as a beacon of liberty but as the necessary counterweight to the authoritarianism and imperialism he had witnessed abroad. Roosevelt‚Äôs final decision to return was made with a quiet confidence that had not always been present in his earlier years. He knew the road back would be fraught with obstacles. His absence had created a void in American politics, and many had wondered what had become of him. Some had assumed he was lost to history. 

&#x200B;

He spent the next several weeks preparing for his return. It would not be a dramatic reentry into the political fray‚Äîthere would be no public speeches or grand gestures. Instead, he would quietly make his way back to America, where his influence would once again be felt, this time in a nation that had undergone its own transformation. On **January 3, 1913**, Roosevelt boarded a German cargo ship in Manila headed to California. As the ship sailed through the warm Pacific waters, Roosevelt sat quietly on the deck, reflecting on the years he had spent away from home. He had no intention of returning as a savior or as a grand hero. He would return as a statesman‚Äîa self-proclaimed leader with a vision for America‚Äôs future. The world had changed in ways that even Roosevelt had not fully anticipated, but he was ready to engage with it once again.

&#x200B;

As the ship made its way toward the west coast of the United States, Roosevelt thought of the nation that had given him so much. America was still his home, the place where he had first tasted the joys of victory and suffered the pains of loss. He was a man who had traveled far and seen much, and now, with a new understanding of the world‚Äôs complexities, he was prepared to help lead America into the future. The journey had been long, but Roosevelt was finally returning to the land he loved, with a resolve as unshakable as ever. He had learned much during his years of exile, but now it was time to put that knowledge to work in the service of the American people. The world was changing‚Äîand Roosevelt, ever the adventurer, was ready to change it alongside his country. At the very least, he knew he was getting an earful from his wife once he returned back to New York.

**Roosevelt's Odyssey V: Writings**  


During his extended stay in the Philippines, Theodore Roosevelt kept a keen eye on global events, using his time in the bustling port city of Manila to stay informed about the socio-political upheavals shaping the world. Through expatriate circles, consular reports, and foreign newspapers, Roosevelt learned about the tense diplomatic landscape that had emerged over the past decade. It was in this environment that he began to form his critiques of the major powers, eventually penning his observations into a groundbreaking book, *A Critical Opinion of the Global Climate*, published in late February 1913.  


Roosevelt became fascinated with the escalating tensions between the European powers, particularly the recent Agadir Crisis of 1911. The near-confrontation between Germany and France over Morocco struck him as emblematic of the precarious balance of power in Europe. Roosevelt criticized both nations for their imperial ambitions, calling the crisis ""*a quarrel of avarice disguised as diplomacy.*"" To him, the resulting Treaty of Fez‚Äîa compromise that granted France control of Morocco while offering Germany territorial compensation in Central Africa‚Äîwas a short-term fix that would not address the deeper tensions underlying the continent. 

He also followed the Balkan Wars, in which Anglo-German alliance's support of the Ottoman Empire allowed the Turks to retain key territories despite the rising tide of Balkan nationalism. Roosevelt viewed this as a pragmatic but short-sighted move, arguing that ""*propping up a rotting tree only delays its fall.*"" Roosevelt considered this alignment a calculated move by both powers to preserve the Ottoman Empire as a counterweight against Russian expansion and the massive French sphere of influence. He admired the strategic foresight but recognized the fragile nature of the Ottoman state, whose territories were still vulnerable to nationalist uprisings and external pressure.    


The French, meanwhile, had aligned themselves with Italy‚Äôs seizure of Libya, an act Roosevelt condemned as opportunistic and indicative of Europe‚Äôs unquenchable thirst for expansion in Africa. He marveled at the boldness of Italy‚Äôs military campaign but was skeptical of its long-term success. ‚Äú*An empire built on sand is as unstable as the desert itself,*‚Äù he reportedly wrote in a letter to a friend in Manila, reflecting his belief that Italy lacked the resources and unity to sustain a major colonial enterprise. 

 

The growing independence movements in Ireland and India also reached Roosevelt‚Äôs ears through British expatriates and newspapers in Manila. He was particularly captivated by the Irish struggle for Home Rule, which had gained momentum under the leadership of John Redmond and the Irish Parliamentary Party. While sympathetic to their cause, Roosevelt saw the Irish movement as emblematic of Britain‚Äôs declining grip on its empire. Similarly, reports of unrest in India intrigued him. The rise of leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Mohandas K. Gandhi signaled the beginning of a broader challenge to British rule. Roosevelt admired the tenacity of these movements but questioned whether Britain, distracted by European rivalries, could effectively address the growing demand for self-governance across its empire.  


Near the end of his writings, Roosevelt wrote:  
*""The old world clings to its imperial pretenses, yet the cracks are visible for all to see. These are not merely the games of kings and diplomats; they are the seeds of upheaval. The age of empires trembles on the brink of change, and though I am far removed from the theater, I am no less a witness to the drama unfolding.""*   


*‚ÄúA Critical Opinion of the Global Climate‚Äù* was published in February 1913, just weeks after Roosevelt‚Äôs return to the United States. It became an instant bestseller, mainly due to the fanfare around Roosevelt's return, however it was praised by critics for its clarity, depth, and Roosevelt‚Äôs distinctive style. However, certain political figures derided Roosevelt‚Äôs critiques of the militaristic fervor in the empires as naive, with Senator, and incoming Vice President, James K. Vardaman dismissing it as ""*the ramblings of a man who abandoned his nation in its hour of need.*""   


Though finally, in the book‚Äôs preface, he wrote:  
*""The fates of nations are intertwined; the recklessness of one affects all. It is not strength but wisdom that will guide the world into the future.‚Äù*

Personal Wishes for TES VI,TESVI,1hw27v8,2025-01-07 16:14:19,36,0.89,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/TESVI/comments/1hw27v8/personal_wishes_for_tes_vi/,pdiz8133,,"Figure today is a good day to share this since we are now as far separated from the trailer as the trailer was from Skyrim. I try to keep most realistic but will try to notate when a wish is unlikely or unfeasible.

#Magic:
* **Spell Crafting**: Alternatively, provide a more comprehensive coverage of spells (Destruction example: have touch, stream, ranged, cloak, rune, and large aoe spells at multiple different levels. Novice flames vs Master flames). The Mysticism mod is a good example.
* **Proper Scaling**: No more useless late game Destruction. Either scale the spells themselves or scale with the character (perks/skill levels/attributes, more on this later). This can be fixed with the spell crafting bullet.
* **UI Accessibility**: There needs to be a better way than the current (modern BGS) favorites menu/actual menus to pick between your arsenal of 10s to 100s of spells. A Spell Wheel could be good. Maybe a quick menu to choose the branch of magic which has its own wheel to select spells from. Add third Key/button to cast from to allow casting while holding bows/two handed weapons. Could be a perk locked behind a magic tree so not every character has the option.
* **Spell Options**: Thematic spell packages for specific guilds, maybe Dark Brotherhood vendors will sell unique spells to aid with assassin roleplay, or Vigilants of Stendarr will sell anti-undead spells (Dawnguard did this), Disease spells from Peryite worshippers, and so on. The Triumvirate mod is a great example of adding in many thematic options. For non-themed spells, bring back touch spells for greater damage but no range, include Absorb spells (Magicka, Health, Stamina) like the anniversary edition of skyrim did, Unlock spells (Rather than unlock different level locks, could just lower lock difficulty by 1 or 2 levels. Lowering below novice would mean a full unlock), add a disguise spell to look like target, more bound weapon options (maybe even a shield), more animal/beast familiar conjures (druid/shaman style), more conjure options (Daedroth, Clannfear, Scamp, etc. would also be fun to have more thematic conjures based on guilds/daedric quests completed ex: spectral assassin)
* **Better Necromancy**: Let us raise lots of weaker minions like skeletons vs fewer strong summons/reanimations (maybe some necromancy spells would cost health instead/as well) Could also differ between raised humanoids vs raised beasts as in they don't affect the limit of one vs the other.
* **Imbuing**: Allow the PC to use a spell with an equipped weapon to generate a mini temporary enchantment like effect. Could also work with bound weapons.
* **Better Staff Implementation**: Rather than all staves acting as free spells, maybe some could amplify your own magic. Perhaps with a slam the ground animation while you cast with the other hand which makes the spell more powerful than a dual cast version. Let us live our best Gandalf lives.
* **Better Spell Learning System**: Tomes teach the base novice spells but otherwise just help speed up the process of learning spells which is done through experience of using lower level spells and perhaps the same mechanics as spell crafting.


# Guilds & Quest Lines:
* **Branching Paths**: Branching paths allow for player choice to have more impact on their experience throughout the story. It requires a lot more work but would be a very rewarding experience. Fewer guilds as part of the base game but with longer, Branching paths is better than more guilds with linear stories. Starting with the same usual 4 with branching in-depth quest lines is better than 6 or 7 all with one standard story. Use DLC to add more different types of guilds or stories.
* Alternatively, **Conflicting Joinable Guilds**: (Skyrim examples:) Silver Hand opposing Companions, Mjoll forming an anti Thieves Guild support group, an actual Penitus Oculatus quest line to defeat the dark brotherhood, Necromancers kicked out of the college. These competing guilds could have headquarters and both quest lines culminate with one side taking over the others at the conclusion of questlines ala Dawnguard.
* **Unique and Themed Guilds**: Have more *unique guilds* like merchants/banks, craftsmen, hunters, necromancers, witch hunters, cults following aedra/daedra, alchemists, etc. (I know I said just said stick to the basic 4 but these could still be added in as something that is present to later allow joining and receive a questline properly through DLC PLEASE NOT CC). *Themed guilds* would be like how Morrowind had the Morag Tong and Skyrim had the Companions where the generic Fighters/Mages/Thieves/Assassins Guild is replaced by a thematic guild for the location (Hammerfell example: Hashashim-esque assassins style guild that silences enemies of the leading faction)
* **Immersive Guilds**: Have quests focus on the skills specific to the guild. You NEED magic skills to advance through the Mages Guild, or sneak skills for Thieves guild, etc. Better to need them to complete quests or get through quest dungeons than numerical skill level requirements but those work as a weak solution.
* **Alternative Quest Completion**: Allow for more unique methods of completing quests. Example: being a part of guilds allows for specific completion methods for the main quest or other guilds. Starfield had a bit of this where you could use faction status to bypass persuasion checks. Pacifist options as well.
* **Guild Design**: Please for the love of Mara, bring back ranks! Allow us to feel like we're progressing through a guild rather than just following a story and being placed in positions that feel way too important for some nobody just off the street. Maybe even allow for prior achievements to impact your starting rank so that the famed Dragonborn who just defeated Alduin maybe joins a little higher than as a whelp of The Companions. Radiant quests and skill levels could help gatekeep ranks. We just need some proper pacing.
* **Guild Leadership**: If a guild has you become the leader (which not all guilds should do), don't have that be the end. Give it a purpose. Allow for the player to make some drastic changes or have some potential world-defining impacts as the leader of a substantial guild. Similar to how the player chooses >!to restart the serpent's crusade or not!< in Starfield's Shattered Space but maybe a little more impactful but even just random encounters would be nice. Shattered Space is a good start but expand on it. Additionally, becoming the leader of a guild could lock you from other guilds as the time requirement to run a guild would be immense. If you want to join a different guild, you would have to step down.
* **Guild Presence**: Allow guilds to have more locations than just their headquarters. Guilds can have various presence in different cities. Maybe big headquarters in one they're most culturally tied to but smaller branches in other cities to show they have influence there.
* **Bandit Clans with Joinable Bandits** (Good candidate for DLC): Regions of the map are controlled by different bandit clans similar to Nuka World Fallout 4. Not all are joinable but they do vie for position and potentially grow stronger in numbers when doing well. Allowing the player to join could lead to capture the fort style mechanics and establishing control over routes to extort travelers. Option for passive income, settlement style building, etc.
* **Daedric Quests** (maybe even Aedra quests): These are usually always good fun, so why not more of a good thing. More quests like the book of love for Mara in Skyrim. Maybe better design rather than being a glorified messenger but you could easily do something for the ~~8~~ 9 divines and a few more deities from the locale of choice (Hammerfell could feature Elven or Yokudan pantheons). Could have competing quest lines for some Daedric quests for alternative morality. Examples: a small group trying to stop Mehrunes Dagon or another Daedra trying to thwart one another such as Boethiah offering a way to counter Molag Bal‚Äôs plans. Just some way to roleplay these as a follower vs crusader.
* **Mastering Skill Quests**: Could be given by the master trainer for said skill. Rewards could entail learning different fighting styles, master spells, unique sneak tricks, etc.
* **Race-specific Quests**: A long shot but these could be where you try to connect to your chosen races culture or ancestors in a loreful way.
* **Class-specific Quests**: Another long shot but if classes are implemented, could have side quests unique to each one that could further help shape roleplay.


# Skills
* **Skill Tree Overhaul**: I think skyrim got it mostly right that skill trees were the way to go and that each skill has perks which can customize how the user interacts with said skills. Currently in skyrim, [each skill changes the game slightly behind the scenes](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Skills). This should be kept and improved slightly for magic skills. This could be improved upon to eliminate some of the less interesting perks. Currently, Alteration, Conjuration, Destruction, Restoration and Illusion levels reduce cost count with level 100 resulting in a 41% decrease in cost. This is a good start but each skill should also respectively scale their branch of magics spells to increase intensity of damage/duration/level. The crafting skills already cover what they need to. Enchanting levels increase enchantment effectiveness up to 25% at level 100, Smithing levels improve tempering quality by a formula, Alchemy increases effectiveness of brewed poisons/potions by 0.5% per level. Heavy and Light Armor increase armor rating by 0.4% per level while One-handed, Two-Handed, and Archery increases damage by 0.5% per level. These could have their percentages boosted to eliminate simple numeric perks about dealing x% more damage that act as a skill dump. Lockpicking levels increase the size of sweet spot while Pickpocket levels increase chance of success. Both (assuming they don't get combined into a security type skill) could also increase odds of finding unique loot. Sneak and speech are more or less fine as is, sneak level reduce detection chance in enemies by a formula and speech levels increase persuasion chance and improve bartering by a formula. Building on this, have skills auto level a perk at 25, 50, 75, and 100 (similar to how Oblivion worked) to allow skill leveling to be more impactful without perk investment and keep perks a more role-playing decision where they change your approach to the skill rather than simple numerical boost. These could be central nodes of the trees that gatekeep perks that you'd want to lock until a higher level. Skyrim examples: the magic trees and their reduced cost for novice/apprentice (25), adept (50), expert (75), and master (100) perks, weapon trees that allow for sprinting power attacks (25), decapitation(50), hitting multiple from side slashes (75), paralyze chance on backwards power attacks (100) etc. Perks should change how you play, not just make you stronger.
* **Acrobatics/Athletics/Wayfaring Skill**: Being able to sprint faster, jump higher, slide, roll, hurdle would be cool and starfield added some of this so it's a possibility! A skill tree that allows for differing movement abilities without locking it behind random trees like light armor or sneak would go a long way to customization of characters. Tying this into a wayfaring style tree rather than just acrobatics/athletics would allow for perks relating to exploration and/or survival if/when a survival mode is present. Perks could include collecting more meat/ingredients, reduced stamina cost for sprinting out of combat, allowing for more campsites if camping is implemented, etc.
* **Unarmed/Fist Weapons**: The lack of dedicated tree for Unarmed/Fist Weapons hampers a very common playstyle. If not a whole tree, at least dedicate an entire branch of another tree like one-handed or acrobatics to unarmed combat.
* **Cooking**: Likely doesn't need its own tree and could be part of Alchemy but I just want cooking to not feel useless for 90% of meals outside of survival mode and then there's the vegetable soup steroid. Both Fallout and Starfield have at least devoted specific perks towards cooking so maybe there is hope for at least some minor attention.
* **Beast Forms**: Try to keep vampire and werewolf abilities and skill trees. This could be a DLC feature as well if it isn't as essential in the main game similar to Dawnguard.


# Character Building & Role-playing
* **New Game+**: First, the elephant in the room. Todd has been on record complaining about the trend in Skyrim where players frequently restarted the game, expressing a desire to minimize this behavior. Adopting the New Game+ from Starfield could help alleviate this but with changes as Starfield's version tried for too much but they didn't invest the depth needed to keep it believable. Allow changing all race, background, trait, etc. but keeping skills, perks, and levels. Could make it cannon where your character dies and is reincarnated with muscle memory-esque knowledge of their skills but no memories of previous runs. This allows players to explore different approaches to a similar character builds more easily without a full restart. Players could evolve their existing stealth archer into a dagger assassin, pickpocket specialist, or other variation of sneak character. New Game+ can also allow for more significant distinctions between classes/backstories, races, and traits as each new playthrough can change these. It can also allow for quests to lock you out of other quests as well as removing essential characters and go back to the morrowind severed fate warning (more on this topic later). This allows for a reloaded save or to just accept the consequences until your next run. Where Starfield went wrong was by trying to implement the PC with the knowledge from the previous run but they didn't want to commit to massive changes to questlines based on what the player now knows. It's better to keep the character's in-world knowledge fresh and allow for starting with a higher level and skills.
* **Racial Differences**: Make these much more noticeable. In Skyrim, races had major powers and minor passive buffs, but largely played the same. For TES VI, Races could see positive and negative effects such as differing base attributes, buffed passives (ever notice how most resist passives have been nerfed from game to game), and predispositions for specific classes and traits that allow them to excel faster than others. Obviously keep the ability for any race to be any class but for the min/maxers, you would need a specific race to truly maximize some aspects of the game. Rather than the Skyrim method for just having skills start at different levels, why not give Khajiits unique sneak buffs like faster sneak speed and better jumping, wood elves less bow sway in archery or perhaps harder to detect when outside, Argonians could regenerate health faster in water, maybe Altmer have stronger spell magnitudes the higher their Magicka, etc. There's nothing worse than having your only passive be 50% resist poison which is made useless by becoming a vampire. Just think about it, how many times are you told that Bosmer are the best archers, Orcs the best smiths, Khajiits make the best rugs. Show me don't tell me! Daily powers can be a good thing to keep but balance is key. Loved the Altmer, Argonian, and Redguard abilities and of course the Orc berserk ability is super OP but as long as all races were equally weak or OP would be fine. Just make it unique and always useful.
* **Attributes**: This is hugely unlikely as Bethesda has said a few times they want to move away from spreadsheet style but personally I'd prefer a return to the Strength, Intelligence, Willpower, Agility, Speed, Endurance, Personality, Luck style attributes which then factor into how Magicka, Health, and Stamina are calculated. Doesn't necessarily have to be the same attributes listed (from Oblivion) but a more D&D style spread would be great. It could allow for speech checks like in Starfield/New Vegas (and the maybe 2 times in FO4), it could play into how combat works (maybe if you're strong enough, you can wield two-handed weapons in one hand), or impact magic (maybe spell crafting has limitations based on intelligence). You could also have in-world attribute checks where an obstacle could be overcome with a high enough strength attribute but without it the player would have to bring a companion with said strength or find some other way around. Neat possibilities but I'm not holding my breath.
* **Classes/Backgrounds**: Just like Starfield added backgrounds, I think that is a fantastic role playing feature to build off of for TES VI. Could stick with backgrounds or go back to classes where they would decide the starting spread of skill levels (maybe even starting perk points like Starfield). Could even add minor adjustments to attributes. Most importantly of all, they need to have a big impact with npc interactions and speech checks. If they go the class route (my preference) having class specific perk trees would be a cool way to flesh out roleplay.
* **Star Signs/Stones**: Whether they are picked at the beginning and set or are changeable is fine by me but they definitely add to role-playing. Could even tie into speech checks. An Argonian born under the Shadow sign has an easier time joining whatever assassin group exists etc.
* **Traits**: Starfield's usage of traits was a great start and I'd love to see it expanded on, especially borrowing ideas from FO:NV. Could tie in with gods and worship, geographic origins, historical lineage, etc.
* **Gods & Worship**: The Wintersun/Pilgrim mods do a fantastic job of adding immersive gods and worship that I would love to see Bethesda incorporate with TES VI. Really goes a long way towards helping shape the roleplay of a character. Would be a perfect focus for a DLC to avoid trying to cram too much in at launch and skimping on depth.
* **Varying Heights and Weights**:Let me make short Altmer and tall Bosmer and keep the skinny/fat/muscular triangle from recent titles.
* **Crafting Vendors Take Requests**: Let me ask Smiths/Alchemists/Enchanters for a custom order that varies in quality depending on their skill. Allows characters to not be pigeonholed into crafting for roleplaying. Requiring the PC to provide the resources would be a good limitation as well. Could also change how these characters work. Smiths like Adrianne Avenicci in Skyrim could only take requests while her husband runs the shop vs something like Riverwood and Alvor would only take requests, no shop.
* **Maybe Less of a Power Fantasy**: I'm not the biggest fan of the player character being pigeonholed into being this super powered larger than life hero but I'm sure that'll stay. Personally I can get over this because alternate start mods are a thing but it would be nice if you had to work for it more than just being handed things (*cough* being able to dragon shout within the first hourish-ish of play, FO4 was sorta guilty of this too with power armor and a deathclaw fight within the first 30 minutes but at least you didn't have powers no one else did, Starfield handled the pacing for powers better but it's another chosen one scenario).


# Followers
* **Quality**: I like the Starfield approach of a pyramid like system where there are a handful of really in depth followers, then a handful of skyrim level followers, then generic options. It provides more options even if not all the same quality of immersion. I'd just like the top of the pyramid to have a few more options and cover a wide range of moralities and themes. Maybe 10-15 options at the top that exist somewhere between FO4 level and Starfield level of quality and then 20-50 skyrim-esque which will follow you and have some lines but nothing near the quality as recent games.
* **Companion Quests and Perks**: Fallout 4‚Äôs companions having thematic perks for maxing affinity and then doing a companion quest was perfect! Starfield‚Äôs several companion related quests over the course of the relationship was also good but may be asking a lot when there are more than 4 companions. The main thing I want is at least one quest and a thematic perk for the top of the follower pyramid companions. Anything more is just the cherry on top.


# Immersion and World Building
* **Cities**: I'd prefer cities to be more like TES of old and not starfield. Every NPC is named minus a few guards and the like (although I wouldn't complain if they named them too). Don't want filler NPCs that just take up space for the sake of scale. That being said, Skyrim's cities are a little too small. If they can't scale that style up much then I'd take one or two big cities as best they can scale them with the rest as towns or hamlets. If they feel the need to go the nameless citizens route then we absolutely need random encounters in cities where beggars, street performers, pickpockets, assassins, etc. would randomly cause a scene interacting with the player or the nameless citizens. If they do have a focus on procedural generation, cities should be where it's used to procedurally generate different housing interiors for large amounts of houses in major cities. These can all be assigned to randomly named NPCs that don't have a corresponding quest or story with them. This would be a better solution over nameless citizen NPCs and the interiors could change if said random NPC died and was replaced with another random NPC.
* **Cities (not towns/hamlets) need sewers!**: All of them, not just the shady city with a convenient sewer system for the dregs of society to hold their cool kids club. These allow for better ways to get around undetected. More accessible rooftops are also a good option for this.
* **Open Cities**: Minor thing but cities as open parts of the world and not sectioned off like skyrim. I doubt this will be an issue though as both FO4 and Starfield were able to accomplish this. Would definitely be willing to sacrifice this for better cities though.
* **Reputation**: Better reputation and recognition of those things that you are supposed to be recognized for and less ‚ÄúHail Sithis‚Äù when not in Dark Brotherhood armor. At the same time, if you're a criminal, especially a wanted one with a big bounty, people should react to that. Maybe they try to get away from you or alert guards, possibly run if you have weapons drawn. Make sure NPC lines that would only make sense if the player is unknown vs well known only go off at the right time. No more Nazeems asking if you've been to the cloud district sarcastically when you've saved the city 6 times over and are bffs with the Jarl.
* **Disposition**: Has been a staple in TES games for a long time and should continue to be. Some quests could be hidden behind needing a higher disposition with certain NPCs. Pacify or Rally spells could also have a charm like effect (or bring back charm) that allow you to raise disposition temporarily.
* **NPC Reactions**: NPCs react decently well in Skyrim to what the player character does but more care could be taken here to flesh out reactions to things like Illusion/Restoration spells impacting them, Conjuration (especially necromancy), drawn bows, and general reputation.
* **Unkillable NPCs**: I think essential NPCs can be useful but they can be too common. It's no fun to completely destroy a major questline because you were a murder hobo. That being said, not every quest needs to be protected like this. A few important quest related NPCs could have backups that deliver quests in their place if they die. Some of these could even be hidden NPCs where they come to visit the region because said quest NPC died and they're filling in but they don't arrive until the quest is active. Maybe this is handled by giving a quest giver a title behind the scenes and anyone holding that title gives the quest and there is a line of succession for NPCs to hold that title. They could have a semi-essential status where an NPC would become downed before dying with a warning that a quest will be lost if said NPC is killed off. Obviously any of these NPCs would be essential when attacked by other NPCs and only a player character to could fully kill them. No more dragons attacking towns ruining your playthrough when you weren't even paying attention.
* **Economy**: A minor economic focus where flooding the market with one type of thing lowers returns for a temporary period. So if you smith hundreds of iron daggers, they have diminishing returns when selling them. Doesn‚Äôt need to be a massively intricate economy.
* **Traveling Merchants**: I really like the traveling Khajiit caravans of skyrim and would like to see traveling merchants return. Would work amazingly if they could have carts being pulled by horse/ox containing their wares. Maybe the Rev-8 indicates that BGS has solved the previous jank with wheeled objects.
* **Urgency**: Less urgency on the main quest. Allow the player to wander without it feeling like you're neglecting the fate of the world
* **Immersive Bounty-ish Hunters**: If you're seen performing necromancy, engaging in vampiric activity, or transforming into a werewolf, it doesn't necessarily add a criminal bounty but could add a notoriety to a bounty system that leads to witch-hunters, vigilants, etc. becoming more common as radiant encounters similar to the hired thugs of skyrim (if hired thugs bug out so more than one instance can't be sent, I'm gonna be mad. I loved that encounter).
* **Different Kinds of Shops**: Having the drunken huntsman was great for roleplaying any sort of archer or hunter. It would be nice to see very niche shops like that. Examples: Bookstores, Hammer Emporium, Fishing Shop, Enchanters, maybe a hidden shop that focuses on necromancy behind a front of a general trader.


# Gameplay
* **Disguises**: Holy shit please!!! Allow for wearing armor/clothes of some enemy factions leading to auto aggro in specific areas. Why could I wear stormcloak armor in Solitude pre civil war conclusion. Some outfits lead to being confronted about it, some cause the NPCs to immediately attack you. If discovered trespassing while wearing a disguise, said disguise will no longer work at that location as NPCs will be on higher alert. Additionally, some captain-esque characters may be more likely to stop and question you as they don't recognize you and expect to know all their subordinates. If they want to get super into it, they could potentially have witnesses and track who knows about your disguise so if you kill NPCs fast enough, you can maintain your disguise to an extent. They had this in the Diplomatic Immunity quest in skyrim then never again. Please make this a full on mechanic.
* **More Armor Diversity**: I'd love to bring back more armor slots and allow for layering. We saw this with FO4 a bit. Slots could be Capes, Hoods, Robes/Clothes, Pauldrons, Greaves, Gauntlets, Boots, Cuirass, Helmet, Necklace, Rings. Nerf enchanting to fit the more armor slots. I acknowledge that this is a little unlikely as the reduced armor slots was a change to give their artist more leeway and less worry about clipping issues. Would be nice if they could at least incorporate capes.
* **Crafting Changes**: Allow things to be reenchanted, not changing the effect but recalculating the effect's magnitude. Could also help improve scaling of unique rewards that are supposed to match your level. At the same time, if they wanted to nerf smithing, they could make tempering a temporary thing that gradually decreases with use. So not the full on repair system of previous TES but a nerf to just how strong you could get weapons in skyrim. Could honestly tie it to a setting like Starfield where it varies between full on degradation and repair to temporary tempering to static giving varying xp modifiers 
* **More Weapon Diversity**: Staves as melee weapons, keep crossbows, different bow types (recurve, long), spears/halberds, throwing weapons (maybe even throwable poisons), fist weapons, more sword styles (katana, claymores, bastard swords, you name it!), whips
* **Unique Uniques**: Really make uniques unique! Both in look and effects. Less Axe of Whiteruns, more Spellbreakers. It's okay for some minor named weapons to not be the most unique but at least give them consistent enchantments (like the Amren's family swords of the world). And for the rarer uniques, have more unique enchants that are otherwise not possible to go with the unique look.
* **Leveling**: I personally enjoy both TES style of level by doing and Fallout/Starfield style of level by killing, questing, and exploring and allocate as desired. No strong feelings here.
* **Potion Naming**: Minor thing but let me name my potions.
* **Minotaurs**: I really like Minotaurs (pretty please, stick em in a small section closest to cyrodil)
* **A Better Focus on Weakness and Resistances**: Elemental weaknesses and resistances are common (ex: Trolls and fire) and elemental damage draining Stamina or Magicka is cool but there isn't too much else rock paper scissors styles to make you think about how you approach encounters. Could differentiate between blade vs blunt vs piercing damage. 
* **Favorites Wheel**: Rather than the menu in skyrim or the cross from FO4 or Starfield, let's get a wheel with configurable settings.
* **Better Thievery**: This might be a ‚Äújust me‚Äù thing but shops should have stealable inventories. Add door chimes to the front door where if you sneak in after dark it alerts the owner and they call the guards unless you have the skills or know-how to get around it. Also have guard dogs and in the most wealthy of shops even round the clock guards. Anything you steal while inside will have its monetary value added as bounty if you're caught inside, regardless of if you've been seen stealing it specifically as they will pin everything on you. Maybe not everything they sell is stealable but it would definitely provide for more interesting goals as a thief.
As an alternative, make more mansions, banks, museums, town halls, etc. that can act as 'thief dungeons' where you get big bounties for getting caught trespassing, stealing, or killing anyone but have better loot to steal.
* **Enemy NPC AI**: Have NPCs call for help, perform grid searches, and light torches/mage lights to better search an area when they've detected your presence but not you specifically. Can have varying levels where minor just detection results in single NPCs looking around. Hitting an NPC then returning to stealth results in calling for backup, lighting torches, etc. And deaths result in everything being utilized. Starfield already has enemies going on high alert when a body is found. Have mage enemies heal their companions or use illusion spells to help buff their allies. Not just spam destruction spells. 
* **Parrying**: Rather than simple blocking with a weapon in one hand and nothing in the other. Could be tied into swinging and hitting an NPCs swing at the same time. Timing being an essential part of it where if done right, opens up attacks of opportunity

# Nice to Haves
These things that would be cool but I do not want the development of them to take away from the any of the above (very much my personal preference as so many are unlikely):

* **Settlement Building**: I personally don't want to see it as a major feature. I'd rather it be a small secondary thing like camp building or Hearthfire. Full-on settlements like FO4 seem to take away from properly developed towns. Starfield style of build anywhere but largely not impact anything feels a little useless unless done as a camp system. Creating a Daedric cult or tying into bandits for a settlement could be super cool.
* **Immersive Carts**: Carts going between cities carrying essentials like food, stone, lumber. Nothing too valuable but still important. Could have guard escorts and bandit raid scripts
* **Scarier Quests**: Would be cool to have some scarier quests that maybe incorporate good usage of jumpscares, psychological stuff and the like.
* **More Underwater**: Underwater combat and add extensive POIs underwater. Also sea monsters.
* **Optional Map Markers**: Quests having more descriptive instructions so if people want to turn off quest marker ui, they can still function
* **Proper Herds of Animals**: Skyrim example: Would be neat to see a herd of goats/deer and not just two or three and then an actual wolf pack or single saber cat tries to single out and kill a member of the herd.
* **Bestiary**: like the fantastic mod for skyrim, would be a great way to learn mechanics, weaknesses, and lore.
* **ESO Style of Race Specific Armor Styles**: Ex: Iron armor made by Nords looks viking-ish vs made by Bretons looks knight-ish
Adding this here but armor that adapted for beast shaped characters (Khajiit and Argonian). Would be a huge task but would be amazing to see.
* **Skill Based Animations**: The Animations for bows, fighting, casting, sneaking, etc. would be different depending on the skill level of the user so a novice would look different than a master. Ideally there could be 3ish levels but I'd be fine with two. Again, a big lift for little gain.
* **Dynamic Growth of Towns**: TES entries have let you kill random NPCs and occasionally have other NPCs programmed to fill in for the void they leave but it would be cool if you could have empty spaces in towns that could be filled by radiant visiting NPCs similarly to how you run into radiant encounters on the road. Maybe a Nord Alchemist moves into a town and opens up a shop (in what was and abandoned building) selling ingredients sourced from skyrim, many which might not be available outside of the storefront. Could potentially be tied into town specific quests as in you do enough quests helping people in the town and it starts to grow. Could also be how generic, non-named NPCs are incorporated where they're visiting from the countryside or another town or further still. This could also tie in to NPCs travelling between towns. Wealthier NPCs could have guards, poorer ones might only travel with a dog companion. Similarly, maybe a farmer makes trips into town to sell food at the marketplace every morndas.
* **Better Visual Representation of the Gear You're Carrying**: Like the popular mods for skyrim. Shields appear on your back when sheathed, dual wielding weapons are both visible. Maybe have customizable others appear like potions/poisons, scrolls/tomes, or lanterns/cooking gear but mainly equipped weapons/shields.
* **NPC Horse Combat**: Skyrim eventually saw the addition of horseback combat so I am hoping it returns (maybe with camels!) however it would be really cool to be able to engage NPCs fighting from horseback either also on horseback or by foot. Would add a good use case for spears/halberds to shine.
* **Climbing**: The sky climb mod is super cool but it also adds a huge amount of complexity in quest and location development. More verticality would greatly help sneak builds though‚Ä¶ definitely a big reach that I have no expectations for. At least we'll likely see hurdling objects and grabbing edges like Starfield.
* **Vampire Bloodlines & Differing Were-Beasts**: Maybe one vampire bloodline is stronger physically while another is more magically inclined with illusion or Necromancy. Werewolves vs werebears vs wereboars. Add in clans surrounding the different types could have quests vs opposing hunter groups (like silver hand or dawnguard). Let's be honest, companions weren't really a fighters guild, more of a werewolf cult.
* **Nemesis System**: Like the mod, on death, return to last sleep/nearest town, get a new quest to reclaim gear. Possibly unique to bandits as they care more for your possessions than about killing you.
* **Non-Lethal Bounty Hunting System**: Collecting bounties by incapacitating targets and bringing them to jail
* **Better and More Horseback Focus**: Perhaps a skill line devoted to it and you encounter more horseback enemies. If in hammerfell, could add camels.
* **Black Flag meets Starfield**: For ship usage and customization. Many people have mentioned it, I agree it would be cool but I don't think it needs to be a base game feature.
* **Faux Co-Op**: Allow you to export your character to be a silent follower in a friend's game. Not co-op but it's the next best thing."

Gusto kong magtake ng master plumber exam  kasi naalala ko yung isang seminar namin from college before na chem eng pero career path niya master plumber. 

Diving deeper, eh gumagawa pala ng plano ang master plumber, ni wala man lang ako naka experience ng competent nq design class sa college. Parang naiisip ko kahit magexam ako at makapasa, how do i even start getting projects di ko naman alam pano magdesign ng plumbing systems. 

Kahit nga man lang licensed na p&id software wala yung university namin. May plant design naman kami pero material balance lang naman yung sinolve ko nun. Jusmiyo pati yung plant design ko pa ang daming mali, wala rin input prof namin kung pano icocorrect. 

Mga chem eng of reddit, kamustang work sa planta as process engineer or line engineer?

Mga master plumber na walang design background, pano kayo natutong magdesign at draft ng plumbing systems? 

I feel so fake at parang wala talagang industry skills na natutunan nung college. Puro fluid mechanics mat bal lang naalala ko.."

Then cable manage, because the original cable management was done with paper ties and tape, which didn't age well.

I'm good at all the mechanical stuff, I've got the record player itself working and the needle lands in the right spot again, it's the electrical stuff I'm dumb about.

Photos 3-7 are what I have a dumb question for. The pot on the side of the preamp says bal, assuming for LR balance but never assume. 

I've managed to scare myself into thinking it could be for the bias, because turning the knob to either extreme doesn't seem to do anything for the actual balance. I bought a bias tester and also used my multimeter to sanity check, and the bal knob doesn't seem to affect the bias either. I just want to make absolutely sure I didn't set this thing to explode before I close it up, so I need someone to tell me I definitely didn't mess with the bias.

Photo 8 is just a fun fix for a whining tube. It would make this high pitch whine that changed frequency when I tapped it, so I kept flicking it until it shut up and quit whining. It was also coming from the tube itself, not through the speakers.

I also want to make sure that the tube being at an extreme angle won't cause anything to explode.

Last question is, where do I get a replacement light for the little orange guy in the bottom right? It's part of the Magnavox logo, and on the inside it looks like a cardboard tube."

I'm running into an issue here, and I hope someone here can help me out! Here's the situation, Whenever I try to run the game, the game gets stuck at the loading screen, and all I see is the Combat Extended (CE) message that repeats endlessly, where the buttons or options seem unresponsive, misaligned, or missing altogether. The issue persists even after trying several fixes like sorting mods, disabling suspected mods. This started happening after I recently updated a bunch of mods and added several CE patches. my game ver. is **1.5.4104**.  
The error seems to repeat: **CE\_EnableTutorText**

I've already tried disabling Vanilla Textures Expanded, Vanilla Factions Expanded, Vanilla Weapons Expanded CE, EdB Prepare Carefully, Tech Advancing, RimFridge, LWM's Deep Storage. Despite this, the issue is still there!

Does anyone know which mod(s) might be causing this issue or how to resolve it? Could it be a conflict with **CE**, or perhaps an outdated apparel-related mod?

Thanks in advance!

As we kick off 2025, I want to thank all of you fellow football fans for making this community so special. Here's to another year of exciting games, unforgettable plays, and friendly debates. With the regular season wrapping up, the stakes are high for many teams, so buckle up for a thrilling week of football action. Last week was another solid one for me, going 14-2, which brings me to 174-82 on the season. This week, we‚Äôve got a full slate of 16 games, all divisional matchups, and some crucial games as teams fight for playoff spots and divisional titles. We have two games on Saturday, and no more MNF/TNF games. Let‚Äôs dive into Week 18 and enjoy the last slate of games of the regular season. Cheers to a great start to the new year and an even better finish to the season!

Winner||Loser|Comments
-|-|-|-
[](/BAL)Ravens|over|[](/CLE)Browns|The Ravens aim to dominate the struggling Browns, who have been unable to generate much offense this season. Baltimore, averaging 30.2 PPG, has a balanced attack featuring a top-tier rushing game (185.6 yards/game) and a strong passing game. Their defense allows just 21.9 PPG, making them a tough matchup. The Browns, sitting at 3-13, struggle offensively, averaging only 15.5 PPG. Thompson-Robinson's inconsistent play has hurt Cleveland, while their defense ranks 25th in points allowed (25.0/game) and has given up 44 total TDs. Expect the Ravens to exploit these weaknesses for a decisive win.
[](/CIN)Bengals|over|[](/PIT)Steelers|The Steelers are struggling offensively with a stagnant run game and limited passing, coupled with defensive cracks. Meanwhile, Burrow has been on fire, driving the Bengals toward a historic playoff push despite starting 0-3. Burrow is averaging 331 passing yards and 3.4 TDs per game since November and needs 359 yards against the Steelers to hit the 5,000-yard milestone for the season‚Äîa feat achieved by only nine QBs in NFL history. Burrow's MVP-caliber play gives Cincinnati a strong chance to clinch the final wild-card spot.
[](/ATL)Falcons|over|[](/CAR)Panthers|Young has shown enough growth to earn a third season as the Panthers' franchise QB, while rookie Penix Jr. is just beginning to find his rhythm for the Falcons. This indoor season finale promises excitement. The Falcons need a victory and outside help to clinch the NFC South. Meanwhile, the Panthers, despite allowing 30+ points in four of their last six games, have covered the spread in four of their last five home matchups. Expect Penix Jr. to guide Atlanta to a win, but their postseason fate will remain uncertain.
[](/WAS)Commanders|over|[](/DAL)Cowboys|The Commanders have secured their first playoff berth since 2020 but aim to build momentum heading into the wild-card round with a crucial road victory over their rivals. They‚Äôll need to manage Daniels and other key players carefully to avoid unnecessary risks. Quinn‚Äôs defense will get a valuable tune-up against his former team. The Commanders can lock in the No. 6 seed with a win, giving Daniels plenty of motivation. He‚Äôs been impressive on the road, boasting 10 TDs, two INTs, and a 111.3 passer rating this season.
[](/GB)Packers|over|[](/CHI)Bears|The Bears, now on a 10-game losing streak since their 4-2 start under Williams, continue their turbulent season after parting ways with Eberflus. Meanwhile, the Packers, despite recent hiccups, remain poised for a deep playoff run with Jacobs leading the charge. Green Bay can avoid a trip to Philly in the wild-card round with a win and a Washington loss in Week 18. The Packers have dominated at home recently, winning their past three games by an average of 25 points.
[](/HOU)Texans|over|[](/TEN)Titans|The Texans, locked into the 4th seed, are looking to regain momentum ahead of a tough playoff matchup. After back-to-back losses, they'll seek a solid showing from Stroud, Mixon, and their defense. Despite being in a position to rest key players, Houston likely aims to sharpen its edge before the postseason. Tennessee, on the other hand, has dropped five straight games. The Texans' rushing game has struggled recently, averaging only 73 yards over the past three weeks, but their overall form should carry them here. Houston builds momentum with a strong performance.
[](/IND)Colts|over|[](/JAX)Jaguars|The eliminated Colts now face a Jags team aiming to finish strong under Pederson. While Jacksonville eyes the No. 1 pick in the daft, their fight hasn‚Äôt wavered, even with Jones leading the charge against a battered Colts defense. Indy has dominated recent home matchups, winning five of the last six, and will lean heavily on Taylor to power past a struggling division rival. Expect a competitive outing, with the Colts edging out the Jags in this clash.
[](/BUF)Bills|over|[](/NE)Patriots|With the Bills already locked into the 2nd seed in the AFC, they plan to give Allen a brief cameo and then rely on Trubisky, their strong running game, and pass rush to take control of the game. On the other hand, New England is limping to the finish line with a seven-game losing streak and the possibility of securing the No. 1 pick in the draft with a loss. The Bills, even with Allen resting, should still have enough firepower to dominate, as they are slight favorites on the road. The Pats' defense has struggled, allowing 31.3 PPG over the past three weeks. Given New England‚Äôs current struggles and the Bills' depth, Buffalo should come out on top in this matchup.
[](/PHI)Eagles|over|[](/NYG)Giants|The Giants ruined their chance for the No. 1 pick by beating the Colts, and now they might have to face Barkley setting the single-season rushing record against them. The Eagles have nothing to play for and could rest their starters, but with Barkley needing 101 yards to break the record, they might let him try. If they do, the full O-line would need to play, risking injury. Since the Giants have already lost their top draft pick, they‚Äôll likely win this game and fall further down the order just to screw with everyone. (Update: Looks like Sirianni is resting Barkley.)
[](/TB)Buccaneers|over|[](/NO)Saints|The Bucs can clinch the NFC South with a win, but if they lose, the Falcons could steal the division. The Saints have been struggling, averaging just 11.4 PPG since their bye, which won‚Äôt be enough to beat Tampa. The Bucs scored 51 points against the Saints in Week 6 and might do the same again. NOLA's silver lining is that if they lose, they‚Äôll eliminate the Falcons from playoff contention. It may not be the Super Bowl, but the Saints could take pride in that consolation. The Saints have a ton of rebuilding to do over the next few years.
[](/DEN)Broncos|over|[](/KC)Chiefs|The final AFC playoff spot could depend on this game: a Chiefs win sends the Bengals to the playoffs, while a Broncos win sends Denver through. The Broncos are 9.5-point favorites because the Chiefs are expected to rest their starters. While Denver might seem like a lock with KC sitting key players, the Chiefs have benched starters four times under Reid in Week 18, going 2-2 in those games and 3-1 ATS. It might not be as automatic as it looks.
[](/LAC)Chargers|over|[](/LV)Raiders|The Chargers are aiming for a strong finish to avoid facing the Ravens again in the playoffs. They clinched a playoff spot and can move up with a win, likely opting to play starters. Meanwhile, the Raiders have won two straight games, with O'Connell avoiding turnovers, but the Chargers are the better team. Expect a solid performance from L.A., especially with a tune-up for the defense and a Dobbins-led rushing attack.
[](/LAR)Rams|over|[](/SEA)Seahawks|The Rams can clinch the 3rd seed, and their performance will depend on the Bucs' game against the Saints. With a five-game win streak, L.A. has been strong, allowing 10 points or less in the last three games. The Seahawks, unable to win the division, will likely benefit from McVay resting players. Despite missing the playoffs, Macdonald's first season as Seattle's coach is a success with a 10-7 record.
[](/MIA)Dolphins|over|[](/NYJ)Jets|The Phins face a shaky QB situation, with Tua's availability in question, which could hinder their passing game against the Jets' defense in cold conditions. Miami still has playoff hopes, needing a win and a Denver loss to secure a spot. Rodgers, aiming for his 500th TD pass, needs to lead the Jets and prove he's the right fit for 2025, but New York has lost six of the last seven games. Miami has won three of the last four matchups at New York, and they are 2-2 when favored by four points or less. Expect late-game dramatics.
[](/SF)49ers|over|[](/ARI)Cardinals|The Cards have struggled, losing five of their last six games, while the Niners aim to finish the season strong despite a disappointing year plagued by injuries. Purdy will look to end the season on a high note, especially with contract talks looming in the offseason. Although San Fran gave their all against the Lions, it wasn't enough, but they should rebound to outscore Murray and the Cardinals.
[](/DET)Lions|over|[](/MIN)Vikings|Arguably the game of the week and a very tough pick. This NFC showdown is set to be a thrilling one, with both the Vikings and Lions excelling in close games this season. Minnesota has a remarkable 9-1 record in one-score games, with the lone loss to Detroit, while the Lions are 6-1 in such matchups. Goff and Darnold have turned this game into must-see TV. The Vikings, led by O'Connell and Flores' defense, have pushed Detroit to the limit, but the Lions will have the advantage at home with their strong closing running game and the momentum to secure a high-scoring victory. This is a coin flip for me, so I'm barely leaning on the home team.

"Origins of the Vampires, Part One",teslore,1hqr292,2024-12-31 18:49:07,20,0.86,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1hqr292/origins_of_the_vampires_part_one/,Niranox,Apocrypha,"The vampire looks up from her campfire. She wears a pair of oversized glasses, shaped like circles; catching the light, they become like two full moons balanced on her face. After a moment, she beckons you forward. Waves tumble up behind her and nip at her heels. Stars reflect across the waves. Looking up, looking down, could you even tell which is the true night sky?

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù the vampire says. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get this over with. What do you want?‚Äù

You keep your hand on your sword, drawing the blade by a few inches. Its blade is plated in a thin layer of silver, originally peeled from a mirror and devotedly reapplied. In the past year, you‚Äôve become adept at hunting her kind. ‚ÄúI want to ask some questions.‚Äù

She pulls a stick of driftwood from the sand and chucks it into the fire. ‚ÄúYou followed me across Tamriel for *some questions*?‚Äù The campfire‚Äôs blaze breaks into red, lashing tongues.

‚ÄúI almost lost you in the Alik‚Äôr.‚Äù

The vampire pouts. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I was hoping for. I thought you were too young, too inexperienced. I thought you‚Äôd boil under the sun and shrivel up.‚Äù She makes a motion that might have once been sighing; without breath, it‚Äôs just a quirky twitch. ‚ÄúWhatever. Running is getting boring. Ask away.‚Äù

You study the vampire. Hair tumbles down her body in dark waves. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù you ask.

‚ÄúMy name?‚Äù She stares for a second. There‚Äôs some movement of memory across her brow, memories so heavy her forehead weighs down into creases. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs half the truth: I‚Äôve forgotten it.‚Äù

You draw your sword another distance. Moonlight dances across the silvering, making it look like a spark caught in paused time. ‚ÄúAnd the whole truth?‚Äù

She smirks at the way you posture, at the makeshift armour you wear, at your na√Øve brashness. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so old I‚Äôve forgotten not only it, but the language it was in.‚Äù The vampire shifts a little. Her body looks frail, built in times of famine, perhaps. ‚ÄúFunny ‚Ä¶ Have you ever thought about what language really is? Is language something we translate our thoughts into, or is language the bedrock of our thoughts? Can someone without language think in the same way as someone with language? Can different languages encode novel thoughts? Is a creature without speech just ‚Ä¶ some sort of animal?

‚ÄúNone of this is an answer to my question.‚Äù

The vampire‚Äôs eyes flick up to you. The fire‚Äôs light plays in her irises, illuminating red slivers. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it? I‚Äôve forgotten my name; I think I‚Äôve forgotten how I used to think. There is an answer to your question. It‚Äôs somewhere deep inside of me. What I‚Äôve said is the best translation of that answer I can give you. There are no perfect words for it.‚Äù

You let a beat of silence pass. ‚ÄúMaybe I should rephrase my question.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù

Taking a tentative step forward, you speak again: ‚ÄúWhat should I call you?‚Äù

‚ÄúAha. Call me‚Ä¶ Ceye.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds Ayleid.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is! It means shadow or something.‚Äù Ceye makes the shape of a heart with her fingers and winks at you through the middle of it. ‚ÄúKinda cute, huh? I think so.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù You shake your head, then remind yourself what Ceye is: primeval, wicked, tricky. ‚ÄúQuestion two: Why did you make me?‚Äù

She shrugs. ‚ÄúBecause you were dying.‚Äù

‚ÄúA lot of people die every day.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut because of me, on that day, you didn‚Äôt‚Äîwell, you did, but you got back up.‚Äù Ceye gestures in your direction. ‚ÄúIf I had known you‚Äôd become this‚Ä¶ maybe I wouldn‚Äôt have shared my blood with you after all.‚Äù Her gaze finds its focus on the necklace of fangs you wear. ‚ÄúI probably shouldn‚Äôt have, really. A vampire-hunting vampire?‚Äù Ceye rolls her eyes and smirks again. It seems to be a smirk reserved entirely for herself. ‚ÄúHa. How trite.‚Äù

Your lips flatten into a frown. You hold your blade out so the flames lick its flat sides, the point a small distance from Ceye‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúQuestion three: What are we? Is Lamae Bal really our progenitor? Are we of Molag Bal?‚Äù

Ceye lets herself flop back onto the beach. Elsweyr‚Äôs sand glitters with little motes of sugar. ‚ÄúUgh, the Bal thing. Couldn‚Äôt you have asked this anyone else? Maybe to the other vampires you slew?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt make me. You did. And then you left. I feel you‚Ä¶ you owe me some explanation for what I‚Äôve become.‚Äù

Ceye‚Äôs face softens a little, then she tilts her head back and closes her eyes. ‚ÄúSorry. I‚Äôve never been a good mother. What did you ask? Was Lamae the first? Hmm. I doubt it. That claim originates with the Cyrodiilic and Nordic clans, but then Skyrim and Cyrodiil have always enjoyed higher populations of vampires relative to the rest of Tamriel. The former for its short days, the latter for its abundance of prey. When a lot of people say the same thing, it can often masquerade as truth. That being said, I don‚Äôt deny that Lamae, if she really existed, *thought* she was the first of our kind.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo on.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, if you were a Nede, tribal, maybe nomadic, an escaped slave, possibly ‚Ä¶ and some monster raped you to death in the night ‚Ä¶ What would you think? A demon? A Daedra? A wicked ghost? Would your language even have the terminology to describe what you saw? Or what happened to you? And if it didn‚Äôt, could you ever even create thoughts acute enough to understand either? Let‚Äôs be lucid about this: If a woman was attacked and arose again as a vampire, what would be the rational explanation?‚Äù

You quirk an eyebrow. ‚ÄúThat she was assaulted by another vampire.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly, but if you have no reference for what we are, or for our reproduction, wouldn‚Äôt it be natural to imagine it had been Molag Bal instead? I mean, Lamae probably lived at the same time the Ayleids were turning to Mola-Gbal.‚Äù

Ceye whispers, ‚ÄúDumb fucking name,‚Äù under her breath, then continues.

‚ÄúStories of him would have been the only myths‚Äîthe only cultural touchstone‚Äîfor what happened to her.‚Äù Ceye brushes her fringe from her eyes. It reminds you of a smeared brushstroke of ink. ‚ÄúWhether it was Bal or not, that‚Äôs the only answer that would have been satisfactory. I think it would have been the only thing Lamae could have said to‚Ä¶ cope? To understand? Most vampiric sires murder their scions to turn them, you know that? I didn‚Äôt do that to you; I just saved your life.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure you saved anything.‚Äù For 12 months now, you‚Äôve been tracking Ceye across the provinces, encountering cadres of nightspawn along the way. Violence followed by hunting followed by drinking blood. Nothing seems to make sense anymore. ‚ÄúWhat type of life am I living now?‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, I just made you a vampire. I didn‚Äôt make you a melodramatist who felt the need to give up everything and wander Tamriel.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about that!‚Äù you say. ‚ÄúI used to feel *parity* between the different parts of myself. My soul would want to move, that impulse would translate into my thoughts, then my body would do it. It was like being a song, a song that was being written, conducted, and played at the same time. Now my body is a corpse‚Äîa corpse I puppet around‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt even *feel* like I‚Äôm inside it. I‚Äôm just a dissociated spirit that has to watch it pretend to be human.‚Äù Your body‚Äîyour stiff, corpulent body‚Äîaches like you‚Äôve been running for centuries. ‚ÄúI never feel warm anymore, I don‚Äôt even think I sleep anymore! I just enter some sort of torpor, dreamless, restless, like blinking. I would do such terrible things for one last night of real sleep.‚Äù You let your sword fall from your hand. It feels like you‚Äôve been awake forever. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just so tired all the time‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt think properly anymore‚Ä¶‚Äù

Ceye rests on her elbows. Her eyes meet yours, becoming increasingly sheepish. ‚ÄúOh. I, uh, did not realise being alive felt any different to being undead.‚Äù Sheepishness becomes surprise, then something like resignation. ‚ÄúHa, you know what means?‚Äù She laughs again, but it becomes a strained whine. ‚ÄúI must‚Äôve forgotten what being alive feels like.‚Äù Ceye collapses back onto the sand, stretching her arms out. ‚ÄúFunny, that‚Äôs so funny,‚Äù she mutters. ‚ÄúHa.‚Äù Her laughter fades away, leaving the crackling of the fire and the tumbling of the waves. ‚ÄúWould you‚Ä¶ would you have preferred it if I had let you die, on that day?‚Äù

You look past her. Constellations sail across the ocean. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù There is an answer to that question. It‚Äôs buried deep inside you, but there are no words you know that can properly voice it.

Ceye sits up. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt know either.‚Äù Her face is hidden behind flickering shadows and hair strands. ‚ÄúIf I tell you where vampires come from,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúwill that be a good enough apology? Will understanding help you?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù

In the distance, a lone seabird swoops down onto the surface of the water, a dark fluttering silhouette. You can tell, with your vampiric senses, that it‚Äôs broken a wing, and will never fly again.

‚ÄúWell ‚Ä¶‚Äù Ceye says, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where we come from. Maybe I did once, but I‚Äôve forgotten it if I did. I know the stories, though.‚Äù

You sit down by the fire. Your dropped sword still lays within it. The silver plating has begun to bubble. It seems so impermanent now. Everything does. It seems even what Ceye reveals, in this moment, will fade in time. ‚ÄúTell me.‚Äù You suppose that answers, even answers sought after for billions of years, will someday be forgotten in a single second.

‚ÄúOkay. Vampires in Summerset consider Mara to be their origin. You might think that‚Äôs a surprise, but it makes sense considering the Maran undercurrent.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe what?‚Äù You vaguely recognise that phrase, but it‚Äôs increasingly difficult to remember your mortal life. (Being a beast, as you are, means only living in the present.)

‚ÄúThe‚Äîhmm, okay, how do I ‚Ä¶?‚Äù Ceye looks at you, then the stars, then peers into the fire. ‚ÄúLook, Mara is one of the most culturally universal spirits. If you believe non-didentitarians then she‚Äôs even‚Äîwell, actually, now I have to explain *that*. All right: Non-didentitarians believe that similarities between Lorkhan and Shor, or between Auri-El and Akatosh, are just archetypical or etymological. Even non-didentitarians, however, accept that there is only one Mara. Some theologians‚Äîor zealots, am I right?‚Äîanyway, they reason that there‚Äôs only one Mara because there‚Äôs only *one* Mara; she‚Äôs *it*, she‚Äôs the *one true God*.

‚ÄúThe Maran undercurrent is recognised by all cultures in addition to her existence by itself. It is the recognition that Mara is inherently predatory. In Skyrim and the Reach, Mara is the wolf. In Hammerfell, she has multiple arms to hunt husbands. Although Cyrodiil has forgotten the demonic Mira, her name survives in the Tamrielic word *miare*, which descends etymologically from the Nedic *Mira* and the Ayleid *-i* suffix, which was used to create infinitive verbs. The *r* has migrated across the word through metathesis, and the *-i* has undergone sound change to *-e* as the Ayleid-Nedic Creole became 4E Tamrielic. Ultimately, the modern *miare* means ‚Äòto hunt‚Äô if you‚Äôre vulgar and ‚Äòto predate‚Äô if you‚Äôre not, but to the slaves it probably meant something more like ‚Ä¶ ‚Äòto be Mira‚Äô I suppose.‚Äù

You follow along, nodding your head. ‚ÄúSo Mara is‚Ä¶ what? An ancient vampire?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Ceye opens her mouth to speak again, then gnaws her lip. ‚ÄúOr so I assume. That would be silly, wouldn‚Äôt it? Look, what I‚Äôm trying to say is that the Summerset clans treat Mara as their mythic patroness. An elven vampire once showed me a book called the *Ethnogram*. It was a self-proclaimed account of the transmission of vampirism from one host to another, tracing the blood back to the first of our kind.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is very like the Altmer to obsess over genealogy.‚Äù

‚ÄúMhm.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd the first vampire?‚Äù

‚ÄúJode.‚Äù

You look at the moons hanging overhead. Their surfaces are like pocked eggshells. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a Merrish name for Masser, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Masser is undead.‚Äù Ceye leans forward. She‚Äôs a little impish, and adds a spooky note to her voice. ‚ÄúWhen the Aldmeri gods returned to Aetherius with Tower Zero, they left two of their own behind, Jode and Jone, who would defend Nirn from incursion by ‚Ä¶ Daedra? Magna-Ge? I‚Äôm not really sure. Jone and Jode, however, were dying. They were too close to the mortal plane. In order to disturb the natural cycle of life and death, Mara hunted Daedric forces and imbibed them in her womb, then slept with Jode at a strange angle. The resulting condition inside her, which inherited her natural wolfishness, contracted to Jode: the first vampiric strain.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù you interrupt. ‚ÄúVampirism is ultimately venereal?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat surprises you? It shouldn‚Äôt.‚Äù Ceye smiles wonkily. ‚ÄúAnyway, Jode became undead, developing the ability to subsist on blood.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe blood of whom?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Maybe he drank up the Daedra and Magna-Ge who tried to invade Nirn. They are the blood of Anu and Padomay, after all.‚Äù Ceye licks her lips. ‚ÄúRegardless, the Aldmer took to the stars in Sunbirds of Alinor. I know spaceships seem quite archaic, but at the time, they represented big leaps in liminal transportation.‚Äù

You nod. ‚ÄúThey were for conjuration what chariots are for carriages.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an interesting analogy. I might use that. Ah, where was I? Right. One of the Aldmeri rocket programs was called N√¥svera. It‚Äôs second launch, N√¥svera-2, never returned to Nirn.‚Äù

You can tell from the peaked excitement in Ceye‚Äôs voice where this is going. ‚ÄúExcept it did.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcept it did indeed! The N√¥svera-2 returned from Jode, albeit changed! Each of its ancient crew are associated with one of the Summerset clans.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see. Do you think that‚Äôs true?‚Äù

Ceye lets her spooky aspect fade. ‚ÄúProbably not. I usually trust Aldmer histories, but this‚Ä¶? Meh. One thing in particular bothers me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe *Ethnogram* begins with the assertion that the word vampire is ultimately a shortening of *varla-mabir*, meaning star-sailor.‚Äù

‚ÄúAstronaut?‚Äù

Ceye cocks her head. ‚ÄúYeah. The etymology, to me, seems ‚Ä¶ I dunno ‚Ä¶ forcefully constructed? Folkish? Amateur?‚Äù She hums to herself, then tucks some hair behind her ear. ‚ÄúStill, that‚Äôs the creation myth of the Summerset clans. Mortal Altmer, however, generally believe that vampirism originated from cross-breeding between goblins and Aldmer during Summerset‚Äôs colonisation. On Auridon, however, the most popular belief is that vampirism is a disease resulting from cannibalism and the taking of mannish wives.‚Äù

That rings a bell. ‚ÄúThe Bosmer?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly. I suspect that vampirism might have been introduced to Auridon by Wood Elves, or by early Aldmeri settlers returning from Valenwood. These early Valenwood vampires might have been the first instances of vampirism in Summerset as a whole. If so, that might mean that vampirism originated in Tamriel even prior to Topal‚Äôs explorations. Wood Orcish vampires? Nedic vampires? For once, this might be something the elves were late to.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen vampirism would be ancient.‚Äù

‚ÄúPre-historic! Which really makes any attempt at explaining what we are speculative at best, and an exercise in fiction at the worst.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù

Ceye points at you through the fire. ‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt despair! You‚Äôll only make me feel guiltier. Besides, the other provinces have yet to give their explanation for the origin of the vampires. We have till dawn, and the night is young!‚Äù

You blink at her. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awfully chipper for a cursed monster.‚Äù

Ceye clicks her pointing finger. Sparks burst from where her clawed nails grind against each other. ‚ÄúWhat can I say? Life is a journey, not a destination, but undeath is neither, so why not forget your responsibilities and just be happy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that easy‚Ä¶‚Äù"

Minimal 401k Match - 2x larger non-mtg debts - Nix 401k max to pay off? ,personalfinance,1hppbig,2024-12-30 10:14:50,1,0.67,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1hppbig/minimal_401k_match_2x_larger_nonmtg_debts_nix/,saxscrapers,Debt,"Another one of these posts... 

36.   
401k @ appr. 50k.  
Roth IRA @ 60k.  
Trad IRA @ 28k.  
ESOP @ 66k.    
HYSA @ 20k \[e fund\].  
Take home after 401k max of appr. $7,000/mo. Conservative monthly expenses appr. $3k/mo.  
  
Rec'd a raise last June to allow me to max my 401k, which i've been doing. The company match is small @ 1,500 for the year. The company contributes appr. 10% of my salary every year in July to an ESOP which fully vests in appr. 1.5 years. Current vested bal is appr. 55k. 

I have 2 notes - a car note @ 26k @ 7%. Another personal loan @ 41k @ 5.35%. Also have a dental woork interest free ""note"" of appr. $5k.  Currently, the personal loan is generating more interest than the car loan.

Given i feel a bit behind in my retirement balances, I've been fully maxing my 401k \[split btw trad and roth\] and Roth IRA. I assume with the ESOP not being tax deferred, that balancing trad and roth is acceptable.

Started making larger principal payments on the bigger personal note until the car note was taken out last month. Is there a hard and fast rule that would suggest I reduce the 401k contribution to the 1,500 match while i pay these two larger loans off? Doing so would give me appr. $750ish in additional funds each check to put towards the loans. Psychologically i'm a bit torn - i want to get rid of these debts as quickly as reasonable, but also feel behind in my retirement savings. 

Hoping i provided enough info - thanks!"

How do payments for ancillary services work?,Grid_Ops,1hooxgj,2024-12-29 00:17:46,14,0.9,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Grid_Ops/comments/1hooxgj/how_do_payments_for_ancillary_services_work/,jms_nh,,"I'm trying to wrap my head around ancillary services in the real-time energy markets. (With CAISO as an example, since I know there are slight differences across various ISO/RTOs.) I understand the concept of the services themselves, and energy bids, but I don't understand how payments work. Do the generator operators get paid similar prices per MWh even though they're not actually delivering energy? And how do ISO/RTOs figure out how to charge customers for these payments?

----

The concept is pretty easy; if CAISO gets demand bids for, say, 40,000 MW, during some control interval (hour for day-ahead, or 15-minutes / 5-minutes for real time market) then they need to match them with supply bids for 40,000 MW, but also ensure there are reserves to meet the reliability requirements, for example [WECC Standard BAL-STD-002-0 - Operating Reserves](https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Reliability%20Standards/BAL-STD-002-0.pdf)

> Minimum Operating Reserve. Each Balancing Authority shall maintain minimum
Operating Reserve which is the sum of the following:
>
> (i) Regulating reserve. Sufficient Spinning Reserve, immediately responsive to
Automatic Generation Control (AGC) to provide sufficient regulating margin to
allow the Balancing Authority to meet NERC's Control Performance Criteria (see
BAL-001-0).
>
> (ii) Contingency reserve. An amount of Spinning Reserve and Nonspinning Reserve
(at least half of which must be Spinning Reserve), sufficient to meet the NERC
Disturbance Control Standard BAL-002-0, equal to the greater of:
>
> (a) The loss of generating capacity due to forced outages of generation or
transmission equipment that would result from the most severe single
contingency; or
>
> (b) The sum of five percent of the load responsibility served by hydro generation
and seven percent of the load responsibility served by thermal generation.
The combined unit ramp rate of each Balancing Authority's on-line, unloaded
generating capacity must be capable of responding to the Spinning Reserve
requirement of that Balancing Authority within ten minutes
>
> [iii (typo? omitted from text)] Additional reserve for interruptible imports. An amount of reserve, which can
be made effective within ten minutes, equal to interruptible imports.
>
> (iv) Additional reserve for on-demand obligations. An amount of reserve, which
can be made effective within ten minutes, equal to on-demand obligations to
other entities or Balancing Authorities.

Anyway let's say they need 40,000MW demand + 1,000 MW up/down regulation + 2,000 MW spinning reserve + 2,000 MW non-spinning reserves.

The ISOs have to pay for those extra ancillary services (up/down regulation + spinning/non-spinning reserves). How much is it?

Suppose the market clearing price is $80/MWh to cover the 40,000MW and $85/MWh for the next 1000 MW and $88 for the next 2000 MW and $93 for the next 2000 MW. How much do the awardees get for those services? 

Generator XYZ1 is a fast natural gas plant with 200MW capacity and XYZ1's bid is $79/MWh (below market clearing price) for the first 120MW and $82 for the next 40MW and $90 for the last 40MW.

The ISO picks the generators (ignoring for a moment the LMP differences due to congestion and losses) to cover the first 40,000MW at $80/MWh. These get paid for actually delivering energy, and that includes the first 120MW of XYZ1 since its bid was below the $80/MWh point.

As I understand it, the ISO will also pick the generators to cover up-regulation, spinning, and non-spinning reserves by using the bids for generation that meet these requirements but which offered slightly more than the $80/MWh market clearing price, in order of the bids, so XYZ1 might get picked for 40MW of up-regulation (MCP = $85 vs. generator bid of $82) and 40MW of non-spinning reserves (MCP = $93 vs generator bid of $90).

How much does generator XYZ1 actually get paid?

-----

edit: [the present CAISO tariff](https://www.caiso.com/documents/section-11-california-iso-settlements-and-billing-as-of-nov-1-2024.pdf) says

> **11.10.3.2 Hourly User Rate for Spinning Reserves**
>
>The hourly user rate for Spinning Reserves is the ratio of: (1) the sum of the portion of Spinning Reserve
Cost used to meet the spin requirement and the portion of Regulation Up cost that can substitute for
Spinning Reserve and (2) the Net Procurement quantity of Spinning Reserves by the CAISO ($/MW).
The cost of Regulation Up substituting for Spinning Reserve is the user rate for Regulation Up multiplied
by the quantity of Regulation Up used to satisfy the Spinning Reserve requirement.
The CAISO‚Äôs Spinning Reserve Cost is equal to: (i) the revenues paid to the suppliers of the total
awarded Spinning Reserve capacity in the Day-Ahead Market, HASP, and Real-Time Market, minus, (ii)
the payments rescinded due to either the failure to conform to Dispatch Instructions or the unavailability of
the Spinning Reserves under Section 8.10.8. The Net Procurement of Spinning Reserves is equal to: (i)
the amount (MWs) of total awarded Spinning Reserve capacity in the Day-Ahead Market, HASP, and
Real-Time Market, minus, (ii) the Spinning Reserve capacity associated with payments rescinded
pursuant to any of the provisions of Section 8.10.8. The amount (MW) of awarded Spinning Reserve
capacity includes the amounts (MW) associated with any Regulation Up Reserve capacity used as
Spinning Reserve under Section 8.2.3.5.

But does that apply whether or not the generator actually provides power in case of contingencies?"

The model is a sony vsx-9500s i was wondering how do hook up my turntable to the unit. Also I want to use it as 2 channel I have 2 tower speakers. Is it possible to hook up a powered subwoofer? If so how would I go about doing that. Does any one have experience with this type of receiver?
