What Makes Braintrust Unique?

Braintrust's key value proposition is an efficient price discovery, made possible by its decentralized nature. Usually, companies don't have the time and resources to hire staff at their perceived market value, forcing them to acquire talent from middlemen like consulting firms. However, this talent comes with a significant mark-up. 

On Braintrust, a talent's price is influenced by their rate, skills and location. Talent placing bids must thoroughly list skills, set competitive prices and ensure locations align with existing client demand. Clients placing asks must offer competitive pay but keep required skills and experience broad enough to find enough matching talent. Simultaneously, expanding suitable time zones will increase the chances of success. 

Unlike centralized platforms, Braintrust does not charge talent fees. Clients are charged 10% of the total contract value, which is used to pay network operations costs. Since token holders vote on governance proposals, they decide the incentive structure for talent, allowing them to keep between 20% and 45% more of their earnings compared to traditional platforms. 

Clients profit from Braintrust's community-driven screening process and flexibly adjust to market demand by hiring competent freelancers instead of full-time employees. In doing this, they save between 50% and 75% compared to sourcing talent from external providers, according to Braintrust.

Connectors are incentivized to onboard their existing talent networks to the platform since they receive an increasing share of referrals' invoices from completed projects. 

--------------------------------------

Braintrust's mission is to build the world's most impactful talent Network -- One that is user owned, aligns incentives, and redistributes value to talent and organizations. At Braintrust, our decentralized talent network is built on the belief that everyone should be treated fairly. Fees should be transparent. Incentives should be aligned. And the huge percentages taken by middleman should be a thing of the past. This new model is uniquely enabled by a blockchain technology and the BTRST Token."

"CoinEx | Offering Free BTRST for Talent Referral, How Braintrust Overtakes Traditional Recruitment Platforms?",u_CoinExcom,q106rr,2021-10-04 02:48:54,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_CoinExcom/comments/q106rr/coinex_offering_free_btrst_for_talent_referral/,CoinExcom,," In September 2021, Coinbase listed Braintrust‚Äôs token BTRST, which rose nearly 200% in a single day, putting the freelancer recruitment platform on the radar.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, economies around the world have seen different levels of impact. As the pandemic continues to aggravate, unemployment has risen sharply across the globe, while telecommuting and freelancing are also on the rise. In this context, Braintrust has emerged to give its users more flexible, efficient, and unconstrained work opportunities.

Unlike traditional recruitment platforms, Braintrust is a decentralized marketplace for talent networks that replaces the conventional dispersive human resources market with community participation and algorithmically controlled marketplaces. It aims to transform the gig economy by connecting the world‚Äôs top talents (mainly engineers, designers, and developers for now) with established companies in a decentralized way.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qjzqugfgrdr71.png?width=2100&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5d16543cf8b34778b938e829f6ea9176ea8f052

The Braintrust platform has been developed and maintained by global community contributors from more than 100 countries. Its community works with hundreds of Fortune 1000 companies, including Goldman Sachs, Nike, American Eagle Outfitters, Atlassian, Porsche, Under Armour, and Wayfair.

On September 1, 2021, the platform issued BTRST based on the ERC20 standard, with a total supply of 250 million, 54% of which goes to community incentives and rewards, allocated as recommendation engines, subsidies and bonuses.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nygvjezhrdr71.png?width=2100&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1bb3c296dc7b2f61a3b4890922b543aefd54e55

Users can earn BTRST through various contributions to the platform, including building a talent profile (work experience and skills certification, etc.), referring new talents or new clients, and helping to examine and manage the talent pool. In a word, by bringing clients (demand side) and talents (supply side) to the platform, users can earn BTRST. Clients (demand side) can spend BTRST on posting job demands, whereas, talents (supply side) can pay BTRST to refine their resumes or take professional courses to improve their skills.

In addition, BTRST plays other roles on the Braintrust platform:

1. An endorsement for talent caliber. Talents stake BTRST to present their work abilities, thus having a better chance of standing out, winning a job, and building a stronger relationship of trust with the employer.

2. A share of decision-making and platform governance. BTRST inspires the community to provide an inexhaustible source of motivation for platform governance. With BTRST in hand, users can vote on Braintrust‚Äôs future direction or participate in essential decision-making, including fee structure, roadmap, and new platform features. Braintrust uses a ‚Äúone-token, one-vote‚Äù system to give token holders proportional access to platform governance.

3. Access to unique benefits. BTRST can be used to redeem special benefits explicitly created for the Braintrust community, such as free and discounted software, products, career resources, and community benefits.

Also, it is worth mentioning that BTRST is not for payment but for community incentives. In other words, employers still pay their talents fiat money (mainly US dollars) instead of BTRST, so users don‚Äôt have to worry about BTRST price fluctuations affecting their income. Of course, BTRST is more than an incentive, and more features will be unlocked as the project continues to evolve.

I didn‚Äôt see it listed early enough to ride that wave, so I‚Äôve kept it on my watch, as typically these capitulation events result in a steep sell off to oversold levels that they bounce hard from.

That got me looking into their white paper and tokenomics and it actually sounds really good to me. Fiiver‚Äôs market cap is $8B, Upwork‚Äôs market cap is $6B, and BTRST says they want to compete with uber/Lyft/doordash as well. 

They have contracts with Nestle in which the CEO hired out work in South America and saved $300k or something like that as well as contracts with NASA and Nike among others.

What are your thoughts here? I think this could easily retrace $30 being in oversold levels right now, the tokenomics look decent with 46% going to early contributors/investors/early coin sale and 54% going to community incentives and rewards. 46% is kind of a lot for early investors and creators, but I‚Äôd imagine there were a lot of investors and people that had to come together to get this started.

What are your thoughts on this good or bad? Should I try to catch the knife? Should I wait to let the dust settle? Am I mistaken and do those tokenomics look like shit? Any insight is appreciated."

They say they are the first decentralized (nonprofit) network that connects skilled freelancers to reputable brands like ""Nestle, Porsche, Atlassian, Nasa, Goldman Sachs and Nike."" Allowing the freelancers to retain 100% of their earnings. Making it easier for companies to enlist outside talent. \[[1](https://www.usebraintrust.com/btrst-token)\] I have not found any documented evidence of the 'reputable brands' listed so if you found something I did not, I will add it in as an edit. All I've found, really, is this article on Decrypt \[[2](https://decrypt.co/80008/decentralized-talent-network-braintrust-is-working-nike-goldman-more-ethereum)\]

The CEO is Adam Jackson. He's done quite a bit like being a co-founder and CEO of Doctor On Demand which did 'Video Visits' for board-certified physicians and psychologists. Founded MarketSquare in 2004, DriverSide (founded in 2007) which was acquired by Advanced Auto Parts in 2011. Serves as Managing Partner & CTO of Cambrain Asset Management (blockchain asset management company). Also the co-founder and CEO of Freelance Labs, Inc., which is the company building the network. He's done a lot, to be honest, so here's his past experience. \[[3](https://profiles.forbes.com/members/tech/profile/Adam-Jackson-Founder-CEO-Braintrust/760f9f07-a170-4b4c-b28a-b42a932cfcba)\]

Gabriel Luna-Ostaseski is the other cofounder of Freelance Labs, Inc. He's the founder of Upshift which is similar to what Braintrust aims to do. Upshift seems to be doing pretty well but I'm not diving too deep into it. He seems to be a big sales kind of guy so that looks to be his background. \[[4](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/gabriel-luna-ostaseski)\]

Now to the dirty deets. Some of the backers are Coinbase Ventures (obvi), Pantera, Galaxy Digital, ACME, some others I'm too lazy to list \[[5](https://www.usebraintrust.com/)\]. [This](https://decrypt.co/80008/decentralized-talent-network-braintrust-is-working-nike-goldman-more-ethereum) article on Decrypt does a good job at describing the projects details. Why they created it, how it works, who it vets, etc. Also in the article, it talks about how the token is forked from COMP (Compound). On track to do $31m in invoice volume this year and has tripled in size by clients, workers, and job postings since the June 2020 launch. With an average pay of $92 an hour and an average project worth $57k. *Mind you, that is the information Braintrust has given.*

Tokenomics. Currently, it is trading at $41.44. The trading volume is $72.3m. The volume/market cap has no data currently. And the circulating supply is not available at this time. Has a max supply of 250m coins all according to CoinMarketCap. The breakdown is as follows: Community Incentives and Reward: 54%, Early Token Purchasers: 22%, Early Contributors: 19%, and CoinList Sale: 5%. \[[6](https://www.usebraintrust.com/hubfs/Braintrust_Token_Economics_9_2_21.pdf)\]

Their [White Paper](https://www.usebraintrust.com/hubfs/%5BWhitepaper%5D%20Braintrust_The_Decentralized_Talent_Network_9_2_21.pdf) is also an interesting read. Basically talking about how more people are moving towards virtual work due to COVID-19 and they aim to help the talent that has to deal with high fees and cuts.

So yeah. I think it definitely has a use and it is an original idea for blockchain. Have I bought? Not yet and probably won't until the dust has settled since new listings always spike on CB. I'll be keeping an eye on it and figured you guys might like to see a more detailed look into the project.

Have a good night guys. Stay classy.

Edit: Something I forgot to add that u/djiboutiiii asked. How do they make money since it all goes to the talent? This is directly from their Whitepaper:

""Talent are charged no fees: they are paid their full contracted rate (whether that be per hour or per project). Clients are charged 10% of the total contract value, an amount that is significantly less than in other networks and consulting firms. That fee is used to pay the costs of network operations, so talent and clients alike see the benefit. In short, Braintrust is designed to be self-sustaining, rather than chase profits by ramping up fees."""

AMA + An insider's review of the highest paying freelance platforms,jobs,pnu4yo,2021-09-13 22:39:26,19,0.86,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/pnu4yo/ama_an_insiders_review_of_the_highest_paying/,CriticDanger,AMA,"Hello all!

I'm in the unique position of having used many different platforms for freelance work, and I've been accepted in many of the more premium/exclusive ones as well. In this post I'll review the best three I've used so far, which are Toptal, BrainTrust and 10xManagement. I've also used Upwork, Freelancer, Elance and Fiverr both as an employee and employer.

Why are those three the best? For **experienced** freelancers (they all require experience and are very hard to get accepted into), these platforms will give you the best clients, which means the best wages and the best projects. All three are also very professional and will support their talent better than a low-end freelance site. Not to say they are perfect, all of them have issues, but they're better than the current alternatives.

Let's go!

# [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/#bring-in-incredible-hackers-now)

Toptal is the biggest one of those three (maybe the biggest premium platform overall) and has the most jobs, by far. It is the most well-known of the three, and as such, they are in a dominant position in this market and they know it, so they can charge higher fees for example.

They are a typical marketplace in which, once approved, you get to see all the listings and apply to them. Because you've already been technically vetted by Toptal, clients usually won't test you, and the interviews are mostly to check communication and fit.

### Jobs

At this moment, there are [127 jobs](https://i.imgur.com/y8r7W87.png) that have been added within the last 7 days. This doesn't include jobs that require a specialization, if you include those, then it's over 150. These are serious clients that had to put in a deposit to create a job posting.

If your goal is to get hired as fast as possible, Toptal wins out here, and there is also a good diversity of contracts.

The quality of the jobs/employers vary, you can find a contract with Airbnb on there or you can find a contract with a small startup. Overall, there is a minimum standard, and you won't find a truly terrible/broke client on there, clients are vetted and must put down a deposit.

### Rates

Expect between $40-100/h for the vast majority (90%+) of roles. 

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/XBtEVd4.png) is a chart directly from Toptal that shows what a client is expected to pay per hour for their talent. If these numbers look higher than what I wrote above, that's because the talent doesn't see those rates.

In Toptal, the neither client nor the talent know each other's rate, the talent sets his own rate and the client will see the talent's rate with the Toptal fee already added on top. This varies, but generally the Toptal fee is about 50% (!) of the talent rate, so if your rate is $60, the client might pay 80-100/h for you. 


### Joining Toptal

It is pretty difficult to get accepted in Toptal, there are five steps in the interview process and some require good algorithmic knowledge, others require a lot of free time. They get hundreds of applicants per day because of how well-known the platform is.

To join, simply go [here](https://www.toptal.com/#bring-in-incredible-hackers-now) and sign up, you'll be contacted for the first step of the interview in a bit.

The first step is a simple interview to test your English and communication skills. Next, they‚Äôll send you a codility test to complete. If you pass that, you‚Äôll get a technical interview with an engineer, who might ask algorithmic type questions as well. After that, you‚Äôll have a take home project to complete, and a final interview demonstrating the project you‚Äôve built.

# [Braintrust](https://www.usebraintrust.com/join-engineer?utm_source=talent&utm_medium=community&utm_campaign=dc_ref)

Braintrust is the newest one here. It was founded in 2018 but it's only really starting to pick up in popularity recently. The overall process overall is fairly similar to Toptal, you go through an interview process, and once approved, you apply to positions.

They are already working with large companies such as NASA, Porsche, Deloitte, Nike etc.

One interesting quirk of Braintrust is that they are trying to make the platform more ""decentralized"", and ""talent-owned"". They have their own crypto (btrst) which launched recently, and btrst holders will be able to vote on proposals to the platform (governance), theoretically even important things like modifying the fees could be voted upon.

### Jobs

At this moment there are 40 jobs in the last 7 days. Most are development jobs, but there are also jobs for Product Management, Project Management, Designers and more, same as Toptal. There are also jobs that don‚Äôt fit into those buckets, such a communications manager, copywriter and such, so it‚Äôs still worth considering for non-traditional remote roles.

The jobs are very competitive so it‚Äôs difficult to get hired. The clients are high quality and there are a lot of approved Freelancers, some whom are very good, so you need to really stand out. I expect the balance to change soon as the platform aims to onboard more clients.



### Rates

The rates at Braintrust are pretty good. Braintrust only takes 10% from the client and 0% from the talent, so you nearly get the rate the client pays. The vast majority of roles pay between 50-150/h, although there are some outliers on both sides.

### Joining Braintrust

Simply sign up [here](https://www.usebraintrust.com/join-engineer?utm_source=talent&utm_medium=community&utm_campaign=dc_ref). You‚Äôll enter a waiting list before getting interviewed. Fill out your profile as much as you can as it might accelerate the time it takes you to get an interview.

The waiting list is pretty short at the moment but that might change as the network might gain a lot of publicity soon.

As for the process itself, it‚Äôs a fairly simple one, there is an initial screening call in which your communication skills will be evaluated, a second stage in which you‚Äôll be asked to complete a coding challenge and a third stage which is the behavioral and technical interview. The interviews are not challenging per say, however, Braintrust is very selective and thus you need your communication and technical skills to be on point.

# [10x Management](https://10xmanagement.com/)

This one is a little bit more secretive, but it is nonetheless a very good option for highly skilled freelancers and possibly the one with the highest rates overall.

The owners used to manage music talented and pivoted to manage tech talent, in a similar manner, and they‚Äôve done so pretty successfully. For their permanent talent, they somewhat ‚Äúguarantee‚Äù that they‚Äôll find you work full-time or part-time, as they would with entertainment talent, and for that reason they have very few engineers whom are very highly qualified. If they are representing you, they will also do as much as they can to ensure you get paid by the client, up to assisting in legal matters.

They are not a marketplace per say like the other two, you don‚Äôt have access to the list of all positions, a 10x agent will contact you directly when they have an opportunity for you and you get to either accept or refuse an interview with the client for that position.

### Jobs

Due to the nature of how they work, I can‚Äôt really know how many jobs they have available, I can only know about the ones they contact me for, or sometimes they‚Äôll ask everyone for a job that is specifically difficult to fill. My guess is they likely don‚Äôt have too many openings at a time, maybe 10-30, but they do have a lot of talent working on long-term engagement.

If you manage to become officially represented by 10x, they would generally find you enough opportunities to fill your time, but getting represented as such is very difficult. They have A-tier customers as well, such as BMW, Berkeley, Ebay, Nordstrom, Yelp etc.

However, they are moving away from that model somewhat and most of the new talent instead gets a non-exclusive contract, in which they can work on other projects too and 10x doesn‚Äôt guarantee to fill their time.

### Rates

The rates at 10x are the highest of all 3 and generally start at around 175/h. If you‚Äôre a super specialist or you have very impressive experience, you can sometimes double or even triple that. It‚Äôs also possible to get a lower rate than that, although anything under 100 would be pretty much unheard of. As for the fees, they are charged to the talent and are generally about 15% for represented individuals, and 25% for the non-exclusive folks. 

### Joining 10x Management

Joining 10x is close to impossible. They make that very obvious as they don‚Äôt even have a form to apply as talent. Essentially, they‚Äôll be the ones reaching out to you if you‚Äôre a truly great engineer or you‚Äôre very well known.

That‚Äôs probably pretty disappointing reading this after I tell you about their amazing clients and rates...but well‚Ä¶ there may be another way. As 10x comes from entertainment talent management, they view relationships as extremely important. So essentially, if you want to get in, you need to both be talented and know someone on the inside that can refer you and vouch for you. Check your linked in contacts properly (build them if you have a poor network), maybe you already know someone that‚Äôs part of the network..

As for the process to join the network one you‚Äôre in the pipeline, it‚Äôs a fairly simple process, you‚Äôll have a call with the founder to ensure you have the right communication style (communication is the most important thing in 10x), and if that goes well, you‚Äôll have another interview with an engineer. If that goes well, then you‚Äôre in, and you‚Äôll start getting emails once in a while for potential gigs.

=========

# Ending words

There you have it. If you‚Äôve got some experience under your belt and/or a good portfolio, give a shot to a few of these, and if you get rejected the first time, try again in 6 months. None of these platforms will reject you ‚Äúpermanently‚Äù, unless you do something stupid, keep studying and working hard and apply again later. Feel free to ask me anything in the comments!

Edit: It's late but Ill answer questions tomorrow too."

The rates at Braintrust are pretty good. Braintrust only takes 10% from the client and 0% from the talent, so you nearly get the rate the client pays. The vast majority of roles pay between 50-150/h, although there are some outliers on both sides.

### Joining Braintrust

Simply sign up [here](https://www.usebraintrust.com/join-engineer?utm_source=talent&utm_medium=community&utm_campaign=dc_ref). You‚Äôll enter a waiting list before getting interviewed. Fill out your profile as much as you can as it might accelerate the time it takes you to get an interview.

The waiting list is pretty short at the moment but that might change as the network might gain a lot of publicity soon.

As for the process itself, it‚Äôs a fairly simple one, there is an initial screening call in which your communication skills will be evaluated, a second stage in which you‚Äôll be asked to complete a coding challenge and a third stage which is the behavioral and technical interview. The interviews are not challenging per say, however, Braintrust is very selective and thus you need your communication and technical skills to be on point.

# [10x Management](https://10xmanagement.com/)

This one is a little bit more secretive, but it is nonetheless a very good option for highly skilled freelancers and possibly the one with the highest rates overall.

The owners used to manage music talented and pivoted to manage tech talent, in a similar manner, and they‚Äôve done so pretty successfully. For their permanent talent, they somewhat ‚Äúguarantee‚Äù that they‚Äôll find you work full-time or part-time, as they would with entertainment talent, and for that reason they have very few engineers whom are very highly qualified. If they are representing you, they will also do as much as they can to ensure you get paid by the client, up to assisting in legal matters.

They are not a marketplace per say like the other two, you don‚Äôt have access to the list of all positions, a 10x agent will contact you directly when they have an opportunity for you and you get to either accept or refuse an interview with the client for that position.

### Jobs

Due to the nature of how they work, I can‚Äôt really know how many jobs they have available, I can only know about the ones they contact me for, or sometimes they‚Äôll ask everyone for a job that is specifically difficult to fill. My guess is they likely don‚Äôt have too many openings at a time, maybe 10-30, but they do have a lot of talent working on long-term engagement.

If you manage to become officially represented by 10x, they would generally find you enough opportunities to fill your time, but getting represented as such is very difficult. They have A-tier customers as well, such as BMW, Berkeley, Ebay, Nordstrom, Yelp etc.

However, they are moving away from that model somewhat and most of the new talent instead gets a non-exclusive contract, in which they can work on other projects too and 10x doesn‚Äôt guarantee to fill their time.

### Rates

The rates at 10x are the highest of all 3 and generally start at around 175/h. If you‚Äôre a super specialist or you have very impressive experience, you can sometimes double or even triple that. It‚Äôs also possible to get a lower rate than that, although anything under 100 would be pretty much unheard of. As for the fees, they are charged to the talent and are generally about 15% for represented individuals, and 25% for the non-exclusive folks. 

### Joining 10x Management

Joining 10x is close to impossible. They make that very obvious as they don‚Äôt even have a form to apply as talent. Essentially, they‚Äôll be the ones reaching out to you if you‚Äôre a truly great engineer or you‚Äôre very well known.

That‚Äôs probably pretty disappointing reading this after I tell you about their amazing clients and rates...but well‚Ä¶ there may be another way. As 10x comes from entertainment talent management, they view relationships as extremely important. So essentially, if you want to get in, you need to both be talented and know someone on the inside that can refer you and vouch for you. Check your linked in contacts properly (build them if you have a poor network), maybe you already know someone that‚Äôs part of the network..

As for the process to join the network one you‚Äôre in the pipeline, it‚Äôs a fairly simple process, you‚Äôll have a call with the founder to ensure you have the right communication style (communication is the most important thing in 10x), and if that goes well, you‚Äôll have another interview with an engineer. If that goes well, then you‚Äôre in, and you‚Äôll start getting emails once in a while for potential gigs.

There you have it. If you‚Äôve got some experience under your belt and/or a good portfolio, give a shot to a few of these, and if you get rejected the first time, try again in 6 months. None of these platforms will reject you ‚Äúpermanently‚Äù, unless you do something stupid, keep studying and working hard and apply again later. Feel free to ask me anything in the comments!

AMA + An insider's review of the highest paying freelance platforms,digitalnomad,pnu347,2021-09-13 22:36:14,48,0.92,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/pnu347/ama_an_insiders_review_of_the_highest_paying/,CriticDanger,Business,"Hello all!

I'm in the unique position of having used many different platforms for freelance work, and I've been accepted in many of the more premium/exclusive ones as well. In this post I'll review the best three I've used so far, which are Toptal, BrainTrust and 10xManagement. I've also used Upwork, Freelancer, Elance and Fiverr both as an employee and employer.

Why are those three the best? For **experienced** freelancers (they all require experience and are very hard to get accepted into), these platforms will give you the best clients, which means the best wages and the best projects. All three are also very professional and will support their talent better than a low-end freelance site. Not to say they are perfect, all of them have issues, but they're better than the current alternatives.

Let's go!

# [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/X9noVK/worlds-top-talent)

Toptal is the biggest one of those three (maybe the biggest premium platform overall) and has the most jobs, by far. It is the most well-known of the three, and as such, they are in a dominant position in this market and they know it, so they can charge higher fees for example.

They are a typical marketplace in which, once approved, you get to see all the listings and apply to them. Because you've already been technically vetted by Toptal, clients usually won't test you, and the interviews are mostly to check communication and fit.

### Jobs

At this moment, there are [127 jobs](https://i.imgur.com/y8r7W87.png) that have been added within the last 7 days. This doesn't include jobs that require a specialization, if you include those, then it's over 150. These are serious clients that had to put in a deposit to create a job posting.

If your goal is to get hired as fast as possible, Toptal wins out here, and there is also a good diversity of contracts.

The quality of the jobs/employers vary, you can find a contract with Airbnb on there or you can find a contract with a small startup. Overall, there is a minimum standard, and you won't find a truly terrible/broke client on there, clients are vetted and must put down a deposit.

### Rates

Expect between $40-100/h for the vast majority (90%+) of roles. 

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/XBtEVd4.png) is a chart directly from Toptal that shows what a client is expected to pay per hour for their talent. If these numbers look higher than what I wrote above, that's because the talent doesn't see those rates.

In Toptal, the neither client nor the talent know each other's rate, the talent sets his own rate and the client will see the talent's rate with the Toptal fee already added on top. This varies, but generally the Toptal fee is about 50% (!) of the talent rate, so if your rate is $60, the client might pay 80-100/h for you. 


### Joining Toptal

It is pretty difficult to get accepted in Toptal, there are five steps in the interview process and some require good algorithmic knowledge, others require a lot of free time. They get hundreds of applicants per day because of how well-known the platform is.

To join, simply go [here](https://topt.al/Zzc4yv) and sign up, you'll be contacted for the first step of the interview in a bit.

The first step is a simple interview to test your English and communication skills. Next, they‚Äôll send you a codility test to complete. If you pass that, you‚Äôll get a technical interview with an engineer, who might ask algorithmic type questions as well. After that, you‚Äôll have a take home project to complete, and a final interview demonstrating the project you‚Äôve built.

# [Braintrust](https://www.usebraintrust.com/join-engineer?utm_source=talent&utm_medium=community&utm_campaign=dc_ref)

Braintrust is the newest one here. It was founded in 2018 but it's only really starting to pick up in popularity recently. The overall process overall is fairly similar to Toptal, you go through an interview process, and once approved, you apply to positions.

They are already working with large companies such as NASA, Porsche, Deloitte, Nike etc.

One interesting quirk of Braintrust is that they are trying to make the platform more ""decentralized"", and ""talent-owned"". They have their own crypto (btrst) which launched recently, and btrst holders will be able to vote on proposals to the platform (governance), theoretically even important things like modifying the fees could be voted upon.

### Jobs

At this moment there are 40 jobs in the last 7 days. Most are development jobs, but there are also jobs for Product Management, Project Management, Designers and more, same as Toptal. There are also jobs that don‚Äôt fit into those buckets, such a communications manager, copywriter and such, so it‚Äôs still worth considering for non-traditional remote roles.

The jobs are very competitive so it‚Äôs difficult to get hired. The clients are high quality and there are a lot of approved Freelancers, some whom are very good, so you need to really stand out. I expect the balance to change soon as the platform aims to onboard more clients.



### Rates
