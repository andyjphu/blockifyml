Where can I learn to fully understand PostgreSQL EXPLAIN plans and execution details?,SQL,1i9x9qi,2025-01-25 16:16:07,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/1i9x9qi/where_can_i_learn_to_fully_understand_postgresql/,Darkfra,PostgreSQL,"Hi everyone,



I‚Äôve been working with PostgreSQL and trying to optimize queries using EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS), but I feel like I‚Äôm not fully grasping all the details provided in the execution plans.



Specifically, I‚Äôm looking for resources to better understand:

‚Ä¢ **Node Types** (e.g., Bitmap Heap Scan, Nested Loop, Gather Merge, etc.) ‚Äì When are they used, and how should I interpret them?

‚Ä¢ **Buffers & Blocks** (Shared Hit Blocks, Read Blocks, etc.) ‚Äì What exactly happens at each stage?

‚Ä¢ **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)** ‚Äì How does it impact performance, and what should I watch for in execution plans?

‚Ä¢ **Incremental Sort, Parallel Queries, and other advanced optimizations**



I‚Äôve gone through the official PostgreSQL documentation, but I‚Äôd love to find more in-depth explanations, tutorials, or books that provide real-world examples and detailed breakdowns of query execution behavior.



Any recommendations for books, courses, or articles that explain these concepts in detail?



Thanks in advance for your suggestions!"
Im Sleep Deprived. Redoing Sherman lore because the first one sucks.,RobloxAvatars,1i9x7uu,2025-01-25 16:13:50,3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9x7uu,UnUmanoARandom,Avatar Lore üî•‚úçÔ∏è,"His name is  Sherman Hose. and he lived in the Nest of District 12. He's now 23 years old, and he's (STILL) not married. he got accepted as an Agent in Lobotomy Corporation, with a girl that I shall name ""Tulip"" for anonymous reasons. She was a German girl who almost never had friends. Only Sherman was, and she cared very much for him. So much that, when his parents died, she was willing to do all the work herself instead of him. Housework, groceries, (rarely) cat caretaking, everything. He didn't have to move a muscle. At night, she would go into his bed, hugging him from behind 

Sherman was always a kind boy (and deep down, a simp.), and didn't appreciate that Tulip would do all the work for him. From time to time, when he was sure he could do something, he asks her to stop, and she would obey him without a second thought. ...to which Sherman would call her for assistance. She would chuckle, or giggle, but the result was still her helping him out. Sometimes he could do something on his own, and she would compliment him on his accomplishment.

...such kind and sincere words... ...like what a true parent would have said to their child...

On their first day at work at Lobotomy Corp, he quickly learned that this was gonna be one of THOSE places. With nightmarish abominations... And so far, there were only a floating skull with heavy Christian implications and a Bird with a second mouth for a head. He only liked the skull, because he was also Cristian, and he thought that it was Jesus Christ. So he usually went to him to confess his sins when he killed someone/something.

Tulip would have also forgave him, saying that ""It's probably just what happens everyday! You'll get used to it!"". ...Thing is: YES. It's what happens everyday. BUT: **it'll get worse from here...**

20 days after first entering the corporation, they both befriended an Abnormality with the ID of O-01-04. Upon seeing her for the first time, they thought that the corporation was inhumane, for trapping the girl inside like a sort of animal. Like a monster. They tried to free her, but it backfired, and the girl turned into a giant snake and attacked the whole facility. They promised themselves to not do that again, and they are more careful with her from then on. But still remained friends!  
...39 days have passed since I and Sherm. entered L Corp, and it's been 5 days since I, Poppie Tulipania Ghanpaudr, died, after confessing my sins to O-03-03... (Mf really died to One Sin)

I came back, at night, to see him again, on the same spot, to give him consolation and reassuring him everything will be alright. I didn't see him tonight. I went to the containment cell of O-01-12, because that's where he usually goes now, other than O-03-03, and she started to speak, as if she knew I was there.

**¬´Dearie, dearie... Would you like to hear a story?¬ª**

**""No, I just wanna know where Sherm is-""** the Old Lady interrupted me, and continued her story...

**¬´Once upon a time, near a woodpile... Near a woodpile... Where his mother met his father... There was a 18 year out boy, named Sherman... His parents asked him to come to see where they met each other...¬ª**

**""I just wanna SEE WHERE SHERMAN IS NOW!!!""**

**¬´...¬ª** She continued anyway. **¬´He killed them both, by tearing their head off, and drank their blood...¬ª**

**""...""**

**¬´He killed them on Friday, and buried them on Sunday. After having buried them, he asked a friend of his to pick them up and bring them home. He said to the friend that there was a murder who killed his parents in cold blood and that they seriously injured him too. The friend, who cared for him a lot, went to help him as soon as possible. While on the other part of the Woods, he went and made a grave injure onto himself. It took a lot of courage from him to do that...¬ª** 

**""...""**

**¬´But it took nothing from him to kill his parents, who he deemed dead weight.¬ª**

**""...""** I exit the containment cell, sitting down. If he did all that, I fear what he could do to an Abnormality. Or rather, to T-03-46...

...I'll let him do his thing and and kill the embryo (the Embryo is T-03-46 he isnt going to kill a random fetus). If he calls me, I'll go and look, and do what I always did when I was alive at L Corp.

I'll say that I'll be proud of him. He did say he would avenge me...

But then a hand reached out for his shoulder grabbing him with a strong grip. Sherman was stopped by Ayin (L Corp Manager) saying that he will doom all the facility if he lets his emotion control over him. And in the end he didnt do it. Always Smiling knowing that Tulip was still watching over him. (At the end of these events he became a fixer) 

And that wraps it up. im 90% even this lore sucks.

Which just leads me to get shot up...  

I guess what I'm asking for, the aim point on most aircraft should be engine/wings?   There's many times I get the ""severe damage"" alert but the still just fly at full damn speed...


Edit: and when engaging bombers, where to concentrate fire? I spent a good amount of time hitting them, setting fires but they will not go down, I tried bombers a few times, and one pass I get blown out of the sky....

I am a returning player and looking for some spicy mods to make the returning experience great. The problem is, i really don't know what I am doing (mainly what to choose from and what works together without breaking the game) I am aware there is an online guide for mods and some stuff there is definitely very cool and worth a try, but I'm not necessarily looking for any mods that add extra parts or changes to the editor, I was looking for other game changing features that I didn't find there, I will try to list them all separately and briefly to avoid confusion: 

1 - A mod that enhances the overall detail/feel of the world, not necessarily gameplay changes here in this entry. Maybe some more detailed textures or color pallette shift, expanded terrain generation (larger trees or larger and diverse hills) some different assets and vegetation to the world, better lighting, different kinds of nests in creature stage maybe other visual effects like better rain or firelights at night, more visceral blood (I saw that one exists in the list) sound design like birds chirping, cool little but  imersive stuff like that.

2 - any mod that gives an extra stage, I saw that the aquatic stage used to be a thing but was scrapped on darkedgeTV, I didn't understand if that mod actually was launched or improved upon at all though

3 - a mod that gives an end goal to the game, I realize that goes aggainst the entire point of the game beeing a sandbox but when I was 12 and got to the center of the galaxy I just thought ""no way, that's it!?!"" basically anything that enhances the campaign/adventure side of the game or gives a new story/end goal, if such a mod even exists 

4 - any other mod that enhances the already existing stages, im pretty sure I saw one that enhances the cell stage (which is direly needed) but cant remember the name. Any other mod that overhauls the gameplay of each stage is something I would consider 

 sorry if this has already been discussed/doesnt even exist. I await for your tips! Thanks in advance "

There's gonna be spoilers for Logan AND Fang in this one so... avert your eyes and whatnot


I originally intended to go for Fang,  but my own inability to set the main story aside meant I was just waiting for him to come around eternally, so I just gave up and went for Logan instead. I made a split save right before I met up with Logan for Cornered Beasts. I wanted to go ahead with Logan and then come back to that save and wait for Fang. 

That's what I did, married Logan (Fang finally was ready to do ""Leaving the Nest"" AT MY GODDAMN WEDDING), had a kid with him even, cried when it was all over, the works. 

Then I decided the best way to get over it being over with that saga is to go back to that save, don't do any hearts in Cornered Beasts, and finally wait for Fang. I did so, nearly broke my heart, I couldn't help hearing disappointment in his voice during some of the lines.

But anyway, experienced Fang and all his glory, married him, everything is great, I'm not advancing the main plot or anything sono need to do anything but his quests. I was already at a late enough point in the main story where the requirements for starting ""Him"" were already fulfilled.

So I'm doin that quest, loving the drama, but of  course I don't have 500 hyacinth orchids so I need to go gather them! 

Logan is out there by his outpost and I decided to have him follow me so he kill scorpions as I'm inspecting the bushes.

I first caught it out of the corner of my eye... he's running a bit to close to me... wait no way, is he holding my hand? Sure enough he was, confirmed by him saying hold on he's gonna lose his grip! Then he starts talking about walking around with that special someone, you all know the lines...

We hadn't gotten to that point in our relationship in this save... it was another save entirely. 

Anyway, Logan... love you bud but you can't be flirting while I'm trying to save my husband's father's life lmao"

Sorry if this isn‚Äôt the type of post allowed on here, but my fianc√© and I are getting married this spring and thinking of starting our family in the next couple years. We‚Äôre both only children and I‚Äôve always wanted a big family, as in 5 or 6 kids. Fianc√© is on board but thinks he should have majored in something else lol. He‚Äôs a civil engineer and I‚Äôm an elementary teacher. We‚Äôre both just starting our careers and I plan to stay at home when the kids are young, so obviously that budget will be stretching like Temu slime. But in 10ish years, with both our incomes combined with side hustles, we‚Äôd probably be pulling in 200k or a little over, which sounds great for one kid but very much of a stretch for 5 or 6, especially since we live in a somewhat HCOL area. I do have a very nice nest egg gifted to me by my parents, but I want to invest that and save it for my kids‚Äô college rather than touching it day-to-day.¬†

So my question is, how much money do you think it takes to raise a family of 5-6 kids comfortably? Not as in, they all get an Audi when they turn 16 and we jet off to Hawaii every winter, obviously, but having the experiences of a normal middle-class childhood. Sharing rooms, living in a smaller house, budgeting, thrifting, and generally living frugally is expected, but I want them to be able to take music lessons, go to the occasional expensive summer camp, pursue their passions to the highest level, and not feel like they‚Äôre missing out on things their friends get because they had the misfortune of being born into a big family. Is it a total pipe dream? Should we move somewhere else? Fianc√© said I should start an OnlyFans catering to people with a pregnancy fetish; should I start researching webcams?

Color Wow Dream Coat Supernatural Spray is a groundbreaking hair product designed to combat frizz, smooth hair, and create a sleek, glass-like finish. Suitable for all hair types, this innovative spray leverages advanced technology to deliver long-lasting results, ensuring your hair looks and feels its best.\
Key Features and Benefits:\
Humidity-Proofing Technology: At the heart of Color Wow Dream Coat Supernatural Spray is its humidity-proofing technology. This advanced formula forms an invisible, water-repellent barrier around each hair strand, effectively sealing out moisture that can cause frizz. This ensures that your hair remains smooth, sleek, and frizz-free, even in high humidity.\
\
Lightweight and Non-Greasy: Despite its powerful performance, the Dream Coat spray is incredibly lightweight and non-greasy. It does not weigh hair down or leave any residue, making it perfect for all hair types, including fine hair that can be easily overwhelmed by heavier products.\
\
Heat-Activated Formula: Dream Coat is activated by the heat of your blow dryer. As you apply heat, the spray‚Äôs polymers crosslink to form an invisible hydrophobic matrix over the hair. This creates a lasting, ultra-smooth finish that can withstand up to 72 hours or until your next shampoo.\
\
Sleek and Silky Finish: The result is hair that looks and feels exceptionally smooth, sleek, and silky. Dream Coat enhances the hair‚Äôs natural shine, giving it a glossy, mirror-like finish that looks professionally styled.\
\
Color Protection: In addition to its anti-frizz benefits, Dream Coat also helps protect color-treated hair. By sealing the hair cuticle, it helps prevent color fade and maintains the vibrancy of your hair color.\
\
\
How to Use:\
\
 	Preparation: Start with freshly washed and conditioned hair. Towel dry to remove excess moisture.\
 	Application: Divide your hair into sections. Spray Dream Coat generously and evenly onto damp (not wet) hair. Make sure to saturate each section for optimal results.\
 	Blow Dry: Using a blow dryer, apply heat to activate the spray. For best results, use a brush to stretch and smooth each section while drying.\
 	Style: Style your hair as desired. Enjoy frizz-free, glossy hair for up to 72 hours.\
\
Why Choose Color Wow Dream Coat Supernatural Spray?\
Effortless Frizz Control: Dream Coat offers a simple, effective solution for frizz control, eliminating the need for multiple products. Its unique technology provides long-lasting results, making it a convenient choice for busy lifestyles.\
\
Professional Results at Home: Achieve salon-quality hair at home with Dream Coat. Its ability to create a sleek, glossy finish makes it a favorite among professional stylists and consumers alike.\
\
Versatility: Suitable for all hair types, Dream Coat works equally well on straight, wavy, curly, or coily hair. Whether you‚Äôre dealing with frizz, flyaways, or dullness, this spray can help transform your hair.\
\
Heat Protection: By forming a protective barrier around the hair, Dream Coat also offers some degree of heat protection, helping to shield your hair from damage caused by blow dryers and other styling tools.\
Conclusion:\
Color Wow Dream Coat Supernatural Spray is a revolutionary product that delivers on its promise of sleek, frizz-free hair.

I am feeling a need for some deep reflection with where I'm at in my polyamory journey and what I'm actually seeking. I'll share the context of my relationship and then some of the thoughts I've been having, and I'm hoping folks might be able to suggest some questions I can ask myself to, I don't know, be more connected with myself? Thanks in advance for any insight. 

Context:
I (F) have a beautiful relationship with my partner (nonbinary). We've been together nearly 3 years, and they have been with their other partner (nonbinary) for nearly 7 or so years. 

With their other partner, they coparent their teenager (not my meta's biological kid), and are basically nesting partners but not quite (long story lol). 

We all hang out together from time to time, and I also have a close relationship with their teenager. I'd say we practice what could be considered adjacent to kitchen table poly, but our partner is also so good at keeping our partnerships healthily separate. They hinge in a very respectful way, and my meta and I are also so mutually considerate of each other. All in all, I feel I've lucked out with the polycule. 

So, what's wrong then? 

Well, really nothing. I am just noticing at times I'm starting to really crave a nesting partner myself and to have my partner around more in general. But at other times, I don't want that at all and am so grateful I get to spend sweet time with my partner and then come home to my own house.

But when I'm sick or having a hard time, for example, I do wish they were just already there and didn't have to go so much out of their way to be there for me, and vice versa. And even when we're just excited about life, I wish we could witness that with each other in our day to day more. 

When I imagine the future, part of me wonders if we could all one day live together. We all sort of imagine little tiny houses on land or something, so we all can get that important alone time while still maintaining closeness, lol dreams right? Some of our friends share that vision too, but we've never explicitly talked about actually trying to make it happen with us. 

One problem with that is I have such a hard time with the idea of sharing with my partner what I do want for ""some day."" I'm afraid of us not sharing a vision and it impacting our relationship, and I'm scared of disrupting what I really feel is a beautiful relationship as it is. I feel closer with them then ever, I just have my own hang ups with vulnerability in some ways that I know I need to get over.

I have considered dating with the intention of finding a nesting partner, but that feels icky in a way to try and put someone into a box, and it's also just hard (I don't think I need to explain that too much lol). 

In short, I am confusing myself, and my partner isn't doing anything wrong. I just want more sometimes, but not others, and what the heck do I do with all that? My mind is playing some shenanigans for sure.

If you read all that, thanks! Appreciate everyone who contributed to this community in a positive way. I'm sure there are gaps in this story, so happy to offer any clarity. ‚ú®

Zanpakuto Sealed Appearance: Handmade Spring Steel Straight Blade Chinese War Dao Broadsword With Black Scabbard. 


Zanpakuto Name: Jinan (Ê¨°Áî∑)
Translation: Second born Son 

Release command:
Translation: All Things in Your Creation, All Memories in Your Mind, All Emotions in Your Heart, All Colors Within Your Soul, Flicker and Spark, Creating Embers in the Moonlight, as all things are Gambled Away


Zanpakuto spirit & Inner World: Now The inner world of Jinan is a vast and extravagant, but oddly confusing, taking the form of a opera theater house, mixed with a carnival performance tent, creating a awe inspiring attitude, with ornate architecture and a sense of grandeur. The theater is adorned with velvet curtains as well as maroon, gold and black tapestries lining the overhead booths, gilded pillars wrapped in painted designs, and intricate carvings along the walls depicting ancient religious stories, creating an atmosphere of mystique and enchantment. The seating area stretches out in all directions, seemingly infinite, with rows upon rows of empty seats that fade into the distance, With red carpets rolling out Into the infinite as well inbetween each row, Leading up to a ornate door that can never be reached or opened from within the inner world. Despite the vastness of the theater, the audience seats remain seemingly empty. However, upon closer inspection, one can detect faint silhouettes of figures occupying the seats. These shadowy entities represent the spirits of past dreams and aspirations that I had at one point in my life observing and lending their support to me. They remain silent, their presence a reminder of the hope and power contained within my Soul.
Now Throughout the theater, suspended in mid-air, are a multitude of playing cards. These cards hover and swirl around the magician, creating intricate patterns and displays of magic. The cards emanate a soft glow, each representing a different aspect or ability of Jinan. They shimmer with energy and occasionally transform into ethereal manifestations of the Jinan's powers.
At the center of the theater a stage stretches out, as the stage looks like it could perform 15 musicals all at once, and in behind the stage are musical instruments as well as props and set pieces that change dynamically to match the magician's tricks and illusions. Trap doors, mirrors, and hidden compartments are scattered throughout, allowing for seamless transitions and unexpected surprises. as far as the eye can see, as the curtains to the stage are always drawn back and shining and candle torches go throughout the theater along the walls lighting it up. 
The stage serves as the arena where Jinan's abilities are unleashed with dramatic flair. 
And standing at this very center of the stage, stands the magician performer himself,  Jinan, the physical Zanpakuto, Behind him are two beings dancing and singing, one is a woman of fire, the other is a man made of oil. Now although his attire has changed numerous times, Jinan is mainly seen Dressed in an elegant, Black and Gold tailored suit with a top hat cape and fully covered gold and ivory Face mask, the magician, Jinan, exudes an aura of a charismatic devil wrapped up in showmanship. And while Some other attire consists of leopard print jackets, some of them being from halfway across the world, from different regions, with some of his costumes being completely goofy And in some cases look almost completely unusable because of how thick they are, With them also appearing completely over the top some of them even featuring things like peacock feathers, snake skin, and even rhinoceros horns. In additional to his attire, he possess a mischievous smile and twinkling star filled eyes that hint at their mastery of illusion and sleight of hand. The magician Jinan's movements are graceful and precise, their every gesture accompanied by a flourish of glowing cards.


Shikai Appearance: Although I am by no means bound to a release command to enter the Shikai state, as My unity with my Zanpakuto will have long-since and indefinitely surpassed such a point, Just like most other captain class Shinigami, I would mostly Say so as a way of showing respect to My Zanpakuto, giving it what I believes is the proper respect. 
To initiate the release form of My Zanpakuto, I nonchalantly grab My Zanpakuto with My right hand before holding it out in front of me the point of the tip facing fowards, then releasing the hilt of the sword I then leave it suspended in the air, as I begins, turning and levitating the weapon vertically to the right using delicately controlled vibrating strings of Rieatsu, which leaves it hovering right in front of Me. Then with a loud and authoritative voice, I speak aloud and in a deep and authoritative tone, the release command as if it were a personal mantra or a saying from a lifelong religious understanding. 

‚ÄúAll Things in Your Creation, All Memories in Your Mind, All Emotions in Your Heart, All Colors Within Your Soul, Flicker and Spark, Creating Embers in the Moonlight, as all things are Gambled Away, Jinan.‚Äù

Now upon the usage of the release command, my I grab my blade upside down and begin spinning it in my hand causing It to transform and turn into a golden beam of light, that shines as bright as the sun, before it begins transforming itself into large metal spear, over six feet tall, and Is similar in appearance to the legendary norse spear Gungnir, the metal of the spear is engraved with multiple different kanji/katakana such as Gamble („ÇÆ„É£„É≥„Éñ„É´, Gyanburu) Fortune (Ë≤°Áî£, Zaisan) Luck (ÈÅã, Un) Wish (È°ò„ÅÑ, Negai) Value (‰æ°ÂÄ§, Kachi) Increase (Â¢óÂä†, Z≈çka) Probability (Á¢∫Áéá, Kakuritsu) Jackpot („Ç∏„É£„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Éù„ÉÉ„Éà, Jakkup≈çtto) and with two smaller extensions on either side just underneath the spearheads similar in design to eagle wings, Now the spearhead is wickedly pointed and narrow and is nearly twenty inches long, it boasts a razor-sharp cutting edge along either side of the spearheads edge, and it is dull and indented on either side, capable of either blocking or slamming into an opponent, like a hammer, to cause massive bludgeoning damage. Now¬†the deadliest part of the spearhead, however, is the tip, which rests at the end of the elongated pole. Although its strange and narrow blade makes it seem unwieldy to use the long-spear in a stabbing motion, with its sharpened point off-center thanks to its arrowhead-like design, its use is so purely ingrained within Me that i can find my target nearly one hundred percent of the time, calculating the difference between My line-of-thrust and the curve of My Zanpakut≈ç. The reason why the puncturing tip is so deadly is simply due to it's weight along with both it's sharpness and roughness; with a point less than a few particles in diameter, and the sides of the blade being so rough, it can pierce through and shatter almost any material with ease upon impact, barreling and plowing through defenses and other Zanpakut≈ç like a hot knife through butter.



Shikai abilities & Explanations. Now In the Shikai state, the Zanpakuto, known as ""Jinan - Second born Son,"" has one Ability known only as Kakekin no Z≈çka (Ë≥≠„ÅëÈáë„ÅÆÂ¢óÂä†, Increased Bet): and while powerful it lacks directly ""defensive capabilities"" but it possesses the unique ability to absorb and convert energy wether reishi and rieatsu from the surrounding environment into indestructible playing cards which constantly float above and around my head. The first card that is created is the Number Ace card, representing duality and balance, As i can absorb energy from every sources, whether it be spiritual energy, reishi particles, or even the force of attacks directed towards me. Each attack absorbed contributes to the creation of a new card. However, to create each subsequent card, I must first either absorb energy which is equal to double the amount of attacks as compared to the previous card, Or i Charge my own Zanpakuto With my own power, Which allows me to cut the full charging time in half. For example, to create the first card the Ace, I must first absorb the amount of energy equal to that of two attacks. To create the second card, I must absorb energy which is equal to the amount of four attacks, and so on. This pattern continues, with each new card requiring double the amount of energy as compared to the previous card.
With the cards allowing me a multitude of abilities, such as the ability to use different card games to my advantage, the ability to Is seal away outside attacks, and even ""cut through"" other attacks. 
Now as more cards are created and exist on the battlefield, My own strength, speed, healing, and defense are enhanced. The presence of the cards acts as a catalyst, amplifying My physical attributes and granting them heightened capabilities, As I am able to draw on them like a battery. This boost is proportional to the number of cards in play.
Additionally, i gain control over the four elements - Water, Earth, Eind, and Fire, By using the power of my Zanpakuto (energy conversion) i can Convert the original energy into elemental energy. With them I can summon and manipulate these elemental forces to launch long-range attacks, create defensive barriers, or further augment My own abilities. The elemental control further adds further to my versatility in battle, allowing for strategic offensive and defensive maneuvers.
It also has one final passive ability which can be initiated at any time and it is called Gisei Dekki (Áä†Áâ≤ „Éá„ÉÉ„Ç≠, Sacrificial Deck) it is an ability that when activated absorbs all of the cards belonging to whichever suit chosen and element they are affiliated with, this then transforms the Zanpakuto from its normal State of spiritual energy conversion, into a state which embodies said element.


Supƒìdo („Çπ„Éö„Éº„Éâ, Spade): Now the spade cards have the unique ability to enhance and boost my speed, and control the air surrounding airwaves, as the Spades suit can summon tornadoes, control air currents, and execute lightning-fast strikes and motions with enhanced speed and precision. 
Now when the Ace card is thrown it can cause a lightning storm that spans over 3-miles with multiple funnels of air surrounding the area that shoot out blades of high pressurized air and allows Me to enhance their speed by using streams of air and static electricity in the air to constantly move faster. But also creates a large sphere of swirling wind around Me, enhancing my defense and shield me from the gerated force, and Anything within my field related to earth can be controlled granting dominion over one element of wind, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both wind and sky, temperatures and weather, lighting static electricity and electricity, atmospheric pressure and temperatures, both mist and fog, weightlessness mass and flight, pollution and poison, both tornadoes hurricanes and tropical storm's, sound soundwaves and music, spinning and motion. With the King card having the ability to generate a large and condensed and electrified tornado of over ten miles, moving and spinning over 300 mph, as everything is absorbed into it's domain ot is stripped of its reishi and rieatsu Literally erasing them as they are pulled in. 
Now when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the suit of the Spade. 
Doing so transforms the Spear into a near perfect Wind type Zanpakuto as the Spearhead of the pole weapon becomes weathered and rusted as if it has been exposed to the elements for hundreds of years. 
As the Spearhead of the spear becomes Jagged and crooked pieces of it flake off as it crackles with lightning which dances and Arc's all across its surface. 
It then becomes covered in a powerful but nearly invisible force of Wind with the very edge of the spearhead being covered in a very large and violent gailing wind which is seemingly thin and sharp able to cut through most if not any type of metal as if it was a knife through butter.
With this ability I can generate hundreds of Wind type attacks creating Blades of wind which can split buildings in two, tornadoes of wind which can completely demolish parts of the battlefield, Cyclones and Vortexes which seemingly pull in and Shred opponent's bodies apart, As well as giant balls of wind which trap and shred the opponent apart from the inside their blood mixing with the Wind and turning it red, and more.  


Shinz≈ç (ÂøÉËáì, Heart): Now the hearts cards If have the unique ability to heal My physical body, and are powerful as The Hearts card can create overly powerful water-based attacks and healing waves that wash over allies, cleansing and revitalizing them. strength and healing. 
When the Ace card is thrown, it emits a radiant watery dark aura aroumd me that not only enhances my healing power and capabilities but also shield me from the generated force and causes the water molecules in the air to shift around and take on form. Creating a whirlpool flood within a 1-mile radius that I can control, as using this water I can heal wounds on other people forcefully implant the water into an opponent's body allowing Me to control said water in the body to manipulate enemies like a puppet and can even use this water like a weapon, So I can either shoot off a simple, high pressurized bowl of water or even create entire low level tsunamis, as Anything within my field related to water can be controlled granting dominion over one element of water, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both ocean and sea, rain and clouds, snow ice and slush, aquatic wildlife, both cold and sub zero temperatures, arctic material and blizzards, blood and corpses, both hail snowstorms and frost, liquids and liquid state's, primordial water's. With the King card having the ability to Expand my field of control up to 13-miles allowing me to Generate a Large flood that churns and spins itself into a Whirlpool which Breaks apart everything in its domain, As it spins, All of the debris caught within turns it muddy and murky , but it continues to spin anyways as everything that collapses into It turns it poisonous and acidic to anything spiritual in nature the healing waters now turned deadly as it in dragged into the depths of the ""oceans floor"".
Now when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the suit of the Heart. 
Doing so transforms the Spear into an almost near perfect Water type Zanpakuto as the Spearhead of the pole weapon becomes unique and has a newly formed shape to it. 
As The spearhead then reforms as a rushing Gale of water which then solidifies the spearhead being made out of 100% pure ice water. 
As the inside of spearhead of the pole weapon is still liquid like as if the blade was water itself it begins flowing softly gently starting from the base and flowing directly up to the tip of the spearhead.
Moreover the edge of the spearhead begins to seemingly pour out and generate and endless amount of water which shoots outwards like a waterfall covering and coating the blade in pure glass like water which breaks off from the original and floats upwards as if lighter than air, as Through the water Other's are able to see as individual water droplets Cascade over the surface of the spearhead mixing with the gales of rushing water.
It is at this point that I become capable of manipulating water in any way to desire shaping it forming it altering it and generating it anyway that they pleases. 
With this ability I can generate hundreds of Water type attacks creating Blades and whips of water which can sever buildings in two, tsunamis and waves of water which can completely demolish parts of the battlefield, Bullets and pillars which seemingly Tear and rip opponent's bodies apart, As well as giant whirlpools of water which trap and shred the opponent apart from the outside inwards. 


Kurabu („ÇØ„É©„ÉñÈÉ®, Club): Now the club cards have the Unique ability to enhance my physical strength, and are incredibly powerful as The Clubs suit can unleash infernos, create walls of flames, and deliver explosive fire-based attacks, leaving trails of destruction in its wake and have the unique ability to constantly increase my physical and swing strength more with every swing. 
When the Ace card is thrown it allows me to generates a multitude of five large explosions, that form into hundred foot powerful pillars, of spinning fire which can burn anything until even it's ashes are burned away and which can summon hundreds of fireballs turn anything that it hits into ash, it also generates a powerful outward explosive burst that not only delivers a devastating blow to the opponent, but also creates a fiery aura around Me, enhancing my natural Strength in my body which shields me from the gerated force, and Anything within my field or reach related to fire can be controlled granting me dominion over one element of fire, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both heat and temperature, light and colors, explosions combustion and different nuclear possibilities, oils and napalm, both smoke and smog, volcanic based materials, bones soot and ash, both solar nuclear and different types of energy, candles and wax, and even divine flame. With the King card having the ability to create a total of sixty five, hundred foot tall powerful pillars, of spinning electrical flame within a 10-mile area that then extends outwards incinerating everything in it's path, before it collapses in on itself as all of the flames are absorbed into one pillar, which then explodes outwards and upwards, In the shape of a Blade, causing anything caught inside to be Incinerated as their body and even ash is burned away, from only the sheer heat of the explosion. 
Now when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the suit of the Club.
Doing so transforms the Spear into a near perfect Fire type Zanpakuto as the Spearhead of the pole weapon undergoes a change in nature the spearhead heating up in the very hand that wields it threatening to burn everything in it's path. 
Embers seemingly Flickering at the base of the spearhead with the edge of the spearhead becoming lit aflame as fire crackling with lightning Cascade over the surface of the spearhead twisting and churning. Whenever the spear is swung it leaves a trail of fire in it's path which can wilt anything left behind.
With this ability the I can generate hundreds of Fire type attacks creating Blades and Swords of fire which can completely reduce buildings to ash, as well as summon tornadoes and pillars of fire which can seemingly deconstruct and reduce parts of the battlefield to mere embers, even creating Balls and miniature suns which seemingly spread outwards and scorch the opponent's very bodies to nothingness, As well as create colossal beings of fire which both burn and destroy the opponent from the outside their body mixing with the Fire and being reduced back into atoms, and more. 


Daiyamondo („ÉÄ„Ç§„É§„É¢„É≥„Éâ, Diamond): Now the diamond cards Have the unique ability to enhance my physical defensive capabilities, and they are incredibly strong as The Diamonds suit can allow me to control the shape and architecture of the earth itself, creating massive golems, protective fortifications, and devastating seismic attacks and have the ability to enhance my defense and manipulate the very earth.
Now When the ace card is thrown, it allows me to control anything within a 1-mile radius it also generates a powerful shockwave that not only delivers a devastating blow to the opponent but also creates a protective barrier around Me, enhancing my defense and shield me from the gerated force, and Anything within my field related to earth can be controlled granting me dominion over one element of earth, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both rock and stone, crystal and gemstones, steel iron and different metals different oils, both nature and poison, volcanic material and obsidian, bones and corpses, both sand glass and mirrors, mud and clays, marble. With the King card having the ability to Expand my field of control up to 13-miles allowing me to shatter and create mountains, control fault lines and the very crust and tectonic plates, cause earthquakes and can then use the broken rock to form and create asteroids, and More. 
Now whenever the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the card suit of the Diamond insignia. 
Doing so transforms the spear into a near perfect Earth type Zanpakuto as the spearhead of the pole weapon becomes old and worn out the blade becoming heavily chipped and rough as if it was struck hundreds of times by a large and jagged rock it's own surface adorned in scratches.
It also appears heavily covered in dust and dirt with debris covering the edge of the sword as if it was lodged in stone for years on end the body is now wrapped in old and aged dirty bandages.
Now whenever the spear is swung a giant cloud of dust and sand is always sure to follow in it's wake trailing in behind it. 
Now with this unique ability I can generate hundreds of Earth type attacks creating Gigantic Weapons made of Earth which can completely crush buildings with relative ease, form titanic powerful display of earth which can completely destroy and reform parts of the battlefield, make Landslides and Earthquakes which seemingly pull in and break opponent's bodies Into Peices crushing them with it's weight, As well as creating giant shockwaves of Earth which trap and shred the opponent's body into peices from the outside, and more.  


J≈çkƒÅ („Ç∏„Éß„Éº„Ç´„Éº, Joker): Now the Joker cards are extremely special and are almost never actually used the reason being that these cards can only be especially summoned after I have created the entire deck and if i use any of the other cards even after the Joker cards have been summoned the ritual will become incomplete and the cards will dematerialize and fade out of reality, When these Two cards are summoned however the Pommel of the Spear transforms, emerging a pod that blooms open taking the form of a golden flower with its appearance taking the form of a mixture of three flower those being a guren, lotus, and spider lily. 
Now the Joker cards are incredibly powerful and unique as the Joker suits can shape Light and Darkness itself, creating massive constructs of of hardened light and darkness, the cards drawing power from both dark spaces like the color black, and the light of a person's soul, as well as draw power directly from the sun and moon as well as shadows, and can even completely warp the power of others by creating Illusions and bypassing the defenses of others by pulling the darkness directly out of their body and the light directly out of their soul a process which is extremely painful and nearly illegal for me to use against others, except for prisoners of the maggots nest and opponent's. 


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî(Techniques)‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


Erementaru R≈´retto: Unmei no Te („Ç®„É¨„É°„É≥„Çø„É´ „É´„Éº„É¨„ÉÉ„Éà: ÈÅãÂëΩ„ÅÆÊâã, Elemental Roulette: Destiny's Hand): Now this ability is one of the most powerful techniques that Jinan has as unlike normal techniques this one is played out into three different parts. Now additional information is that, Only in the Shikai state, can I perform the (Erementaru R≈´retto: Unmei no Te) technique. Now the first part of this technique is called KƒÅdo Gensh≈ç no Rensa (Card Decrease Cascade,) technique Or the first stage. 
By selecting and throwing multiple cards from the deck, each representing a different elemental suit, I can create a powerful elemental cascade of attacks. For example, throwing a Hearts card could generate a water-based projectile at full power, followed by a Diamonds card launching an earth-based attack, then a Spades card creating a gust of wind, and finally a Clubs card engulfing the target in flames. However The successive elemental assaults create a cascading effect, overwhelming the opponent with a rapid sequence of varied elemental forces but if I throws each card even one I would not be able to perform the second part of this technique.
Now the second part of this technique is called KƒÅdo Gensh≈ç Saikuron (Card Decrease Cyclone,) technique. 
Now in order to perform this part of the technique I must have all 52 cards and when this technique is utilized I gather an immense amount of spiritual energy, before infusing it into the deck of cards. Then With a powerful swing of the Zanpakuto, the deck is sent spinning into the air, creating a swirling vortex of cards. The opponent becomes trapped within this vortex, and the cards start to rapidly rotate, each card representing a different element.
I then calls upon my own ""destiny, allowing fate to determine the order and nature of the attacks"". As The cards unleash a relentless barrage of elemental assaults, each card randomly selecting an element to manifest. 
The onslaught can include devastating water-based torrents, earth-shattering tremors, lightning-fast winds, and engulfing infernos. The unpredictable nature of the technique makes it extremely difficult for the opponent to defend against or evade, as they are subjected to a relentless assault of ever-changing elemental forces this however allows them to perform the third and final part of this technique.
Now the third and final part of the technique is called KƒÅdo Gensh≈ç Hokai (Card Decrease Collapse,) technique.
Now In this devastating technique, the wielder utilizes the power of Jinan, to trap their opponent within a cyclone of elements and spiritual energy. 
Once trapped within the cyclone, the opponent becomes weakened by the intense forces exerted upon them.
As the opponent struggles to withstand the cyclone's onslaught, the Zanpakuto releases a surge of energy, causing the enchanted cards to stack themselves one atop the other  into a colossal deck just above the trapped opponent. 
This deck is encircled by four distinct spheres, each representing a different element: water, earth, wind, and fire.
With precise control over the elemental forces, the wielder commands the deck to plummet directly onto the opponent. The spheres surrounding the deck intensify, imbuing it with the combined power of the four elements. Now in a devastating display of elemental power the deck descends, and Upon impact, the colossal deck and the elemental spheres unleash an overwhelming wave of destruction. 
The destructive force generated by the elements rip open a tear in spacetime which then transforms into a cataclysmic void which obliterates everything in the pre-existing space within the cyclone, leaving no room for escape. The opponent is subjected to a cataclysmic assault, as the cards rain down upon them with immense force. The power generated by the elemental convergence eradicates the opponent's defense, obliterating them completely. Furthermore, the sheer force of the technique erases and resets the space within the cyclone, removing any trace of the opponent's presence until the technique dissipates. This ensures that the opponent is not only defeated but erased from existence within the confines of the cyclone.


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî(weaknesses)‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Shikai Weakness. Now the weaknesses for My Zanpakuto is very simplistic in nature as the I cannot utilize this Zanpakuto to rush and forcibly attack opponents, Without being left vulnerable, instead the nature of it can only allow it to absorb defend and use the cards it creates as a way to both counter attack and use for a form of Defense. It can also be utilized in such a way that it won't need to counter attack instead it could unleash the barrage all at once but this would be unwise as this can lead to Me being trapped in places some minutes on end and even being constantly and consistently exposed to the combined attack of one or more people. 
Now I could overcome this weakness by channeling my own spiritual pressure into it but the drain on me would be greater then simply absorbing outside forms of energy, As it would require, more energy expenditure on my part. 
However when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it completely transforms not only the Zanpakuto but also transforms it's weaknesses, As whenever it selects a suit of cards it will destroy everything else other than said suit beyond that each time I chooses a suit I can no longer have access to any of the other elements and I can only use the sword for 10 minutes at most. With the final downside being that whenever the shikai is once again inevitably sealed the wielder will not be able to use his own Zanpakuto for an entire day. 


Shikai Technique Weaknesses. The weaknesses for this technique are also very simple as well as in order to use it it requires a full deck of 52 cards and in the first part if any cards are thrown Directly at the opponent it is attempting to harm them instead of trapping them they will not be able to use the next two parts of this ability this could lead to the wielder unfortunately not being able to correctly use the technique as it would not have the same amount of power as since it requires all 52 the wielder would need to get the last card before they could then unleash the technique again and if all 52 cards are used in this technique they can then not activate the bankai as the Bankai requires all 52 cards as well.

Zanpakuto Sealed Appearance: Handmade Spring Steel Straight Blade Chinese War Dao Broadsword With Black Scabbard. 


Zanpakuto Name: Jinan (Ê¨°Áî∑)
Translation: Second born Son 

Release command:
Translation: All Things in Your Creation, All Memories in Your Mind, All Emotions in Your Heart, All Colors Within Your Soul, Flicker and Spark, Creating Embers in the Moonlight, as all things are Gambled Away


Zanpakuto spirit & Inner World: Now The inner world of Jinan is a vast and extravagant, but oddly confusing, taking the form of a opera theater house, mixed with a carnival performance tent, creating a awe inspiring attitude, with ornate architecture and a sense of grandeur. The theater is adorned with velvet curtains as well as maroon, gold and black tapestries lining the overhead booths, gilded pillars wrapped in painted designs, and intricate carvings along the walls depicting ancient religious stories, creating an atmosphere of mystique and enchantment. The seating area stretches out in all directions, seemingly infinite, with rows upon rows of empty seats that fade into the distance, With red carpets rolling out Into the infinite as well inbetween each row, Leading up to a ornate door that can never be reached or opened from within the inner world. Despite the vastness of the theater, the audience seats remain seemingly empty. However, upon closer inspection, one can detect faint silhouettes of figures occupying the seats. These shadowy entities represent the spirits of past dreams and aspirations that I had at one point in my life observing and lending their support to me. They remain silent, their presence a reminder of the hope and power contained within my Soul.
Now Throughout the theater, suspended in mid-air, are a multitude of playing cards. These cards hover and swirl around the magician, creating intricate patterns and displays of magic. The cards emanate a soft glow, each representing a different aspect or ability of Jinan. They shimmer with energy and occasionally transform into ethereal manifestations of the Jinan's powers.
At the center of the theater a stage stretches out, as the stage looks like it could perform 15 musicals all at once, and in behind the stage are musical instruments as well as props and set pieces that change dynamically to match the magician's tricks and illusions. Trap doors, mirrors, and hidden compartments are scattered throughout, allowing for seamless transitions and unexpected surprises. as far as the eye can see, as the curtains to the stage are always drawn back and shining and candle torches go throughout the theater along the walls lighting it up. 
The stage serves as the arena where Jinan's abilities are unleashed with dramatic flair. 
And standing at this very center of the stage, stands the magician performer himself,  Jinan, the physical Zanpakuto, Behind him are two beings dancing and singing, one is a woman of fire, the other is a man made of oil. Now although his attire has changed numerous times, Jinan is mainly seen Dressed in an elegant, Black and Gold tailored suit with a top hat cape and fully covered gold and ivory Face mask, the magician, Jinan, exudes an aura of a charismatic devil wrapped up in showmanship. And while Some other attire consists of leopard print jackets, some of them being from halfway across the world, from different regions, with some of his costumes being completely goofy And in some cases look almost completely unusable because of how thick they are, With them also appearing completely over the top some of them even featuring things like peacock feathers, snake skin, and even rhinoceros horns. In additional to his attire, he possess a mischievous smile and twinkling star filled eyes that hint at their mastery of illusion and sleight of hand. The magician Jinan's movements are graceful and precise, their every gesture accompanied by a flourish of glowing cards.


Shikai Appearance: Although I am by no means bound to a release command to enter the Shikai state, as My unity with my Zanpakuto will have long-since and indefinitely surpassed such a point, Just like most other captain class Shinigami, I would mostly Say so as a way of showing respect to My Zanpakuto, giving it what I believes is the proper respect. 
To initiate the release form of My Zanpakuto, I nonchalantly grab My Zanpakuto with My right hand before holding it out in front of me the point of the tip facing fowards, then releasing the hilt of the sword I then leave it suspended in the air, as I begins, turning and levitating the weapon vertically to the right using delicately controlled vibrating strings of Rieatsu, which leaves it hovering right in front of Me. Then with a loud and authoritative voice, I speak aloud and in a deep and authoritative tone, the release command as if it were a personal mantra or a saying from a lifelong religious understanding. 

‚ÄúAll Things in Your Creation, All Memories in Your Mind, All Emotions in Your Heart, All Colors Within Your Soul, Flicker and Spark, Creating Embers in the Moonlight, as all things are Gambled Away, Jinan.‚Äù

Now upon the usage of the release command, my I grab my blade upside down and begin spinning it in my hand causing It to transform and turn into a golden beam of light, that shines as bright as the sun, before it begins transforming itself into large metal spear, over six feet tall, and Is similar in appearance to the legendary norse spear Gungnir, the metal of the spear is engraved with multiple different kanji/katakana such as Gamble („ÇÆ„É£„É≥„Éñ„É´, Gyanburu) Fortune (Ë≤°Áî£, Zaisan) Luck (ÈÅã, Un) Wish (È°ò„ÅÑ, Negai) Value (‰æ°ÂÄ§, Kachi) Increase (Â¢óÂä†, Z≈çka) Probability (Á¢∫Áéá, Kakuritsu) Jackpot („Ç∏„É£„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Éù„ÉÉ„Éà, Jakkup≈çtto) and with two smaller extensions on either side just underneath the spearheads similar in design to eagle wings, Now the spearhead is wickedly pointed and narrow and is nearly twenty inches long, it boasts a razor-sharp cutting edge along either side of the spearheads edge, and it is dull and indented on either side, capable of either blocking or slamming into an opponent, like a hammer, to cause massive bludgeoning damage. Now¬†the deadliest part of the spearhead, however, is the tip, which rests at the end of the elongated pole. Although its strange and narrow blade makes it seem unwieldy to use the long-spear in a stabbing motion, with its sharpened point off-center thanks to its arrowhead-like design, its use is so purely ingrained within Me that i can find my target nearly one hundred percent of the time, calculating the difference between My line-of-thrust and the curve of My Zanpakut≈ç. The reason why the puncturing tip is so deadly is simply due to it's weight along with both it's sharpness and roughness; with a point less than a few particles in diameter, and the sides of the blade being so rough, it can pierce through and shatter almost any material with ease upon impact, barreling and plowing through defenses and other Zanpakut≈ç like a hot knife through butter.



Shikai abilities & Explanations. Now In the Shikai state, the Zanpakuto, known as ""Jinan - Second born Son,"" has one Ability known only as Kakekin no Z≈çka (Ë≥≠„ÅëÈáë„ÅÆÂ¢óÂä†, Increased Bet): and while powerful it lacks directly ""defensive capabilities"" but it possesses the unique ability to absorb and convert energy wether reishi and rieatsu from the surrounding environment into indestructible playing cards which constantly float above and around my head. The first card that is created is the Number Ace card, representing duality and balance, As i can absorb energy from every sources, whether it be spiritual energy, reishi particles, or even the force of attacks directed towards me. Each attack absorbed contributes to the creation of a new card. However, to create each subsequent card, I must first either absorb energy which is equal to double the amount of attacks as compared to the previous card, Or i Charge my own Zanpakuto With my own power, Which allows me to cut the full charging time in half. For example, to create the first card the Ace, I must first absorb the amount of energy equal to that of two attacks. To create the second card, I must absorb energy which is equal to the amount of four attacks, and so on. This pattern continues, with each new card requiring double the amount of energy as compared to the previous card.
With the cards allowing me a multitude of abilities, such as the ability to use different card games to my advantage, the ability to Is seal away outside attacks, and even ""cut through"" other attacks. 
Now as more cards are created and exist on the battlefield, My own strength, speed, healing, and defense are enhanced. The presence of the cards acts as a catalyst, amplifying My physical attributes and granting them heightened capabilities, As I am able to draw on them like a battery. This boost is proportional to the number of cards in play.
Additionally, i gain control over the four elements - Water, Earth, Eind, and Fire, By using the power of my Zanpakuto (energy conversion) i can Convert the original energy into elemental energy. With them I can summon and manipulate these elemental forces to launch long-range attacks, create defensive barriers, or further augment My own abilities. The elemental control further adds further to my versatility in battle, allowing for strategic offensive and defensive maneuvers.
It also has one final passive ability which can be initiated at any time and it is called Gisei Dekki (Áä†Áâ≤ „Éá„ÉÉ„Ç≠, Sacrificial Deck) it is an ability that when activated absorbs all of the cards belonging to whichever suit chosen and element they are affiliated with, this then transforms the Zanpakuto from its normal State of spiritual energy conversion, into a state which embodies said element.


Supƒìdo („Çπ„Éö„Éº„Éâ, Spade): Now the spade cards have the unique ability to enhance and boost my speed, and control the air surrounding airwaves, as the Spades suit can summon tornadoes, control air currents, and execute lightning-fast strikes and motions with enhanced speed and precision. 
Now when the Ace card is thrown it can cause a lightning storm that spans over 3-miles with multiple funnels of air surrounding the area that shoot out blades of high pressurized air and allows Me to enhance their speed by using streams of air and static electricity in the air to constantly move faster. But also creates a large sphere of swirling wind around Me, enhancing my defense and shield me from the gerated force, and Anything within my field related to earth can be controlled granting dominion over one element of wind, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both wind and sky, temperatures and weather, lighting static electricity and electricity, atmospheric pressure and temperatures, both mist and fog, weightlessness mass and flight, pollution and poison, both tornadoes hurricanes and tropical storm's, sound soundwaves and music, spinning and motion. With the King card having the ability to generate a large and condensed and electrified tornado of over ten miles, moving and spinning over 300 mph, as everything is absorbed into it's domain ot is stripped of its reishi and rieatsu Literally erasing them as they are pulled in. 
Now when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the suit of the Spade. 
Doing so transforms the Spear into a near perfect Wind type Zanpakuto as the Spearhead of the pole weapon becomes weathered and rusted as if it has been exposed to the elements for hundreds of years. 
As the Spearhead of the spear becomes Jagged and crooked pieces of it flake off as it crackles with lightning which dances and Arc's all across its surface. 
It then becomes covered in a powerful but nearly invisible force of Wind with the very edge of the spearhead being covered in a very large and violent gailing wind which is seemingly thin and sharp able to cut through most if not any type of metal as if it was a knife through butter.
With this ability I can generate hundreds of Wind type attacks creating Blades of wind which can split buildings in two, tornadoes of wind which can completely demolish parts of the battlefield, Cyclones and Vortexes which seemingly pull in and Shred opponent's bodies apart, As well as giant balls of wind which trap and shred the opponent apart from the inside their blood mixing with the Wind and turning it red, and more.  


Shinz≈ç (ÂøÉËáì, Heart): Now the hearts cards If have the unique ability to heal My physical body, and are powerful as The Hearts card can create overly powerful water-based attacks and healing waves that wash over allies, cleansing and revitalizing them. strength and healing. 
When the Ace card is thrown, it emits a radiant watery dark aura aroumd me that not only enhances my healing power and capabilities but also shield me from the generated force and causes the water molecules in the air to shift around and take on form. Creating a whirlpool flood within a 1-mile radius that I can control, as using this water I can heal wounds on other people forcefully implant the water into an opponent's body allowing Me to control said water in the body to manipulate enemies like a puppet and can even use this water like a weapon, So I can either shoot off a simple, high pressurized bowl of water or even create entire low level tsunamis, as Anything within my field related to water can be controlled granting dominion over one element of water, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both ocean and sea, rain and clouds, snow ice and slush, aquatic wildlife, both cold and sub zero temperatures, arctic material and blizzards, blood and corpses, both hail snowstorms and frost, liquids and liquid state's, primordial water's. With the King card having the ability to Expand my field of control up to 13-miles allowing me to Generate a Large flood that churns and spins itself into a Whirlpool which Breaks apart everything in its domain, As it spins, All of the debris caught within turns it muddy and murky , but it continues to spin anyways as everything that collapses into It turns it poisonous and acidic to anything spiritual in nature the healing waters now turned deadly as it in dragged into the depths of the ""oceans floor"".
Now when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the suit of the Heart. 
Doing so transforms the Spear into an almost near perfect Water type Zanpakuto as the Spearhead of the pole weapon becomes unique and has a newly formed shape to it. 
As The spearhead then reforms as a rushing Gale of water which then solidifies the spearhead being made out of 100% pure ice water. 
As the inside of spearhead of the pole weapon is still liquid like as if the blade was water itself it begins flowing softly gently starting from the base and flowing directly up to the tip of the spearhead.
Moreover the edge of the spearhead begins to seemingly pour out and generate and endless amount of water which shoots outwards like a waterfall covering and coating the blade in pure glass like water which breaks off from the original and floats upwards as if lighter than air, as Through the water Other's are able to see as individual water droplets Cascade over the surface of the spearhead mixing with the gales of rushing water.
It is at this point that I become capable of manipulating water in any way to desire shaping it forming it altering it and generating it anyway that they pleases. 
With this ability I can generate hundreds of Water type attacks creating Blades and whips of water which can sever buildings in two, tsunamis and waves of water which can completely demolish parts of the battlefield, Bullets and pillars which seemingly Tear and rip opponent's bodies apart, As well as giant whirlpools of water which trap and shred the opponent apart from the outside inwards. 


Kurabu („ÇØ„É©„ÉñÈÉ®, Club): Now the club cards have the Unique ability to enhance my physical strength, and are incredibly powerful as The Clubs suit can unleash infernos, create walls of flames, and deliver explosive fire-based attacks, leaving trails of destruction in its wake and have the unique ability to constantly increase my physical and swing strength more with every swing. 
When the Ace card is thrown it allows me to generates a multitude of five large explosions, that form into hundred foot powerful pillars, of spinning fire which can burn anything until even it's ashes are burned away and which can summon hundreds of fireballs turn anything that it hits into ash, it also generates a powerful outward explosive burst that not only delivers a devastating blow to the opponent, but also creates a fiery aura around Me, enhancing my natural Strength in my body which shields me from the gerated force, and Anything within my field or reach related to fire can be controlled granting me dominion over one element of fire, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both heat and temperature, light and colors, explosions combustion and different nuclear possibilities, oils and napalm, both smoke and smog, volcanic based materials, bones soot and ash, both solar nuclear and different types of energy, candles and wax, and even divine flame. With the King card having the ability to create a total of sixty five, hundred foot tall powerful pillars, of spinning electrical flame within a 10-mile area that then extends outwards incinerating everything in it's path, before it collapses in on itself as all of the flames are absorbed into one pillar, which then explodes outwards and upwards, In the shape of a Blade, causing anything caught inside to be Incinerated as their body and even ash is burned away, from only the sheer heat of the explosion. 
Now when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the suit of the Club.
Doing so transforms the Spear into a near perfect Fire type Zanpakuto as the Spearhead of the pole weapon undergoes a change in nature the spearhead heating up in the very hand that wields it threatening to burn everything in it's path. 
Embers seemingly Flickering at the base of the spearhead with the edge of the spearhead becoming lit aflame as fire crackling with lightning Cascade over the surface of the spearhead twisting and churning. Whenever the spear is swung it leaves a trail of fire in it's path which can wilt anything left behind.
With this ability the I can generate hundreds of Fire type attacks creating Blades and Swords of fire which can completely reduce buildings to ash, as well as summon tornadoes and pillars of fire which can seemingly deconstruct and reduce parts of the battlefield to mere embers, even creating Balls and miniature suns which seemingly spread outwards and scorch the opponent's very bodies to nothingness, As well as create colossal beings of fire which both burn and destroy the opponent from the outside their body mixing with the Fire and being reduced back into atoms, and more. 


Daiyamondo („ÉÄ„Ç§„É§„É¢„É≥„Éâ, Diamond): Now the diamond cards Have the unique ability to enhance my physical defensive capabilities, and they are incredibly strong as The Diamonds suit can allow me to control the shape and architecture of the earth itself, creating massive golems, protective fortifications, and devastating seismic attacks and have the ability to enhance my defense and manipulate the very earth.
Now When the ace card is thrown, it allows me to control anything within a 1-mile radius it also generates a powerful shockwave that not only delivers a devastating blow to the opponent but also creates a protective barrier around Me, enhancing my defense and shield me from the gerated force, and Anything within my field related to earth can be controlled granting me dominion over one element of earth, but giving me 100% full control over said element, the elements include both rock and stone, crystal and gemstones, steel iron and different metals different oils, both nature and poison, volcanic material and obsidian, bones and corpses, both sand glass and mirrors, mud and clays, marble. With the King card having the ability to Expand my field of control up to 13-miles allowing me to shatter and create mountains, control fault lines and the very crust and tectonic plates, cause earthquakes and can then use the broken rock to form and create asteroids, and More. 
Now whenever the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it will absorb all of the cards which bear the card suit of the Diamond insignia. 
Doing so transforms the spear into a near perfect Earth type Zanpakuto as the spearhead of the pole weapon becomes old and worn out the blade becoming heavily chipped and rough as if it was struck hundreds of times by a large and jagged rock it's own surface adorned in scratches.
It also appears heavily covered in dust and dirt with debris covering the edge of the sword as if it was lodged in stone for years on end the body is now wrapped in old and aged dirty bandages.
Now whenever the spear is swung a giant cloud of dust and sand is always sure to follow in it's wake trailing in behind it. 
Now with this unique ability I can generate hundreds of Earth type attacks creating Gigantic Weapons made of Earth which can completely crush buildings with relative ease, form titanic powerful display of earth which can completely destroy and reform parts of the battlefield, make Landslides and Earthquakes which seemingly pull in and break opponent's bodies Into Peices crushing them with it's weight, As well as creating giant shockwaves of Earth which trap and shred the opponent's body into peices from the outside, and more.  


J≈çkƒÅ („Ç∏„Éß„Éº„Ç´„Éº, Joker): Now the Joker cards are extremely special and are almost never actually used the reason being that these cards can only be especially summoned after I have created the entire deck and if i use any of the other cards even after the Joker cards have been summoned the ritual will become incomplete and the cards will dematerialize and fade out of reality, When these Two cards are summoned however the Pommel of the Spear transforms, emerging a pod that blooms open taking the form of a golden flower with its appearance taking the form of a mixture of three flower those being a guren, lotus, and spider lily. 
Now the Joker cards are incredibly powerful and unique as the Joker suits can shape Light and Darkness itself, creating massive constructs of of hardened light and darkness, the cards drawing power from both dark spaces like the color black, and the light of a person's soul, as well as draw power directly from the sun and moon as well as shadows, and can even completely warp the power of others by creating Illusions and bypassing the defenses of others by pulling the darkness directly out of their body and the light directly out of their soul a process which is extremely painful and nearly illegal for me to use against others, except for prisoners of the maggots nest and opponent's. 


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî(Techniques)‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


Erementaru R≈´retto: Unmei no Te („Ç®„É¨„É°„É≥„Çø„É´ „É´„Éº„É¨„ÉÉ„Éà: ÈÅãÂëΩ„ÅÆÊâã, Elemental Roulette: Destiny's Hand): Now this ability is one of the most powerful techniques that Jinan has as unlike normal techniques this one is played out into three different parts. Now additional information is that, Only in the Shikai state, can I perform the (Erementaru R≈´retto: Unmei no Te) technique. Now the first part of this technique is called KƒÅdo Gensh≈ç no Rensa (Card Decrease Cascade,) technique Or the first stage. 
By selecting and throwing multiple cards from the deck, each representing a different elemental suit, I can create a powerful elemental cascade of attacks. For example, throwing a Hearts card could generate a water-based projectile at full power, followed by a Diamonds card launching an earth-based attack, then a Spades card creating a gust of wind, and finally a Clubs card engulfing the target in flames. However The successive elemental assaults create a cascading effect, overwhelming the opponent with a rapid sequence of varied elemental forces but if I throws each card even one I would not be able to perform the second part of this technique.
Now the second part of this technique is called KƒÅdo Gensh≈ç Saikuron (Card Decrease Cyclone,) technique. 
Now in order to perform this part of the technique I must have all 52 cards and when this technique is utilized I gather an immense amount of spiritual energy, before infusing it into the deck of cards. Then With a powerful swing of the Zanpakuto, the deck is sent spinning into the air, creating a swirling vortex of cards. The opponent becomes trapped within this vortex, and the cards start to rapidly rotate, each card representing a different element.
I then calls upon my own ""destiny, allowing fate to determine the order and nature of the attacks"". As The cards unleash a relentless barrage of elemental assaults, each card randomly selecting an element to manifest. 
The onslaught can include devastating water-based torrents, earth-shattering tremors, lightning-fast winds, and engulfing infernos. The unpredictable nature of the technique makes it extremely difficult for the opponent to defend against or evade, as they are subjected to a relentless assault of ever-changing elemental forces this however allows them to perform the third and final part of this technique.
Now the third and final part of the technique is called KƒÅdo Gensh≈ç Hokai (Card Decrease Collapse,) technique.
Now In this devastating technique, the wielder utilizes the power of Jinan, to trap their opponent within a cyclone of elements and spiritual energy. 
Once trapped within the cyclone, the opponent becomes weakened by the intense forces exerted upon them.
As the opponent struggles to withstand the cyclone's onslaught, the Zanpakuto releases a surge of energy, causing the enchanted cards to stack themselves one atop the other  into a colossal deck just above the trapped opponent. 
This deck is encircled by four distinct spheres, each representing a different element: water, earth, wind, and fire.
With precise control over the elemental forces, the wielder commands the deck to plummet directly onto the opponent. The spheres surrounding the deck intensify, imbuing it with the combined power of the four elements. Now in a devastating display of elemental power the deck descends, and Upon impact, the colossal deck and the elemental spheres unleash an overwhelming wave of destruction. 
The destructive force generated by the elements rip open a tear in spacetime which then transforms into a cataclysmic void which obliterates everything in the pre-existing space within the cyclone, leaving no room for escape. The opponent is subjected to a cataclysmic assault, as the cards rain down upon them with immense force. The power generated by the elemental convergence eradicates the opponent's defense, obliterating them completely. Furthermore, the sheer force of the technique erases and resets the space within the cyclone, removing any trace of the opponent's presence until the technique dissipates. This ensures that the opponent is not only defeated but erased from existence within the confines of the cyclone.


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî(weaknesses)‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Shikai Weakness. Now the weaknesses for My Zanpakuto is very simplistic in nature as the I cannot utilize this Zanpakuto to rush and forcibly attack opponents, Without being left vulnerable, instead the nature of it can only allow it to absorb defend and use the cards it creates as a way to both counter attack and use for a form of Defense. It can also be utilized in such a way that it won't need to counter attack instead it could unleash the barrage all at once but this would be unwise as this can lead to Me being trapped in places some minutes on end and even being constantly and consistently exposed to the combined attack of one or more people. 
Now I could overcome this weakness by channeling my own spiritual pressure into it but the drain on me would be greater then simply absorbing outside forms of energy, As it would require, more energy expenditure on my part. 
However when the Gisei no dekki (Sacrificial Deck) ability is activated it completely transforms not only the Zanpakuto but also transforms it's weaknesses, As whenever it selects a suit of cards it will destroy everything else other than said suit beyond that each time I chooses a suit I can no longer have access to any of the other elements and I can only use the sword for 10 minutes at most. With the final downside being that whenever the shikai is once again inevitably sealed the wielder will not be able to use his own Zanpakuto for an entire day. 


Shikai Technique Weaknesses. The weaknesses for this technique are also very simple as well as in order to use it it requires a full deck of 52 cards and in the first part if any cards are thrown Directly at the opponent it is attempting to harm them instead of trapping them they will not be able to use the next two parts of this ability this could lead to the wielder unfortunately not being able to correctly use the technique as it would not have the same amount of power as since it requires all 52 the wielder would need to get the last card before they could then unleash the technique again and if all 52 cards are used in this technique they can then not activate the bankai as the Bankai requires all 52 cards as well.

Avant de d√©buter, oui j'ai un pass√© o√π j'ai √©t√© ULTRA irresponsable financi√®rement, je suis au courant, pas besoin de rentrer le couteau dans la plaie.

Voici mes informations importantes :

- J'ai mon Barreau. BAC en droit et √âcole du Barreau compl√©t√©s. 
- J'ai compl√©t√© mon stage du Barreau dans le domaine de la lutte contre les crimes financiers, mes 2 ans de pratique je les ai pass√©s dans ce domaine.
- Il faut comprendre que la criminalit√© financi√®re est un domaine EXTR√äMEMENT nich√©.
- Pendant mes √©tudes j'ai pris une marge de cr√©dit √©tudiante pour mes d√©penses essentielles. Mais, ce qui deva arriver est arriv√©. J'ai full√© ma marge de 90K AU COMPLET √† l'√¢ge de 20 ans, erreur monumentale qui me pourrit la vie depuis.
- J'√©tais presque incapable de payer ne serait-ce que les int√©r√™ts de la marge √† tous les mois, je n'ai jamais pay√© de capital. J'ai alors d√©cid√© de faire une proposition de consommateur en ao√ªt 2023 qui me co√ªte autour de 750$/mois, consid√©rant que la faillite n'est pas vraiment envisageable pour une avocate.
- J'ai √©t√© r*ped en juillet, j'ai du prendre un 3 mois d'arr√™t de travail pour m'en remettre.
- Le jour m√™me du retour de mon travail, (legit je suis sorti de psychiatrie la veille), ma boss m'annonce qu'on met fin √† mon contrat de travail pour manque de travail (en gros, ils ont engag√© pendant mon arr√™t), nice.
- Je suis sur le ch√¥mage depuis ce moment (octobre), mais les opportunit√©s d'emploi dans mon domaine (que je rappelle √©tant hyper nich√©) sont au compte goutte.
- Live, j'ai 17$ dans mon compte. Le paiement de chomage devrait √™tre d√©pos√© autour du 3 - bref, √ßa va pas bin.

Voici mes d√©penses fixes :
- 100$/semaine pour automobile en location;
- 750$ ish/mois paiement de la proposition de consommateur;
-350$/mois loyer;
-250$/mois cell, assurance auto, assurance pour mon chien
-300$ √©picerie/m√©dicaments/gaz/autres

J'ai un paiement d'assurance-emploi de 1 166$ aux deux semaines.

Je me demande quelles sont les prochaines √©tapes :

1. Je trouve un emploi qui n'est pas dans mon domaine (par ex. je veux retourner travailler comme caissi√®re chez Desjardins, j'avais un 23$ de l'heure) et en occupant cet emploi, je continue √† faire des recherches d'emploi dans le domaine juridique.

2. Je fais faillite. Stress financier moindre, mais √ßa me cr√©er des obstacles au niveau de mon inscription au Tableau de l'Ordre.

3. Autre?

I'm 30 weeks pregnant, ftm. We're moving in March, baby due early April. Currently we can't prepare the nursery, because we don't have one (living with my in-laws while waiting to move to our own place) - so we didn't buy any items yet, thinking that it's best to wait for the move and then buy everything when we'll actually have a place to put it.

Anyway, suddenly today I felt the strongest and weirdest urge to make a list of everything we need and started looking frantically online for different items, writing what brand and model of everything I want in an excel sheet. 
Found myself sitting on my computer into the night, making the list and feeling like I need to prepare everything and be ready for the baby.

Is this what nesting feels like? Does it happen around this time? I just feel so weird, it's definitely a new feeling."

Demande de conseils pour n√©gocier une rupture conventionnelle initi√©e par l‚Äôentreprise,VosSous,1i9vpqr,2025-01-25 15:07:20,6,1.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/VosSous/comments/1i9vpqr/demande_de_conseils_pour_n√©gocier_une_rupture/,Mental_Rough4029,,"Bonjour √† tous,

Je viens chercher vos lumi√®res pour une n√©gociation de rupture conventionnelle que mon entreprise a initi√©e.

Je voulais poster sur r/conseiljuridique mais on m‚Äôa pr√©conis√© de le faire sur r/vosfinances qui m'a redirig√© ici.

 Voici ma situation :

√Çge : 28 ans

Poste : Cadre manager dans l‚Äôinformatique

Salaire annuel : \~55K brut (environ 3300 ‚Ç¨ supernet mensuel)

Localisation : R√©gion parisienne

Anciennet√© : En poste depuis juillet 2022 (2 ans et demi)

L‚Äôentreprise traverse une restructuration et n‚Äôa plus besoin de mes services, sp√©cifiquement pour lesquelles ils m‚Äôavaient recrut√©. Ils m‚Äôont donc propos√© de nous s√©parer √† l‚Äôamiable. Ayant vu le coup venir, je m‚Äô√©tais d√©j√† renseign√© en amont et leur ai propos√© une indemnit√© correspondant √† 6 mois de salaire, en plus de mon solde de tout compte et des 6 semaines de pr√©avis (car j‚Äôanticipe le d√©lai li√© aux d√©marches).

Voici mes arguments principaux :

Pression morale constante depuis plusieurs mois :

Mes deux managers ont fait un burn-out.

Deux coll√®gues ont √©t√© licenci√©s l‚Äôann√©e derni√®re.

Un coll√®gue plus senior (sans lien hi√©rarchique direct) m‚Äôa fait des remarques sur ma tenue vestimentaire lors d‚Äôune soir√©e d‚Äôentreprise. J‚Äôavais remont√© l‚Äôincident aux RH, mais cela a √©t√© class√© sans suite.

Le contexte de la rupture :

Mon N+2 m‚Äôa convoqu√© sous pr√©texte d‚Äôun autre sujet, mais c‚Äô√©tait un guet-apens avec la DRH pour me proposer cette rupture.

Quand ils m‚Äôont fait leur proposition, j‚Äôai directement annonc√© mes attentes (les 6 mois de salaire, correspondant √† plus ou moins 27K), ce qui les a laiss√©s sans voix. Ils m‚Äôont dit qu‚Äôils allaient refaire leurs calculs et revenir vers moi d‚Äôici une semaine.

Plusieurs points √† pr√©ciser : 

\- Je suis tr√®s au courant que les indemnit√©s d√©caleront l'ARE. 

\- Si il le faut, j'irai au tribunal, j'ai de la chance d'avoir bien pu √©pargner donc l'argent n'est (pour l'instant) pas un probl√®me

\- Je suis propri√©taire de ma RP dont le cr√©dit tire jusqu‚Äô√† 2047, fianc√© et potentiellement en attente d'un enfant

Mes questions :

Ma demande d‚Äôindemnit√©s est-elle coh√©rente ? Si non, quel serait un montant plus r√©aliste ? Ces 6 mois ne sortent pas de nulle part, ils correspondent √† peu pr√®s √† l'argent qu'ils devraient d√©bourser pour me licencier dans les m√™mes conditions.

Quels conseils me donneriez-vous pour g√©rer la prochaine r√©union avec eux ? Dois-je formaliser ma demande par √©crit ?

Y a-t-il des erreurs classiques √† √©viter dans ce genre de n√©gociation ?

Merci d‚Äôavance pour vos retours, je veux m‚Äôassurer de bien g√©rer cette √©tape d√©licate. Toute exp√©rience ou insight sera pr√©cieux !"

I've searched everywhere and could not really find a direct answer, so I'm asking here. Apologies if wine and paracetamol are getting the best of me.

I'm considering buying some extra 3D items to enhance the experience and wanted to ask what you would recommend. I don't know the game, this would be a gift to a colleague who's a fan, and I've yet to play it. I'm sure I'll love it but I have watched a minimum of videos without spoiling things, as I'd love my friend to talk me into the game and explain things rather than do it over a series of videos.

I've gifted him Aftermath some months ago and he really loved it, in my short research it seemed to be the best expansion available in terms of what it added. He's got the base game and Aftermath. Nothing else that I know of.

My question is: what first to last priority in terms of getting these in 3D:
- doors
- eggs
- dead astronauts/intruder parts
- equipment/cargo boxes 
- character trays (6x)
- nest tray
- intruder bases that hold the red cubes 
- anything I'm forgetting 

I thinj obviously the answer can be ""get all of them"", but what is really useful, in your opinion?

I'd like my gift to count even if I know it will always be appreciated anyway. I also believe he will eventually get lockdown and the stretch goals, not sure about the car is and voids (I'm using my own slang here ;))

Thanks!"
[QCrit] Crossover Cozy Fantasy THE BOOKERY (75k words; v1/v6) + NEW First 300 Words,PubTips,1i9vo1n,2025-01-25 15:05:13,1,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/1i9vo1n/qcrit_crossover_cozy_fantasy_the_bookery_75k/,indiefatiguable,,"Hello friends! It's been about four months since I last posted a query for this project, and during that time I did a major revision of both the query and the manuscript itself. So while this is technically version #6 I've posted here, it bears little resemblance to previous attempts.

A few specific questions are related to querying this as crossover:

1. Have I adequately highlighted why I feel this will appeal to both adult and YA audiences? (And do you agree or am I misguided?)
2. Does querying as crossover mean I can query agents open to Adult **or** YA, or only those open to Adult **and** YA? Any other unspoken rules to querying a crossover?

Any and all advice is always appreciated! Thank you in advance!

# QUERY

Dear \[AGENT\],

*Pride and Prejudice* meets Studio Ghibli, THE BOOKERY is a \[75,000\]-word cozy romantic fantasy about a witch fighting for independence, the baker living in her family‚Äôs bookshop, and the phoenix who lights up their lives. This standalone novel combines the grumpy/sunshine romance of Camille Peters‚Äôs *Voyage*; the witchy whimsy of Kate Johnson‚Äôs *Hex Appeal*; and the humorous, feminist flair of T. Kingfisher‚Äôs *A Wizard‚Äôs Guide to Defensive Baking*. Its timely yet timeless themes of autonomy, belonging, and self versus society will resonate with both adult and YA readers.

Aristocratic witch Ishana Patel is running out of time to find a suitable husband before her family picks one for her. When she unexpectedly inherits her estranged grandfather‚Äôs arcane bookshop, The Bookery, Ishana sees an opportunity: sell the property, fund her independence, and prove to her family that a modern witch needs no man.¬†

But Ishana‚Äôs plans threaten The Bookery‚Äôs long-standing tenant, magicless pastry chef Nicky Noone. After a tumultuous childhood in foster care, Nicky built the home he never had inside The Bookery, running his bakery out of the shop and living in an on-site apartment. The possibility of losing everything leaves Nicky scrambling to save his business‚Äîa goal further complicated by his hopeless crush on prim-and-proper Ishana.

At every turn, Nicky‚Äôs gentle kindness challenges Ishana‚Äôs notions of masculinity. Accustomed to high-society backstabbing, she suspects sweet-as-sugar Nicky of sabotage when his oven spits sparks and belches smoke, scaring off potential buyers. Her only offer comes from Marko Zimmler, a wealthy and well-connected real estate mogul whose interest in Ishana extends far beyond The Bookery. While she negotiates the shop‚Äôs sale, Marko secretly contacts her overbearing mother to negotiate an engagement.¬†

Ishana is trapped by Marko‚Äôs manipulations and her family‚Äôs expectations‚Äîuntil the phoenix hiding in Nicky‚Äôs misbehaving oven reveals herself. She declares The Bookery her nest and its residents her flock, lending her immortal might and wisdom to Ishana‚Äôs fight for freedom. With her new ally, Ishana must face her smoldering infatuation with Nicky and take control of her future before she‚Äôs shackled to Marko till death do them part.

I live outside \[MAJOR US CITY\] where I work as a software engineer, write for \[BLOG\] on Medium, and watch too much Food Network. THE BOOKERY was inspired by my love of baking and my personal experiences as a feminist born and raised in the American Bible Belt.¬†

Thank you for your time and consideration!

\[AUTHOR\] (she/her)

# FIRST 300

Her three-hundred-and-ninth life began in the cold‚Äîand that was *wrong*.¬†

Baby phoenixes were meant to be born from flame, cradled in a brimstone bassinet, nursed by Mother Earth‚Äôs molten lifeblood. But this time, she came to life in a cage.¬†

The iron bars stung when she tentatively touched one with a wingtip. Her scalding skin stuck to it like a wet tongue on frozen metal. She tore free with a squeal of pain and reeled back, only to find more frigid bars behind her. Trapped, she tucked her tiny wings to her sides, sat on her freezing feet, and shivered.

Mere minutes old, she didn‚Äôt know where she was, how she got there, or who had locked her up. Memories of her past lives would return slowly, blurry at first but sharpening into focus little by little, day by day. After a few weeks of smoldering, she‚Äôd have her feet under her, her voice within her, her wits about her. All she needed was sufficient fire to sustain her until then.¬†

The Phoenix peered past the bars of her cage, where craggy shadows loomed. She stoked the fire flaring across her wings, willing it to blaze brighter and illuminate her surroundings, but her magic flickered and spat like a campfire in the rain. It wasn‚Äôt just that she was young and weak; something blocked her, some viscous, oozing energy that smothered and suffocated her own.

The sludgy energy stirred and thickened, clogging the air. The Phoenix watched the spot where it felt thickest until it congealed into a swirling portal. From out of its crackling center stepped a tall, thin man, and The Phoenix regained her first memory: The Curator."
Enchantment Tier List - Jan 25 2025,PlayTheBazaar,1i9vkc1,2025-01-25 15:00:50,0,0.14,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayTheBazaar/comments/1i9vkc1/enchantment_tier_list_jan_25_2025/,nymusix,Discussion,"As of today, Jan 25, here is my enchantment tier list for The Bazaar with general explanations of each ranking. Of course, there is some variability, as different enchantments can be particularly strong with certain builds or item combos.

**S Tier**

* *Shiny:* One of the rarest enchants in the game is also arguably its most powerful. Having an item trigger twice can be enough of a mechanic on its own to turn a strong build into an insane one or turn a weak build into a strong one. Getting shiny on a heavy-hitting weapon, or an item that has some fast charge looping ability, can simply mean game over for your foes. The only downside to shiny? It's one of the hardest enchantments in the game to get. Unlike other enchantments, it's not available as a level-up reward or as an enchant from Fate's Crossroads (first death enchantment event). You can acquire an item already enchanted with this from Pearl's Dig Site or Serafina (enchanted item vendor), you can get this from the random enchantment interaction, or enchant a weapon with the Form event (rare weapon event). A fun cheese for this one is that there are a handful of items where shiny is the only enchant, perhaps most notably Robotics Factory, so dropping those items into the random enchantment event can guarantee a shiny Robotics Factory (+2 multicast on your friends! Insane!)
* *Icy:* Arguably as good or better than shiny, icy is almost as rare to come by, and potentially as powerful. The ability to get continuous freeze for an entire fight is broken against most boards, particularly if you are able to put this enchant on a fast item and even moreso if you are able to get Snowflake. Most freeze skills are now pretty heavily limited, making this enchant one of the only ways to lock your opponent's items in perpetuity. Particularly with the last patch removing Rapid Thaw, the only counter to this effect is the Radiant enchant. 


**A Tier**

* *Heavy & Turbo:* Grouping these two enchantments together makes a lot of sense as they do pretty similar things, and being able to impact the speed of a fight can have dramatic impact, particularly for more drawn out battles. Between the two of these, I have heavy as generally being just a hair better, for a couple of reasons; namely, there are two curio items that improve the heavy enchant as opposed to just one for turbo, and also because there are a fair number of skills that can provide internal haste without needing to spend an enchantment on it. But there are absolutely situations where turbo might be better for your board, and I'm basically never upset to see one of these enchants show up. 

**B Tier**

* *Radiant:* Radiant can be an incredibly strong effect on the right board, but it's often situationally not very valuable. For single weapon builds, or builds where one item running without being slowed is incredibly important to the board composition, radiant can mean the difference between life and death. Radiant is also incredibly powerful because radiant items can still be targeted by your enemy's slow, destroy, and freeze effects, meaning they effectively preserve your other items from those targets. However, radiant can be less useful on a wider board of smaller items, because there are so many targets for enemy slow/destroy/freeze. It's also worth mentioning here that radiant does not protect your items from having their cooldowns increased by effects like that of Fort, Chronobarrier, or Atomic Clock. 

* *Deadly:* Like radiant, the deadly enchant can be an incredibly powerful effect on the right board but sometimes just getting +50% crit on one item isn't all that powerful, particularly if you already have a lot of crit, or ways to scale crit separately (like Building Crescendo). Look to pair the deadly enchant with specific items that have unique effects - Crow's Nest, Miss Isles, Caltrops, and Crook all have particularly strong deadly enchants, and I'm sure there are others as well. 
* *Shielded:* The shielded enchant goes somewhat hand-in-hand with the C-Tier enchants, Restorative and Obsidian. Where shielded has a slight edge lies in three main details: firstly, that you can stack shield on top of your base health, secondly, in the fact that shield has a stronger protective effect against enemy burn, and finally, because there are builds utilizing items like Force Field or Crusher Claw builds where you can turn your shield into a weapon. 

**C Tier**

* *Restorative & Obsidian:* Obsidian is slightly more situational as it can only be used on weapons, which makes it useless in non-weapon builds; however, having a weapon with life steal can be situationally powerful with certain skills like the Death Knight Reaper's Hypnotic Drain. Neither of these enchants are particularly strong, but in some cases, having one of these enchants can be a life-saver. 

**D Tier**

* *Fiery & Toxic:* Whereas most of the higher tier enchants are basically never useless, Fiery and Toxic are two enchants that can tend to be useless in a lot of builds. If you're already running burn or poison builds, getting these enchants can dramatically increase your outputted damage, but often in those situations you're more looking to increase your item loop speed or control the board; and if you're not running burn or poison, these enchants often do very little to effectively improve your build, particularly as it can be very tough to scale these enchants to a point where they're useful. These enchants can still be situationally useful for non-burn/poison Pygs - putting any enchantment on a property item will dramatically increase the value of that item, and with a Fiery Lemonade Stand, Pyg can have a 100 burn infinite looping matchbox - pretty busted - but generally speaking these two will be the worst enchants you'll usually see.

**F Tier**

* *Golden:* We started with one of the rarest enchants in the game, and now we're ending with another. The Golden enchant is an enchant that is most relevant to economy-based items. As a result, there are absolutely situations where Pyg can utilize these items to improve board-based effects or where they can give your build much-needed econ. However, usually by the time these enchanted items start being available to you, you should have a pretty strong economy going already, and a lot of the effects of this enchant are so situational as to be practically useless. Basically the only ways to get this enchant are to either buy an item with this enchant already on it, or get the enchantment from the ""Random Enchantment"" event, so thankfully you don't have to worry about running into this enchant on the Fate's Crossroads event. 


Hope to hear what you all think and maybe you'll find this helpful in some way!"

Qual a potencia que os cabos EPS de 4 e 8 Pinos fornecem?,hardwarebrasil,1i9vhm5,2025-01-25 14:57:32,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwarebrasil/comments/1i9vhm5/qual_a_potencia_que_os_cabos_eps_de_4_e_8_pinos/,Relevant-Break2067,D√∫vida,"Pessoal estou com uma d√∫vida, que n√£o estou conseguindo chegar numa conclus√£o.

Z axis only running at 50%,ender3,1i9vgpq,2025-01-25 14:56:24,1,0.67,4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9vgpq,FatDaddy777,Help,"So a friend gave me their printer to take a look at. Original ender 3. They said it would start bird nesting randomly. 
When they gave it to me I ran through the normal maintenance. New nozzle. Cleaned up hot end (threads, polish, etc). Upon running first prints, the extruder was pushing too hard. Looked to have been doing it for a while. Motor still barley worked. Replaced, and tuned flow rate. 
Upon actually being able to print the z axis is only moving 50%. 
When I manually move the axis up 10mm on the screen, the head only moves 5mm. 
I have re loaded to firmware twice. Swapped Motor with another machine. (Only does it on this one). 
Traced all z wiring back to board. (No breaks or kinks) looked over the board for bad solder. (Didn't see anything obvious)
Unplugged and replugged all connections. 
Put everything back together and still does the same thing. 
I tried printing a calibration cube (20mm x 20mm x 20mm) and the cube prints fine on x & y but squishes the z to 50% scale while trying to run 100% scale filament through. This causes over extruding symptoms. 
If I tune the flow rate to 50% it prints fine. If I increase only the z scale by 50% and don't decrease flow rate, it prints fine. 
Anyone have any ideas or encountered this before? 
The owner claims this  wasn't a problem before but looking at some of their latest prints shows over extruding and what I think are scale issues. (They messed with scale on almost all their prints) 

SD card is fat32 formatted. 
Tried booting firmware with both .bin & .hex files. Only the .bin seems to register. 

Any thoughts and ideas are welcome.

I created the following deck that I really enjoy. 

I seem to do pretty well against some players on Live up until a certain point and then I just get destroyed.

When I started playing Live, I started with a Normal deck and kept tweaking it. I just randomly starting playing Normal so I'm not really attached to this deck.

I was hoping to get some advice on how to make this deck more competitive or tell me I should give it up and more on to something else.

Autistic woman seeking help understanding / processing a situation.,abusiverelationships,1i9v6sq,2025-01-25 14:43:55,1,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1i9v6sq/autistic_woman_seeking_help_understanding/,-sadanon-,Support request,"This is a throwaway / anon account for me. I'm posting here bc I feel like this community would be well rounded and able to look at things in an unbiased way (hopefully). While this does seem like an abuse-type tactic I don't know that my wife is intentionally being ""bad"". I am also to blame, I know I'm not good at communication.

I (30f) am autistic & I make a lot of scrunch faces and often close my eyes while I'm processing information. Specially when there's a lot of other noises going on. I also have an extremely stunted understanding of emotions/feelings. My wife often gets her feelings hurt by this and has recently begun just stopping mid-sentence and walking away from me. (Which triggers some sort of extreme rejection sensitivity in myself or something? I'm not sure). I have tried to explain to her multiple times that I'm not mad at her, I'm not upset with her, I'm listening and thinking and processing. She says ""I see your frustration and it hurts my heart""(that feels so needlessly dramatic to me but probably bc I don't have a very strong emotional range for anything). Idk how to fix that bc there's no frustration until she starts to walk away and I've told her that. Like NOW there's frustration bc you're stopping mid conversation, asserting I'm feeling a way that I'm not, and shutting down the conversation?

Today she was telling me about a friend of hers who she often compares me to and telling me something he did to alleviate his social anxiety/ stress. As I'm listening I'm thinking about a few things:

a)I'm tired of hearing about him tbh.

b)What she's describing isn't how I feel about/during/after social interactions.

c)how can I tell her I appreciate her concern but I don't feel that way without upsetting her.

And I guess in my processing & thinking I furrowed my brow/pursed my lips so she said ""ok I see your frustration, I'm going."" and tossed her hands up in the air, started to tear up, and started to walk away. I told her I wasn't frustrated about the conversation but now I'm frustrated bc she's doing the thing. She said it hurts her heart too much to see me look so frustrated. I'm like ??? tf I was literally processing. I told her if she keeps walking away from me mid conversation like this I know myself and I'm gonna eventually stop having conversations with her at all bc I will be too anxious that I'll upset her and I know my anxiety will tell me things like 'she doesn't care about what we have to contribute. She doesn't care about my thoughts and feelings.' and that's going to ruin any communication we have. We start arguing bc now she's saying I'm calling her crazy bc I'm saying she's misinterpreting my facial expressions and storms off. I shut the bedroom door and make myself a little pillow nest in the corner of the bed to try to destress and not cry. ( Our bed is in the corner against the wall bc it's comforting for me to be able to lean fully against the wall surrounded by pillows and blankets). Not 5 minutes goes by and she comes back to the bedroom. I hear her and before she opens the door I let her know ""I don't want to talk to you right now. I want to be alone please."" She comes in anyway. I say again ""I don't want to talk to you, I want to be alone."" She approaches me. ""I want to be alone. I want to be alone."" I'm curled up in the corner repeating myself. She starts talking over me about how she's going to sit and allow me to speak without interrupting me and sits on the edge of the bed. I shut down, turn away from her and pull a blanket over me. She set an alarm for 5 minutes and sat close to me in silence waiting. I'm getting sweaty, my heart is racing, I'm trying so hard not to cry. The alarm goes off, she gets up, says I love you and leaves.

?????

I don't know how to feel about this. I don't know how to process this. I'm feeling confused and violated and definitely far from loved. What am I supposed to do in this situation? How am I supposed to react or respond?"

* Jurassic¬†[World Rebirth](https://worldmagzine.com/altcoins/altcoin-market-poised-for-imminent-reversals-analyst-predicts/)¬†features Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Bailey in pivotal roles.
* The film, set five years after Dominion, introduces a dangerous, dinosaur-infested environment.
* New prehistoric creatures like the Spinosaurus and Mosasaurus will add intensity to the story.

Jurassic World Rebirth marks a major shift for the franchise, bringing a new cast led by Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Bailey. Set five years after the events of Dominion, the planet‚Äôs¬†[ecosystem](https://worldmagzine.com/business/nano-labs-rebrands-subsidiary-nano-bit-accelerates-bitcoin-ecosystem-entry/)¬†is no longer suitable for dinosaurs, forcing them into isolated tropical environments.

The film promises an exciting blend of action and mystery, with new dinosaurs such as the reimagined Spinosaurus and Mosasaurus. Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) and written by Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp, Rebirth pushes the boundaries of PG-13, bringing more brutal violence than¬†[previous films](https://worldmagzine.com/entertainment/avatar-3-fire-and-ash-viral-trailer-sparks-fan-frenzy-but-isnt-official/).

# Jurassic World Rebirth: New Image of Johansson and Bailey in a Dinosaur Nest

[Universal Pictures](https://worldmagzine.com/entertainment/best-picture-winner-oppenheimer-finally-premiered-in-japan/)¬†recently revealed a promo still from Jurassic World Rebirth, offering a glimpse at the high-stakes environment Johansson and Bailey‚Äôs characters will face. The image shows the duo in a dinosaur nest, hinting at the thrilling dangers lurking in the story. This is a pivotal film, as it marks the first Jurassic World installment without Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, shifting the focus to a new ensemble cast.

Set five years after Jurassic World: Dominion, Rebirth explores a planet that is increasingly inhospitable to dinosaurs. The remaining creatures are confined to isolated environments resembling their original habitats, which is where the film‚Äôs protagonists find themselves entangled in a high-risk mission. The new ecosystem introduces a fresh batch of terrifying dinosaurs, including a revamped Spinosaurus.

Johansson‚Äôs character, Zora Bennett, is a covert operations expert on a mission to secure genetic material from the dinosaurs. Meanwhile, Bailey‚Äôs Dr. Henry Loomis will bring his expertise as a paleontologist to help navigate the threats of the new¬†[world](https://worldmagzine.com/automobiles/hydrogen-powered-rescue-truck-breaks-world-record-with-zero-emissions/). The stakes are high as the two characters, along with their team, venture into a tropical biosphere where the dinosaurs rule.

With Jurassic World Rebirth, the franchise is pushing the boundaries of the action genre. The inclusion of new dinosaur species and a darker tone promises a thrilling adventure. Fans are anticipating a more intense experience, with the film‚Äôs PG-13 rating expected to deliver brutal violence and a fresh narrative direction.

Jurassic World Rebirth is shaping up to be a thrilling new¬†[chapter](https://worldmagzine.com/entertainment/jung-ho-yeon-joins-bh-entertainment-a-new-chapter-for-the-squid-game-star/)¬†in the franchise, offering a darker and more action-packed story with an exciting new cast."

Neste momento estou a poupar para comprar uma casa nos pr√≥ximos 3 anos e gostava de colocar o dinheiro que poupo para a casa a render, mas com capital garantido. At√© ent√£o andava a colocar em Dep√≥sitos a Prazo a 3 meses, no meu banco (BPI), mas recentemente, muito devido a este sub, tenho tentado cada vez mais aprofundar a minha literacia financeira, o que me levou a procurar melhores alternativas.  

Chamou-me √† aten√ß√£o a **Conta Mais Ordenado** do **Bankinter** que d√° 5% at√© 10.000 no 1¬∫ ano para novos clientes.

Ap√≥s investigar aqui pelo Reddit, encontrei um post com v√°rias cr√≠ticas tais como:

* Funcion√°rios rudes e incompetentes. Uns dizem uma coisa, outros outra;
* Cobram anuidade do Cart√£o de D√©bito, quando o isento de comiss√£o √© o de Cr√©dito;
* O Cart√£o nunca chega e √© necess√°rio ligar para cancelar o envio e fazer o pedido de um novo cart√£o, o que tem um custo. 

No entanto, o post j√° tem 2 anos. Se por acaso algu√©m tiver aderido a este produto mais recentemente podia partilhar a sua experi√™ncia? Passaram pelo mesmo tipo de situa√ß√£o ou correu tudo bem? Tiveram outros problemas? Era importante para mim saber se o banco conseguiu melhorar esses pontos negativos ou se continua na mesma, ou pior. 

Outra d√∫vida que tenho √© se √© mesmo obrigat√≥rio domiciliar l√° o ordenado, ou se posso s√≥ transferir 800‚Ç¨ para a conta. No site falam dessa possibilidade, mas depois indicam que ""A primeira domicilia√ß√£o ter√° de se verificar no m√°ximo at√© 4 meses ap√≥s a data de ades√£o"", o que me deixou confuso. 

Outras alternativas que tenho √© abrir conta no BiG, adquirir Certificados de Aforro, ou simplesmente colocar na Trade Republic. Se quiserem partilhar feedback tamb√©m agrade√ßo.

It might well be a firewall issue on the desktop, but seeing as it does not respond when trying locally I am wondering if it is working as it should.. I have also tried the container ip address..

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. :)

My employer's pension provider of choice is NEST.

After passing my probation period last year, I voluntarily enrolled in it back in April 2024 when I was 19, due to not being old enough to be auto-enrolled into it, I am now 20.

I contribute - 5% - ¬£74.00 monthly

My employer contributes - 3% - ¬£44.40 monthly

Total monthly contributions: ¬£118.40

The fund I'm in is the Retirement Date Fund and I have not changed this since I started my pension. I am really into personal finance myself and I want to make sure that my pension is in a good place now so that I can set myself up for the future. I am wondering if the fund I'm currently in is good for me and my age.

Also, I was looking at the other funds they offer: Ethical Fund, Sharia Fund, Higher Risk Fund, Lower Growth Fund, and the Guided Retirement Fund. I understand towards the end of last year the Sharia Fund changed from 100% equities, to now include 30% bonds. So, this doesn't look like an attractive fund option to me. Should I just remain in my current Retirement Date Fund?

I really want to start contributing more, so I will be contacting Payroll on Monday next week to request the range of contribution rates they offer.

Any advice on my NEST pension would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Hi all I intend to help increase visibility for transmascs,trans,1i9ue03,2025-01-25 14:09:21,3,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/1i9ue03/hi_all_i_intend_to_help_increase_visibility_for/,puffpuffwhat,,"Hello everyone 
I am ftm, 10 years on testosterone. 
Testosterone treatment allows me to live my life without constant fear and without having to live a life of isolation. 

The average person born of female experience is not safe to walk safely down a street at night. As long as this is the case, we will have societal issues. Many trans people who are assault survivors simply want to live out their lives without having to live constantly on defense mode.

If access to hrt were to be banned outright then transmasculine individuals would begin to menstruate again. 

I have my insurance and phone bill paid for 6 months in advance, and nest egg. My wanted changes from hrt are permanent. I have already achieved what I put in the work for. 

I am willing to put on hold my hormone treatment in order to once again be able to menstruate. And then I am willing to bring the consequences to DC. I have nowhere else in particular I need to be. 


I have personal experience in fields such as CNC routing, TIG welding, lathe work, 3d printing, engine maintenance and repair, micro-electronics and soldering, gunsmithing, off grid energy production and storage, and administration of intramuscular injections in an active field environment. A very steady skilled hand. 

I intend to create a series of paintings to express the concerns of those who are not interested in having their private business and lives further regulated and micromanaged. 


I'm welcoming the beginning of a discussion. If you are interested in being involved in any way, whether it's spreading the event through social media, or collaboration, I am here to begin the work. "

Smart Thermostat compatibility question,hvacadvice,1i9u5d9,2025-01-25 13:59:22,1,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/hvacadvice/comments/1i9u5d9/smart_thermostat_compatibility_question/,rhymes_with_ow,,"We just moved into a new three story townhouse house. It has an electric heat pump with backup electric emergency heat set up in dual zone mode so that the climate in an attached in-law suite on the first floor can be controlled separately from the climate in the main unit on floors 2 and 3. There are some old Honeywell thermostats in both units.

I originally wanted to replace the Honeywells with Nests or Ecobees  in both units however after trying and failing to install Nests myself, I turned to some HVAC professionals, who came out and said we couldn't have Nests because instead of  running wiring from the air handler on the first floor to the outdoor unit on the roof, the installers had set up some wireless system (see pic attached). I shrugged and left the old Honeywells in place.

Well fast forward a few months and it got cold like it does in winter in our part of the country and our heating bill for December was an unpleasant surprise. Now back to wanting a programmable smart thermostat to keep a better eye on our energy usage from my smartphone and to set up routines through a smart app.

This is the wireless controller: [https://imgur.com/a/R6JyIlg](https://imgur.com/a/R6JyIlg)

Question: Is this wireless controller compatible with Honeywell smart themostats? Can I swap out the dumb Honeywells for a smart Honeywell T9 or something similar? Is this wireless controller compatible with anything better?"

Then I saw the theorem that there's no smallest infinite series because you just keep taking the ln to make it smaller. So firstly, does that apply to the harmonic series. I can't see how bc ln(1) + ln(1/2)+... goes to negative infinity. I went on wolfram alpha and got the series 1/(xln(x)) based off the derivative of ln(ln(x)) which seems to make sense. Is that correct?

Secondly and I think more interesting. I think it's fair to assume that an infinite amount of nested ln(x) functions like ln(ln(ln(...))) would be the ""smallest"". If you call it Fn(x) with n being the amount of ln functions, then the zero is e^(n-1). So then woukdnt the zero of Fn(x) as n-> infinity become e^(infinity), meaning it never goes positive, meaning it doesn't go to infinity. This shit is messy. Somebody please help. Also if you take the series the way I described like 10 seconds ago you get 1/(a shit ton of undefined ln(0)) so how does that work"

"On vient d'apprendre que le breton a perdu 50% de ses locuteurs en 6 ans. En continuant sur la m√™me voie, on estime que le nombre de bretonnants va continuer √† chuter pour se stabiliser autour de 30-40 000 (ou moins) en 2050. Ma question : qui restera-t-il pour faire la culture bretonne ?",Bretagne,1i9tfrb,2025-01-25 13:28:24,25,0.97,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bretagne/comments/1i9tfrb/on_vient_dapprendre_que_le_breton_a_perdu_50_de/,paniniconqueso,,"Le post qui suit s'applique √©galement au gallo, qui a perdu un tiers de ses locuteurs, mais qui semble r√©sister un peu mieux que le breton :  le dernier gall√®sant √† survivre au dernier bretonnant √©teindra la lumi√®re.

Il est d√©j√† difficile pour les artistes bretons qui chantent en breton de gagner suffisamment d'argent pour continuer √† chanter en breton, et il s'agit l√† d'un art pour lequel il n'est pas n√©cessaire de comprendre le breton pour appr√©cier la musique.

Il est d√©j√† tr√®s difficile pour les dessinateurs de bandes dessin√©es, les √©crivains, les magazines, les maisons d'√©dition, les librairies, de vendre et de justifier leurs bandes dessin√©es, leurs livres, leurs magazines en breton.

Il est d√©j√† difficile pour les acteurs bretons de th√©√¢tre, de t√©l√©vision et de cin√©ma en langue bretonne, de gagner suffisamment d'argent pour vivre d√©cemment.

Je ne pense pas que les gens soient au courant de ce que signifiera le fait que le breton devienne encore plus rare qu'il ne l'est d√©j√†. Aujourd'hui, il y a encore suffisamment de bretonnants pour que les bretns francophones b√©n√©ficient de ce que les bretonnants produisent et cr√©ent, pour qu'ils puissent pr√©tendre participer √† une culture bretonne plus large, la montrer au monde entier quand les gens leur demandent ce qu'est la culture bretonne.  Mais que croyez-vous qu'il se passera quand il y aura trente ou quarante mille locuteurs bretons ? Qui restera-t-il pour 1) cr√©er la culture bretonne en breton ? 2) consommer la culture bretonne en breton ?

√Ä un moment donn√©, il sera de plus en plus difficile pour le prochain Stivell de voir le jour, la prochaine Kristen Nogu√®s, le prochain Yann-Fa√±ch Kemener, le prochain Denez Prigent, la prochaine Annie Ebrel. Et ces personnes-l√† sont soit des locuteurs natifs, soit ont grandi √† une √©poque o√π elles √©taient baign√©es dans la langue et la culture (Stivell, par exemple, n'est pas un locuteur natif, il l'a appris). Quand ils seront tous morts et que 99% des Bretons ne parleront plus que le fran√ßais, qui les remplacera ? Qui sera en mesure de les remplacer ?"

I've been poly for over 10 years and am currently separated amicably, and yes we keep in touch. I also have a long distance partnership, and would prefer local starting as a casual connection. However, I've lightened up to the idea of some more distance connections, so I'll be testing the waters there. I'm open to the idea of it becoming more than that as well, but I'm currently not looking for a nesting partner as I'm enjoying living alone.

**About Me**

I'm 6ft tall, Average build, black hair, brown eyes, and my left arm is tattooed. I'm also planning another one likely on the right arm to complete the set. I'm definitely a nerd and an introvert, so I do tend to favor a night in, but I can be swayed to head out every so often. My major hobby is PC Gaming and the enthusiast interests that come with that like new part releases and tech trends in general. Outside of that, I keep track of hockey and like getting out to restaurants and bars every so often. Other than that, I have a full-time job and my own apartment where I work from home 2-3 days a week.

I also lean towards being a Dom and have some toys IYKYK.

**What I'm looking for**

Currently, something consistent. Whether that's a FWB (I have a post of what that means to me btw) or something that develops further. I'd rather not have something fleeting, but I am also open to safe and consenting play. Please also be 28+. I'm also body, sex, and kink positive. I'm also open to cis & trans women alike.

If any of that seems interesting, sneak into my DMs. I'll be prepared to share a face picture as well."

Carpenter Ant Colony,ants,1i9sxx4,2025-01-25 13:06:35,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ants/comments/1i9sxx4/carpenter_ant_colony/,TextPrestigious9081,Chat/General,"We have just recently purchased a house in the Huntsville, Ontario area.

Late Decemeber we had a warm day combined with heavy rainfall. I noticed a large carpenter ant on one of our walls in the basement and figured it was due to the quick thaw. The next day I noticed a little pile of wood shavings ontop of our chest freezer in our utility room and looked up to find a cluster of carpenter ants working away at a ceiling board. 

I consulted the internet which brought me to the conclusion of a carpenter ant colony nearby, or likely due to it being winter, inside of the house. When I returned to the spot the carpenter ants reacted to the light being turned on and fled inside of their hole.

I went to the hardware store and purchased an ant poison gel that is injected to specific locations. I filled the whole area in the ceiling. 

In the meantime I reached out to some pest control places to see who could help, prices, etc. 

Over the coming weeks I noticed more and more dead carpenter ants in various locations. Most were dying right infront of the freezer, but others wandered and died throughout the basement. 

They chewed through enough of the gel so they could continue accessing through that spot. I have reapplied a number of times. 

Over the past couple days I have been noticing Dead swarmer(winged) carpenter ants. From my limited research I understand those are a sign of a colony hoping to spread. 

I have read that ants will place their dead bodies in certain places to eliminate them. What I find strange is that the ants seem to be wandering and slowly dying on their own. I'll see ants limping and slowing down until they die. 

The pest control company that has responded books weeks in advance so I will need to be patient.

My question is, are these ants dying because the queen is dead and the poison is working? Or would things look different in that case?

And in the case of the swarmer ants being dead, does that mean they are not being successful in finding a new place to nest?

Thank you for reading this far!"

Pagamento da Mensalidade do Lar,literaciafinanceira,1i9swai,2025-01-25 13:04:40,0,0.5,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/literaciafinanceira/comments/1i9swai/pagamento_da_mensalidade_do_lar/,Esperanca29,D√∫vida,"Boas! Preciso da vossa opini√£o!
Somos 3 irm√£os, 67anos, 66anos e 51anos(eu). Nossa m√£e faleceu em 2002 e fui eu que cuidei dela sempre  
O problema √© o nosso pai, foi um pai e marido narcisista, sempre maltratou a minha m√£e e filhos, mas a minha m√£e foi espancada constantemente, e n√£o consigo esquecer detalhes de pura malvadez do meu pai para com ela.
A minha m√£e sempre teve comigo e o meu pai foi ficando, pois todos os bens que o meu pai tinha perdeu para o Banco, inclusive o irm√£o mais velho de 67 anos pagou uma d√≠vida ao banco do meu pai. 
Eu nunca tive uma rela√ß√£o muito saud√°vel com o meu pai, que se degradou em 2021 quando tive um cancro. 
O irm√£o de 66anos acabou por for√ßar a ida do meu pai para o lar e acordou comigo o pagamento de metade da mensalidade, uma vez que o mais velho 67 anos n√£o se mostrou dispon√≠vel em pagar, uma vez que j√° tinha pago a d√≠vida. 
Sucede que agora o irm√£o de 66anos deixou de pagar a mensalidade, inclusive diz que quem deve pagar o lar do nosso pai, √© a minha filha que por ser a mais nova foi a √∫ltima que convivia mais com o av√¥ e que ele a beneficiou muito. 
A verdade √© que antes da minha filha nascer, apenas existiam as minhas sobrinhas desse meu irm√£o de 66anos. 
Ambos os meus irm√£os t√™m casa pr√≥pria, eu vivo numa alugada e sem condi√ß√µes, e com amea√ßa de despejo. Sou m√£e sozinha desde os 2 anos da minha filha, sempre tive de ter 2 trabalhos.
As sequelas do cancro e quimioterapia s√£o imensas, este ano fiz uma reconstru√ß√£o maxilo facial.
Os meus irm√£os e respectivos filhos t√™m todos casa pr√≥pria, eu sou a √∫nica sem casa pr√≥pria e que o cancro bateu a porta e a √∫nica que aceitou viver com o nosso pai durante cerca de 20 anos. Paguei o lar sozinha enquanto pude, neste momento estou sem rendimentos (apenas o psi) e em risco de ser despejada. 
Estou a pensar mandar uma carta ao lar a rescindir o contrato pois n√£o consigo pagar, e deixar de ser a respons√°vel do contrato/pai, pois mentalmente e fisicamente sinto-me esgotada. 
Tenho uma ansiedade enorme, depress√£o √° 23 anos (em que h√° dias que o que me segura √© a minha √∫nica filha e o facto de ficar sozinha sem apoio), tenho 3 h√©rnia de disco, sou paciente de m√©dico da dor, pois s√£o constantes as dores musculares e articulares. 
Desculpem o ""testamento"" mas n√£o estou aguentar a press√£o...Sinto que sou respons√°vel por tudo e que s√≥ eu √© que sou filha.
Sou a filha ca√ßula, mas desde os 13 anos que sou independente...
Acham muito mau mandar a carta ao lar a rescindir o contrato e informar que n√£o sou filha √∫nica, e que n√£o tenho condi√ß√µes de pagar a mensalidade? √â que n√£o tenho mesmo... D√™em a vossa sugest√£o, n√£o quero ficar com sentimento de culpa.
Obrigada

Si √ßa tenait qu'√† aimer des contenus publier sur les r√©seaux sociaux ou de valider des produits simplement sur une plateforme pour gagner de l'argent √ßa aurait √©t√© tr√®s simple.

Leur ruse c'est lors de la pr√©sentation de l'activit√© ils se garde de ne pas vous en parler de cette √©tape dont s'ag√Æt ce qui suit: 

dans le groupe o√π ils postent les liens que tous les recrut√©s doivent clicker pour effectuer la t√¢che √† accomplir, √† un moment donn√© la mission suivante ne consiste plus √† se rendre sur un r√©seau social pour aimer des contenus mais de faire une transaction d'argent d'un montant de niveau A, B, C, D etc... √† toi de choisir et de l'envoyer instantan√©ment sur un IBAN fournit, ou deuxi√®me option de se rendre sur la plateforme de clicker sur recharger et se voir rediriger vers des moyens de paiement tu choisis ton choix et r√©alise ton paiement sauf que pour te pousser √† faire √ßa ils ont dit aux recrut√©s que si tu mise sur un choix de montant A, B, C, D etc..tu recevras un remboursement de ce que t'as miser + 30% 50%, 70%,  100% selon ce que  tu as miser, ce qu'ils respectent au d√©but mais tout cela fait partie de leur plan ce qu'ils visent c'est leur objectif.

et apr√®s avoir r√©alis√© ta transaction ton compte sur la plateforme est cr√©dit√©, une fois le compte cr√©dit√© au montant que t'as recharger, ils t'indique des √©tapes suivantes √† r√©aliser dans le compte qui finit par un compte √† rebours, une fois le compte √† rebours termin√© le montant que t'as recharger dispara√Æt et ton compte revient √† z√©ro.
puis tu re√ßois par la suite une nouvelle mission de miser un montant au choix et √† chaque fois le montant devient de plus en plus elev√© on te le rembourse avec un pourcentage encore et apr√®s quelques missions d'aimer des contenus la mission de transf√©rer revient encore cette fois ci plus √©lev√© encore jusqu'√† ce qu'ils r√©ussissent √† te faire faire une transaction d'un haut montant peut-√™tre m√™me avoir miser tout ce que tu avais sur ton compte bancaire en esp√©rant un remboursement, l√† ils changent compl√®tement avec toi et commencent √† te raconter du n'importe quoi: comme quoi tu a mis trop de temps avant de faire le transfert m√™me si tu l'as fais tout de suite, si tu insiste en demandant le code de remboursement qu'il doit te fournir pour que tu le transmet √† une troisi√®me encore dont j'ai oubli√© d'√©num√©rer plust√¥t dont la r√©ceptionniste te donne √©galement son lien vers son compte c'est lui qui g√®re toute l'activit√© des paiements elle te r√©pond il n'y a plus de Code pour l'option que t'as choisis et ils restent sur √ßa avec d'autres baratins qu'ils ont jamais mentionner juste pour te souler.

Apr√®s avoir miser ton argent ils te disent : 1_ que t'as mis trop de temps √† faire le transfert 2_ qu'il n'y a plus de code et 3_ si tu veux recevoir un code il faut que tu effectues celle du niveau sup√©rieur c'est √† dire transf√©rer un montant sup√©rieur que ce que t'as d√©j√† transf√©r√© et dont ils refusent de te rembourser ce qui signifie que si tu le fais tu leur aura juste offert un second cadeau ils vont tout bonnement encaisser ton argent et t'abandonner comme un inconnu. C'√©tait √ßa leur objectif te conduire jusqu'√† te soutirer le plus d'argent possible.
C'√©tait √ßa la supercherie ! Et c'est la m√™me technique appliqu√©e par tous ces groupe de malfaiteurs, arnaqueur qui passent leur publicit√© pareilles sur Tiktok, pour soutirer les gens leur argent. 

Partager au maximum ce Reddit pour qu'il y ait le maximum de gens qui tombe dessus afin que tout le monde en soit inform√©, car ces personnes sont dou√©s dans leur m√©tier et calcul bien toute la relation avec leur victime pour mieux la manipuler 
Au d√©but tout parra√Æt sinc√®re au point o√π tu te dis bon je vais essayer qui sait... C'est pourquoi toute personne peut tomber dans le pi√®ge s'il n'est pas au courant, Et une fois plonger dans le jeu ils te font croire que t'as pas tord de l'avoir fait jusqu'√† ce qu'ils te p√™che au moment souhait√©. T'auras aucun issu, aucune solution tu te sentiras perdus et confus d'avoir envoyer cette grosse somme que t'as perdu et √ßa fera na√Ætre dans ta situation une peur. C'est pour cela que je tenais √† avertir tous ceux qui penseront √† s'aventurer dans l'annonce de ces pubs et en m√™me temps peut-√™tre quelqun qui est d√©j√† dans le jeu tombera sur ce Reddit et saura ce qui l'attend et cela pourrai le sauver, alors partager au maximum svp !!!

Avant d'en arriver l√† ils se montraient gentils, aimable, encourageant et tout jusqu'√† ce qu'ils arrivent √† t'avoir tu entendras d√©s-lors toute sorte d'irespect comme: ne me d√©range pas...etc...encore une fois d√©s-que vous tomberez sur ces annonces fuiyez ou passer votre chemin "

**07/1T** üîÉ Substitui√ß√£o no Coritiba: SAIU: Bruno Melo, ENTROU: Rodrigo Moledo.

**25/1T** Corta. Zapelli recebe perto da √°rea, manda em dire√ß√£o ao gol, e Moledo se estica para afastar.  
**26/1T** Uuuuh. Fernando cruza, Seb√° G√≥mez afasta errado, e Raul fica com a bola. Ele chuta de fora, e ela passa ao lado, bem perto do gol.  
**27/1T** üü® Expulso. Cart√£o vermelho para L√©o. Ele atinge Lucas Ronier em disputa e recebe o segundo amarelo, sendo expulso. O Athletico fica com um a menos.  
**31/1T** üîÉ Substitui√ß√£o no Athletico-PR: SAIU: Di Yorio, ENTROU: Matheus Felipe.

**45/1T** Mais seis. Vamos at√© os 51 neste primeiro tempo.
