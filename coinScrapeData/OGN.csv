A trader lost nearly $900,000 after investing in 13 different memecoins, with substantial losses on Alon and Vinecoin. The TRUMP token, which initially surged to a $9 billion market cap, has since dropped significantly, causing further losses. A wallet linked to influencer Ansem lost over $2.5 million. Concerns have been raised about the impact on investors and potential conflicts of interest for Trump.

The crypto market may be unpredictable, but that‚Äôs where some of the best opportunities lie. I‚Äôve been tracking three standout projects - $PLATH, $CATBAT, and $PYRATE. These projects are building serious momentum and offer unique value propositions for 2025. Here‚Äôs why you should keep them on your radar:

# $PLATH (SOL) ‚Äì Conservation with a Twist

https://preview.redd.it/hoiv3fwrl6fe1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f21ca407d2e24cb919017c7b5bb1b8a60ed2f9ab

**$PLATH** is bridging the gap between innovation and impact. Their charitable focus on adopting endangered platypuses (21 and counting) through the WWF sets them apart, while their commitment to environmental stability hints at a broader charity roadmap for 2025.

But it‚Äôs not all about giving back - $PLATH has fun, too. Their Telegram and Reddit bots (rock-paper-scissors, anyone?) and upcoming NFTs add a layer of engagement for the community. Combine that with a strong team of diamond-handed whales, constant token burns, top-holder airdrops, and this project has serious long-term potential.

üîç **Ark Analysis**:

* **Market Cap:** 2.1M
* **Strengths:** Charitable initiatives, original art, strong community engagement.
* **Targets:** Potential for a 2x-3x short-term, with significant long-term promise.

**$CATBAT** is not just a token; it‚Äôs a mission-driven initiative to clean up the crypto space. From developing ScamScout, a tool to help users avoid scams, to offering a unique rugged coin redemption platform, they‚Äôre tackling real issues head-on.

Daily token burns, top-holder airdrops, and partnerships with other major projects add to its appeal. Plus, the dev has locked his token supply for a year, building trust and ensuring stability for the community.

üîç **Ark Analysis**:

* **Market Cap:** 2.7M
* **Strengths:** Anti-scam tools, daily burns, strong roadmap.
* **Targets:** ATH at 4M, with fast growth as tools roll out.

**$PYRATE** isn‚Äôt just a token‚Äîit‚Äôs an entire ecosystem. From a rich storyline featuring characters and comics to a pfp builder web app and ocean-cleaning charity initiatives, this project is all about innovation and engagement.

With over 170K users of its Telegram bot, CEX listings on the way, and paid promotions kicking off soon, $PYRATE is positioning itself for explosive growth. Plus, their focus on community gaming (Minecraft and more) is a fun way to strengthen their loyal crew.

üîç **Ark Analysis**:

The Risks of Different Staking Methods: A No-Bullshit Guide,DeFiYieldClub,1i9tz75,2025-01-25 13:52:05,5,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeFiYieldClub/comments/1i9tz75/the_risks_of_different_staking_methods_a/,Solanafluent,,"Staking is one of the easiest ways to earn passive income in crypto, but not all staking methods are created the same. Some come with good rewards, while others can damage your portfolio if your not careful. Before you lock up your assets, It is important to know what you are getting yourself into. By a request from a community yielder I have tried to break down the risks with different stratetgy.

# 1. Exchange Staking

Centralized exchanges (CEXs) make staking super easy. Just a few clicks and your earning. But easy comes at a cost:

* **Custodial Risk:** Your coins are not  really yours if they are sitting on an exchange. If the exchange gets hacked, mismanages funds, or collapses (FTX, anyone?), you could lose everything.
* **Regulatory Risk:** Governments crack down on exchange staking all the time. One day you are staking, the next day your funds are locked up.
* **Lack of Transparency:** You have no idea what the exchange is doing with your assets behind the scenes.

**Risk Level: High**

# 2. Self-Custody Staking (Validator Delegation)

If you stake directly to a validator on a proof-of-stake (PoS) network like Solana, you keep control of your assets. Sounds great, but there are still some risks:

* **Slashing Risk:** Some networks punish validators for bad behavior or downtime. Solana doesn‚Äôt slash for downtime, but Ethereum does.
* **Validator Risk:** A bad validator means lower rewards or potential delays in unstaking.
* **Liquidity Risk:** Staking locks up your assets for a set period, so if you need funds fast, you might be stuck waiting.

**Risk Level: Medium**

# 3. Liquid Staking

Liquid staking protocols (, Lido, Jito, The Vault, Marinade) give you a token that represents your staked assets. You can use this token in DeFi while still earning staking rewards.

* **Smart Contract Risk:** If the protocol gets hacked, you could lose your staked assets.
* **Depeg Risk:** The liquid staking token (mSOL, vSOL) might not always be worth exactly 1:1 with the original asset. But if mSOL or vSOL depeg it would simply be an arbitrage oppertunity as market would buy up the LST and simply unstake it for insta rewards.
* **Centralization Risk:** A few big liquid staking providers controlling the majority of assets can be a concern.

**Risk Level: Medium**

# 4. Restaking (Solayer and Similar Protocols)

Restaking lets you take already-staked assets and put them to work securing other networks for extra rewards. More yield? Yes. More risk? Also yes.

* **Smart Contract and Protocol Risks:** These are still new, experimental protocols, meaning more risk.
* **Complexity Risk:** Restaking requires some knowledge and active management. You cant just set it and forget it.

**Risk Level: High**

# 5. Staking via DeFi Lending Platforms

Some lending platforms (Save, Kamino) let you stake assets as collateral to borrow or leverage trade. Higher yield potential, but serious risks:

* **Liquidation Risk:** If your collateral value drops, your position could be wiped out.
* **Interest Rate Fluctuations:** Lending rates shift constantly, meaning your APY could drop fast.
* **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:** More complex contracts mean a higher chance of exploits.

**Risk Level: High**

# Final Thoughts

Every staking method has its pros and cons. The best approach? Diversify your staking strategies, use reputable platforms, and never go all-in on one method. Keep an eye on your risk tolerance and make sure you are not locking yourself out of liquidity when you need it most.

**Which staking method do you use? Let‚Äôs discuss in the comments!**"

Who Dat? Hello,baseballclash,1i9s92v,2025-01-25 12:36:38,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/baseballclash/comments/1i9s92v/who_dat_hello/,Altruistic-Shape7555,,"2021 when I first started playing this game I remember it was Annie and Terry. I also remember that getting Ryan was the first gold card and putting him in right field to throw out runners at first base was ridiculous. But because this game has me addicted I have spent thousands of dollars so far on three teams. I lost one team due to someone hacking my Google account and that team was the original OG's all level 13 with Jay as my P and Murray as my C. So does anyone know who these people are on the screen now? 

Last month's breakdown 
$100 on gems
$60 on level up box
$20 on extra tokens for the weekly boxes 
$20 on the monthly pass 
$100 on gems for team two 
$20 on monthly pass 
$10 to finish off crates 

That's $330 and I'm not even at championship level because I haven't had time to play due to work. 

I started a new team it's called CLUBXTC I'm making the 12-month commitment to take it to level 5. This will be my third team. I enjoyed doing it more so to help others that want to play. I'm not recruiting, I have two players me and me and I would like to see if some people would like to come join me and experience from day one until level five because it's pretty exciting. This team is a zero tolerance team which means five games a week League Play minimum of 100 donations except for new people and daily affirmations of support this is not a team it's a club modeled after the New York Yankees when Class not Ass is priority number one.

The team will fill up I know that I'm just looking to see if any tenured players want to start the team with someone who has been playing since the beginning 

I owe a ton of credit to a lot of guys and that are battling for the top 10 positions in this game they have taught me much I don't want to mention their names to piss people off but they know who they are and they helped me understand what it's like to play at level five and win. So I'm trying to do that for the next gen that's coming up 

CLUBXTC OPEN 
NEED CO-LEADERS

"Question about ""Resolving"" vs. ""Revealing"" tokens for the purposes of triggering card effects",arkhamhorrorlcg,1i9rur5,2025-01-25 12:19:36,3,0.71,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/arkhamhorrorlcg/comments/1i9rur5/question_about_resolving_vs_revealing_tokens_for/,significantowl3,,"This question came up specifically relating to [parallel Father Mateo](https://arkhamdb.com/card/90081). He can seal Bless tokens on investigators, and the second part of his ability states: ""When an investigator would reveal a chaos token: Resolve the [Bless] token sealed on them instead. Release that token."" 


My question: does ""resolving"" in this case count as ""revealing"" the Bless token for the purposes of using cards such as Blessed Blade (0), Beloved, etc. that say something like ""If a [Bless] token is revealed ...""?


(Bonus: I assume it definitely would *not* work to trigger Jacob Morrison, who states ""After a [Bless] token is revealed **from the chaos bag** ..."")


Some arguments:


* Favor of the Sun says ""Resolve a token sealed here instead, as if it were just revealed from the chaos bag"". Mateo doesn't have that ""as if"" clause. 


* Tokens are revealed during ST.3 of the skill test timing and resolved during ST.4, so that suggests that ""resolve"" happens after ""reveal"", so the Bless token was never revealed and you don't get the benefits of revealing it, only resolving it (so, just +2)? *EDIT: I'm now questioning this. Rules for Bless tokens are: ""[Bless] tokens revealed during a skill test have the following effects: +2. Reveal another token. Instead of returning this token to the chaos bag, return it to the token pool."" That seems to imply that a Bless token that is not revealed doesn't do anything at all ... so the token ""resolved"" by Mateo's ability must also be effectively ""revealed"" in order to do anything???*


* There is no entry for ""resolve"" (for chaos tokens) that I could find in the Rules Reference. I know there are FAQs about revealing and cancelling for Olive McBride, etc., but in that case you definitely reveal all of them (then pick one to resolve and others to cancel) so it's not quite answering my question. 


* The Rules Ref entry for ""Instead"" says: ""If a replacement effect that uses the word ""would"" changes the nature of a triggering condition, the original triggering condition is replaced with the new triggering condition. No further abilities referencing the original triggering condition may be used."" So it sounds like the condition that would, e.g., trigger extra damage on Blessed Blade (0) (""When an investigator would reveal a chaos token"") is completely replaced with the new condition (""Resolve the [Bless] token"")?


All that suggests that you don't get benefits of *revealing* a [Bless] from || Mateo, only resolving them (*EDIT: but what are these benefits? The rules for Blesses only refer to revealing them*). This IMO makes his ability a bit lacklustre if he can only hand out +2s (*EDIT: but can he?? See edit note above*) and not trigger Bless-reveal effects, so I wanted to see if I was missing something. There are some uncertain/conflicting answers on the arkhamdb and BoardGameGeek pages. What do you all think?"

Launching a SaaS based on YT influencer idea. Is it a good idea?,SaaS,1i9qpwt,2025-01-25 11:30:36,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1i9qpwt/launching_a_saas_based_on_yt_influencer_idea_is/,No-Common1466,B2B SaaS,"Ive been into SaaS development for thr past 3-4 months. My first SaaS is a sales scheduling tool which I got plenty of feedbacks already here from this
sub. Its still on validation stage and I still dont want to fully commit the development since its a bit complex. Im still running my automated cold email outreach and continue on posting content on linkedin. Got some
decent waitlist users ready for my pilot
program.

So while Im doing this marketing and growth stuff, I still have some decent spare time to develop a microsaas for startup founders, sales teams, and product managers for getting customer and role insights using AI ( Yes! its an AI wrapper I admit!)

Basically the idea came from TK Kader, a SaaS founder and influencer I followed. You can watch the original video here: https://youtu.be/x6osXJaIOtM?feature=shared

So this is one of the underrated SaaS idea he mentioned which is creating customer profiles based on role on job title and AI will generate a comprehensive insights based on that role. I have tried different LLMs
like OpenAI, Claude, Cursor, Gemini, and the most comprehesive results I got is using Gemini Pro. With 1500 input tokens, I receive about 6000 output tokens worthy of about 8-11 pages of comprehensive report.

After about 3 weeks of development, in which I only work on weekends (3-4 hrs in free time) and some 1-2 hours on a free week day, I will launch this microsaas. The only missing part is the Payment integration testing from Lemon Squeezy, where Im waiting for activation - once done, people can upgrade and see the full report.

I would like to know your feedback on this from actual SaaS and startup founders and is this something you will really use like TK Kader have mentioned.

Why I Believe Saitama Reborn is Massively Undervalued,SaitamaInuERC20,1i9qma2,2025-01-25 11:26:11,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaitamaInuERC20/comments/1i9qma2/why_i_believe_saitama_reborn_is_massively/,Exotic-Midnight-6028,,"# My Journey in Crypto

I began trading cryptocurrency around mid-2023, diving headfirst into what has been an exhilarating yet often frustrating journey. Early on, I dedicated countless hours to research‚Äîreading whitepapers, analyzing roadmaps, and trying to make calculated decisions. While I managed a few small wins, my tendency to rotate into other projects too quickly often erased any gains I made.

Time and again, I would sell tokens for modest profits, only to watch them skyrocket after I exited. These missed opportunities taught me a hard lesson about the dangers of over-rotation and the importance of patience in investing.

After enduring several cycles of frustration, I pivoted towards meme coins. At first, I thought I‚Äôd found my niche, but even this sector wasn‚Äôt without its challenges. Rug pulls, exorbitant gas fees, and overtrading continued to hinder my progress. I knew I had to refine my approach if I wanted to succeed.

# The Unique Appeal of Meme Coins

Meme coins are unlike any other asset class in the crypto space. What started with Dogecoin as a joke has evolved into a phenomenon, driven by communities that rally around humor, shared beliefs, and a sense of belonging. These coins tap into a unique psychology‚Äîparticularly among younger generations‚Äîwhere financial investments become a form of social identity.

According to Murad, a prominent expert in the field, meme coins are poised for a ‚Äúsupercycle‚Äù in 2025. This prediction is rooted in the idea that Gen Z and Millennials are drawn to strong communities and cult-like followings that offer more than just financial returns. For many, meme coins represent a fun and engaging way to participate in the crypto revolution, blending investment with entertainment and collective identity.

# The Power of Communities in Crypto

In the world of meme coins, communities are everything. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, where utility and technology often take center stage, the success of a meme coin depends heavily on its ability to foster a passionate and loyal following.

Strong communities act as the backbone of a project, helping it weather market dips and setbacks. These groups, often referred to as ""hardcore holders"" or ""cult-like believers,"" are fiercely committed to their chosen token. They don‚Äôt just hold through turbulence‚Äîthey actively promote, defend, and grow the project. This sense of unity and shared purpose can make or break a meme coin.

# Why Saitama Reborn Stands Out

In my search for a meme coin with a strong community, I came across¬†**Saitama Inu Reborn**. This project is the successor to the original¬†**Saitama Inu**, which was one of the most iconic meme coins of 2021. At its peak, Saitama Inu reached a market cap of¬†**$7 billion**,¬†**becoming the third-largest meme coin in the world and boasting over 350,000 holders**. Its community, known as the ""Wolfpack,"" was legendary for its passion and dedication.

However, like so many projects in the crypto space, Saitama Inu fell victim to bad actors. The original developers betrayed their community, orchestrating a rug pull that left investors devastated. The fallout was so severe that the FBI intervened, arresting the developers for fraud and market manipulation.

But from the ashes of this betrayal,¬†**Saitama Reborn**¬†emerged. This isn‚Äôt just a new project‚Äîit‚Äôs a revival of one of the most passionate communities in crypto history. For me, Saitama Reborn is more than an investment opportunity; it‚Äôs a powerful statement against fraudulent developers and a testament to the resilience of dedicated communities.

# Why I Believe in Saitama Reborn

Currently, Saitama Reborn has faced a significant dip, falling from its all-time high of $13 million to a market cap of around $800,000. While this might deter some investors, I see it as an opportunity. The Wolfpack community continues to show resilience, working tirelessly to rebuild trust and momentum.

This aligns with a broader truth about life and investing: struggle leads to growth. Whether in markets or personal development, challenges are what make us stronger and wiser. Saitama Reborn embodies this principle, showing that even in the face of adversity, a strong community can rebuild and thrive.

Given its history, I believe Saitama Reborn has the potential to reclaim its former glory. If it were to reach its previous market cap of $7 billion, this would represent a staggering 7,000x increase from its current valuation.

Before investing in any meme coin, it‚Äôs crucial to do your own research and avoid chasing hype or green candles. Meme coins thrive on belief, community, and long-term commitment. Saitama Reborn stands out because it represents more than just financial gain‚Äîit‚Äôs a movement, a comeback story, and a rallying point for those who believe in the power of collective effort.

For anyone considering an investment, I encourage you to think beyond the short-term gains. Saitama Reborn is a project worth holding onto, not just during the highs but also through the storms. Stop trading and start believing‚Äîbecause in crypto, and in life, it‚Äôs the believers who ultimately win.

Problem with Star Citizen Vulkan,starcitizen,1i9qhkg,2025-01-25 11:20:28,3,0.67,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1i9qhkg/problem_with_star_citizen_vulkan/,No_Analyst1481,DISCUSSION,"o7 to everyone.  
I have a strange problem with Star Citizen and VULKAN.   
I have 5800X3D, 64 gb ram(2x32, 3600 mhz ADATA), RX6700 XT and 650w PSU, gigabyte ds3h b550m

I cannot use VULKAN on Star Citizen anymore. why? I have no idea.

ERROR 732823392  
I will try to explain here:  
For me VULKAN in SC is much stable than using DirectX11 (stutters a lot)  
The problem is if I want to use VULKAN in Star Citizen, it only works for the first time after i install my graphics driver. I Install Adrenaline -> start Star Citizen -> it does those shader caches(134k) and the game will run flawlessly.  
I can play even 12h without any problems. After I finish playing SC and I restart my computer, the next time SC won't wanna load with VULKAN. When it should load the menu it goes all black and the game closes the game and it shows me verify error. if I do the verify, it says it's perfectly fine.  
If I delete the shader cache from c:/user/local/starcitizen folder it's the same bullshit.  
I can use vulkan in Star Citizen only if I reinstall my graphics driver and it will work until i restart my pc.  
Did anyone have this problem?  
In c:/user/local/starcitizen folder I also check the game.log (to check for errors but I cannot understad)  
It's something like this in that game.log folder :

Thoughts on Teeth of God GN - Spoilers!,SleepTokenTheory,1i9pjwc,2025-01-25 10:39:25,11,0.87,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepTokenTheory/comments/1i9pjwc/thoughts_on_teeth_of_god_gn_spoilers/,Brisingrspiceg97,Discussion,"Few thoughts on the novel that really lead to more questions but quite fun to pull on the tendrils of them all.¬†

  
  
Teeth of God.¬†

¬†

As mentioned in the first letter, it appears the Director has been subjected to recurring dreams since childhood and maybe this book is a window into those dreams of past, present, and future.¬†

¬†

The first episode seems like it could be based of scripture from the Bible in Revelation 6. In this chapter, the Lamb (the first episode‚Äôs title) opens the seals which unleashes end time events on the Earth. In verse 12, it says ‚Äú‚Ä¶¬†the whole moon turned blood red‚Äù and in verse 15, ‚ÄúThen the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals, the rich, the mighty, and everyone else, both slave and free,¬†hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains‚Äù. This seems to line up with the novel‚Äôs setting where people are hiding below the Earth‚Äôs surface and we see the moon erupting with a red entity. It is interesting that we are introduced to a mouthlike star tulip and it seems to pop up in each episode. Star tulips typically symbolize healing and receptivity which is an interesting choice given this apocalyptic plot.¬†

¬†

*Side note: While dark, the first episode is also funny. It gives ‚ÄúMonty Python and the Holy Grail‚Äù energy with the jackalope (killer bunny!!) and people losing limbs but acting like ‚Äúit‚Äôs only just a flesh wound‚Äù.*¬†

¬†

Then, in the second episode we see the soldiers encounter the chokeholdesque creature after disturbing it in the tar pit. In Revelation chapter 9, the locusts are released ‚Äúwearing something like crowns of gold‚Äù (creature‚Äôs sun mask?) to torment the people on earth and they were ruled by the ‚ÄúDestroyer‚Äù of the Abyss (‚ÄúDrowned Lord‚Äù ->‚Äù Destroyer‚Äù?).

¬†

Blessings. A funny title for the third episode given what happens to the team and seems to be a deserved eyebrow raise at the Church. However, the start of the episode seems like an illustrated combination of ¬†‚ÄúMud Angels‚Äù and ‚ÄúFall for Me‚Äù where we see the hand reaching through the surface and feathers scattered in the snow. ¬†

¬†

>*‚ÄúBehold, they have flooded my sanctuary*  
*With hate, chemicals and machines*  
*Fouled by a pillar of thick black smoke*  
*I know this place*  
*I know this place*

>*Follow the trail of feathers and mud (nothing is)*  
*Find me alone in the throes of gravity (infinite to me)‚Äù*

¬†

>*‚ÄúSo won't you fall for me?*  
*Won't you fall for me?*  
*Through a fractured existence*  
*Won't you fall for me?*  
*Won't you fall for me*  
*From reality?‚Äú*  
  


Episode 4 has an interesting tytle. Daedalus is known as a Greek inventor. He built the famous labyrinth and wings for him and his son, Icarus, to escape imprisonment. Seems like the band has built us a labyrinth made of music, no? Even Daedalus didn‚Äôt truly know how to get out of the labyrinth so has Sleep Token created a labyrinth through their music, and now this book, that will take us where we need to go on our own individual journeys? Maybe using the star tulip in the beginning was intentional as we see the Director decide to finally face his fate and dreams head on in the last episode. He is receptive to the changing tide even though he is afraid and ‚Äúmust be something new‚Äù. ¬†He embraces the tidal wave he feared in Letter 1 and steps into a new reality.¬†

¬†When he steps into the new reality, we see the episode conclude with him and the TMBTE character gently embracing each other. This scene and the contents of Letter 4 are very reminiscent of the ‚ÄúFall for Me‚Äù music video text.¬†

¬†

>*‚ÄúThe truth is I am due a harsh lesson, in truth itself and how bitter it can be. Will you teach me? The truth is I am ugly, I am inadequate, I am lost.*

>*I am no God.*

>*The truth is I want to, to want, to live. And so do you. I just can‚Äôt do this any longer. I am afraid. Are you afraid? I want to understand what it is to let go. So for now, let me serve as a living drama of your pain. If we are to be submerged then let us be submerged.*

>*Together.‚Äù*

¬†

This novel seems to follow a female solider from episodes 1-3... Is she the one who originally pulled the mutated star tulip and got away in episode 1, fought in episode 2, and was transformed by the anomaly in episode 3?¬†

Additionally, is the soldier who took the flower from her and put it on himself the same as the Director as well as the Summoning character? After he sacrificed himself for her to get away and is forced to stare into the moon, did he become the Summoning character? The flower is in the same spot on both their uniforms, the cut off arm is replaced with the gun, and both save the female solider from attackers at the last second (episodes 1 & 2) *(‚ÄúAnd I'm not here to be the saviour you long for, only the one you don't‚Äù).* Also, the director's facial features shown in episode 4 are quite similar to that soldier‚Äôs in episode 1 where we see the smirk. In the director‚Äôs fourth letter, he ends it with repeatedly saying ‚ÄúI am the teeth of God‚Äù and we can see dentures/teeth hanging from the machine gun in the Summoning music video. Coincidence?¬†

¬†

Speaking of coincidences, at the end of episode 3 we see the Director rip out the cables of the operation and the screen shows an 8-pointed star.¬†Research shows an 8-pointed star is associated to the Sumerian goddess Inanna and she is associated with Venus. Funny coincidence with the publisher‚Äôs name? We can add more coincidence to this for fun. Vessel/Leo used to wear an 8-pointed star necklace with the libra ‚ôéÔ∏è symbol on it and astrology shows that Libras are ruled by Venus. Pulling the astrology thread, Leo is a constellation and the heart of the lion is also the base of the sickle marked by a star called Regulus. Regulus and Venus¬†once upon a time are rumored to have formed an 8-pointed star with Jupiter called the Star of Bethlehem. That 8-pointed star led the way and marked a significant point in history.

We can add even more spice to this for fun. In the TMBTE video, the character is holding a scythe and at the very end of it, we can faintly see an 8-pointed star hanging. All this to say, it‚Äôs a tendril to pull and fascinating an 8-pointed star was displayed on the computer screen right before the Director meets the TMBTE character.¬†

¬†

P.S. Would be great for LSB to resurface and regale us with a fanfic theory on¬†the novel right about now. ¬†

He‚Äôs passionate about getting his work seen by a bigger audience.
Oliver Sarkis, a skilled artist, has teamed up with Hollywood producer and crypto vet Stevie Long (also doxxed) to bring the project to life. These guys aren‚Äôt just crypto enthusiasts, they‚Äôre pros in what they do. The team backing SPU is insanely talented and hard-working because we believe in this project and know it's potential. 

üöÄThe token launched a week ago, and although it‚Äôs been caught up in some drama like the rest of the crypto world(the Trump/Melania mess), the focus is on growing the content.


The YouTube  channel and TikTok just LAUNCHED and the animations are honestly some of the funniest, most original content you‚Äôll see in the crypto space. This is what meme tokens should be, funny, engaging content that makes people laugh and SHARE it!

This is a long-term vision. There‚Äôs a plan for regular content release, and the project is focused on building real value, not just a quick pump and dump. The team has less than 1% ownership and the wallets involved are under 3%, which means there‚Äôs no central control that could cause a rug pull.

The Community and What‚Äôs Coming:

The Telegram community is a great place to hang out, share laughs, and promote the content. It‚Äôs about working together to build something fun and lasting.

This is just the beginning!!!! There‚Äôs a whole pipeline of content in the works, with the following getting bigger and the humor getting sharper. If you‚Äôre in the crypto space for something real and entertaining, this project is worth your attention.


 If you‚Äôre looking for something with staying power and tons of entertainment to look forward to, this is the one to check out!

Agricola,soloboardgaming,1i9o2d7,2025-01-25 09:28:02,52,1.0,18,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9o2d7,mrausgor,,"My first Uwe Rosenberg game. I‚Äôve been eyeing a bunch of different games by him for a while now, but never pulled the trigger. The easy choice seemed to be to just grab Feast for Odin, but honestly every time I see one of his games posted here I get intrigued, so I curated a list of 20 of his games and I‚Äôm trying them out in order of release. It gets a bit convoluted because Agricola came out in 2007 but there are like 40 different versions of it. I landed on getting the 2016 revised edition, so I‚Äôm not *actually* playing them in release order‚Ä¶ but this is just for me so it doesn‚Äôt really matter. 

**Quick Overview**: Agricola is  a worker placement game where you are building out a farm. It‚Äôs played over 16 rounds. You start with two workers to place each round and have the opportunity to create more depending on how busy you get in the farmhouse. You expand your house, build pastures and plant crops. You‚Äôre always balancing the desire of achieving goals and the need to feed your family. 

**Solo Mode**: Very minor tweaks to the standard gameplay, otherwise you just play the game. There seems to be a ton of variety with the cards and combinations that can be capitalized upon, so I can‚Äôt imagine this getting stale very quickly. There is also a ‚Äúcampaign‚Äù mode where you keep one of your occupation (upgrade) cards from each previous game over an 8 game campaign. During the 8th game you‚Äôll be starting with 7 occupations in play. Each game has a higher score that you must achieve to advance .

Observations:

‚úîÔ∏è It‚Äôs not clear to me how much was changed from the original version when they released the Revised. I read that it updated some art and balanced out the cards better to make everything a bit tighter. Unless it was drastically different, it seems like the game was way ahead of it‚Äôs time. 

‚úîÔ∏è There‚Äôs an authenticity in the rule book and appendix that I really enjoyed. Lots of blurbs from Uwe about the game and it‚Äôs design. ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúThis score is good for beginners, experienced players should shoot for‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúI thought about having the rules be this way, but ended up going with this instead‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúHere are some house rules that people play with‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúThis scores like this even though it isn‚Äôt thematic‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢  Stuff like that. It felt honest and refreshing, and I really hope it‚Äôs something that he does in his other games. 

‚úîÔ∏è Throwing my sheep in the fireplace to feed my kids I was cranking out as fast as I could didn‚Äôt really feel that great lol.

‚úîÔ∏è I very much enjoyed the way the game is scored. You don‚Äôt get rewarded for being really good at one thing, you get a small amount of points for each of the different criteria. This made it feel like I couldn‚Äôt ignore any one aspect of the game without getting penalized on my scoring. I think there are 13 different areas you score in. 

‚úîÔ∏è I recently played quite a few rounds of Harvest and really enjoyed it, but always felt like the game ended before I wanted it to. Like there‚Äôs a lot to do and I didn‚Äôt get to do nearly enough of it. Agricola is the answer. There are a lot of similarities between the two, but Agricola feels like a more well-realized farm simulator. 

‚úîÔ∏è This looks like an old game, but it‚Äôs clean and has a certain charm to it. Going back to Harvest again - man it would be cool to have a game that looks like Harvest but plays like Agricola.

‚úîÔ∏è The first round took me an hour or maybe slightly more. It‚Äôs pretty snappy though once you get a grasp on the rules. I could easily see this being a game that could be played in 30 minutes once you know what you are doing. 

‚úîÔ∏è A Plano box or something similar for the tokens is a must. I can‚Äôt imagine trying to set this game up and play it without one. I imagine setup will take me 2 minutes with how I have it stored. 

‚úîÔ∏è I definitely need to read the rule book again now that I‚Äôve played a couple of rounds. I don‚Äôt think I did anything too off the wall, but I would be very surprised if I didn‚Äôt make several rule mistakes. 

‚úîÔ∏è Overall I‚Äôm very high on this game. I plan on playing it a bunch before moving onto the next Uwe game and can confidently say I‚Äôm excited to play more of his creations."
I Think Cryptos Can Be Evaluated By An Idea From Stock Evaluation Methods.,CryptoMarkets,1i9mhi0,2025-01-25 08:02:42,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/1i9mhi0/i_think_cryptos_can_be_evaluated_by_an_idea_from/,PureClass247,,"Today, I'll focus on only 3 cryptos: 

ETH (Ethereum), 

SOL (Solana),

TRX (Tron). 

These are representative cryptos of L1 (Layer 1) chains.

Actually, I've been thinking about crypto evaluation methods during the past 7 years. 4 years ago, I tried to evaluate cryptos by Marketcap divided by TVL (Total Value Locked). If the figure is lower than other chains, relatively, it can be undervalued.

As time goes by, we can check 24h tx (Transactions) fees data from De-Fi platforms such as swap pools or DEX (Decentralized Exchange, looks like a traditional CEX - Centralized Exchange).

Alright! Let's try to calculate annualized tx fees from 3 major coins.

(Estimates)

üëâ ETH annual tx fees: $4.57m √ó 365 (days) = $1.6b

Excluding L2 chains, like BASE

üëâ SOL annual tx fees: $15.5m √ó 365 (days) = $5.7b

üëâ TRX annual tx fees: $1.93m √ó 365 (days) = $0.7b

üëâ ETH marketcap: $397b

üëâ SOL marketcap: $121b

üëâ TRX marketcap: $22b

Let's take an idea from PER, so how many years does it take from Marketcap divided by Annual tx fees?

Marketcap / Annual tx fee

üëâ ETH = $397b √∑ $1.6b = 248y (Years)

üëâ SOL = $121b √∑ $5.7b = 21y

üëâ TRX = $22b √∑ $0.7b = 31y

Of course, please consider this data is excluding ETH L2 chains.

Anyways, in conclusion, SOL is the king of altcoins as L1 chains, and TRX is undervalued, considering TRX marketcap.

Alright, let's advance TVL evaluation methods. Now we have Bridged TVL data. Bridged TVL means an original chain's assets TVL + other chains' tokens TVL.

So, if a chain has high bridged TVL, compared to marketcap, the chain can be undervalued. I think this evaluation model is more advanced than the previous model. Cause, high bridged TVL means since many investors trust a blockchain, they used the bridging function a lot.

Let's calculate liquidation value by Marketcap / Bridged TVL.

üëâ ETH = $397b √∑ $229.764b = 1.73

üëâ SOL = $121b √∑ $46.921b = 2.58

üëâ TRX = $22b √∑ $66.185b = 0.33

It seems bridging users trust Tron chain more than other chains ü§î Interesting üßê Rich bridging users prefer using Ethereum and Tron.

So, my conclusion is.. SOL is the leader of all altcoins now, and it's still undervalued in terms of 24h tx fees. However, rich users prefer using Ethereum and Tron. Furthermore, TRX is still potential to grow more with respect to these data. Let's keep our eyes on these 3 major coins ü§î

"[Genshin Impact] As we return to Inazuma, one loose end still bothers me: Scaramouche never making amends with Kazuha.",CharacterRant,1i9iqs9,2025-01-25 03:38:59,2,0.56,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterRant/comments/1i9iqs9/genshin_impact_as_we_return_to_inazuma_one_loose/,EarthSeraphEdna,Games,"Inazuma is ruled by the Raiden Shogun. (We will put aside the autonomous region of Watatsumi Island.) Underneath her is an aristocracy, led by three great noble clans who run the three branches of government. Below those three highest houses are a number of minor or branch families, such as the priestly Kuki. Many playable Inazuman characters are nobles, as evidenced by their full names.

Kaedehara Kazuha is a minor noble. The Kaedehara clan was one of five renowned for mystical bladesmithing skills. Unfortunately, for the past few centuries, Scaramouche (originally Kunikuzushi) had embarked on a petty crusade to ruin all major craftsmen in Inazuma. Thanks to slow, methodical sabotage to make them look foolish and incompetent, Scaramouche successfully shattered the reputations of four out of five of these mystical bladesmithing houses, including the Kaedehara family. By the time Kazuha was born, his clan was disgraced and impoverished.

Today, Kazuha is the last of his line. He has gained acclaim on his own (mostly for parrying a god), and he turned down an opportunity to restore the prestige and fortune of the Kaedehara name, in favor of wandering the world. Nevertheless, his house's past came back to haunt him. Hues of the Violet Garden saw him learn about Scaramouche's old campaign to engineer the downfall of the Kaedehara clan and several others: including a document penned by his great grandfather, detailing the machinations of Kunikuzushi, which would have been dismissed as the ravings of a madman at the time. The Golden Apple Archipelago 2.8 showed that his childhood still weighs heavily on him.

Later, in an effort to delete himself and his past actions from the timeline, Scaramouche wound up ""merely"" erasing all memories and historical records of himself. This includes the written testimony of Kazuha's great grandfather, which now makes only vague intimations about internecine strife between the bladesmithing families as the ""real reason"" for their gradual downfall.

So now, Kazuha's mind has been robbed of the knowledge of Scaramouche, the true perpetrator of the collapse of four whole noble clans and their respective mystical bladesmithing arts. Scaramouche has referred to Kazuha only once, and even then, dismissively (check his voice lines). There is no longer any chance for the house of Kaedehara and three other humiliated families to receive justice or even a token apology from Scaramouche.

As we return to Inazuma, this really, really irritates me. I hope that the writers even loosely acknowledge this, but I doubt that they ever will.

___

It has also been pointed out that the above incident also affected two other playable characters, Ayaka and Ayato of the Kamisato clan. Their house was responsible for overseeing the works of the five bladesmithing family. The Kamisatos were also badly scandalized, to the point wherein Ayaka and Ayato's aging parents died from the stress.

Also, this covers only **one** of his misdeeds! Scaramouche has been active for centuries across the globe, and we have seen him orchestrate at least two other major operations: the Unreconciled Stars, and the Inazuman Delusion factory. How many other wrongdoings has Scaramouche eluded justice for?"

We‚Äôve perfected this colorway style entirely.

Most denim fabrics on the market are treated with a starch removal process to prevent shrinkage, but the base color of this fabric is prone to fading and cannot withstand bleaching or dyeing.

We custom-wove 3000 yards of this fabric, and the craftsmanship and development logic are detailed in the link beside this. The custom-woven fabric needs to undergo mercerization treatment to achieve the original effect.

I‚Äôve checked the mass production of these pants, and the hand-painting is almost identical to the sample. The hand-drawn patterns also don‚Äôt look stiff.

There are only a small batch left before the new year, so grab them while you can and cherish them. Truly great items.

I don‚Äôt usually play around with fancy wording; good products speak for themselves.

Despite initial appearances, Trump's digital currency transactions, including wrapped bitcoin, are primarily tied to Ethereum's ecosystem. Wrapped Bitcoin is an ERC20 token on Ethereum, offering exposure to Bitcoin's value with Ethereum's smart contract benefits. This shift suggests Trump's alignment with Ethereum, challenging the 'Bitcoin President' narrative and highlighting the evolving landscape of digital currencies.

Following our recent purchase of the design artwork, active members of the Shenmue community set out to trace the original owner of these books and artworks. Their search led them to Hideki Kawabata, a former SEGA AM2 employee. While such rabbit holes often lead nowhere, this one uncovered a treasure trove of unseen images and artwork that had been hidden in plain sight for over 25 years.

We have preserved these on our website for the entire Shenmue Community to enjoy and we hope you take the time to marvel at a huge piece of Shenmue history!

Token Distribution - A Closer Look:

* Community First: A whopping 50.5% of the tokens are allocated for community grants and programs through the Animecoin Foundation. This is a clear sign of their commitment to a community-driven ecosystem.

* Azuki NFT Holders: If you're part of the Azuki community, you're in for a treat. 37.5% of the tokens are set aside for you at launch. Any unclaimed tokens will shift to the 13% Community Cultivation Fund, which AnimeDAO will manage to fund community initiatives.

* Foundation and Growth: The Animecoin Foundation holds 24.44% for ecosystem growth, including grant programs and industry integration. There's also 2% for partner communities.

* Team and Vesting: Team members, contractors, and Azuki employees get 15.62%, but there's a catch - they're on a three-year vesting schedule with a one-year cliff. This ensures long-term commitment. Azuki Corp itself gets 7.44% under the same terms.

This project is really about merging two of the coolest worlds it got listed on Bitget on the 23 January - anime and blockchain. Whether you're here for the tech, the culture, or both, ANIME Token seems like a project worth keeping an eye on.What do you think? Are you excited about this blend of anime and blockchain?

PvP servers issue update,newworldgame,1i9deqk,2025-01-24 21:56:50,8,0.79,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/newworldgame/comments/1i9deqk/pvp_servers_issue_update/,StepChylde,Discussion,"After today‚Äôs maintenance there was an issue in which unique per-world rules were not being applied correctly. This issue allowed transfers of characters into and out of worlds where transfers were not intended to be possible. This issue was identified and resolved, and the team has been hard at work to mitigate any impacts on world economies. 

The following actions are being taken to rectify these issues.

* All accounts with characters that transferred during the window when the issue was live, and those who took part in trading with transferred characters, have been temporarily suspended. 
* Length of temporary suspensions is determined based upon the actions taken by the player accounts that impacted the affected worlds, and are subject to change.
* All characters created on Seasonal Worlds during the period when the issue was live are deleted, as the characters did not have seasonal rules applied to them correctly.
* Territories claimed on the Seasonal Worlds during the period the issue was live are reverted to unclaimed status.
* Player to player trading and the trading post remain temporarily disabled on Standard and Seasonal Worlds and will be restored as soon as possible.
* Trading post contracts from affected characters are cancelled.
* Items and coin traded between players or put into company balances by those who took part in the unintended transfers are removed. 
* Companies created by those who took part in the unintended transfers have been removed.
* Players who used a transfer token during the time period the issue was live are sent back to their original worlds and will receive a transfer token at a later date.

We are doing a phased approach to re-enabling worlds and will post updates as they are available, and the team will continue to monitor these worlds.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused by these issues and the extended downtime, and appreciate everyone's patience and continued support as we work through them."

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke. It was our song remastered"

Pathfinder 2e Conversion Report,Pathfinder2e,1i980e3,2025-01-24 17:33:13,141,0.98,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/1i980e3/pathfinder_2e_conversion_report/,2tothe8th,Discussion,"My group has recently finished a campaign that was designed to help my group transition from 5e and PF 1e. I thought I would put up some notes on the experience with the intent of perhaps helping those who are transitioning or considering it.

TLDR: Pathfinder 2e is one of the most solid systems I've ever run and is very GM friendly. Experienced player seem to enjoy the design possibilities for characters and buy in is at an all time high.

**Background and References**

Our group has been playing together in various configurations for close to twenty years. We play almost weekly but cancel occasionally due to life. Most of us are middle aged.

Personally, I've been playing TTRPG's since the 80's and have tried basically everything including original editions of dnd, Cyberpunk 2020, Deadlands, Rifts, World of Darkness, FATE and a dozen others. This group in particular has always been open to try anything at least once. 

I usually run but others step in occasionally. 

**The Switch to Pathfinder 2e**

We switched to Pathfinder 1e instead of DnD 4e way back in the day. The majority of play was in my homebrew world that I stared in DnD 3.5 and then converted to Pathfinder. When Paizo announced their 2nd edition, we decided to try DnD 5th just to see since what it was like and we worked with some of the modules (mostly Curse of Strahd) until the OGL fiasco. Then we took the leap into Pathfinder 2e after a Humble Bundle deal. 

**The Gauntlet**

My due diligence lead me to believe that even old PF 1e players may have some adjustments to contend with so I decided to put together a series of encounters ranging from cr 1 to 10 with the intent of using the different encounters to not only train the players but give me the opportunity to design the encounters. There would be 10 encounters and the players would level up after each to match the progression of CRs.  We would play through the encounters, learning as we go and then graduate to a real campaign with either new characters or maybe sticking with the higher level characters. We would knock out two or three encounters a session and discuss the options with the various classes so that everyone would gain insight into the various options.

**Tools**

Early on, I was impressed with the tools available. The players quickly found [Pathbuilder](https://pathbuilder2e.com/) (https://pathbuilder2e.com/) and it is indispensable. I own Foundry VTT but I found that [Owlbear.rodeo](http://Owlbear.rodeo) was a much better platform for hybrid play. (Foundry is fantastic for modules such as Abomination Vaults but if you are building your own maps or using what you find on the internet, Owlbear is just fine and always getting better.) Lastly, after trying a lot of options, I went with [Pathfinder Dashboard](https://pathfinderdashboard.com/) (https://pathfinderdashboard.com/) as the encounter/initiative tracker. I cannot recommend it enough. Throwing together an improv encounter in the middle of a game is very easy and all of the monster details are clickable and have everything you need as a GM.

**Observations**

So we made it through three encounters before role playing took over and it became a campaign. I had a loose story that connected all of the encounters to start but as we played, questions came up and suddenly we had a story and the sessions got longer and longer and more encounters happened between the Gauntlet encounters. A year later we ""finished"" the campaign with encounter 10 of the Gauntlet. My original intent was to be done in three sessions.

Here are my general observations:

* The game is player-centric and that is a good thing. For the first time in a long time, I hear players saying that they need to work on their character between sessions and they are excited about it. Leveling up takes a minute as the players comb through options and have a blast doing it.
* The game is GM-friendly. Pre game anxiety has been tamped down considerably, especially with all of the tools available. Running the game is smooth and easy and, most importantly, fun. Keep in mind that we play in person but I use a tv to run Owlbear from my laptop so that we are all looking at the same thing. The players have Owlbear on their devices to move their characters and then we roll analog dice. It works for us.
* GM prep is also fast and easy. I spent most of my time finding maps, making maps (Inkarnate or Dungeon Designer) and making tokens (Photoshop). Building the encounters in Pathfinder Dashboard is very simple, mostly point and click. I do spend more time making notes on roleplay encounters and story beats. 
* Buy in is built in. As in, the players are locked in and focused for the duration in ways that I have rarely seen. We usually play between 4 to 5 hours on the weekend and we all have day jobs. Seeing some nodding heads and some phone use are common towards the end of the night. But lately, I've had to shut games down because we have gone past midnight and no one noticed. That's huge. There are several reasons for this with the 3 action economy giving the players more to think about and the focus on teamwork being the most prevalent. Through the encounters, we quickly figured out the most basic strategies, such as using the 3rd action to move away from the monster to force an action spend on movement to close again. But the group also learned each others strengths and the teamwork was awesome. The cr10 encounter was a ballet of efficient death and destruction that took me by surprise. The team moved like heroes and I wish I could watch the movie version of just that scene. 
* It's crunchy and tactical but no one is complaining. And I expected complaints but everyone has abilities and feats that fit and that they want to use so the crunch disappears into the game. Also, the crunch does not interfere with the roleplay. The roleplay aspect is basically why three sessions turned into a year. The mechanics actually encouraged this.

**The Downsides**

I really don't have any. And I do not work for Paizo. Anytime we had a problem with a rule, it did not take  long to iron out. We realized early on that the ""Playing the Game"" chapter is actually a very small part of the Players Guide. Once we got that part down, looking up keywords in the index answered any question we had. The hardest part was giving up some of 1e habits but it happened over time. 

2e is just a tight gaming experience that shows the evolution of TTRPGs in a positive way. If anything, I should be a bit miffed at the Remaster drama but I get why they need to separate themselves and the pre-remaster is compatible with post-remaster so it works out fine. 

Overall, this has been one of my favorite gaming experiences and I find myself excited about the medium again. At this point I'm going to give my home brew a brake and try one of Paizo's adventure paths on Foundry. Currently, I'm torn between Outlaws of Alkenstar or Abomination Vaults and would be interested in anyone's opinion who has run either. "
Choosing an Energy Commander - Jeskai or Temur?,EDH,1i97mx6,2025-01-24 17:16:46,5,0.78,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1i97mx6/choosing_an_energy_commander_jeskai_or_temur/,MaskedThespian,Discussion,"So, a couple of months ago I was in a position to purchase both the Creative Energy precon and the SCIENCE! precon decks, so I did so with the aim of merging them and modifying what came out into a deck based around the use of Energy, something I‚Äôd been planning ever since the original Kaladesh set was first released.  I built the deck with [[Satya, Aetherflux Genius]] as the Commander, as I felt that both [[Liberty Prime, Recharged]] and [[Dr. Madison Li]] (the only other three-colour Commander options that actually generated and/or used Energy counters themselves) were more Artifact Commanders with a sideline in Energy.  I‚Äôve played four games with this deck and won two of them, but I‚Äôve had fun with it in all four games.

Now Wizards are releasing the new Living Energy precon deck, in Temur colours, with two new Commander options in [[Saheeli, Radiant Creator]] and [[Pia Nalaar, Chief Mechanic]], making me second guess my choice to stay with Jeskai.  Here are my thoughts on the five Commanders presented here:

* Satya seems to me like the best overall ‚ÄúEnergy‚Äù Commander, in that he creates Energy and uses Energy with no caveats other than needing to attack.  And with Menace and Toughness 5, he usually survives the Attack Step as long as I'm careful.  His ability also can go infinite with a couple of other cards such as [[Port Razer]] and [[Lightning Runner]] and whilst that‚Äôs not the primary way I‚Äôd like to win, it‚Äôs always nice to have combos in the deck to end long games.

* Liberty Prime, as mentioned above, feels like more of an Artifact Commander.  Even though he needs Energy to survive blocking or attacking, due to his Tap ability it feels like he needs to be leading an Artifact deck to make the best use of it as sacrificing Artifacts is the only way he makes Energy himself.  Since I want this to be an ‚ÄúEnergy‚Äù deck, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a great idea to have him lead this deck.

* Similarly, Madison Li only generates Energy when I cast Artifacts.  Even though she is has several useful Tap abilities that require the spending on Energy, as she only generates Energy when I cast Artifacts, it again feels like she‚Äôs more of an Artifact Commander as I need them to make Energy with her.

* Oddly enough, Pia Nalaar also feels like an Artifact Commander, seeing as she generates Energy from having Artifact Creatures deal combat damage to players.  The fact that all she does with her Energy is creating Vehicles, albeit evasive and potentially very large ones that will also generate more Energy in the future, also makes me think that her deck would also be an Artifact deck.

* On the other hand, Saheeli can generate Energy without Artifacts, and as there are currently 138 other Artificers in her colour combination, it feels like I could make her deck work without an Artifact focus.  Like Satya, she makes token copies of things I control, though hers are guaranteed to go away at the end of the turn, but she can also copy non-Creatures, making me wonder what combos I could create with her.

With this in mind, my preferred Commander choices are Satya and Saheeli.  I think I'd be happy with a deck built around either of these cards.

Ignoring the specific Commander, is there any particular Energy-related reason I should choose White over Green or vice versa?  White has some nice cards that I‚Äôve already seen in action including [[Aetherstom Roc]], [[Localized Destruction]], [[Razorfield Ripper]] (which won me one of my two wins), and [[Wrath of the Skies]], as well as several I‚Äôd like to try but don‚Äôt own copies of yet, including [[Emissary of Soulfire]], [[Guide of Souls]], [[Suppression Ray]], and [[Voltstorm Angel]].  I‚Äôve not played any games with Green yet, but some cards that look nice include [[Aetherwind Basker]], [[Architect of the Untamed]], [[Nissa, Worldsoul Speaker]], and [[Primal Prayers]].

Thanks in advance for anyone who helps me with this."

Tokenization could enhance transparency and 24-hour trading, but it depends on regulatory updates. This shift might challenge stablecoins by offering digital assets tied to real-world interest rates and could impact DeFi platforms by introducing traditional asset classes. However, tokenized securities face regulatory hurdles, and BlackRock's interest in tokenization could influence market dynamics.

Why Are We Ignoring 273 Million MWh of Clean Energy Every Year?,EdmaNetwork,1i95tvk,2025-01-24 15:58:41,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdmaNetwork/comments/1i95tvk/why_are_we_ignoring_273_million_mwh_of_clean/,Edmanetwork,,"Every year, 25 million households with solar panels generate over 273 million MWh of clean energy. By 2030, this number will grow to 100 million households‚Äîa massive opportunity to reshape the renewable energy and compliance markets.

But here‚Äôs the issue: these households are being completely ignored by the compliance and voluntary markets for carbon credits, renewable energy certificates (RECs), and certificates of origin.

What‚Äôs going wrong?
1. Lack of Accessibility: Smaller producers like households don‚Äôt have the resources or systems to participate in the compliance market.

2. Complex Bureaucracy: The process of converting clean energy into tradeable certificates is tedious, expensive, and tailored for large corporations.

3. Market Opacity: The carbon credit and REC markets are plagued by a lack of transparency, making it difficult for new contributors to participate.

4. Missed Potential: The renewable energy sector struggles to meet demand for carbon credits and certificates, while millions of small energy producers are left out of the equation.

Why does this matter?

- If these households could tokenize their energy production and generate certificates of origin or carbon credits, they could play a critical role in meeting global ESG goals.

- Both compliance and voluntary markets could benefit from a decentralized, transparent supply of credits and certificates, addressing the growing demand for sustainability.

- Smaller contributors like households could finally participate in the market without being excluded by high costs or complicated processes.

What‚Äôs the solution?

We need a system that simplifies compliance for everyone, from small households to large-scale producers. A transparent platform that converts clean energy into certificates and enables trading on a global scale could unlock the full potential of millions of producers.

It feels like the current system is failing both producers and the compliance market. What do you think? Are we doing enough to include small-scale contributors in the renewable energy economy? Let‚Äôs discuss! üå±"

Why I Believe Saitama Reborn is Massively Undervalued,AllCryptoBets,1i931ce,2025-01-24 13:59:40,12,0.88,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllCryptoBets/comments/1i931ce/why_i_believe_saitama_reborn_is_massively/,Exotic-Midnight-6028,Memecoin,"# My Journey in Crypto

I began trading cryptocurrency around mid-2023, diving headfirst into what has been an exhilarating yet often frustrating journey. Early on, I dedicated countless hours to research‚Äîreading whitepapers, analyzing roadmaps, and trying to make calculated decisions. While I managed a few small wins, my tendency to rotate into other projects too quickly often erased any gains I made.

Time and again, I would sell tokens for modest profits, only to watch them skyrocket after I exited. These missed opportunities taught me a hard lesson about the dangers of over-rotation and the importance of patience in investing.

After enduring several cycles of frustration, I pivoted towards meme coins. At first, I thought I‚Äôd found my niche, but even this sector wasn‚Äôt without its challenges. Rug pulls, exorbitant gas fees, and overtrading continued to hinder my progress. I knew I had to refine my approach if I wanted to succeed.

# The Unique Appeal of Meme Coins

Meme coins are unlike any other asset class in the crypto space. What started with Dogecoin as a joke has evolved into a phenomenon, driven by communities that rally around humor, shared beliefs, and a sense of belonging. These coins tap into a unique psychology‚Äîparticularly among younger generations‚Äîwhere financial investments become a form of social identity.

According to Murad, a prominent expert in the field, meme coins are poised for a ‚Äúsupercycle‚Äù in 2025. This prediction is rooted in the idea that Gen Z and Millennials are drawn to strong communities and cult-like followings that offer more than just financial returns. For many, meme coins represent a fun and engaging way to participate in the crypto revolution, blending investment with entertainment and collective identity.

# The Power of Communities in Crypto

In the world of meme coins, communities are everything. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, where utility and technology often take center stage, the success of a meme coin depends heavily on its ability to foster a passionate and loyal following.

Strong communities act as the backbone of a project, helping it weather market dips and setbacks. These groups, often referred to as ""hardcore holders"" or ""cult-like believers,"" are fiercely committed to their chosen token. They don‚Äôt just hold through turbulence‚Äîthey actively promote, defend, and grow the project. This sense of unity and shared purpose can make or break a meme coin.

# Why Saitama Reborn Stands Out

In my search for a meme coin with a strong community, I came across **Saitama Inu Reborn**. This project is the successor to the original **Saitama Inu**, which was one of the most iconic meme coins of 2021. At its peak, Saitama Inu reached a market cap of **$7 billion**, **becoming the third-largest meme coin in the world and boasting over 350,000 holders**. Its community, known as the ""Wolfpack,"" was legendary for its passion and dedication.

However, like so many projects in the crypto space, Saitama Inu fell victim to bad actors. The original developers betrayed their community, orchestrating a rug pull that left investors devastated. The fallout was so severe that the FBI intervened, arresting the developers for fraud and market manipulation.

But from the ashes of this betrayal, **Saitama Reborn** emerged. This isn‚Äôt just a new project‚Äîit‚Äôs a revival of one of the most passionate communities in crypto history. For me, Saitama Reborn is more than an investment opportunity; it‚Äôs a powerful statement against fraudulent developers and a testament to the resilience of dedicated communities.

# Why I Believe in Saitama Reborn

Currently, Saitama Reborn has faced a significant dip, falling from its all-time high of $13 million to a market cap of around $800,000. While this might deter some investors, I see it as an opportunity. The Wolfpack community continues to show resilience, working tirelessly to rebuild trust and momentum.

This aligns with a broader truth about life and investing: struggle leads to growth. Whether in markets or personal development, challenges are what make us stronger and wiser. Saitama Reborn embodies this principle, showing that even in the face of adversity, a strong community can rebuild and thrive.

Given its history, I believe Saitama Reborn has the potential to reclaim its former glory. If it were to reach its previous market cap of $7 billion, this would represent a staggering 7,000x increase from its current valuation.

Before investing in any meme coin, it‚Äôs crucial to do your own research and avoid chasing hype or green candles. Meme coins thrive on belief, community, and long-term commitment. Saitama Reborn stands out because it represents more than just financial gain‚Äîit‚Äôs a movement, a comeback story, and a rallying point for those who believe in the power of collective effort.

For anyone considering an investment, I encourage you to think beyond the short-term gains. Saitama Reborn is a project worth holding onto, not just during the highs but also through the storms. Stop trading and start believing‚Äîbecause in crypto, and in life, it‚Äôs the believers who ultimately win.

3. To minimize risk, some traders focus on higher-cap memecoins listed on reputable exchanges, and use tools like Dex Screener to audit token contracts and holder distributions.

# A trader's guide to memecoins üíª

Memecoins, though often launched as such, are no joke.¬†

On the surface, these lighthearted projects with seemingly no utility may seem fundamentally useless. In reality, they make up billions of dollars‚Äô worth of market capitalization, bringing together global communities of millions of users who rally around a shared vision.

As memecoins live and die on their memetic appeal and community spirit, they‚Äôre highly volatile ‚Äî even compared to other cryptocurrencies. As such, caution must be exercised when trading them.¬†

This article will outline the best practices for doing so.  


# Where to trade memecoins üìç

Unsurprisingly, memecoins like¬†[Dogecoin (DOGE)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-dogecoin-doge),¬†[Pepe (PEPE)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/buy-pepe-pepe)¬†do not originate on centralized exchanges, but often find their way there after gaining significant traction.

Instead, these tokens are more commonly found on blockchain networks like Ethereum and Solana, and traded on decentralized exchanges like¬†[Uniswap](http://uniswap.org/)¬†and¬†[Jupiter](http://jup.ag/). Anyone can access these trading venues with a non-custodial wallet such as¬†[Kraken Wallet](https://www.kraken.com/wallet).

# Key considerations for memecoin trading üßê

As with any investment,¬†[doing your own research (DYOR)](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-is-dyor)¬†is strongly recommended prior to diving into any memecoin trade. Granted, this can be difficult with many, due to a lack of available resources for newer projects.

Remember that¬†**memecoins rarely have any utility**. Instead, they gain value based on the popularity of the meme and an active community behind them, who act as de facto marketers ‚Äî taking to social media platforms to share memes and content about the project in hopes of attracting new investors.

This dynamic underscores the need for caution: with the tools available today, it‚Äôs easy for bad actors to ‚Äòastroturf‚Äô on social media ‚Äî making it appear as though the community is much larger than it is. To audit a project yourself, you‚Äôll want to spend some time in its community hangouts (X, Telegram, Discord) to get a feel for its strength.¬†

An example of a potential red flag is an¬†[LP (liquidity provider) token](https://www.kraken.com/learn/what-are-liquidity-provider-lp-tokens)¬†that hasn‚Äôt been burned. The renouncement of this token is a good faith gesture that the developer will not rug pull its users, which can provide a degree of confidence in the project. More on this in the next section.

For more information on rug pulls, check out our Kraken Learn Center guide,¬†[How to stay safe in DeFi](https://www.kraken.com/learn/how-to-stay-safe-in-defi).

A tool like¬†[Dex Screener](http://dexscreener.com/)¬†or¬†[Birdeye](http://birdeye.so/)¬†can provide valuable insights prior to purchase. Some important things worth checking out include:

* **Holder distribution:**¬†a single entity holding the majority of the token supply is risky, as a sudden sell-off could cause prices to crash.
* **Website and socials:**¬†take a look at the project‚Äôs Telegram group and website to gauge the (organic) community support for the token.
* **LP status:**¬†as mentioned earlier, has the LP token been renounced? If it hasn‚Äôt, the developer could drain the liquidity pool at any moment.
* **Token contract:**¬†can new tokens be minted (diluting the existing supply) or frozen (preventing users from selling)?



# Managing risks in memecoin trading üìö

Unfortunately, the memecoin space is rife with scams that can catch out even the most seasoned traders.¬†

Risk can be mitigated, to a degree, by sticking to higher-cap offerings listed on reputable exchanges: the exchange is likely to have performed its own assessment of the project prior to listing, and the memecoin is probably established enough that the actions of a single bad actor may not massively impact it. This does not, however, protect it from unexpected exploits or reputational damage that could cause the price to tank.

For non-listed memecoins, risks range from deliberate, malicious rug pulls to simple lack of interest from users. The end state is the same for both cases: following a sharp decline in price, a lack of liquidity makes the tokens untradable.¬†

The former is a common scenario with tokens launched by coin creators with no prior reputation. Launching a token requires no technical skill due to the availability of off-the-shelf tools, making it easy for bad actors to spin up these scams. Again, an LP burn can signal to the community that the developers are committed to the project, as they cannot withdraw liquidity without the LP token.  


# Tips for successful memecoin trading üìñ

Memecoins are highly volatile assets in an already volatile market. Predicting their trajectory is impossible, as even the most promising projects can fail due to wider trends in the financial/crypto markets.

As such, any investment should be undertaken with an understanding of the very real risk that¬†**the coin could lose the entirety of its value**. Many recommend against placing all of your eggs in one basket, instead diversifying across other cryptocurrencies and financial assets in case of loss.

Identifying successful memecoins requires time and immersion in the crypto space ‚Äî ideally via Twitter and Telegram groups. This will allow you to identify interesting projects early and to catch them prior to widespread adoption.

Trump Signs Executive Order to Revolutionize U.S. Crypto Policy,Junior_Stocks,1i8ycub,2025-01-24 10:45:22,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Junior_Stocks/comments/1i8ycub/trump_signs_executive_order_to_revolutionize_us/,JuniorStocksCom,,"Original Article: [https://www.juniorstocks.com/trump-signs-executive-order-to-revolutionize-u-s-crypto-policy](https://www.juniorstocks.com/trump-signs-executive-order-to-revolutionize-u-s-crypto-policy)

*Trump's Executive Order Sets the Stage for a New Era in U.S. Cryptocurrency Regulation*

https://preview.redd.it/8b115xjvpyee1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b1312a226fcfa7f963e4560a56218369976fc64

In a decisive move, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on January 23, 2025, establishing a cryptocurrency working group tasked with drafting new regulations for digital assets and exploring the feasibility of a national cryptocurrency stockpile. This action underscores Trump's commitment to reshaping the U.S. approach to digital asset policy, a key promise during his campaign.

The order also emphasizes safeguarding banking services for crypto companies, responding to longstanding complaints from the industry about restricted access to financial institutions. Additionally, it explicitly bans the creation of a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC), reflecting Trump‚Äôs skepticism about government-issued digital currencies that could rival existing cryptocurrencies.

**A Game-Changer for Crypto Policy**

The working group, which will include top officials like the Treasury secretary and the chairs of the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has been directed to develop a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. This includes addressing the status of stablecoins, a critical component of the digital asset ecosystem.

Notably, the executive order signals a marked departure from the crypto policies of the previous administration under President Joe Biden. While Biden-era regulators sought to rein in the industry with legal actions against companies like Coinbase and Binance, Trump‚Äôs approach aims to foster innovation and boost the U.S. as a global leader in digital assets.

**Protecting Banking Services for Crypto Companies**

One of the most significant aspects of the order is its directive to ensure that crypto companies retain access to banking services. For years, crypto firms have accused U.S. regulators of pressuring banks to sever ties with the industry, a claim that has been repeatedly denied by regulators. Trump's executive order sets a clear tone that the new administration will support crypto companies in securing essential financial services.

Nathan McCauley, CEO of Anchorage Digital, described the move as ""a sea change in U.S. digital asset policy,"" emphasizing the administration's commitment to clarity and consistency in crypto regulations.

**National Cryptocurrency Stockpile: A Revolutionary Idea**

The executive order introduces the concept of a national digital asset stockpile, potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by federal law enforcement. While details remain sparse, the initiative could be implemented through the U.S. Treasury‚Äôs Exchange Stabilization Fund.

Legal experts remain divided on whether congressional approval is necessary to establish such a reserve. Some analysts argue that this stockpile could enhance the U.S.'s ability to stabilize markets and bolster its strategic position in the digital asset space.

**Bitcoin Hits New Highs Amid Regulatory Optimism**

The market has responded enthusiastically to Trump's crypto-friendly policies. Bitcoin surged to an all-time high of $109,071 earlier this week, fueled by investor optimism about the administration‚Äôs support for digital assets. Although prices dipped slightly to $103,000 by Thursday afternoon, the upward momentum remains strong.

**SEC Reverses Costly Crypto Asset Guidance**

Adding to the industry‚Äôs relief, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rescinded controversial accounting guidance that previously made it expensive for companies to safeguard crypto assets. This change could remove a significant barrier to institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies.

The executive order comes just days after the SEC announced the creation of a task force to overhaul crypto policy. Together, these moves signal a coordinated effort to integrate digital assets into the mainstream U.S. financial system

**The Road Ahead: Regulatory Clarity and Innovation**

Trump‚Äôs order sets the stage for a regulatory overhaul that could finally address the crypto industry‚Äôs long-standing grievances. By clarifying the legal status of crypto tokens as securities, commodities, or other classifications, the administration aims to establish a stable and predictable environment for innovation.

Senator Tim Scott, chair of the Senate Banking Committee, praised the initiative, saying, ""Just days into his administration, President Trump is delivering on his promises to keep the United States a leader in digital assets innovation.""

**Conclusion**

President Trump‚Äôs executive order represents a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency policy in the United States. By prioritizing regulatory clarity, protecting banking access for crypto companies, and exploring innovative ideas like a national digital asset stockpile, the administration is signaling its commitment to fostering growth in the digital asset industry.

With the crypto market already reacting positively, these measures could redefine the U.S.'s role as a global leader in digital asset innovation."

The snake wif hat telegram was hit by a report attack by unfriendly actors and the original group was banned on telegram but a new group is up and I will share the link to our website where you can find our telegram below! This dev team and community is as tight knit as I have ever seen and are completely unfazed by these malicious actors. Come join us (again)!

In other news, we are within 6 days of the year of the snake and the dev team has a VERY big announcement to make before the beginning of the Chinese new year! They have mentioned before that this news was huge enough to put our next CEX listing on delay until after the announcement as well as the rebrand and website update. This bullish news will be announced within the next 6 days and according to a dev could be big enough to send us to all time highs. 

I am uncertain what kind of announcement this will be (feel free to speculate in the comments!) I feel as if it is a rather large collaboration with either another community or project in the real world! 

The community also continues to grow! We are approaching 2,600 Reddit followers and have gained nearly 100 in the last week alone. This growth has been brought on by a weibo account launch and advertisements being ran there to boost us in Asian countries before the year of the snake begins! There is also a mandarin speaking telegram only for any members of the community who would like to join there!

&nbsp;

The wait was agonizing.

They had all heard the commotion when the councillor arrived, and now, it was only a matter of time before Nako retrieved them for First Official Contact.

Jasmine was pacing to calm her nerves, practicing breathing in and out and going over the plan she, Xant and Itsuki had devised amongst themselves. Questions to ask, demands to make, subtleties and nuances of alien culture she had learned were all about to be put to the test.

There couldn‚Äôt be any room for doubt.

Spades sat beside Beau, the large man had a hand over his partners head, gently running his fingers through the fur. They had plenty of practice waiting, lost in thoughts far beyond the confines of the room, while he would have preferred to talk, he couldn‚Äôt let his emotions get ahead of himself or anyone else.

Itsuki finished the last knot of ribbon around a wooden box, fiddling and fussing the elaborate fabric until it was deemed ‚Äòpresentable‚Äô. A small token they had agreed upon, since even in the depths of space, it felt uncomfortable coming empty handed to such an occasion.

Xant pried his eyes away from the door, the anticipation was driving half of him to irritation, while the other longed for the days of his stoicness. Humility and reservation, it was not his place to have ‚Äòloud‚Äô emotions today.

Xant offered Jasmine a cold glass of water, she took it graciously, but barely took a sip when they all felt the chilled air of the lieutenants arrival.

Jasmine‚Äôs nerves flared, but Xant‚Äôs hand over hers brought her back down.

‚ÄúEven presence,‚Äù he reminded her, and she half smiled.

‚ÄúCalm thoughts,‚Äù she replied.

Beau stood up, reaching for the faceless helmet that accompanied the suit.

‚ÄúYour time to shine,‚Äù He prompted her, before clasping the unwieldy armour over his face, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try to keep my simmer down,‚Äù Despite the request made to the Engine lord to make their helmets exactly the same as diagrams provided, Viitoic had insisted the design was incompatible with the galactic safety standards. There was no visor, and no meaningful way to turn his head, once the helmet was connected to the suit the organic cameras on the outside became his eyes. He could see everything around and behind him, it made him feel like a walking tank, an ugly tank, but a tank none the less.

Itsuki tucked the wooden box under his arm, and adjusted the alien sword at his hip.

‚ÄúReady when you are, Sunshine,‚Äù he stated without sarcasm.

Jasmine nodded, affording herself one last sigh before heading for the door.

Closing her eyes, she could get a better feel for those outside the room, Rynard‚Äôs relaxed bravado unwavering while the fresh chill of the Lieutenant felt like cracking ice.

‚ÄúIt feels like he‚Äôs waiting outside,‚Äù she whispered allowed, and he felt just as nervous as she did. Jasmine turned back to face her friends, all of them waiting for her orders, so she put on a brave face and a warm glow, ‚Äúlets go make first contact,‚Äù

-*-

Counillor Kaalijorn looked rather disparagingly at the room, despite the hours the attendants had, there was just no way to restore millenia old steel in a day.

The conference room had been bare, since Kotorn took most of his meetings in his own office, the space had been spared the physical damage but suffered from abandonment and neglect. Even with added wall coverings and floor rugs, the best Kaalijorn could do was make sure it was clean, neutral space, devoid of any obnoxious odors.

It had crossed their mind, several times infact, to hold such an occasion upon their own ship, the surroundings would have been more comfortable for everyone involved, but then that would have undermined the security and secrecy. It was not a good idea to be outnumbered by an alien species in an advanced stealth ship.

Several tables and stools stood beside the infloor holoprojector, their own data uploaded to it and synced so that should the need arise the councilor could pull files with a simple command. Speeches and holovids prepared to show off the glory of the Galactic Council and the great boons they would receive upon their admission were all prepared before he even left Clentessia. Kaalijorn chuckled to themself, despite being the ‚Äòambassidor‚Äô they was really only there to help the fledgling species navigate the endless contracts of citizenship.

And from the Esaander reports, he might not even need to explain that much of the legal work at all. How thrilling, to meet a species understanding of bureaucratic decorum.

The quiet contemplation was interrupted by the pinging of an attendants comms. Kaalijorn motioned for the tall, graceful Savori pair to allow his guests in as they took their position for greeting.

They had studied the materials on humans for the last weeks before arrival, but feeling them in person was, indeed, a completely different matter. They far surpassed the presence of the Lieutenant commander escorting them, distinct and ever shifting, the councilor tried to compose themself before the doors opened but being in the same room only caused further stumbling.

Sir Tar Nako, the arvas Lieutenant acted as announcer, but dressed as though he were receiving the councillor himself. Kaalijorn‚Äôs fins twitched as the young soldier presnted a salute.

Fridged air was his signature, the favoured calling of tactious Princes, ruthlessness behind a professional mask.

‚ÄúYour eminence!‚Äù Sir Tar Nako bowed, ‚ÄúMay I present; Namegiver Jasmine Anne Howe and her entourage,‚Äù Nako quickly and expertly side stepped to reveal the smaller aliens behind his flourishing cape ‚ÄúSir‚Äôs Sargent Beau Mathews, Sugawara Itsuki, Captain Rynard Derjan, Captain Spades and Doctor Uru‚ÄôNav Xant,‚Äù

The pleasant aura of a solar lamp warmed his blue skin, and although they heard it many times, the humans voice carried an air of regality they did not posess over the audfiles. She bowed respectfully.

‚ÄúCouncillor Kaalijorn,‚Äù her entourage followed after her, bowing in turn, ‚Äúthank you for hosting us,‚Äù

Kaalijorn slowly returned the bow, regaining his composure upon becoming upright.

Their impressions of the humans already shifting, they had expected inexperienced yet eager individuals, not the coordinated and poised collection before them now.

They had integrated considerably in the short months since ‚Äòarriving‚Äô.

‚ÄúNamegiver Jasmine, and Entourage,‚Äù Kaalijorn greeted, turning to offer them a seat, ‚ÄúWelcome to The Galactic Councills 138 sector Military Branch, please, take which ever arrangement suits your standard,‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you councillor,‚Äù Jasmine acknowledged, ‚Äúbut before we begin the formal proceedings,‚Äù she gave a mere glance to the smaller of her kind, ‚Äúit is customary for human delegations to bring a gift, as a token of respect and a hope that we can foster a friendship in the times to come,‚Äù

Kaalijorn clicked his toothplate unexpectedly, as the smaller human, dressed in a scientist coat offered him a glimmering wooden box. An attendant was quick to rush forward and take it from the human's hands, but stalled once the box was in his possession, the Kitarian was staring at the human with wide golden eyes, then, shaking, as if overcome from simply being too close. The male humans freq was chilling, crisp, but filled with a subtle sense of‚Ä¶ despair. Kaalijorn, quickly, accepted the box from his attendant, allowing the poor creature to return to their place behind him.

The box was heavy in his hands, polished and lacquered to show off the intense cellular structure of the woods grain. Beautiful.

‚ÄúA most generous offering Namegiver, the council appreciates the forethought,‚Äù

The human accepted their reply but turned a sympathetic eye to the poor attendant, before finding a seat for herself.

Kaalijorn‚Äôs webbed fingers curled around the box, from the females warm sunlamp to the males chill of an airlock, they‚Äôd have to watch how quickly their Frequencies interacted with their own, perfectly balanced personality.

Curiously, the councillor sat down at the table, studying at a glance his negotiators to be, they arranged themselves in the exact order they had walked in, they had been given extensive equtitte training and followed it, which was impressive for such a short amount of time.

Kaalijorn counted an alarming amount of pleats in the armoured human's cape, his face completely covered so he couldn't see the difference in phenotype, but the body shape was obvious. The user-level species, who had been given a captains designation sat patiently and obediently at his feet, the number of pleats in his cape, however, should certainly not have been the case, causing the councillor to frown.

The smaller, colder feeling human chose to focus his piercing eyes at his attendant's feet, hand covering his face so only his eyes were visible, glancing as subtly as the councillors own around the room. The white coat suggested he was of scientist‚Äôs build, but his head was the same size as his maidens.

The Sulin Knight stood up against the back wall, knowing his presence was not needed, except for the human's request, but curiously, the Zenthi doctor, sat at the table with the humans‚Ä¶

Nako stood at the door, while he was the escort he was not included in the discussion, the arvas was probably wary of his standing and behaving for good measure-

‚ÄúCouncillor?‚Äù Namegiver Jasmine spoke, snapping him from his reconnaissance, ‚Äúare you going to open the gift?‚Äù

Kaalijorn turned to look at the box.

‚ÄúThe box is not the gift?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is, but, there is a token inside,‚Äù she smiled, a bright glow of anticipation.

Kaalijorn studied the object and tugged at the thin blue fabric, the delicate wisp of ribbon fell aside allowing the contents inside to be revealed.

A strange trinket indeed.

A clear, glass bottle, the length of his arm and double the thickness, lay atop gold stands, yet inside there sat a fully realised replica vessel of ancient design. Kaalijorn sat there stunned, the longer they looked at the thing the more detail they noticed, an exhausting feat of engineering.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù they began, but the words and polite manner did not want to co-operate. Sensing the councillor's discomfort, the zenthi doctor spoke up.

‚ÄúIt is purely decorative, your eminence,‚Äù the swell of a river followed his words, ‚Äúhumans prefer to be surrounded by aesthetically pleasing things,‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's symbolic too,‚Äù the Namegiver added, ‚Äúthe galleons sailed the unknown oceans in search of a safe harbour, just as we,(humanity) are searching for our own,‚Äù

Kaalijorn gulped, hearing the ‚Äòsecondary‚Äô layer of human voice poking through the translator‚Äôs filter. The thought and care put into the gift and their meeting alone was unprecedented, so often when speaking with a new peoples the council would have to talk down, simply and while the situation was delicate and unprecedented, he did not need to speak down to the species infront of him. Perhaps, this would be a new dynasty defining moment in more ways than one.

‚ÄúThe council offers sanctuary to all those who seek it,‚Äù the councillor gestured to their attendants, the lights were lowered, the aud-recording prepared, ‚ÄúNamegiver Jasmine, shall we begin the proceedings?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes councillor, we are ready,‚Äù

Councilor Kaalijorn: It is 1030 [hours] on the 142nd [day] the second quarter of [year] 306, Rejuvenation Dynasty. I Councillor Kaalijorn will preside over the formal first contact between the galactic council and the new species, Humanity and Dogs, please state your names and titles as a matter of record.

Namegiver Jasmine: Namegiver Jasmine Anne Howe, 

Itsuki: Sugawara Itsuki

Sargent Beau: Sargent Beau Mathews, 

Captain Spades: Captain Spades, Friend of Namegivers

[Councilors notes: The Holomap of the entire Galactic council territory was displayed for the humans, they reacted rather nonchalantly, probably used to the holoprojectors during their stay amongst Galactic Council Military.]

Councilor Kaalijorn: the galactic council envelops 53 planets, 142 stations and serves the needs of 40 billion citizens. 12 species with over 60 variants we are a harmonious civilisation aiming for excellence and rebuilding to the height of the Prosperous dynasty. As a joining member, you will be promised your own homeworld for internal affairs and access to the entire galactic Civ-net, logistics network and the protection of the Council Rangers. As a creator level intelligence, you will receive a seat at the council and have a nominated candidate for councillor. Contribution accreditation will be evaluated and given a score to participate within the economy and live your lives in perpetual comfort. I am here to guide you through the entire process, and I am sure you have many questions.

[Councilor Kaalijorn rises from their stool and approached the hologram.]

Councilor Kaalijorn: Namegiver, would you care to add your homeworld to our map?‚Äù

Namegiver Jasmine: [Sad/Embarressed] I‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ Humanity is not yet a star-faring species, I couldn't tell you where Earth would even be‚Ä¶

[Councilors notes: One of Humanity‚Äôs unique traits amongst Creator-Level intelligences is the ability to communicate complex emotions even after going through the translator filter. Such a strong sense of self is important for Commander units.]

Itsuki: I can.

Sargent Beau: [Shocked] What?!

Namegiver Jasmine: [Surprised] What??
 
Itsuki: [happy/confident/annoyed] I know where Earth is on the galaxy map.

Sargent Beau: [confused] What? How? Why?

Itsuki: [Shrugs] you know, ‚Äòjust in case‚Äô.

[Itsuki stares at the map, raising his hands to the holograph]

Itsuki: councilor, can you zoom out? 

[councilors notes: this was unexpected, with the exception of the Sulin, no species since joining the Council has been able to point out their home planet, even the Arvas though space fairing, did not have the technology to map star systems beyond unaugmented vision.]

[holomap zoomed out to show the entire branch of the galaxy]

Itsuki: No like, zoom all the way out, I need to see the whole of the [milky way]

[councilors notes: The smaller human took a few minutes of deliberation, focusing on the outer stars of the galaxy. Eventually pointing to a cluster on the opposite galaxy arm, uncharted even from before the Painful Dynasty Record Purge.]


Itsuki: [confidently] There, roughly, give or take a few thousand light-years,‚Äù

Sargent Beau: [Excited/Jubelant] And you‚Äôre sure? You‚Äôre absolutely sure?!

Itsuki: [Confident] 90% sure, I mean, [hesitant] the pictures taken from the opposite end of the galaxy but‚Ä¶ yeah.

Councilor Kaalijorn: If you‚Äôre sure it is in that direction, it should not take more than, 15 [years] to make the necessary journey.

 Itsuki : [shocked] 15 years? That‚Äôs all?... 

Namegiver Jasmine: [Relief/Excitment] It‚Äôs so close‚Ä¶I thought‚Ä¶ I thought we‚Äôd never get back home‚Ä¶

Itsuki : [confused/incredious] Why would you think that? I thought your first instinct would be to find your way back?

Namegiver Jasmine: [Anger/Dissapointment] The Rajava harvest planets and people, if Earth had survived, or [sadness] red buttoned the invasion, everyone and everything I knew would have been gone anyway‚Ä¶ [relief] Thought I was hundreds of millions of lightyears away but now‚Ä¶

[councilors notes: I have never felt such a strong and quick reaction, so much freq blasting in such intensity so quickly. My assistants nearly all succumbed to VFS. particularly Namegiver Jasmine and Sargent Beau]

Namegiver Jasmine: [Determination/Confidence] Councillor, we are humbled by the council's most generous of offerings, but I‚Äôm afraid we will not be acknowledging citizenship contracts today.

Councilor Kaalijorn: [shocked] y-you won't? I was under the impression you, that is to say, Namegiver Jasmine, were ready to commence proceedings, at least that is what your Audfile Transcripts indicated.

Jasmine: [polite/diplomatic/commanding] Yes, I was, but circumstances have changed, this new information has come to light and it would be morally and legally irresponsible of me to proceed without consulting my companions and confirming additional concerns about the Council and its ongoings. With our home planet so close it would not be right for us to make decisions encompassing Humanity and the remaining species of Earth. 

Councilor Kaalijorn: [caught off guard] O-of course; is there anything you have particular concerns about? Surely you would be the most qualified to make these decisions having been living amongst the people of the council for the longest-

Namegiver Jasmine: [polite/diplomatic/commanding] No. Humanity is no stranger to the complexity and morality of the law. ‚ÄòDo not sign anything you don‚Äôt understand‚Äô is the first lesson humans learn about law. I want to thank you councilor for your patience in this whole fiasco but unfortunately, while your citizen and military personnel have been most generous hosts, the short few months during mine and my companions stay have highlighted several conflicts of interests between our two parties. Our cultures are very different and while we eager to broker a peace between us, there may be some aspects that neither us will be able to reconcile without further discussion. While I have done my best to keep this diplomatic, neither I nor my companions are qualified to broker this new peace between our peoples. 

Councilor Kaalijorn: Conflicts of interests? Namegiver, the Council has offered you everything you have requested and more. Acknowledging the contracts is more a formality and once they are agreed to and you are welcomed into the community, there is nothing we couldn‚Äôt provide. In terms of assets ships, stations, planets‚Ä¶ in terms of immaterial, we can offer physical rejuvenation, planetary tours, and judiciary powers within government. I fail to see what would be such a large conflict of interest that your people would not forgive you for speaking without them.

Itsuki: Genetic engineering is taboo.

Councilor: oh. Yes, I remember you saying it was a fledgling science-

Itsuki: [Concern/Contempt] not a fledgling science, a forbidden one. We have mapped the genome and identified numerous genetic diseases, cured a few even, but to tamper directly with human DNA directly? Then that would lead us down the dark road that you are currently on, and are desperately seeking to get away from. 

[Councilors notes: Namegiver‚Äôs subordinates speak out of turn, humans while they do have a designated leader it seems to be more of a consensus then a direct line of authority. They all act independently of one another even when possessing a translator.]

Councilor: but the opportunities provided to you should your genetic material be made available to the council are exponential.  New materials in the hands of our geneticists can reverse the many limitations we currently suffer in the reproduction and healing process.
The preliminary studies of your cohesive structures could save the qzetillian race, like myself, from genetic decay, humanity would be giving trillions of new lives a brighter future.  

Beau: [anger/disgust/insulted] ***No***.

[councilors notes: The military model human barely speaks but his commands are very confronting. The other humans and the User companion, while startled by his contribution recover quickly from the command.]

Jasmine: [polite/firm/diplomatic] councilor, it makes me happy to hear you are open for discussion, but we cannot make any promises at this time. We need to recess, discuss and reconvene. 

Councilor: New technology can seem scary and confronting to those who do not understand it but I truly believe you are overstating the dangers-

Jasmine: [incredulous/defensive] Counilor, I‚Äôm not sure you understand it. My companions experienced first-hand what the technology looks like and I wouldn‚Äôt describe it as a bright future.

Itsuki: [anger/disgust] We were imprisoned at a corporate station, they were using our DNA to make homunculi, trying to splice human DNA with alien. Even with all your experience and tech it didn't work, they had thousands of failed experiments kept in refrigeration!

Beau: [Repulsed/disgusted] ***and they were still alive and suffering‚Ä¶***

Councilor: [disbelief] I‚Ä¶ was not informed Kyu-Kage corporation was conducting unauthorised R&D research on unsanctioned genetic material. There will be a formal investigation into their conduct within the market. But if you truly do not want to negotiate then I‚Äôm not sure how much further we can extend our hospitality.

[Councilors notes: humans, it seems, having no prior experience with Freq are very sensitive to tone shifts and vocabulary. The wrong wording can set off threats the speaker had no intention of implying.]

Namegiver Jasmine: [concerned/nervous] We‚Äôre not finished with negotiations Councilor, we just need time to discuss- 

Sargent Beau: ***[loathing/anger] ‚Ä¶***

Itsuki: [appalled/confrontionational] So you‚Äôd make us destitute within council space for retaining our genetic autonomy?!

Councilor: Not destitute no, every citizen within the sphere is kept to a minimum standard of living, food, shelter, hygienic facilities health care, all provided for, but the amount of deficit you have accumulated under the good Lieutenant‚Äôs account would be enough to destroy all of his equity‚Ä¶and more. If you refuse to acknowledge the citizenship contracts then you can no longer exist at the standard of accommodation you are at now.

Sargent Beau: ***[Loathing/Replused/fury] ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶***

Jasmine: [Pleading/insulted/diplomatic]Councilor, my companions and I want to help, we do, but we can't hand over our genetic rights without proper consultation, and threatening us with our benefactor‚Äôs wellbeing is not the way to broker trust between us.

Councilor: it was by no means supposed to be a threat Namegiver, i am simply stating the facts. Without citizenship you and your user-level intelligence species are relegated to being the Lieutenant‚Äôs assets. your companions were responsible for an estimated 35% destruction of the entire progenitor companies output. And since Kyu-Kage are the primary producer of citizen and military assets for the sector that accounts for nearly 13 thousand [years] worth of lost productivity and of lost lives. That is a considerable amount of credit and even the esteemed lieutenant does not have that much in accreditation. You would all be downgraded to the minimal living conditions until you join as citizens and get accredited yourselves.

Itsuki: [anger/incredious] Councilor, humans would absolutely consider that a threat.

Councilor: I am simply stating facts and trying to warn you of the consequences of your actions Namegiver. I am bound by the law and am presenting them to you as such.

Jasmine: [Blunt/Unimpressed] Fine. Is there any way we can control who has access and for what reasons? Are we allowed to revisit the contract and renegotiate after a certain amount of time is up? Can we control absolutely all copyright?

Councilor: It is under council law that as a Creator Species, you are entitled to designate what aspects of your DNA might be put into circulation. If you desire to limit your access we would be willing to accommodate, but absolutely all copyright would be a hard clause to enact if you wish to produce more citizens-

Itsuki: [distraught/angry] Absolutely not! No human clones of any kind! 

Jasmine: [appalled/Dissapointed] Never. Full Human Cloning goes against every moral, ethical and philosphic virtue we stand for. Designer genes invites prejudices and destroys stability, we need diversity in our lives, we need time to mature and grow to become people. Every human‚Äôs genetic imprint is unique, special, our DNA can't survive being paired with related strains, identical pairings would only cause debilitating diseases. I don‚Äôt think our brains can even comprehend a sea of identical faces without breaking down. You cant manufacture humans‚Ä¶ [Pleading] Councilor, I cannot stress how much of a violation cloning is to us‚Ä¶

Councilor: Namegiver I am forced to profusely dissagree with your statements. Cloning is what saved the Galactic council from absolute extinction, we‚Äôve revived species from the dead and erraticated more diseases then your planet has probably produced. The fact you are sighting incompatible related strains confirms you are not well versed with the technology or its capabilities. With only a single human sequence we would be able to repair the damage done to the 11 original council species, retaining longevity and minimizing abnormalities with current build models. We could rectify any abnormalities within the sequence and produce citizen and military models-

Beau:[Righetous/Furious] ***How many times do we have to tell you no?***

Councilor: [startled/scared/shocked] ?!

Beau:[Righteous/Furious] ***All men(Humanity) are created equal, there will be no lesser or superior beings, there will be no more monsters made from us-skkwjebfkashgq .: . / ‚Äô ; k j s#%7q899-***


***Transcripts error- Disconnected.***

The room was enveloped by a burning hatred reserved for Knight commanders and living bombs. Every Freq feeling being was forced backwards, except for the councilor, pinned in place by a righteous fury.   
Beau stood from his seat, Spades growling at his heel as the soldier strode across the room and grabbed the councilor by the collar of his robes. Even with the helmet on Kaalijorn could feel his eyes seering holes into his own.

‚ÄúCouncilor, We do not trust you and we do not fear you, we will not go quietly,‚Äù

The growl was deep and guttural, the statement cutting and a true threat.

Itsuki ran over and tried to pull Beau off the councilor, but he had no hope of matching the man's size or strength.

‚ÄúPut them down!‚Äù Itsuki exclaimed, but Beau grabbed Itsuki's wrist, twisting it around and forcing the kid to heel. 

‚ÄúBeau don‚Äôt kill them!‚Äù Jasmine cried out in fear and alarm, watching as the negotiations fell apart before her. ‚ÄúLet them go!‚Äù
 
Rynards hulking presence seemed frozen, caught between inaction of Jasmine's fear and the realisation he could not intervene without hurting Beau or the councilor, his claws too big to grab either safely. Nako jumped from the door after hearing the plea, sword launching out to within centimetres of Beau's back, crackling with electricity.

‚ÄúUnhand the Councilor!‚Äù Nako commanded, but the wall of ice simply passed over the human.

‚ÄúNot until they tell me why they‚Äôre so desperate for our subjugation!‚Äù Beau shouted back with terrifying volume, ‚ÄúThis is first official contact and this so-called representative of the galactic council is forcing us to sign over the fate of the human race without even allowing us a recess?! They don‚Äôt want harmony they want submission, so desperate they're willing to threaten us to comply, why? The devil is in the details and you aren't giving them to us‚Ä¶‚Äù

Beau‚Äôs Freq seared like plasma, the wave of fury, fear, and disgust was painful, even the lieutenant‚Äôs grip on his blade wavered as the human continued to broadcast his extreme discontent. 

Kaalijorn shook, terrified in the human's grip.

‚ÄúI am just trying to guide you through the contracts-‚Äù they answered meekly.
Beau lifted the councilor from the ground easily, Kaalijorn held onto his robes for dear life.

‚ÄúIf you harm me the lieutenant will kill you where you stand!‚Äù they attempted to regain control, but the human only replied with a bone-chilling.

‚ÄúThere are fates worse than death,‚Äù

Kaalijorn went pale, Nako hesitated, his sword dropping height as the air in the room went deathly still. Beau spoke again.

‚ÄúWhy are you so desperate for us to sign the contract? Answer me.‚Äù

Kaalijorns eyes darted to Nako desperately.

‚ÄúDon't look at him, answer me!‚Äù Beau demanded and Kaalijorn was forced to comply.

‚ÄúWe need your DNA,‚Äù he said quietly, ‚Äúwe can't keep producing inferior citizens models at this rate, if we slow production we will fail to comply with demands and be outnumbered by the billions,‚Äù

‚ÄúBy the Rajava?‚Äù Jasmine asked, ‚Äúthe pirates?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, the Arvas Imperium.‚Äù The councilor answered bitterly, ‚ÄúTheir reparations and demands from the Painful dynasty have to be satisfied, we were forced to create citizen models to fulfill them but our current output isn‚Äôt enough‚Ä¶‚Äù Kaalijorn could not break the human's gaze no matter how hard he tried, ‚Äú... even the genome of one of you could balance the universe in our favour.‚Äù

Beau carefully placed the councilor down and released Itsuki from his grip.

The fires smouldered to embers of disdain and contempt. 

‚ÄúThank you for your honesty,‚Äù he replied cruelly, ‚Äúwe will be deliberating over these details at our accommodation, we will inform you of our answer.‚Äù as Beau turned he side-stepped Nako‚Äôs sword, staring down the lieutenant.

Nako was forced to acknowledge his presence did nothing to the human, Beau had been in war longer than nako had been alive. There was nothing he could do to match such a ferocity‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúJasi! Itsuki! We‚Äôre leaving, we do not negotiate with eugenicists.‚Äù Beau ordered, and without saying a single word, Rynard stepped aside for him.

The two younger humans stood in shock, Spades barking at the pair of them when they refused to move. Xant‚Äôs hand suddenly grabbed Jasmines and he pulled her along.

‚ÄúJasmine, you follow Beau, I will speak with the councillor,‚Äù

‚ÄúBut Xant!-‚Äù She exclaimed, panic beginning to set in. 

‚ÄúI can't calm Beau‚Äôs anger but you can,‚Äù he reminded her, a voice of reason in the cacophony ‚ÄúItsuki, Captain, help Jasmine, I will handle the councillor, ‚Äù

Itsuki and Jasmine looked at Xant dubiously but they had no choice but to run after Beau, he was a danger to everyone on base. The captain scooped the pair of them up and gave Xant a quiet nod as the door closed behind him.

Nako was helping the councillor off the floor as Xant offered a helping hand.  

The councillor was shaken, a fury and self-disappointment flickered behind his eyes.

Xant waited patiently for the councillor to address him, the ruined politician could not stand on his own two feet, requiring the doctor to bring them water and medications. The councilor's attendants were in even worse shape, barely beyond response, collapsed in a heap and shivered from overexposed nervous systems. 

Thankfully, Xant was able to administer some small chemical relief, but the incident had left them all worse for wear.

 Kaalijorn sat on the stool and looked up at Nako and Xant miserably.

‚ÄúI propose you would call that a catastrophe‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúCouncillor, if things did not go terribly wrong where humans are concerned, I would consider it a first,‚Äù Xant conceded. The councilor blinked surprised, Xant was unharmed by the display of freq and was trying to comfort him, despite being completely sworn to the humans, ‚Äúwe knew this meeting would be difficult and while Sir Beau‚Äôs reaction was, confronting, that does not mean negotiations have been disconnected entirely.‚Äù

The councillor stared back at the citizen model before him, who had been quiet this entire time, watching and observing as he was supposed to do, now reasoning with him as a bureaucrat on his level.

‚ÄúCouncillor, when Beau and Itsuki were contained under Kyu-Kage they were under the impression they were prisoners of war and I suspect the company were under the impression they were Rajavan constructs. Humans do not possess frequency organs but do possess an extreme amount of nerve endings, what you and I would consider enough force to injure results in unimaginable pain for them, what they consider an appropriate retaliation would seem extreme to us.‚Äù

The doctor looked between the lieutenant and the councilor,

‚ÄúIt was a collection of terrible misunderstandings on both sides, but is it not the desire to learn from those mistakes and forge relationships that the council was founded upon? To be a society all can live in safety and harmoniously? Free from pain and fear?‚Äù

Xant bowed deeply to the councilor.

‚ÄúHumans also wish for this peace, Namegiver Jasmine wishes for a compromise between our peoples, give them time, understanding, they deserve that much.‚Äù

The councilor nodded his head gently.

‚Äúwell-spoken, doctor,‚Äù Kaalijorn admitted, ‚Äúthe humans have requested time, I will give them time.‚Äù Kaalijorn closed his eyes and allowed his shoulders to sink, ‚ÄúLieutenant escort the doctor back to be with the Namegiver entourage, I have some thinking of my own to do,‚Äù

Nako, hesitated.

‚ÄúAre you sure councilor? We can't wait until another Ranger can relieve us?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes I am sure, the council needs to be informed,‚Äù Kaalijorn sighed heavily ‚Äúand I need to reconsider my position, dismissed,‚Äù

The snake wif hat telegram was hit by a report attack by unfriendly actors and the original group was banned on telegram but a new group is up and I will share the link to our website where you can find our telegram below! This dev team and community is as tight knit as I have ever seen and are completely unfazed by these malicious actors. Come join us (again)!

In other news, we are within 6 days of the year of the snake and the dev team has a VERY big announcement to make before the beginning of the Chinese new year! They have mentioned before that this news was huge enough to put our next CEX listing on delay until after the announcement as well as the rebrand and website update. This bullish news will be announced within the next 6 days and according to a dev could be big enough to send us to all time highs. 

I am uncertain what kind of announcement this will be (feel free to speculate in the comments!) I feel as if it is a rather large collaboration with either another community or project in the real world! 

The community also continues to grow! We are approaching 2,600 Reddit followers and have gained nearly 100 in the last week alone. This growth has been brought on by a weibo account launch and advertisements being ran there to boost us in Asian countries before the year of the snake begins! There is also a mandarin speaking telegram only for any members of the community who would like to join there!

After all the meme token frenzy in the last week we have held strong above $3 Million market cap and have recovered an old floor! Come join us on Reddit or telegram below! Let‚Äôs build together!

This is my attempt at improving on my poor design, and I think it came out pretty good.

This makes copies of itself which can in turn make copies of themselves similar to [[Scute Swarm]]. I found the Boast mechanic to work very well for this replicating ability due to its built in restrictions. It only works once per turn, and it requires an attack. This means the token you make has to wait until another combat to self replicate. This also means that the opponent gets a turn to interact unless you have a haste enabler. This is good since once the ball gets rolling it‚Äôs pretty hard to stop without a sweeper. Once you make one copy, spot removal‚Äôs effectiveness is greatly diminished.

The creature is just a standard 5/5 for 5 so that blocking is still viable. Blocking and killing the original will mean your opponent only has 1 copy, and therefore can only make 1 more next turn instead of doubling to 4.

The Aberration in Cell 113,nosleep,1i8xlga,2025-01-24 10:12:35,48,0.94,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i8xlga/the_aberration_in_cell_113/,imbolicx,,"I‚Äôve been a Cleaner at the Association for six years now, and in that time, I‚Äôve seen my fair share of strange and horrifying things. I still can‚Äôt decide what‚Äôs worse‚Äîthe half-decayed corpses of creatures that shouldn‚Äôt exist or the Wardens, walking around freely, who can transform into absolute monsters in the blink of an eye. But the strangest, most unsettling experience of my life didn‚Äôt involve blood or gore. It involved a series of conversations I‚Äôll never forget.

It happened during my routine rounds on the containment floor. For those unfamiliar, the containment floor is where the Association keeps aberrations that can‚Äôt be destroyed‚Äîor at least, not easily. Some are there because they‚Äôre too valuable to eliminate, others because killing them would have consequences we‚Äôre not prepared to deal with. Cell 113 belonged to the latter category.

We don‚Äôt know what the thing in Cell 113 is, not exactly. It‚Äôs humanoid, but only vaguely. It sits at the center of its cell, shrouded in shadows that shouldn‚Äôt exist, and it never moves. Its containment protocols are strict: no direct contact, no more than three Cleaners in the vicinity at once, and under no circumstances are we allowed to stand in front of its viewing window for more than thirty seconds. The official reason is ‚Äúprolonged exposure may lead to psychological contamination.‚Äù

Most Cleaners avoid Cell 113 altogether. I didn‚Äôt have that luxury. My job that day was to sanitize the hallway directly in front of its cell, which had been flagged for maintenance due to an unexplained dampness seeping from the walls. I tried to work quickly, scrubbing at the dark stains on the floor and muttering to myself to break the silence. That was my first mistake.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre quite the chatterbox, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù

The voice stopped me cold. It was deep and resonant, like it came from everywhere and nowhere at once. I turned my head toward the cell, my heart pounding. The thing in Cell 113 had never spoken before, as far as I knew. The viewing window was dark, and I couldn‚Äôt see anything beyond the faint outline of its hunched form.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not supposed to talk to you,‚Äù I said, breaking rule number one of containment: don‚Äôt engage.

‚ÄúAh, but you already are,‚Äù it replied, a hint of amusement in its tone. ‚ÄúTell me, do they ever tell you why you‚Äôre not supposed to linger here?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer. Instead, I focused on my work, scrubbing harder at a particularly stubborn stain. My hands were trembling, though, and I‚Äôm sure it noticed.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre afraid of what you might hear,‚Äù it continued. ‚ÄúOf what I might tell you. They think ignorance will protect you.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my job to know anything,‚Äù I said, my voice barely above a whisper.

‚ÄúOh, but ignorance is such a fragile thing, isn‚Äôt it? So easily shattered.‚Äù

I should have walked away then. I should have dropped my mop and left the hallway without looking back. But something about its voice‚Äîsmooth and almost hypnotic‚Äîrooted me in place. Against my better judgment, I glanced toward the viewing window.

The darkness inside seemed to shift, like the shadows were alive. And then I saw them: two pinpricks of light, faint and golden, like distant stars. Eyes. They were looking directly at me.

‚ÄúYou have questions,‚Äù it said, its tone softening. ‚ÄúI can feel them, pressing against your mind. Ask.‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have questions. I just want to finish my job.‚Äù

‚ÄúLiar,‚Äù it said, and for a moment, its voice was sharp enough to cut. ‚ÄúYou wonder why they keep me here, why they‚Äôre so afraid of me. You wonder what I am.‚Äù

It was right, of course. But I didn‚Äôt dare admit it.

‚ÄúDo you know what fear tastes like?‚Äù it asked, its voice dropping to a whisper. ‚ÄúYours is bitter, but not unpleasant. You‚Äôre afraid of me, yes, but you‚Äôre more afraid of what your curiosity might cost you. A wise fear, but misplaced.‚Äù

My hands tightened around the mop handle. ‚ÄúI need to finish my work.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course you do. But before you go, a gift.‚Äù

I froze, dread pooling in my stomach. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want anything from you.‚Äù

The thing chuckled‚Äîa low, vibrating sound that seemed to rattle the walls. ‚ÄúWant has little to do with it. Gifts are obligations, Cleaner. And this one is‚Ä¶ harmless. For now.‚Äù

Against my will, I found myself stepping closer to the cell, the mop still in my trembling hands. I wanted to stop, to turn and run, but my legs felt like they were moving on their own. The golden pinpricks of its eyes bore into me, and for a moment, I thought I saw shapes in the shadows‚Äîtwisting, writhing forms that seemed to press against the glass.

‚ÄúLook at the floor,‚Äù it murmured, its voice barely audible yet impossible to ignore.

I hesitated, then glanced down. There, at the base of the viewing window, was a small puddle of the same dark dampness I‚Äôd been cleaning. But this one was different. It wasn‚Äôt just water‚Äîit shimmered faintly, like oil on asphalt under the sun.

‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù I asked, my voice trembling.

‚ÄúA piece of me,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúA token of our‚Ä¶ conversation. Take it, or leave it. But know this: the choice you make will shape the path ahead.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I whispered, taking a step back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not taking anything from you.‚Äù

The thing laughed again, louder this time, the sound echoing down the hallway. ‚ÄúWise, perhaps. But wisdom does not always shield you from consequence.‚Äù

I turned and fled, leaving the mop and bucket behind. The shadows seemed to cling to me as I ran, stretching unnaturally long down the corridor. By the time I reached the elevator, my chest was heaving, and my hands were shaking so badly I could barely press the button to take me back up.

When I returned to the maintenance office, the supervisor gave me a funny look. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt finish the job?‚Äù he asked, glancing at the bucket in my hands, still full of dirty water.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ something came up,‚Äù I muttered, avoiding his gaze.

He frowned but didn‚Äôt press me. ‚ÄúFine. But you‚Äôre on containment duty again tomorrow. Same area.‚Äù

My stomach dropped. I wanted to argue, to refuse, but I knew it would only draw more attention. And the last thing I needed was for anyone to know what had happened‚Äîor worse, what I‚Äôd heard.

That night, sleep refused to come. Every creak of my apartment seemed louder than usual, every shadow longer and darker than it had any right to be. The faint hum of the refrigerator felt oppressive, and I caught myself glancing at corners of the room like something might emerge from them. I told myself it was just my imagination, that the thing in Cell 113 wasn‚Äôt capable of reaching me outside its containment.

But the whisper lingered in my mind: *‚ÄúThe choice you make will shape the path ahead.‚Äù*

When my shift started the next day, I avoided the containment floor for as long as I could. I scrubbed bathrooms, took out trash, and even volunteered to clean the cafeteria‚Äîanything to keep me far away from that corridor. But eventually, my supervisor found me, clipboard in hand and a scowl on his face.

‚ÄúHall 6C,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou left it a mess yesterday, and you‚Äôre on containment duty. No excuses.‚Äù

I wanted to argue, to tell him to send someone else, but the words died in my throat. I nodded and grabbed my supplies, feeling like I was marching to my own execution.

The hallway was exactly as I‚Äôd left it: dark, damp, and humming with an unnatural stillness. The stains on the floor had spread slightly, and the air felt thick, heavy, like it was pressing against my chest. The corridor was silent except for the faint buzz of the overhead lights, but I could feel its presence, awake and watching.

I tried to work quickly, keeping my head down and my movements efficient. The rules were simple: don‚Äôt look into the cell, don‚Äôt engage. But then it spoke.

‚ÄúYou returned.‚Äù

Its voice stopped me in my tracks, smooth and resonant, echoing like it came from all directions at once. It wasn‚Äôt the kind of voice you could ignore‚Äîit reached into you, demanded attention.

I didn‚Äôt respond, gripping the mop tighter and focusing on scrubbing the floor.

‚ÄúSilent today? That‚Äôs disappointing,‚Äù it said, with a hint of amusement. ‚ÄúI thought we were making progress.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just here to do my job,‚Äù I muttered, keeping my eyes fixed on the tile.

‚ÄúAh, but that‚Äôs the thing about humans, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù it said, its tone almost conversational. ‚ÄúYou always reduce yourselves to your roles. Cleaner. Warden. Director. As if those labels are enough to hold your fragile minds together.‚Äù

I paused, my heart pounding in my chest. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not supposed to talk to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd yet, here you are,‚Äù it said, a chuckle rumbling through the air. ‚ÄúTalking. Listening. *Lingering.* Tell me, Cleaner, do you enjoy this work? Scrubbing away filth, pretending not to see the stains that never truly leave?‚Äù

I hesitated, the mop trembling in my hands. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a job.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it?‚Äù it asked, its voice dropping to a whisper. ‚ÄúOr is it a distraction? A way to ignore the questions clawing at the edges of your mind? I can feel them, you know. The doubts. The little cracks in the veneer.‚Äù

I forced myself to keep scrubbing, but the words burrowed into me.

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt tell you much, do they?‚Äù it continued. ‚ÄúThey let you walk these halls, clean these cells, and expect you not to wonder. Not to question what‚Äôs locked behind these doors. What‚Äôs watching you from the dark.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to know,‚Äù I said, though the words felt hollow.

Its laughter was low and mocking. ‚ÄúHumans are such poor liars. Your kind craves understanding, even when it destroys you. Especially when it destroys you.‚Äù

The shadows in the cell seemed to pulse, shifting and writhing like living things. Two faint pinpricks of light appeared in the darkness, golden and piercing. Eyes. They held me in place, drawing me closer without me realizing I‚Äôd taken a step forward.

‚ÄúYou want to know what I am,‚Äù it said, its tone soft and almost kind. ‚ÄúYou want to know why they‚Äôre so afraid of me. Why they keep me hidden down here, in the dark.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt,‚Äù I whispered, though my voice betrayed me.

‚ÄúOh, but you do,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs the beautiful thing about your kind. Your curiosity is both your greatest strength and your undoing. It‚Äôs why you‚Äôve conquered so much, why you‚Äôve built empires. But it‚Äôs also why you destroy yourselves, over and over again. You can‚Äôt help it. You have to look. You have to know.‚Äù

The golden eyes seemed to grow brighter, and I felt an almost magnetic pull, like gravity itself was urging me closer to the cell. I tightened my grip on the mop handle, trying to ground myself.

‚ÄúTell me, Cleaner,‚Äù it said, its voice dropping to a whisper. ‚ÄúDo you ever wonder what lies behind the mask you wear? The role they‚Äôve given you? Do you ever wonder who you *really* are?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a Cleaner,‚Äù I said, but the words sounded weak, even to me.

‚ÄúIs that what they told you? That you‚Äôre just a cog in the machine, disposable and insignificant?‚Äù Its voice took on a sharper edge. ‚ÄúOr is that what you tell yourself, because it‚Äôs easier than asking the questions that matter?‚Äù

The air felt colder now, and I could see my breath in front of me. My heart was racing, and every instinct screamed at me to leave. But I couldn‚Äôt move.

‚ÄúCome closer,‚Äù it said, its voice almost gentle now. ‚ÄúAsk the question you‚Äôre afraid to ask. Let me show you what they don‚Äôt want you to see.‚Äù

I shook my head, forcing my legs to move, backing away from the cell. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not supposed to talk to you. I‚Äôm not supposed to‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúLeave, then,‚Äù it said, cutting me off. ‚ÄúRun back to your small, safe world. But you‚Äôll return. You always do. Humans are nothing if not predictable.‚Äù

I turned and stumbled down the hallway, my breath coming in short, ragged gasps. But as I walked away, its final words echoed in my mind:

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt clean away the truth, Cleaner. Those stains always remain.‚Äù

For days, I couldn‚Äôt shake the aberration‚Äôs words. Its voice echoed in my mind like a song I couldn‚Äôt stop humming, and with each repetition, the meaning became heavier, darker. The thought of it festered, creeping into every part of my life. I started jumping at shadows, second-guessing the Wardens I‚Äôd once admired, even losing sleep as I turned its cryptic warnings over and over in my head.

I thought I could ignore it, that the feeling would pass. But it didn‚Äôt. It only grew worse, clawing at the edges of my sanity until I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I had to know the truth. Or at least, whatever version of the truth that thing was willing to give me.

Against every rule, every shred of common sense, I decided to visit Cell 113 one last time.

The hallway leading to the cell felt darker than usual, the fluorescent lights humming faintly overhead like a warning. My hand trembled as I swiped my keycard and stepped inside the observation chamber. The room was cold, unnaturally so, and the shadows in the cell seemed thicker than before, writhing like living things.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve come back,‚Äù the voice greeted me, smooth and amused. The golden pinpricks of light that I assumed were its eyes flared faintly in the dark. ‚ÄúI must admit, I didn‚Äôt expect you to last this long.‚Äù

I swallowed hard, trying to steady my nerves. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been in my head,‚Äù I said, my voice cracking slightly. ‚ÄúI need answers. I need to know why you‚Äôre here, why someone like you‚Äîsomething like you‚Äîis locked up.‚Äù

The aberration chuckled, the sound low and almost human, but not quite. ‚ÄúLocked up?‚Äù it repeated, savoring the words like a fine wine. ‚ÄúNo, child. I am not contained. I am simply‚Ä¶ waiting. Waiting, as I have for centuries.‚Äù

Its words sent a chill down my spine, but I forced myself to stay. ‚ÄúWaiting for what?‚Äù I asked, though I wasn‚Äôt sure I wanted to hear the answer.

‚ÄúFor your kind to understand what you truly are,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúYou humans are an amusing species. So quick to forget, so eager to believe you are the architects of your own fate. But your kind was never alone. When the dark pressed in and the beasts roamed free, you cried out‚Äînot to gods, but to things older and far hungrier. And we answered. We gave you what you needed to rise, to fight, to thrive.

But nothing is free. Your kind struck a bargain, one you cannot remember but are still bound to. The Guardians, the Wardens‚Äîthey are not saviors. They are the remnants of a deal you no longer understand. And when the time comes, when your borrowed strength no longer satisfies the debt, those who gave it to you will return.‚Äù

I felt a lump rise in my throat. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, return? Are you saying the Wardens can‚Äôt stop what‚Äôs coming?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Wardens?‚Äù the aberration said with a low, guttural laugh, like the grinding of stone. ‚ÄúThey are more than imperfect‚Äîthey are fractured reflections of the pact your kind struck. There is an aberration in them, a monstrous side, clawing beneath their skin. That is why they need the Guardians. Without the bond, they would lose themselves to what they are, become the very things you fear. The pact binds them, keeps them tethered to what is left of their humanity. But even that is not enough, is it? Do you think they would protect you if they truly understood what they are? Or would they turn against you instead?‚Äù

Its words sank into me like hooks, dragging me down into a spiral of doubt and fear.I thought of the Wardens I‚Äôd worked with over the years‚Äîtheir quiet confidence, their unmatched strength. They always seemed so sure, so unwavering. But now, I couldn‚Äôt shake the images in my mind. The way their eyes gleamed too sharply in the heat of battle. The feral, almost predatory way they moved as they closed in on their prey. The Guardians, always so loyal, sometimes seemed to act with a purpose that didn‚Äôt belong to their Wardens at all. I started to wonder: were they truly protectors, or were they simply beasts held on a fraying leash? What if their strength wasn‚Äôt a gift, but a curse they barely kept in check?

I clenched my fists, my voice rising in frustration. ‚ÄúWhy are you telling me this? What‚Äôs your angle? If you‚Äôre not locked up, if you‚Äôre just waiting, then why are you still here?‚Äù

The aberration‚Äôs eyes seemed to burn brighter, and I could feel its grin even though I couldn‚Äôt see its face. ‚ÄúBecause I enjoy watching,‚Äù it said simply. ‚ÄúWatching your kind struggle to understand, to piece together the fragments of a truth that would shatter you if you ever grasped it. You‚Äôre like children playing with fire, so sure of your safety until the flames consume you.‚Äù

My heart was pounding, but I refused to back down. ‚ÄúThen who are you?‚Äù I asked, the question slipping out before I could stop myself. ‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù

For the first time, the aberration was silent. The golden lights of its eyes dimmed, and for a moment, I thought it wouldn‚Äôt answer. Then, it spoke, its voice quieter but somehow more menacing than before.

‚ÄúI am what waits beyond the veil of your understanding, the crawling chaos that whispers in the void. Your kind once called us gods, but we are far older than your faiths, far older than your stars. You might call me a Great Old One, but even that name is a shadow of what I am. I am the hunger beneath your fragile reality, the storm that watches from the abyss. I am not your enemy, child. I am inevitability.‚Äù

I staggered back, the weight of its words pressing down on me like a physical force. My vision blurred, and the air felt too thin, too heavy. I didn‚Äôt know what to believe anymore, but one thing was certain: I couldn‚Äôt stay there any longer.

I turned and stumbled out of the observation chamber, my heart racing as I made my way back to the upper levels. The aberration‚Äôs laughter followed me, soft and mocking, like the echo of a nightmare I‚Äôd never fully wake from.

In the days that followed, its words burrowed deep into my mind, festering like an open wound. I couldn‚Äôt escape them, couldn‚Äôt stop replaying every cryptic sentence. I didn‚Äôt have access to the Association‚Äôs most sensitive records‚ÄîCleaners like me weren‚Äôt meant to question, only to follow orders. But even from the scraps I‚Äôd seen in passing, the whispers in the halls, and the fragmented stories shared by veterans, I started to piece together something horrifying‚Äîor rather, I started to notice what *wasn‚Äôt* there. There were no traces of rituals, no records of the Wardens‚Äô origins, no mention of where their power came from. Just silence. As though it had all been scrubbed away, leaving only questions no one dared to ask. If what the entity in Cell 113 said was true, then humanity isn't fighting to win. We were just stalling. Holding back an inevitable tide that had been promised long before any of us were born.

Taking advantage of ZFS on root with Proxmox VE,selfhosted,1i8x5kg,2025-01-24 09:53:24,8,0.73,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1i8x5kg/taking_advantage_of_zfs_on_root_with_proxmox_ve/,esiy0676,Guide,"[](#aecc46b163a49241)

install. A primer on ZFS basics insofar ZFS as a root filesystem

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proxmox seem to be heavily in favour of the use of ZFS, including for
the *root filesystem*. In fact, it is the only production-ready option
in the stock installer [^1] in case you would want to make use of e.g.¬†a
*mirror*. However, the only benefit of ZFS in terms of Proxmox VE
feature set lies in the support for *replication* [^2] across nodes,
which is a perfectly viable alternative for smaller clusters to shared
storage. Beyond that, Proxmox do NOT take advantage of the distinct
filesystem features. For instance, if you make use of *Proxmox Backup
Server* (PBS), [^3] there is absolutely no benefit in using ZFS in terms
of its native snapshot support. [^4]

## ZFS on root

In turn, there is seemingly few benefits of *ZFS on root* with a stock
Proxmox VE install. If you require replication of guests, you absolutely
do NOT need ZFS for the host install itself. Instead, creation of ZFS
pool (just for the guests) after the bare install would be advisable.
Many would find this confusing as non-ZFS installs set you up with with
LVM [^6] instead, a configuration you would then need to revert,
i.e.¬†delete the superfluous partitioning prior to creating a *non-root*
ZFS pool.

Further, if mirroring of the root filesystem itself is the only
objective, one would get much simpler setup with a traditional no-frills
*Linux/md software RAID* [^7] solution which does NOT suffer from *write
amplification* inevitable for any copy-on-write filesystem.

### No support

No built-in backup features of Proxmox take advantage of the fact that
*ZFS for root specifically* allows convenient *snapshotting,
serialisation and sending the data away* in a very efficient way already
provided by the very filesystem the operating system is running off -
both in terms of *space utilisation and performance*.

Finally, since ZFS is not reliably supported by common bootloaders - in
terms of keeping up with upgraded pools and their new features over
time, certainly not the *bespoke versions of ZFS* as shipped by Proxmox,
further non-intuitive measures need to be taken. It is necessary to keep
""synchronising"" the *initramfs* [^8] and available *kernels* from the
regular `/boot` directory (which might be inaccessible for the
bootloader when residing on an unusual filesystem such as ZFS) to EFI
System Partition (ESP), which was not exactly meant to hold full images
of about-to-be booted up systems originally. This requires use of
non-standard bespoke tools, such as `proxmox-boot-tool`. [^9]

So what are the *actual* out-of-the-box benefits of with Proxmox VE
install? *None whatsoever.*

## A better way

This might be an opportunity to take a step back and [migrate your
install away from ZFS on
root](https://free-pmx.github.io/guides/host-backup/) or - as we will
have a closer look here - actually take *real advantage* of it. The good
news is that it is NOT at all complicated, it only requires a different
bootloader solution that happens to come with lots of bells and
whistles. That and some understanding of ZFS concepts, but then again,
using ZFS makes only sense if we want to put such understanding to good
use as Proxmox do not do this for us.

### ZFS-friendly bootloader

A staple of any sensible on-root ZFS install, at least with a UEFI
system, is the conspicuously named bootloader of *ZFSBootMenu* (ZBM)
[^10] - a solution that is an easy add-on for an existing system such as
Proxmox VE. It will not only allow us to *boot with our root filesystem
directly* off the actual `/boot` location within - so no more intimate
[knowledge of Proxmox bootloading
needed](https://free-pmx.github.io/insights/bootloaders/) - but also let
us have *multiple root filesystems* at any given time to choose from.
Moreover, it will also be possible to create e.g.¬†a [snapshot of a cold
system before it booted
up](https://free-pmx.github.io/guides/host-backup/), similarly as we did
in a bit more manual (and seemingly tedious) process with the Proxmox
installer once before - but with just a couple of keystrokes and
*native* to ZFS.

There's a separate guide on [installation and use of ZFSBootMenu with
Proxmox VE](https://free-pmx.github.io/guides/zfs-boot/), but it is
worth learning more about the filesystem before proceeding with it.

## ZFS does things differently

While introducing ZFS is well beyond the scope here, it is important to
summarise the basics in terms of differences to a ""regular"" setup.

ZFS is not a mere *filesystem*, it doubles as a *volume manager* (such
as LVM), and if it were not for the requirement of UEFI for a separate
EFI System Partition with FAT filesystem - that has to be ordinarily
sharing the same (or sole) disk in the system - it would be possible to
present the entire physical device to ZFS and even skip the regular disk
partitioning [^11] altogether.

In fact, the *OpenZFS* docs boast [^12] that a ZFS pool is ""*full
storage stack capable of replacing RAID, partitioning, volume
management, fstab/exports files and traditional single-disk file
systems*."" This is because a *pool* can indeed be made up of multiple
so-called *virtual devices* (vdevs). This is just a matter of conceptual
approach, as a most basic *vdev* is nothing more than would be otherwise
considered a block device, e.g.¬†a disk, or a traditional partition of a
disk, even just a file.

> **IMPORTANT** It might be often overlooked that vdevs, when combined
> (e.g.¬†into a mirror), constitute a vdev itself, which is why it is
> possible to create e.g.¬†striped mirrors without much thinking about
> it.

Vdevs are organised in a tree-like structure and therefore the top-most
vdev in such hierarchy is considered a root vdev. The simpler and more
commonly used reference to the entirety of this structure is *a pool*,
however.

We are not particularly interested in the substructure of the pool
here - after all a typical PVE install with a *single vdev* pool (but
also all other setups) results in a single pool named `rpool` getting
created and can be simply seen as a single entry: [^13]

    zpool list

    NAME    SIZE  ALLOC   FREE  CKPOINT  EXPANDSZ   FRAG    CAP  DEDUP    HEALTH  ALTROOT
    rpool   126G  1.82G   124G        -         -     0%     1%  1.00x    ONLINE  -

But pool is not a filesystem in the traditional sense, even though it
could appear as such. Without any special options specified, creating a
pool - such as `rpool` - indeed results in filesystem getting mounted
under `/rpool` location *in the filesystem*, which can be checked as
well:

    findmnt /rpool

    TARGET SOURCE FSTYPE OPTIONS
    /rpool rpool  zfs    rw,relatime,xattr,noacl,casesensitive

But this pool as a whole is not really our root filesystem per se,
i.e.¬†`rpool` is not what is mounted to `/` upon system start. If we
explore further, there is a structure to the `/rpool` mountpoint:

    apt install -y tree
    tree /rpool

    /rpool
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ROOT
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pve-1

    4 directories, 0 files

These are called *datasets* within ZFS parlance (and they indeed are
equivalent to regular filesystems, except for a special type such as
*zvol*) and would be ordinarily mounted into their respective (or
intuitive) locations, but if you went to explore the directories further
with PVE specifically, those are empty.

The existence of datasets can also be confirmed with another command:
[^14]

    zfs list

    NAME               USED  AVAIL  REFER  MOUNTPOINT
    rpool             1.82G   120G   104K  /rpool
    rpool/ROOT        1.81G   120G    96K  /rpool/ROOT
    rpool/ROOT/pve-1  1.81G   120G  1.81G  /
    rpool/data          96K   120G    96K  /rpool/data
    rpool/var-lib-vz    96K   120G    96K  /var/lib/vz

This also gives a hint where each of them will have a mountpoint - they
do NOT have to be analogous.

> **IMPORTANT** A mountpoint as listed by `zfs list` does not
> necessarily mean that the filesystem is actually mounted there at the
> given moment.

Datasets may *appear* like directories, but they - as in this case - can
be independently mounted (or not) anywhere into the filesystem at
runtime - and in this case, it is a perfect example of the root
filesystem mounted under `/` path, but actually held by the
`rpool/ROOT/pve-1` dataset.

> **IMPORTANT** Do note that paths of datasets start with a pool name,
> which can be arbitrary (the `rpool` here has no special meaning to

> path would.

Mounting of regular datasets happens automatically, something that in
case of PVE installer resulted in superfluously appearing directories
like `/rpool/ROOT` which are virtually empty. You can confirm such empty
dataset is mounted and even unmount it without any ill-effects:

    findmnt /rpool/ROOT 

    TARGET      SOURCE     FSTYPE OPTIONS
    /rpool/ROOT rpool/ROOT zfs    rw,relatime,xattr,noacl,casesensitive

    umount -v /rpool/ROOT

    umount: /rpool/ROOT (rpool/ROOT) unmounted

Some default datasets for Proxmox VE are simply not mounted and/or
accessed under `/rpool` - a testament how disentangled datasets and
mountpoints can be.

You can even go about deleting such (unmounted) subdirectories. You will
however notice that - even if the `umount` command does not fail - the
mountpoints will keep reappearing.

But there is nothing in the usual *mounts* list as defined in
`/etc/fstab` [^15] which would imply where they are coming from:

    cat /etc/fstab 

    # <file system> <mount point> <type> <options> <dump> <pass>
    proc /proc proc defaults 0 0

The issue is that mountpoints are handled differently when it comes to
ZFS. Everything goes by the *properties* of the datasets, which can be
examined: [^16]

    zfs get mountpoint rpool

    NAME   PROPERTY    VALUE       SOURCE
    rpool  mountpoint  /rpool      default

This will be the case of all of them except the explicitly specified
ones, such as the root dataset:

    NAME              PROPERTY    VALUE       SOURCE
    rpool/ROOT/pve-1  mountpoint  /           local

When you do NOT specify a property on a dataset, it would typically be
*inherited* by child datasets from their parent (that is what the tree
structure is for) and there are fallback *defaults* when all of them (in
the path) are left unspecified. This is generally meant to facilitate a
friendly behaviour of a new dataset appearing immediately as a mounted
filesystem in a predictable path - and we should not be caught by
surprise by this with ZFS.

It is completely benign to stop mounting empty parent datasets when all
their children have locally specified `mountpoint` property and we can
absolutely do that right away: [^17]

    zfs set mountpoint=none rpool/ROOT

Even the empty directories will NOW disappear. And this will be
remembered upon reboot.

> **TIP** It is actually possible to specify `mountpoint=legacy` in
> which case the rest can be then managed such as a regular filesystem
> would be - with `/etc/fstab`.

So far, we have not really changed any behaviour, just learned some
basics of ZFS and ended up in a neater mountpoints situation:

    rpool             1.82G   120G    96K  /rpool
    rpool/ROOT        1.81G   120G    96K  none
    rpool/ROOT/pve-1  1.81G   120G  1.81G  /
    rpool/data          96K   120G    96K  /rpool/data
    rpool/var-lib-vz    96K   120G    96K  /var/lib/vz

### Forgotten reservation

It is fairly strange that PVE takes up the *entire disk* space by
default and calls such pool `rpool` as it is obvious that the pool WILL
have to be shared for datasets other than the one holding root
filesystem(s).

That said, you can create separate pools, even with the standard
installer - by giving it smaller than actual full available `hdsize`
value:

---8\<---

The issue concerning us should not as much lie in the naming or
separation of pools. But consider a situation when a non-root dataset,
e.g.¬†a guest without any quota set, fills up the entire `rpool`. We
should at least do the minimum to ensure there is always ample space for
the root filesystem. We could meticulously be setting quotas on all the
other datasets, but instead, we really should make a reservation for the
root one, or more precisely a `refreservation`: [^18]

    zfs set refreservation=16G rpool/ROOT/pve-1

This will guarantee that 16G is reserved for the root dataset at all
circumstances. Of course it does not protect us from filling up the
entire space by some runaway process, but it cannot be usurped by other
datasets, such as guests.

### Snapshots and clones

The whole point of considering a better bootloader for ZFS specifically
is to take advantage of its features without much extra tooling. It
would be great if we could take a copy of a filesystem at an exact
point, e.g.¬†*before a risky upgrade* and know we *can revert back* to
it, i.e.¬†boot from it should anything go wrong. ZFS allows for this with
its *snapshots* which record exactly the kind of state we need - they
take no time to create as they do not initially consume any space, it is
simply a marker on filesystem state that from this point on will be
tracked for changes - in the snapshot. As more changes accumulate,
snapshots will keep taking up more space. Once not needed, it is just a
matter of ditching the snapshot - which drops the ""tracked changes""
data.

Snapshots of ZFS, however, are *read-only*. They are great to
e.g.¬†recover a forgotten customised - and since accidentally
overwritten - configuration file, or permanently revert to as a whole,
but not to temporarily boot from if we - at the same time - want to
retain the current dataset state - as a simple rollback would have us go
back in time without the ability to jump ""back forward"" again. For that,
a snapshot needs to be turned into a *clone*.

It is very easy to create a snapshot off an existing dataset and then
checking for its existence: [^19]

    zfs snapshot rpool/ROOT/pve-1@snapshot1
    zfs list -t snapshot

    NAME                         USED  AVAIL  REFER  MOUNTPOINT
    rpool/ROOT/pve-1@snapshot1   300K      -  1.81G  -

> **IMPORTANT** Note the naming convention using `@` as a separator -
> the snapshot belongs to the dataset preceding it.

We can then perform some operation, such as upgrade and check again to
see the used space increasing:

    NAME                         USED  AVAIL  REFER  MOUNTPOINT
    rpool/ROOT/pve-1@snapshot1  46.8M      -  1.81G  -

Clones can *only be created from a snapshot*. Let's create one now as
well: [^20]

    zfs clone rpool/ROOT/pve-1@snapshot1 rpool/ROOT/pve-2

As clones are as capable as a regular dataset, they are listed as such:

    zfs list

    NAME               USED  AVAIL  REFER  MOUNTPOINT
    rpool             17.8G   104G    96K  /rpool
    rpool/ROOT        17.8G   104G    96K  none
    rpool/ROOT/pve-1  17.8G   120G  1.81G  /
    rpool/ROOT/pve-2     8K   104G  1.81G  none
    rpool/data          96K   104G    96K  /rpool/data
    rpool/var-lib-vz    96K   104G    96K  /var/lib/vz

Do notice that while both `pve-1` and the cloned `pve-2` *refer the same
amount of data* and the available space did not drop. Well, except that
the `pve-1` had our `refreservation` set which guarantees it its very
own claim on extra space, whilst that is not the case for the clone.
Clones simply do not take extra space until they start to refer other
data than the original.

Importantly, the mountpoint was inherited from the parent - the
`rpool/ROOT` dataset, which *we had previously set* to `none`.

> **TIP** This is quite safe - NOT to have unused clones mounted at all
> times - but does not preclude us from mounting them on demand, if need
> be:
>
>     mount -t zfs -o zfsutil rpool/ROOT/pve-2 /mnt

## Backup on a running system

There is always one issue with the approach above, however. When
creating a snapshot, even at a fixed point in time, there might be some
processes running and *part of their state is not on disk*, but
e.g.¬†resides in RAM, and is crucial to the system's consistency,
i.e.¬†such snapshot might get us a corrupt state as we are not capturing
anything that was *in-flight*. A prime candidate for such a fragile
component would be a database, something that Proxmox heavily relies on
with its own [configuration filesystem of
*pmxcfs*](https://free-pmx.github.io/insights/pmxcfs-mount/) - and
indeed the proper way to snapshot a system like this *while running* is
more convoluted, i.e.¬†the database has to be given special
consideration, e.g.¬†be temporarily shut down or the state as presented
under `/etc/pve` has to be [backed up by the means of safe SQLite
database *dump*](https://free-pmx.github.io/guides/configs-backup/).

This can be, however, easily resolved in *more streamlined way* - by
making all the backup operations from a different, i.e.¬†not on the
running system itself. For the case of root filesystem, we have to boot
off a different environment, such as when we [created a full backup from
a rescue-like boot](https://free-pmx.github.io/guides/host-backup/). But
that is relatively inconvenient. And not necessary - in our case.
Because we have a ZFS-aware bootloader with *extra tools* in mind.

We will ditch the potentially inconsistent clone and snapshot and redo
them later on. As they depend on each other, they need to go in reverse
order:

> **WARNING** Exercise EXTREME CAUTION when issuing `zfs destroy` [^21]
> commands - there is NO confirmation prompt and it is easy to execute
> them without due care, in particular in terms omitting a snapshot part
> of the name following `@` and thus removing entire dataset when
> passing on `-r` and `-f` switch which we will NOT use here for that
> reason.
>
> It might also be a good idea to prepend these command by a space
> character, which on a common regular Bash shell setup would prevent
> them from getting recorded in history and thus accidentally
> re-executed. This would be also one of the reasons to avoid running
> everything under the `root` user all of the time.

    zfs destroy rpool/ROOT/pve-2
    zfs destroy rpool/ROOT/pve-1@snapshot1

## Ready

It is at this point we know enough to [install and start using
ZFSBootMenu with Proxmox
VE](https://free-pmx.github.io/guides/zfs-boot/) - as is covered in the
separate guide which also takes a look at changing other necessary
defaults that Proxmox VE ships with.

We do NOT need to bother to remove the original bootloader. And it would
continue to boot if we were to re-select it in UEFI. Well, as long as it
finds its target at `rpool/ROOT/pve-1`. But we could just as well go and
remove it, similarly as when we [installed *GRUB* instead of
*systemd-boot*](https://free-pmx.github.io/guides/systemd-boot/).

### Note on backups

Finally, there are some popular tokens of ""wisdom"" around such as
""*snapshot is not a backup*"", but they are not particularly meaningful.
Let's consider what else we could do with our snapshots and clones in
this context.

A backup is as good as it is safe from consequences of *indvertent
actions we expect*. E.g. a snapshot is as safe as the system that has
access to it, i.e.¬†not any less than `tar` archive would have been when
stored in a separate location whilst still accessible from the same
system. Of course, that does not mean that it would be futile to send
our snapshots somewhere away. It is something we can still easily do
with serialisation that ZFS provides for. But that is for another time.

# [**Building a Secure Virtual Healthcare Platform**](https://www.nextdlp.com/resources/blog/hipaa-compliant-telehealth-platforms)

Security is the life-blood of any successful telehealth platform. At Bask Health, we've seen the telemedicine solutions market grow faster and faster, with projections reaching USD 559.52 billion by 2027. Notwithstanding that, this growth creates more responsibility to protect sensitive patient information.

# Data Security Best Practices

We've put detailed security measures in place to protect electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). Our approach has:

* [End-to-end encryption](https://bask.health/blog/cybersecurity-best-practices-for-the-healthcare-field)¬†for all data transmission
* Multi-factor authentication systems
* Regular vulnerability assessments
* Automated security updates

Our security protocols work well. Multi-factor authentication alone cuts successful cyber attacks by 99.9%. Each compromised record costs healthcare organizations USD 614.00 on average.

# Patient Privacy Protection Measures

We've built a strong framework that lines up with current healthcare regulations to protect patient privacy. Our platform uses these critical measures:

|**Protection Layer**|**Implementation**|
|:-|:-|
|Access Control|Role-based permissions|
|Data Encryption|Industry-standard protocols|
|Audit Trails|Comprehensive logging|
|Remote Security|Device management tools|

Our virtual waiting room adds an extra security layer so you retain control over consultation access. We run regular security audits to spot and fix potential risks before anyone can exploit them.

# Compliance Framework Implementation

At Bask Health, we know HIPAA compliance needs constant alertness. Our compliance framework includes three key safeguard categories:

1. Technical Safeguards
   * Unique user identification systems
   * Automatic log-off features
   * Emergency access procedures
2. Physical Safeguards
   * Facility access controls
   * Workstation security
   * Device and media controls
3. Administrative Safeguards
   * Security management processes
   * Information access management
   * [Security awareness training](https://bask.health/blog/cybersecurity-best-practices-for-the-healthcare-field)

We keep all electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) secure through our detailed security measures. Healthcare organizations must respond to patients' requests for changes and updates within 30 days. Our platform makes this process natural.

We go beyond simple compliance with security. We use extra measures such as:

* Regular Office of Civil Rights (OCR) audits
* Continuous monitoring systems
* Proactive threat detection
* Incident response protocols

Of course, cybersecurity threats keep evolving. That's why we update our platform regularly to keep security protocols strong. Our documentation management system protects patients' PHI from potential breaches while ensuring secure document flow.

Our platform meets both current and future security standards. This helps startups because they don't need to build complex security systems from scratch. The platform handles security updates, compliance monitoring, and threat detection automatically. Healthcare startups can focus on their main goal: delivering exceptional patient care.

# [**Integration Capabilities for Growth**](https://empeek.com/insights/telehealth-ehr-integration/)

A scalable telehealth platform needs resilient integration capabilities. Bask Health's platform naturally connects with key healthcare systems, which helps startups grow their services.

# EHR System Integration Options

Statistics show that over 95% of US hospitals use certified EHR platforms. We have developed complete integration solutions that support both bi-directional and unidirectional data exchange. Our¬†[EHR integration](https://bask.health/blog/telehealth-technology-platform-that-works)¬†features have:

* Live access to patient data during consultations
* Automated documentation updates
* Simplified clinical processes
* Complete audit trails

Our platform supports HL7 and FHIR standards to enable smooth data exchange between systems. This standardization is vital because growing data volumes from telehealth services can make patient identification between systems difficult.

# Third-Party API Connections

APIs have become vital to telehealth development. Our platform supports various API integration types:

|**API Category**|**Primary Function**|**Key Benefit**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Health Data APIs|Medical record access|Complete patient care|
|Monitoring APIs|Device integration|Live health tracking|
|Pharmacy APIs|Prescription management|Simplified medication services|
|Insurance APIs|Coverage verification|Simplified billing process|

Our APIs let healthcare applications interact directly with various systems while maintaining HIPAA compliance. These APIs work with our platform's architecture to support:

1. Data Management
   * Clinical concept extraction
   * Protected health information removal
   * FHIR format transformation
2. System Connectivity
   * Wearable device integration
   * IoT device communication
   * Mobile app synchronization

# [**Payment Processing Solutions**](https://bask.health/payment-processing)

We‚Äôve found implementing resilient payment processing solutions that meet both HIPAA and PCI DSS requirements is preferable. Medical practice credit card processing is different from standard processing because of legal limitations.

Our payment integration framework recommends:

* Secure Payment Gateways
   * Encrypted transaction processing
   * Tokenization of payment data
   * Automated billing systems

Integrated payment solutions can substantially improve practice efficiency. Our system supports multiple payment models:

|**Payment Type**|**Features**|**Security Measures**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Direct Payments|Live processing|P2P encryption|
|Subscription Billing|Automated Recurring charges|Vault storage|
|Insurance Processing|Eligibility verification|HIPAA compliance|

Patient health information never appears on bills or receipts in our payment processing infrastructure. We have also suggested implementing:

* Direct payment solutions for custom telehealth software
* Integrated appointment POS software
* Complete billing management tools
* Automated insurance verification systems

Our platform's payment capabilities support various revenue models with subscription billing capabilities and integrated payment platforms designed for virtual practices. Our merchant services maintain both PCI compliance and HIPAA standards to protect business and patient data throughout all transactions.

These integration capabilities help healthcare startups:

* Connect naturally with existing healthcare systems
* Maintain regulatory compliance across all integrations
* Scale operations as patient volume grows
* Reduce administrative overhead through automation

Our steadfast dedication to interoperability goes beyond simple connectivity. We support the US Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology's requirements for secure standards-based APIs. This ensures patients retain control of their electronic health information while healthcare providers can efficiently manage and scale their practices.

# [**Scaling Your Telehealth Business**](https://www.responsify.com/telehealth-strategy)

Building a successful telehealth business goes beyond implementing the right technology. Bask Health has seen¬†[telehealth visits increase by 933%](https://www.healthcatalyst.com/learn/insights/scale-telehealth-solutions-to-increase-access-during-covid-19)¬†since early 2020, which shows the massive growth potential in this sector.

# User Acquisition Strategies

Patient acquisition and retention need a comprehensive approach. Our experience shows that skilled nurse triage can resolve about half of all telehealth consultation calls. This creates an affordable patient acquisition funnel. We suggest you focus on:

* Digital Marketing Optimization
   * Website content optimization
   * Search engine marketing
   * Social media involvement
   * Patient testimonials

We've observed that telehealth services can cut costs by 67% with simplified processes. We help startups implement targeted acquisition strategies that maximize return on investment.

# Platform Performance Optimization

Platform performance directly affects¬†[patient satisfaction and retention](https://bask.health/blog/implementing-telehealth-in-primary-care). Our analysis suggests tracking these key performance indicators (KPIs):

|**Metric Category**|**Key Measurements**|**Impact Assessment**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Technical Performance|Connection time, call drops|Service reliability|

Is TikTok's Ban Behind Vine Coin‚Äôs Sudden Surge?,SolanaMemeCoins,1i8w2dr,2025-01-24 09:02:44,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolanaMemeCoins/comments/1i8w2dr/is_tiktoks_ban_behind_vine_coins_sudden_surge/,Woodpecker5987,,"The recent ban on TikTok in the US has sent shockwaves through the social media world, leaving users searching for alternatives. Amid this chaos, Vine, a name many remember fondly as the original short-form video app, has started trending again, and its token, Vine Coin, just saw a massive pump. Could this be a reaction to TikTok‚Äôs ban, or is nostalgia for Vine driving speculation about its return to the social media spotlight?

  
Adding to the buzz, Vine Coin was recently listed on Bitget, sparking even more interest. But is this pump just temporary hype, or does it signal a real shift in the social media landscape? It‚Äôs fascinating to see how crypto and culture collide, especially when nostalgia and market movements meet in such a dynamic way."

"[Governance Poll Proposal] Establish the Donut DAO org; Decentralize, expand, and secure DONUT‚Äôs future beyond r/EthTrader",ethtrader,1i8smzx,2025-01-24 05:42:25,14,0.94,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1i8smzx/governance_poll_proposal_establish_the_donut_dao/,0xMarcAurel,Donut,"## TL;DR

This proposal is a huge step in shaping the future of the Donut ecosystem. It's about: 

1. Formally establishing Donut DAO as a decentralized, unregistered organization with the flexibility to grow beyond Reddit, allowing DONUT to continue to operate independently of any single subreddit or platform.
2. Transitioning DONUT‚Äôs structure to remove its dependency on r/EthTrader, making r/EthTrader as one arm of a broader organization.
3. Balancing the allocation of funds to create a more sustainable and equitable distribution model.
4. Clearly defining roles and responsibilities for Donut DAO contributors, while ensuring fair compensation for their efforts.
5. Optimizing leadership and governance by welcoming new contributors and reevaluating inactive roles (moderators, multisig guardians).

The objective is to create a robust foundation that supports growth, decentralization, and the sustainability of DONUT, while rewarding content creators, contributors and giving power to the community.

The focus of this organization is to give contributors opportunities to grow, connect with other interested individuals, build a professional portfolio, and receive compensation in the process. Thus, the Donut DAO would create an environment of mutual benefit and recognition for all participants.

---

## Current situation

For too long, the mod team has relied on a ""mint more DONUT whenever we run out"" approach. This may've worked 5 or 6 years ago, but it‚Äôs no longer effective considering DONUT is now a valued asset, subject to market mechanics. Also, with regulatory scrutiny increasing, it‚Äôs time we collectively reassess our current practices, formalize our policies / structure, and establish a more strategic approach to DONUT minting and allocation.

As a SocialFi token, DONUT‚Äôs primary purpose is to reward content creators and promote decentralized governance. To fulfill this mission, a dedicated team is essential. We need people responsible for maintaining operations, promoting growth, and investing on long-term sustainability.

This proposal is probably the most significant and complex initiative we have ever had as a DAO. Submitting dozens of individual proposals would be a lot more complex and would delay important progress. This is a consolidated proposal that reflects the collective insights of the mod team, and is the result of internal discussions and team calls. Our vision is to position DONUT as a project that goes beyond r/EthTrader, making sure its growth is not limited by the subreddit‚Äôs boundaries. In this structure, r/EthTrader will be a branch of a broader ecosystem, known as the Donut DAO (proposed below).

---

## Problem

We're going to be fully transparent with the community, the current structure and team reached a pivotal crossroads. Even though our project made significant progress, the current structure has shown limitations that could compromise growth, sustainability and even operations's maintenance.

Right now, there is formally no team or organization responsible for promoting DONUT. Technically it's the mod team and the community as a whole. While this flexibility worked in the early stages, it now creates uncertainty regarding the project's purpose, reach, and goals. What worked 6 years ago no longer works today, especially in the Web3 industry that changes by the day. To attract serious contributors and partnerships, establishing and formalizing a decentralized entity is important. Without this, we risk, once again, stagnation and missed opportunities to expand.

Another problem is the existing reward and funding structure. This model led to concerns about managing resources and a lack of reserves for future growth initiatives. If this issue is not addressed, this project will struggle to fund new and current contributors, attract talent, or even finance ecosystem expansion.

Yet another problem is, over time, some roles within the project (like moderators and multisig guardians) have become inactive or loosely defined. This creates inefficiencies in important decisions.

Additionally, the absence of clear and fair compensation made it very difficult to recruit and retain contributors, leaving gaps in operational capabilities. In other words: people aren't receiving enough rewards for the value and work they provide.

Finally, DONUT has huge potential as a project, but its current visibility is confined largely to this sub. This limits its audience and adoption, making it harder to grow and compete in the Web3 industry.

---

## Solution

The solution goes through different steps to evolve our project into a sustainable, decentralized organization while focusing on its future.

Here are the proposed measures:

**1 - Establishing Donut DAO**

We propose transitioning our entire project into (a new) Donut DAO, an official, (legally speaking) unregistered decentralized organization.

DONUT‚Äôs success should not be limited by one platform or subreddit. We should aim to create a structure that can operate independently of Reddit, enabling expansion into other platforms or even transitioning into a whole new token category if needed. This protects the project from external risks, like changes to Reddit‚Äôs policies or infrastructure. DONUT would continue to work and grow even without Reddit or r/EthTrader.

Under this new organization, r/EthTrader would still be a vital part of the ecosystem, but the Donut DAO would be the overarching organization, positioning itself for broader opportunities and long-term survival. Simply put, r/EthTrader would be one of the many branches of the Donut DAO.

**2 - Structuring Donut DAO**

Donut DAO would operate as a decentralized organization, but with a defined structure that promotes efficiency and collaboration. This would promote a more collaborative approach, while giving clarity on roles and responsibilities.

The proposed structure is as follows:

* Co-founders: Responsible for partnerships, overseeing operations, managing the treasury, handling administrative tasks, grants, and ensuring the organization‚Äôs overall direction.

Proposed co-founders:

Carl Larson: Original developer of the Reddit community points system (DONUT) and an early contributor to the Ethereum ecosystem.

Basoosh: Veteran DONUT contributor, developer, formerly responsible for monthly distributions and currently responsible for the Donut Dashboard.

Marc Aurel: Ecosystem growth lead, responsible for partnerships, networking, business, and operations.

* Developers: Focus on maintaining and scaling DONUT‚Äôs technical infrastructure, including websites, subreddit tools, and others.

* Content moderators: Responsible for subreddit (in this case, r/EthTrader) and Discord management, aiming to promote healthy community engagement.

* Art sector: Focus on creating art for advertising, partnerships, and campaigns.

* Community sector: Organizing events, giveaways, and supporting users directly.

**3 - Optimizing DONUT allocation**

We propose reallocating the monthly DONUT distribution to optimize fund management, support development, and, most importantly, make sure contributors are compensated fairly.

The new proposed monthly allocation is:

* Content creation (subreddit distribution) [NO CHANGES]: 850,000 DONUT

510,000 DONUT for posts.

340,000 DONUT for comments.

* Liquidity incentives: 450,000 DONUT

Uniswap (ETH/DONUT V2 on Ethereum) reduced from 400,000 to 250,000 DONUT.

Sushi (ETH/DONUT V3 on Arbitrum One) increased from 150,000 to 200,000 DONUT.

Even though Ethereum is extremely important when it comes to liquidity, our DeFi operations take place on Arbitrum One. As such, we should aim to promote liquidity on Arbitrum, also to help the DAO unlock the remaining funds from the Arbitrum Grant (7,500 ARB).

* Community contests: 25,000 DONUT.

Reduced from 50,000, as this expense is unfortunately not having the desired effect and is not as impactful given the funds provided.

* Moderation [CEASES TO EXIST] 

* Community treasury [CEASES TO EXIST]

* Donut DAO treasury: 415,000 DONUT, distributed as follows:

Developers: 30,000 DONUT/month (+ grants as needed).

Moderators: 15,000 DONUT/month.

Community (community contributors that are not moderators): 5,000 DONUT/month.

Art: Funded via grants based on project proposals.

After covering monthly expenses, there would be ~200,000 - 230,000 DONUT remaining, according to the current size of the team. These funds would be reserved for the art sector, additional grants, strategic investments, or any extra necessity. Also, there are additional operational costs such as the u/donut-bot server, among other small expenses.

Although 1,740,000 Donuts are available for distribution each month, as you can see the funds disappear almost instantly due to the treasury's expenses needed to finance operations.

**4 - Restructuring and optimizing mod sector and the multisig**

This is not easy to address, but it has to be done nonetheless. To ensure accountability, we propose the following contributor activity policy:

1 month of inactivity: Contributor is defunded.

3 months of inactivity: Contributor is removed from the organization. Rejoining is an option if the contributor becomes active again in the future.

We propose this policy to promote fairness, because funds allocated to inactive members could be redirected to active contributors or other strategic initiatives. We recommend removing inactive members due to sensitive information about the project and to maintain the integrity of our work. Active contributors are important for progress and internal decisions, and people who are inactive can disrupt ongoing efforts. Internal decisions are made democratically, and inactive members who don‚Äôt vote can unintentionally stall progress.

As for multisig guardians, members inactive for 3+ months would also be removed, to make sure the treasury is protected by individuals who are actively involved and aware of ecosystem developments. The multisig must always have a minimum of five active guardians to maintain security and decentralization.  In the future, potential guardians may be added, provided that they gained the trust of the organization and the community as a whole.

**5 - Immediate goals if this proposal passes**

If this proposal is approved, the following topics would be addressed immediately:

* Build an official Donut DAO website, a dedicated platform to communicate the Donut DAO‚Äôs mission, goals, and updates. It would be separate from the Donut Dashboard.
* Create an official X account to promote DONUT and engage in marketing campaigns.
* Assign roles and responsibilities to make sure all teams are ready and equipped to contribute effectively.
* Host monthly meetings to regularly assess progress and adjust strategies. *A future idea is to allow DONUT whales to attend meetings.*
* Post monthly treasury flow reports. This includes expenses and inflows, to promote transparency and trust.

---

## Advantages

* Establishes a professional and organized structure, incrasing credibility and trust among users and potential partners.
* Enables strategic fund management, protecting the sustainability and efficiency of operations.
* Creates a self sustaining economy with DONUT as its foundation.
* Promotes fair compensation for contributors, based on their skills, efforts, and activity levels.
* Further increases decentralization by involving more contributors from different locations, promoting a more global perspective.
* Simplifies internal conflict resolution, particularly in cases of inactivity or disagreement, with clear policies in place.
* Distributes responsibilities and tasks efficiently, reducing the burden on individual contributors. Contributors can focus on their specific roles, for example devs will no longer need to moderate content and can focus on building instead.
* Ensures long term operations by reducing dependency on any single individual within the organization.
* Supports expansion beyond Reddit, making Reddit a vital branch of the broader Donut ecosystem, rather than it's pillar.
* Builds a foundation for growth, including potential integration into other social platforms or use cases.
* Promotes collaboration and transparency through a clearly defined structure and regular reporting.

## Disadvantages

* The proposed structure introduces high complexity, which could lead to overly bureaucratic processes.
* Contributors would have personal responsibility for legal and tax-related matters, which may create challenges depending on their location.
* Requires a lot of effort and coordination to establish the organization, onboard new contributors, and maintain communication between sectors.

---

## Conclusion

This proposal would create a path for DONUT to evolve into a resilient, decentralized organization capable of thriving in any scenario. If we transition to the proposed Donut DAO, we will make sure that DONUT is no longer tied to a single platform, allowing it to expand, adapt, and grow in new directions. It also creates a framework for long term sustainability through structured roles, decentralized decisions, and transparent operations.

There's one important thing to note. Without this proposal, there‚Äôs a huge risk that current challenges lead to reduced activity or disruptions to basic functions like distributions and the maintenance of donut-bot, and even abandonment. This means people leaving the project. We should practically acknowledge the risks we're facing right now and understand the consequences if proactive measures aren‚Äôt taken.

Just like everything, there are challenges involved. However, the benefits really outweigh the risks. This initiative would secure DONUT‚Äôs future.

If the community supports this proposal, we can build a robust, scalable ecosystem where DONUT continues to thrive regardless of individual or platform changes. Feel free to provide feedback or suggestions to change or add to this proposal.

* [YES]
* [ABSTAIN]
* [NO]

*This proposal will remain up for a minimum of 2 days, according to the [governance rules & guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/wiki/governance/). This proposal requires 2 moderators to sign it off in order to proceed to a governance snapshot vote. If approved, this proposal will automatically be queued for Governance Week.*"

That logic falls apart for several reasons. Many iconic characters weren‚Äôt the originals either. For example, Barry Allen wasn‚Äôt the first Flash‚ÄîJay Garrick was. Alan Scott was the first Green Lantern, and Carter Slade was the first Ghost Rider. Yet you don‚Äôt see these so-called ""fans"" claiming, ""Barry Allen isn‚Äôt the Flash"" or ""Johnny Blaze isn‚Äôt Ghost Rider."" They‚Äôre perfectly fine with characters inheriting mantles‚Äîas long as the new character is white. They had no issue with Bucky becoming Captain America or Terry McGinnis becoming Batman. The outrage only seems to come when characters of color take up mantles previously held by white characters."
"There is nothing wrong with Sam Wilson being Captain America, and there is nothing wrong with Miles Morales being Spider-Man.",Marvel,1i8pz1g,2025-01-24 02:19:14,871,0.79,430,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/1i8pz1g/there_is_nothing_wrong_with_sam_wilson_being/,ShadowOfDespair666,Comics ,"A lot of people call Sam Wilson and Miles Morales ""token"" characters, and they don't consider Sam Wilson ""Captain America"" or Miles Morales ""Spider-Man."" Because of this, I find it ironic. They never call any other characters that took the mantles of other heroes ""token.""

Barry Allen might be the more iconic Flash, but Barry wasn't the first‚ÄîJay Garrick was. Hal Jordan wasn't the first Green Lantern‚ÄîAlan Scott was. Yet no one calls Barry Allen, Hal Jordan, or Terry McGinnis ""token characters."" They only use this term for characters who are not white and take the mantle.

These people had no problems whatsoever with Terry McGinnis becoming Batman, but they have a problem with Miles Morales. There is nothing wrong with liking the original characters. If you think Peter Parker is the better and definitive Spider-Man, you'd be right. When most people think ""Captain America,"" they think Steve Rogers. When people think ""Spider-Man,"" they think Peter Parker.

But that doesn't mean other characters can't take the mantle. By that logic, Robbie Reyes is also a token character, and so is Danny Ketch. Honestly, even Johnny Blaze could be considered one because Johnny wasn't the OG Ghost Rider.

Let's also take into account that the multiverse exists. You can have someone else become Spider-Man. You can have a universe where Peter Parker is a cool, brooding jock, Uncle Ben is a sexy young construction worker, and Aunt May is a model or something. You can have a universe where Harry Osborn gets bitten by the spider, and he basically becomes a Batman √ó Spider-Man hybrid‚Äîhe‚Äôs a billionaire with a spider cave, spider mobile, and his own Alfred, etc.

These people just have problems with POC taking on the mantle of white characters. They have no problem with white characters taking on the mantle of other white characters (e.g., Jay Garrick/Barry Allen, Alan Scott/Hal Jordan). What further proves my point is that they didn‚Äôt have a problem with Bucky becoming Captain America, but when Sam became Captain America, suddenly it‚Äôs an issue. They had no problem with Ben Reilly, Miguel O‚ÄôHara, or Kaine becoming Spider-Man, but for Miles, it‚Äôs a problem."
ALON: Diamonds in the Meme Dust,CryptoMars,1i8pyr0,2025-01-24 02:18:39,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMars/comments/1i8pyr0/alon_diamonds_in_the_meme_dust/,Such-Obligation1409,MEMECOIN,"In the burgeoning landscape of decentralized finance (DeFi), meme coins have emerged as a unique and often volatile phenomenon. Characterized by their often whimsical origins and rapid price fluctuations, these tokens have captured the imagination of many within the crypto community. While their value propositions may be less defined than traditional cryptocurrencies, they serve as a testament to the innovative and experimental spirit that permeates the DeFi ecosystem.

$ALON, a prominent example within this space, exemplifies the decentralized nature of meme coin development. While Pumpfun's CTO, Alon, now plays a significant role in its trajectory, he was not the initial creator of the token. Instead, Alon assumed stewardship of the existing Telegram group dedicated to $ALON, which had been established over half a year prior. Furthermore, he demonstrated his commitment to the project by funding its listing on Dexscreener, a prominent platform for decentralized exchange (DEX) data.

Alon's involvement with $ALON extends beyond mere technical support. He articulates a profound perspective on the evolving landscape of meme coins: ""In a world with permissionless asset creation, most people will have their own coins."" This observation underscores the democratization of token creation within the DeFi space, where individuals and communities can readily launch their own cryptocurrencies. Recognizing this reality, Alon advocates for a proactive approach: ""That being said, it's probably best to agree on one for yourself relatively early so people don't get farmed on other ones/engage in PVP."" This statement highlights the potential pitfalls of navigating the burgeoning meme coin ecosystem, such as exploitation by other projects (farming) and the inherent competition (PVP) that can arise within this decentralized space.

$ALON has made its debut on multiple centralized exchanges, with BingX being the standout platform. Let's watch as $ALON rockets to new heights!

HELP REQUEST: Sites served by Caddy + Cloudflare suddenly not working,selfhosted,1i8lj5v,2025-01-23 21:52:45,1,0.67,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1i8lj5v/help_request_sites_served_by_caddy_cloudflare/,trynafindavalidname,,"# **EDIT**
Problem solved, see the ending of the post!

## Please help!
Hi everyone!
This is the first time that I've done something like this, so if this is breaking any rules, please let me know. With that being said, **I'm quite desperate for some help on this issue.** I've exhausted what feels like every resource and I'm not sure where to turn at this point. I've been fighting it for two days now! I'm going to try to provide as much information as is necessary, which might be a lot. If you read the whole thing, I genuinely appreciate it.

## The Context
I recently underwent moving many of my Docker containers in my home network from my Synology NAS to a new PC that I built. On the Synology, I served apps through the free domain (e.g., `<subdomain>.mattdies.synology.me`) and used the built-in reverse proxy and ACLs from the web GUI (DSM) to limit traffic to certain sites as local-only. I wanted to make the move to Caddy, as I've heard a lot of great things about it. I bought my domain through Cloudflare and started!

## Caddy + Cloudflare Setup
The first step was to set up NAT loopback, so that Caddy could distinguish between local and remote traffic. To do this, I went to the Pi-hole web GUIs for each domain I was setting up and added an `A` record within the local DNS. This sent traffic straight to Caddy without leaving the network. This allowed me to block remote traffic with the following snippet, which works great:
```
(local_network_only) {
	@external not remote_ip 192.168.1.0/24
	respond @external 403
}
```

Next I obviously added the records into Cloudflare. While there, I was sure to set some settings for security. For example, I created a rule to delete `X-Forwarded-For` headers, since they're easy to spoof. I set the SSL/TLS encryption to `Full (strict)` (""Enable encryption end-to-end and enforce validation on origin certificates. Use Cloudflare‚Äôs Origin CA to generate certificates for your origin."") as well. 

This leads me to the final component of the Caddy setup: the Cloudflare plugins. I build a custom Caddy image containing a few plugins with the below Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
# Let's build a custom image to add a rate-limiting module
# For more information, see ""Adding custom Caddy modules"" on the below:
# https://hub.docker.com/_/caddy

ARG CADDY_VERSION=2

FROM caddy:${CADDY_VERSION}-builder-alpine AS builder

RUN <<EOF
xcaddy build \
    --with github.com/mholt/caddy-ratelimit \
    --with github.com/caddy-dns/cloudflare \
    --with github.com/WeidiDeng/caddy-cloudflare-ip
EOF

# -----------------

ARG CADDY_VERSION=2

FROM caddy:${CADDY_VERSION}-alpine

COPY --from=builder /usr/bin/caddy /usr/bin/caddy
COPY docker-entrypoint.sh /docker-entrypoint.sh

RUN chmod a+x /docker-entrypoint.sh

ENTRYPOINT [ ""/docker-entrypoint.sh"", ""caddy"", ""run"", ""--config"", ""/etc/caddy/Caddyfile"" ]
```
This allows me to set the Cloudflare IPs as the trusted proxies in the Caddyfile's global settings:
```
# Global Options
{
	servers {
		trusted_proxies cloudflare {
			interval 12h
			timeout 15s
		}
	}
}
```
and to create and use a snippet for letting Cloudflare handle the TLS:
```
(cloudflare_dns) {
	tls {
        dns cloudflare {env.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}
    }
}
```
As you might imagine, the environment variable is set by my `/docker-entrypoint.sh` script by reading the value from Docker secret files. **I've confirmed that this variable is set correctly many times over.**

Finally, running Caddy. I use the standard compose recommendation, with some slight modifications. I won't post it here but can in the comments if desired. Here's a snippet of a reverse proxy:
```
mealie.mattdies.com {
	import cloudflare_dns
	import log_for_app ""mealie""
 	import rate_limit_api
	reverse_proxy mealie:9000
}
```

This was working great! When accessing the webpage locally, it routes me directly to the webpage without leaving the network:
```
$ nslookup mealie.mattdies.com
Server:		192.168.1.100
Address:	192.168.1.100#53

Name:	mealie.mattdies.com
Address: 192.168.1.102
Name:	mealie.mattdies.com
Address: 2606:4700:3036::ac43:80f6
Name:	mealie.mattdies.com
Address: 2606:4700:3030::6815:15c
```
and I was able to access it from anywhere! I confirmed this by using my phone and turning off the wi-fi, as well as checking it from outside of the network.

## Finally, the Problem
I was so happy with my new setup that I started to delete everything from the server and tighten up the security. **I did not change any settings in my router w.r.t. port forwarding nor firewall.** I thought nothing of it and went to work the next day. When checking Mealie from the office, it wasn't loading. Instead, I was greeted with Cloudflare's 522 status code page, informing me that the request was correctly proxied to the website, but the host was unresponsive. It mentions that this is typically a resource-related problem, but this is not true; checks with `top`, `htop`, and even `nvidia-smi` (hey, I was desperate to find a cause) show no abnormal usage. Furthermore, it's not a firewall problem, as I tried disabling all firewalls on the network simultaneously (don't worry, it was a very fast check).

The webpages work perfectly when accessed locally. All night I've been accessing them, using Authelia redirects, the whole shebang. So the problem is definitely in the integration between Caddy and Cloudflare. A complication of this is that the 522 don't even cause logs within the Caddy container, so I don't have anything to offer in that department.

## So, what now?
I'd appreciate any help that anyone can offer; ideas, commands to run, firewall settings to check, **Cloudflare expertise**, and more. Especially the Cloudflare expertise, as this is where I'm lacking the most :)

Thank you!

---

When I mentioned above that it was working before but suddently stopped, I'm actually... not sure how it was ever working in the first place! I had a fundamental misunderstanding of what I should've routed to in CloudFlare.

My original entries routed the traffic to the public IP address of my *router*, which I thought I could forward along to my server internally. I instead adjusted the entries to use the public-facing URL of my *server*, and problem solved! Using this, you're able to use the following:
* **Full (strict) TLS/SSL encryption within Cloudflare:** ""Enable encryption end-to-end and enforce validation on origin certificates. Use Cloudflare‚Äôs Origin CA to generate certificates for your origin.""
* **Enable the proxy for your records within Cloudflare:** ""[A]llows Cloudflare to optimize, cache, and protect all requests to your application, as well as protect your origin server from DDoS attacks""

You might ask how these records are updated when the public IP address of your server may change. Well good news, there's [a plugin for that](https://github.com/mholt/caddy-dynamicdns)! This plugin, in combination with the one from above, lets Caddy handle the DDNS through Cloudflare for you. I use the following global configuration now:
```
{
	servers {
		trusted_proxies cloudflare {
			interval 12h
			timeout 15s
		}
	}
	dynamic_dns {
		provider cloudflare {env.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}
		domains {
			mattdies.com
		}
		versions ipv4  # only do ipv4 records
		dynamic_domains  # automatically look for records matching the domains above and handle those
	}
}
```
So... problem solved! I hope this post may help someone out in the future."
WAN topic? Two revolutionary AI models released this week - cheap AI for everyone,LinusTechTips,1i8l16a,2025-01-23 21:27:26,0,0.5,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/1i8l16a/wan_topic_two_revolutionary_ai_models_released/,Heliummy,WAN Show,"First, DeepSeek released a new, fully open-source, AI model, called R1, that not only rivals, but often out-performs the best alternatives, while costing only 3% of what OpenAI does.

https://preview.redd.it/iqxcfjn8ouee1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1859c83eac08213f0bfda71e16c1c62924e6ada

Senior Research Manager at NVIDIA, Dr. Jim Fan,¬†[pointed-out](https://x.com/DrJimFan/status/1881353126210687089)¬†how ironic it is that a non-US company has taken over the open-source AI mantle, given that was OpenAI's original, but unfulfilled mission.

Here's insightful commentary on the¬†[significance of DeepSeek](https://x.com/RnaudBertrand/status/1881709223152878000), to competitors and innovators. An excerpt:

>Most people probably don't realize how bad news China's Deepseek is for OpenAI.

>They've come up with a model that matches and even exceeds OpenAI's latest model o1 on various benchmarks, and they're charging just 3% of the price. It's essentially as if someone had released a mobile on par with the iPhone but was selling it for $30 instead of $1000. It's this dramatic. What's more, they're releasing it open-source so you even have the option - which OpenAI doesn't offer - of not using their API at all and running the model for ""free"" yourself.

>If you're an OpenAI customer today you're obviously going to start asking yourself some questions, like ""wait, why exactly should I be paying 30X more?"". This is pretty transformational stuff, it fundamentally challenges the economics of the market.

And [here's some commentary](https://x.com/RnaudBertrand/status/1881959757705269503)¬†from the same person on the contrast of philosophical approaches between OpenAI and DeepSeek's strategies.

Here's¬†[a thread](https://x.com/MatthewBerman/status/1881745530667278635)¬†of AI industry reactions to DeepSeek-R1.  
Here's¬†[a thread](https://x.com/minchoi/status/1882083798650851839)¬†showing some creative ways people have used DeepSeek-R1 one since its release.  
Here's¬†[a thread](https://x.com/henrythe9ths/status/1881663105341755580)¬†on some of DeepSeek's history.  
And [some commentary](https://x.com/NuryVittachi/status/1881861230966854010)¬†on DeepSeek.

DeepSeek R1 has reportedly sent US AI firms into a panic over how they can justify their high expenses when they're being outclassed for a micro-fraction of their costs.

https://preview.redd.it/2zdeym7ipuee1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa0a92e07a79b13b161ff00a29d5df501469eaa5

But now ByteDance has released its own AI model, named Doubao, which beats many US AI models in a variety of tests such as knowledge, math, reasoning and coding, which can be even cheaper than DeepSeek R1.

[https://x.com/deedydas/status/1882479771428544663](https://x.com/deedydas/status/1882479771428544663)

>ByteDance Doubao-1.5-pro matches GPT 4o benchmarks at 50x cheaper

>‚Äî $0.022/M cached input tokens, $0.11/M input, $0.275/M output  
‚Äî 5x cheaper than DeepSeek, >200x of o1  
‚Äî 32k + 256k context  
‚Äî sparse MoE architecture

>AI truly too cheap to meter.

US AI firms saw their AI models as money-printing machines, to be affordable for the already-rich, to make themselves richer. But Chinese AI firms came in and said 'how bout everyone gets it?'. And now now US firms are scrambling to figure-out what to do.

As Nvidia's Dr. Jim Fan said on the topic, ""The most entertaining outcome"" has become reality.

How do you know the email address to resend an email signup confirmation to?,Supabase,1i8kyf0,2025-01-23 21:23:26,4,0.84,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supabase/comments/1i8kyf0/how_do_you_know_the_email_address_to_resend_an/,offmilk,tips,"I'm stumped on the [*Resend an email signup confirmation*](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-setsession) flow, which is needed if a user lets their original confirmation email expire and needs to trigger a new one.

**How do I access the user's email address so they can one-click resend the confirmation email?** Or must I ask them to re-enter their email address?

Here's the problematic flow:

1. User signs up, receives a confirmation email with a link to verify their account. The default expiry time on that is 3600 seconds, or 1 hour.
2. User waits longer than 1 hour, then taps that link. It looks something like this in the email:

[*https://abc123.supabase.co/auth/v1/verify?token=pkce\_123456&type=signup&redirect\_to=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fauth%2Fcallback%3Ftype%3Dsignup*](https://abc123.supabase.co/auth/v1/verify?token=pkce_123456&type=signup&redirect_to=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fauth%2Fcallback%3Ftype%3Dsignup)

3. Because the link in this case has since expired, it resolves to something like:

[*http://localhost:3000/sign-in?redirect\_to=/protected#error=access\_denied&error\_code=otp\_expired&error\_description=Email+link+is+invalid+or+has+expired*](http://localhost:3000/sign-in?redirect_to=/protected#error=access_denied&error_code=otp_expired&error_description=Email+link+is+invalid+or+has+expired)

See how I can't access the user's email address at this point? If I could, I would at this point just give them a ""resend verification email"" button that is attached to a `resendVerificationEmailAction(searchParams.email)` action.

Even if I change the 'Confirm email' template to include the user's email as a searchParam (e.g. `<a href=""{{ .ConfirmationURL }}&email={{ .Email }}"">`), this is stripped and not accessible from the resolved error URL.

Any pointers are very much appreciated. I'm using Supabase in Next.js in a similar set up to the [official template](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-supabase), where `supabase/middleware.ts` and `auth/callback/route.ts` are involved."
FedEx Tracking API always return same response,FedEx,1i8kecp,2025-01-23 20:55:27,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/FedEx/comments/1i8kecp/fedex_tracking_api_always_return_same_response/,jerichoi224,Ask FedEx,"Hi, I'm trying to use the FedEx API, and am having some trouble with testing the Tracking API.  
Been using the API availble here: [https://developer.fedex.com/api/en-us/catalog.html](https://developer.fedex.com/api/en-us/catalog.html)

I've got the Auth Token using the **API Authorization** API, and tried using the **Track by Tracking Numbers** in the Track API. Been testing with Postman, with the following payload for the tracking API.

    ¬†{
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ""includeDetailedScans"": true,
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ""trackingInfo"": [
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† {

    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† }
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† }
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ]
    ¬† ¬† }

While, I do get a response, I've noticed whatever tracking Number I use, I get the same response. I wanted to see different resposnes by different status, but using any tracking number from FedEx pages, [websites 1](https://developer.fedex.com/api/en-aw/guides/api-reference.html#mocktrackingnumbersforfedexexpressandfedexground) or [website 2](https://www.fedex.com/en-us/developer/web-services/process.html) return the same as below. 

I've noticed only the 'output.completeTrackResults.trackingNumber' and 'output.completeTrackResults.TrackingNumberInfo' are the only values that change, and the status seems to be identical for every trakcing number, even probably non-existant numbers (such as '11' or 'aaa')

  
am I doing sth wrong? Below is the resposne I get every single time.

Do you prefer the Dawn of Souls logos for FFI and FFII or the 20th anniversary logos?,FinalFantasy,1i8k114,2025-01-23 20:36:30,1,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/1i8k114/do_you_prefer_the_dawn_of_souls_logos_for_ffi_and/,134340Goat,Final Fantasy General,"I notice that the 20th anniversary logos seem to have effectively replaced the DoS logos for the first two games, and honestly, I find that a bit of a shame.

Excellent Amano art no matter what, but I find that the DoS logos are just much more appealing. The 20th anniversary logos feel a little too detailed to me. The little tassels on the warrior's cape, the individual strands of hair going down Mateus's body. The best logos are generally the simplest ones. On top of that, the DoS logo for FFI pays homage to [the game's original box art](https://external-preview.redd.it/4MDcLrvKyFpVg6g1p9Riphk7xDf40T9wpntX906hzGw.jpg?auto=webp&s=7df094d242f7441a764eb3dd36fe0b036b28ab56). It's an iconic pose

I also think the posing/expressions are just more interesting. In the 20th anniversary art, the warrior/Mateus are just kind of standing there. Compared to the iconic warrior pose and Mateus's sort of trancelike state in the DoS art (I assume inspired by his [Heaven Emperor appearance](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/a/a8/Emeror_Soul_PSP.png/), or maybe the other way around) it just falls short for me

"""Native Rollups?""",loopringorg,1i8jtzm,2025-01-23 20:27:01,77,0.92,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/loopringorg/comments/1i8jtzm/native_rollups/,Iron_Monkey,‚ùì Unverified ‚ùì,"https://preview.redd.it/71g2smq5juee1.png?width=595&format=png&auto=webp&s=756897298c6a89e8db8e5e7b913756b4cc2e5c2e

**\^ \[**[**I highly recommend reading Uma Roy's fantastic summary of this proposal on Twitter**](https://x.com/pumatheuma/status/1880286929956270261) **+ replies\] \^**

**Disclaimer:** I am not an Ethereum developer.

I have decent understanding of general computer reasoning & logic, alongside some (*rusty*) basic coding skills in a few languages. **My interest in Loopring / Ethereum** stems almost exclusively from the **countless implications** which their successful adoption may very well bring about **within these next few upcoming years**, and **hold immense faith** in their ultimate **potential to drastically reform** how **our entire world & society** operates - **for the better**.

**I would heavily advise that you don't take any of my technical simplifications within this post as definite for the time being - and instead whenever possible: opt to learn directly from source materials / related experts.**

With how fresh [this recent proposal iteration](https://ethresear.ch/t/native-rollups-superpowers-from-l1-execution) actually is, I imagine that most Ethereum L2 teams/developers (*of those even currently focused on this*) are still brainstorming how all of this would work, and how their existing projects would fit in. Even on the Ethereum Research forum post, there have been several [replies over these past few days](https://ethresear.ch/t/native-rollups-superpowers-from-l1-execution/21517/9) following release which brought up some potential concerns with the current design, and are still yet to be answered.

There was [a post made here yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/loopringorg/comments/1i7b3d5/saw_vitalik_reposting_about_native_rollups_how/) asking if Native Rollups would mean inevitable obsolescence for Loopring, paired with a considerable amount of apocalyptic-tier reactions (*and unanswered calls for official team comment*). In hopes of somewhat easing the ongoing lack of any explanation whatsoever here (*non-team included*) since then, I wanted to make a quick (optimistic) summary of how I'm understanding everything so far:

* Any existing rollup can become 'Native' once the proposal is implemented:
   * In a similar manner to how Taiko is a '**Based**' zkEVM, but a (L2) zkEVM nonetheless
      * with 'Based' meaning that **Ethereum L1 stakers sequence Taiko's proposed blocks**, even if  validation for them being proposed in the first place is done via zkProofs
   * Loopring/any L2 Rollup would also be able to become '**Native**', but a L2 nonetheless
      * with 'Native' meaning that **they can essentially grab a precompiled valid proof + state from Ethereum L1**, without having to do it with an off-chain method such as zkProofs
   * Furthermore, a L2 Rollup also has the option to **become both 'Native' and 'Based'**
      * which would make them an '**ultrasound** rollup'
* Despite perhaps seeming like a no-brainer to become 'ultrasound'
   * Realistically, **we would most likely end up with a mix of all of these** across different rollups:
      * \[*'Based' / 'Native' / 'Ultrasound' / neither 'Based' nor 'Native'*\]
   * **Consider that if a Rollup**:
      * grabs a precompiled valid proof / state from Ethereum L1 (Native)
      * simply re-executes it
      * and asks Ethereum L1 stakers to sequence it for settlement (Based)
   * In the case of doing all three (Ultrasound):
      * They are asking Ethereum L1 to do a vast majority of the work throughout this entire process, and will therefore **incur heftier fees** (*depending on if 'Native' and/or 'Based'*)
      * If 'Native' and simply re-executing the provided precompilled proof: then rollup will also **limited to L1's inherit gas limits**
      * meanwhile **independent proof systems (e.g. zkProofs) are far more flexible with gas usage**: **customised splits** between partaking users, ability to **check gas fee total** prior to sending, **payment of gas using non-$ETH** tokens (**+ possible incentives**: *20% discount when paying for gas via $LRC on Loopring's protocol*) etc.

https://preview.redd.it/2c0lbhy0luee1.png?width=593&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f1dd79360c56f8e1fe4ca227bae81d4833c31bc

* Kind of brings us back to why having '*a healthy Taiko*' L2 is important for Loopring even now:
   * **Taiko incurs heavier fees due to gaining the privilege of L1 sequencing** (Based)
      * which **need to be offset by a healthy amount of users + constant transactions**, or otherwise fees and/or settlement speed would greatly suffer due to the increased cost from L1 sequencers
   * If 'Based' Taiko achieves stable overall performance, then **Loopring also benefits as a non-based L3**:
      * **By using its own zkProofs** for both internal L3 sequencing + validation without incurring L1 fees
      * with **resulting rollup blocks** (*in reality: thousands+ of L3 transactions*) **subsequentially being settled onto Taiko** and counted as a 'single transaction' block (alongside the many others which are already being made directly on Taiko as 'true single transactions').
      * **If the Loopring L3 zkProofs are implemented bug-free, and are sound in logic** (*e.g. no token dictating this process*): L3 block is settled on 'Based' Taiko **->** and the containing Taiko L2 block is settled by L1 sequencers **-> Loopring essentially inherits the best of both worlds**

Therefore, I am inclined to believe that **regardless of Native Rollups existing, the incentive to use Loopring as an L3 across various L2s should still remain** \- primarily due to the gas implications which make it counter-productive for everyone to be 'Native' / 'Ultrasound'?

Loopring L3s would still benefit from the underlying 'Native' / 'Based' / 'Ultrasound' properties of whichever L2 is being passed its zkProof blocks - while circumventing the increased gas & limitations, yet still retaining '***near-absolute***' **Ethereum L1 security inheritance** (*again, assuming the zkProofs used are bug-free + sound*)

* at the cost of the L3 proofs / sequencing technically not having '***absolute inheritance***'
   * (*achieveable throughout an entire transaction if made directly using 'Native' / 'Ultrasound' Rollups*)

Keep in mind that a lot of Loopring's value as a product originates from use in conjunction with its **Smart Wallet**:

* due to the sheer **convenience** (*yet minimal security tradeoff*) provided to its end users
   * for (*typically intended*) use as a **daily function, yet non-custodial, hot wallet**
* **natively intertwined with its L2 / L3 protocols** to create a **feature-rich & portable single-app  experience**
   * **simulataneously tailored towards performing a vast amount of financial tasks:**
   * ranging anywhere from **general Ethereum asset management**,
   * to **advanced day-trading** (*e.g. long/short positions for non-Ethereum assets w/ CEX liquidity & leverage*)

I'll conclude here because I didn't even intend for this to end up as long as it already has. As of now, **my main struggle** when trying to piece everything together - **is figuring out where the clear boundaries lay for what is considered valid use** when utilising a mix of ""Native"" and alternative proofs (e.g. ZK) layers, in the context of both:

**a) an individual rollup layer**

* **What optimisations can be made to a** 'Native' Rollup **precompiled proof** **prior to re-executing**?
   * **What are the limits** of this **before a proof is no longer valid / Rollup is no longer truly 'Native'**?

**b) multi-layer rollup stacks** recursively settling proofs on each other

* How would different **varying proofs types + degrees of 'Native' / 'Based'** affect performance / stability?
   * What should you analyse to determine **which stack is best optimised for needs** \+ **risk adversity level**?

**Just to clarify again: I'm not an Ethereum developer** ‚ÄºÔ∏è but rather just another (*currently* *very tired*) ape amongst the many of us here. Regardless, I thought this would still probably be worthwhile sharing given yesterday's sentiment - at least while we wait to receive official clarification from the Loopring team detailing their outlook on all of this.

We updated our API to by default parse any `send_message` tool calls into an `AssistantMessage` object in the message response (you can see all the response message types [here](https://docs.letta.com/quickstart#message-types)). Below is an example of a response object:

    {
      ""messages"": [
        {
          ""id"": ""message-29d8d17e-7c50-4289-8d0e-2bab988aa01e"",
          ""date"": ""2024-12-12T17:05:56+00:00"",
          ""message_type"": ""reasoning_message"",
          ""reasoning"": ""Feeling energized to chat! Ready to connect and share some positive vibes with Bob the Builder.""
        },
        {
          ""id"": ""message-29d8d17e-7c50-4289-8d0e-2bab988aa01e"",
          ""date"": ""2024-12-12T17:05:56+00:00"",
          ""message_type"": ""assistant_message"",
          ""assistant_message"": ""Hey! I'm feeling great, thanks for asking! How about you? What‚Äôs on your mind?""
        }
      ],
      ""usage"": {
        ""completion_tokens"": 56,
        ""prompt_tokens"": 2030,
        ""total_tokens"": 2086,
        ""step_count"": 1
      }
    }

If you want to keep the original behavior without the tool call parsing, you can pass in `use_assistant_message=false` (see more [here](https://docs.letta.com/api-reference/agents/messages/send)).

# üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß Built-in multi-agent support

Letta supports multi-agent in a style similar to [OpenAI swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm), where agents can communicate via tools and share state. We added built-in tools for cross-agent communication, either by specifying a target `agent_id` or agent tags. You can see documentation for build-in multi-agent tools [here](https://docs.letta.com/guides/agents/multi-agent).

# üîê Support for passing in password into the RESTClient (community contribution)

If you are using a Letta server in secure mode, you can pass in the password into the `RESTClient` with:

    client = RESTClient(base_url=""..."", password=""mypassword"")

This will pass in the password under the ""X-BARE-PASSWORD"" header.

# üê£ Alpha release of new Python/Node SDKs

We are moving to auto-generated SDKs with support for Python and Node. These are generated by our [REST API](https://docs.letta.com/api-reference/overview), so will fully match functionality in the REST API rather than being a subset.

**Python SDK:**  [https://github.com/letta-ai/letta-python](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta-python)

[5e][Online][LGBTQ+ friendly][18+] Looking to run a dungeon crawler campaign with a good balance of rp and combat,lfg,1i8eute,2025-01-23 16:40:07,6,0.69,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/1i8eute/5eonlinelgbtq_friendly18_looking_to_run_a_dungeon/,the_good_devillll,Player(s) wanted,"hi! two of my campaigns recently imploded so i wanted to see about organising another one. 

sessions will be from 6pm-12am GMT ish every other Saturday. (the time isn't set in stone yet but this will be the rough time I'd like to start)

info about the campaign:
- campaign starts at level 3. i run for strong characters so ill have a buffed up standard array and a free feat at levels 1, 4 and 8. i will say that this im not keen on super optimising damage wise or trying to break the game wise. you dont need to optimise characters for the campaign and i have this mainly so you dont have to pick between an ASI and a cool/flavourful feat. 

- there will be an overarching story and some plot points but im looking to run a dungeon crawler where you will go into a mine/dungeon and just explore. i will probably randomise some encounters and stuff but i will add a bit of structure based on the paths you take. 

- the tone will shift. there are likely to be a lot of silly and lighthearted moments but i also do enjoy emotional, serious and dark stories/story lines.

- the world is a homebrew world. it is fantasy with fantasy technology/mechanics currently going through a magitech revolution (very recently developed in world). i have parts developed but i am happy to add things if a player wants to for their character and it seems reasonable to the setting. 

- the morality of the world isnt the usual d&d rigidity. things arent usually evil or good by nature (though there are aspects of that in the world but it is clear that this is from societal and systemic causes/pressure so it is more nuanced)

- i wanna run the campaign for good-aligned or neutral but killing averse characters. i like to run games that are a bit more alive and that means that there may be consequences for killing every enemy willy nilly. (i homebrew non-lethal damage to be almost universal so this wont nerf characters). killing monsters and non-sentient creatures wouldnt be a massive issue but killing bandits might find out that they were unfortunately doing what they had to to make ends meet. 

- i like homebrew. i usually homebrew magic items for players that grow with them (we will work together to make your item fit your character). i also homebrew monsters a lot. i wanna use this campaign as a way to test homebrew as well so patient players who dont mind if i have to alter things as we go would be preferable. 

- i will have a hireling system. mainly because i love character creation (im an artist and a bit of a writer) and also would like to use them as a way to test mechanics i might wanna pass to players. it will be optional but ofc it would be something players would have to agree on to use or not. 

- i have a homebrew system that lets you reroll a d20 a certain amount of time a session and you have a wild magic surge. the tables are custom made so they wont be massively game breaking or risk a tpk like regular wild magic. 

- there will be body horror, regular horror and gore as story beats or as creatures in general. this is non-negotiable and not something im planning to remove. its not going to be everywhere in the campaign but if you are squeamish the campaign might not be for you. please keep this in mind

- the main background quest will be building up a town from scratch. there will be moments of downtime (usually a few days to a week) where your downtime activities will affect the town and its growth. you can make friends, invite people to the town, raise morale, aid the towns growth, suggest buildings to be built, etc. this means that there will be moments of roleplay heavy sessions. also your actions will affect aspects of the world. 

- i have a few homebrew races. mainly animal people and half animals.

- strictly no horny characters. im asexual and do not feel comfortable running for players who wanna rp sex (even hinting to it). there will be themed creatures (succubi and incubi are very much possible to come across) but aside from how they dress or talk nothing explicit will be said or happen. 

- most of the rules will be 5e2014 but im happy to allow some 5e2024 if asked and it wont require me to learn too much about it. i usually recommend certain classes using 2024 over the original cause imo they're better (rogue, monk and warlock for example)

- the campaign will be run on roll20 and we'll call and communicate through a discord server I'll make


about me as a dm:
- im very descriptive! i like to describe in detail what characters are doing if not specified and even in battle enemies will talk and i will describe their attacks woth flair. you are free to describe your own flair 

- very into character building so a lot of characters will be quite fleshed out and complex

- i like to reward creativity. if you would like to craft something, learn something or do something from your imagination i wanna try and allow it. ofc within reason but i like players who are happy to ask. combat will be mostly be by the rules but i will still try to reward you if you wanna try something unique 

- i am so so big on communication. i dont know how to read hints or rooms at all and wont know if ive said something to upset people or if someone is feeling left out. please do join the campaign if you're comfortable putting down boundaries and okay with mentioning things youd like to do or that are bugging you directly. 

- i am not a ""realistic combat"" type girly. i will describe combat with flair, favouring cool stuff over realistic descriptions. (for example, i once had a player finish off a boss by launching the creature up in the air slightly with the first attack then jumping off the monster in middair to slam down on it with its second attack)

- i use theatre of mind unless we're in combat. i wont have a big map of a dungeon for people to crawl through with tokens. 


in your first message please give me some information:

- your timezone and availability 

- what draws you to my campaign and my post? (i prioritise people who have enthusiasm for my campaign specifically over those just looking for a game)

- what kind of character do you want to play? whether a specific character or just vibes you go for is fine. 

- any kind of questions about lore. i have a few deities that ive homebrewed and plan to flesh out the pantheon soon as well as how magic in the world works is different so there are things i can inform you about if asked. 

- any important info you wanna lemme know. 


if you tried to get into one of my games but didn't before please do try again! i only dont let people in sometimes cause i get lots of messages. 

im looking for roughly 4-5 players "

I'm facing an issue with embedding a MindStudio component in my Next.js project using the App Router. The embed doesn't load on the initial page visit; it only appears after performing a hard refresh.

I've tried using the `next/script` component to dynamically load the embed script, but the issue persists.

Has anyone encountered a similar problem or have suggestions for best practices to ensure the embed loads properly without requiring a hard refresh?

Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance.

# üéä Market-Driven Emissions Proposal

Solana's current inflation mechanism uses a fixed emissions schedule to reward validators and stakers who maintain the network's security.¬†

This schedule began with an 8% annual inflation rate at the network's launch, designed to incentivize early participation. This rate decreases by 15% each year and is expected to stabilize at 1.5% around 2030.

Validators play a key role, receiving newly issued SOL for validating transactions and sharing these rewards with stakers who delegate their tokens.¬†

These rewards are composed not only of emissions but also of transaction fees and Miner Extractable Value (MEV), which validators earn by strategically ordering transactions.

The fixed emissions schedule, while providing predictability, has limitations.¬†It doesn't adapt to changing network conditions, meaning token issuance remains constant regardless of the economic climate or staking levels.¬†

This rigidity was less of a concern when Solana was nascent and needed to attract validators. However, as the network matured, validators became less reliant on token emissions for income, supplementing it with MEV and transaction fees.

The current model continues to benefit stakers through emissions but dilutes the value of SOL held by non-stakers. This has raised concerns about inflation's impact on SOL's overall utility and attractiveness.

The proposed governance change,¬†[SIMD-0228](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/blob/5c9c06daddfb35b6dd9a9317bfa58ac2e52aee0f/proposals/0228-market-based-emission-mechanism.md?ref=blog.colosseum.org), introduces Smart Emissions, aiming to make inflation rates more responsive to real-time network conditions.¬†

The proposal sets a target staking participation rate of 50%, calculated as the total staked SOL divided by the circulating supply.

* If staking participation falls below 50%, the network would increase token emissions to incentivize more staking and bolster security.
* Conversely, if staking participation exceeds 50%, emissions would decrease to mitigate inflationary pressure and reduce staking rewards.

This adjustment would be programmatic, automatically responding to changes in staking levels.

The proposal includes upper and lower bounds for emissions.¬†

The upper bound would align with Solana's current inflation schedule, preventing excessive emissions. The lower bound would allow emissions to temporarily drop to zero if staking participation consistently surpasses the target.¬†

This flexibility allows the network to adapt without over-issuing tokens.

If implemented, this proposal could significantly alter Solana's economic dynamics. Validators and stakers might experience reduced rewards, especially if MEV revenue doesn't fully compensate for lower emissions.¬†

However, overall inflation would likely decrease, and SOL could even become deflationary over time, mitigating dilution for non-stakers and potentially improving $SOL's utility in DeFi.

This shift would mark a significant evolution in Solana's monetary policy, transitioning from fixed schedules to a more flexible and responsive model.

# ü§ñ Solana Virtual Machine

This deep-dive into Solana's SVM compares its multi-threaded, parallel processing capabilities to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), highlighting their fundamental differences and implications for developers.

It also talks about the key role of Sealevel, the technology that enables Solana to process transactions concurrently, and explains how localized fee markets further distinguish Solana from Ethereum‚Äôs global fee model.

For Solana developers, understanding the SVM is key to appreciating how its architecture supports dApps with unmatched efficiency.

By utilizing the full capacity of validator hardware, the SVM offers a game-changing alternative to the single-threaded EVM, which struggles with bottlenecks during peak demand.

This article will help deepen your understanding of what sets Solana apart from other blockchains and how the SVM opens new possibilities for dApp development.

# üí∞ Multicoin's Solana Thesis

Multicoin Capital‚Äôs latest thesis, authored by Kyle Samani, examines how Solana can play a central role in building what they describe as Internet Capital Markets.¬†

The report focuses on how Solana‚Äôs technology and ecosystem have matured to address challenges in finance, with an emphasis on efficiency, accessibility, and scalability.

Since its early days in 2018, Solana has grown significantly, now valued at $100 billion.¬†

It has one of the fastest-growing developer ecosystems and has surpassed Ethereum in several key metrics, including trading volumes and daily active addresses.¬†

Multicoin views Solana as a platform capable of outperforming TradFi systems, not just on cost and speed, but also by retaining blockchain-native features like permissionless access and composability.

A central argument is that Solana has the potential to reduce financial services fees by up to 99% while still increasing its market cap to exceed major financial incumbents.

The thesis explains that while payments are not a primary revenue driver for blockchains, they are essential for adoption.

Solana‚Äôs transaction fees are extremely low, making it far cheaper than traditional payment systems. This affordability, coupled with its ease of use, encourages the growth of wallet adoption and ecosystem engagement.

Some of the key factors that Kyle highlights in this report are:¬†

* Introduction of Conditional Liquidity to tighten spreads and reduce risks for market makers
* Implementation of Multiple Concurrent Leaders to decentralize price discovery and reduce latency
* Capable of handling traditional assets, crypto-native assets, and new financial instruments
* Revenue and Value Growth Through MEV
* Expanding Total Addressable Market¬†
* Expected to play a larger role in global finance as blockchain adoption grows

The report describes Solana‚Äôs broader goal as creating a permissionless financial system that integrates low fees, global accessibility, real-time auditability, and composability.¬†

While Solana serves as the infrastructure, its ecosystem is designed to support¬† both traditional and crypto-native assets while enabling new market opportunities.

üîÆ ***About My Games***

In the last five years, I have come to be very familiar with the Jim Henson Labyrinth Adventure Game system, having played in two games and run a long-term campaign of it that lasted over a year.

I usually like to play with a group of no more than 6 players, and find that I enjoy myself most when I am seated at the table with other young queer folk. I have run sessions as short as an hour apiece and as long as ten hours, but I always enjoy some good text-based out-of-session roleplay between sessions as well. You can expect each player character to get a full, well-developed character arc throughout the course of the campaign, and during each session there will be loads of time for roleplay and character moments as well.

üîÆ ***About Session 0 and Character Creation***

Before our Session 0 as a group, I will spend roughly an hour one-on-one with each of you for character creation. We will spend that time setting your character's Goal, Traits, Flaws, and Equipment before we get started.

All of the player characters will start off as young adult humans, but as the wedding draws nearer and the Goblin Queen's power over you grows stronger, there will be opportunities for your characters to become creatures from the Labyrinth. If that is something you'd like to play with, we will plan for it, and create a second version of your character as a Labyrinth Kin of your choice to be used later down the line. At the end, if the Goblin Queen is defeated or the wedding called off, your character will have the choice to return to human in the Outside or stay in the Labyrinth as a Kin.

Once characters are created, we will schedule our group Session 0 and work on character relationships and get to know each other before we begin playing. This will likely include some light in-character roleplay to get familiar with everyone.

# ‚ú® About the GM ‚ú®

Greetings adventurer! My name is Michael (they/them) and I am a ‚ú® master of the gaming ‚ú®

I am a lover of all things fantasy, and I have been playing 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons since it was released. I have also become familiar with Knave 2e, the Jim Henson's Labyrinth Adventure Game (a personal favorite), and Dungeons and Dragons 3.5e. I am a rule-of-cool, LGBTQIA+ friendly, homebrew loving GM who loves to collaborate with my players to breathe life into the worlds that we create. I love being able to say ""you can absolutely try"" to the wild and wacky ideas my players come up with, and figuring out ways to make it work.

As a GM, I strive to create an immersive and enjoyable experience for each and every one of my players. I may be terrible at accents and not know how most spells work without looking it up (Eldritch Blast is easy, ok), but I promise, you will have a wonderful time sitting at my table.

üîÆ ***More About Me***

I am a writer, reader, storyteller, and adventurer at heart. I am in my early 20s, but was lucky enough to be introduced to Dungeons & Dragons 3.5e when I was a kid (too young to be playing, honestly) and have been a player and occasional dungeon master ever since.

I spend my summer weekdays working at a state park and my summer weekends dancing, singing, and spending far too much money at the renaissance festival. In the winter, I work odd jobs and wait for the snow to go away so I can go back to doing what I love in the parks. I am getting married in a few years to my girlfriend, my starlight, who I am sure you will hear a lot about (not sorry). I often play Dead by Daylight, Red Dead Online, and Minecraft in my spare time."

"An in-depth analysis of the new Doom: The Dark Ages footage, story and universe details.",Doom,1i8blj6,2025-01-23 14:24:27,11,1.0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Doom/comments/1i8blj6/an_indepth_analysis_of_the_new_doom_the_dark_ages/,monologousmutilation,DOOM: The Dark Ages,"No point in a preamble. I tend to focus on the universe, story shit over gameplay, so keep that in mind.

Let's just get into it. I'll refer to this video for timestamps: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGFuaVUI6_E

- The robed figure at 1:13 looks interesting - potentially an Archdemon, as in the Hell governors introduced in the Doom Eternal art book.

- Interestingly we see a few glimpses of female Sentinels, the first time we've seen them in the series. Seeing Sentinels as individual characters and not just a background faction will be exciting.

- Demon design in this is interesting; they seem to be designing cybernetics with the intent that they look way different from 2016/Eternal's, likely because Hell is now using either local cybernetics like in the classic games, or pilfering Argenta resources.

- The Imp design is now as close to the classic games as it has ever been, with horns explicitly placed exactly where they're shown in the original sprites. Makes sense, considering the new games are eons after the classic games, while this is set in the same era as the originals from Hell's perspective.

- Hell Knights now have green energy around them, as seen in 2:55. Likely a reference to their nature in the classic games.

- Keeping with past games, zombified Sentinels seem to be enemies, as seen in 3:38.

- At 3:58 we get a clear view of the new (I guess old?) Arachnotron, which seems to be wholly organic (except for the mounted gun) instead of a cyborg as in all other games. Very interesting.

- At 4:10 we see a significantly more high-tech looking environment, which was shown briefly in the original teaser. It looks awfully like 2016's UAC base, but the UAC timeline-wise should not exist right now, other than the classic universe's version. There are still signs of gothic architecture here, though - I'm willing to bet this is a Sentinel base on another planet, likely Mars.

- We see more glimpses of this more overtly sci-fi environment throughout the teaser, but architecture is still a bit far away from distinct UAC.

- The difficulty system looks great and very in-depth - would be perfect for replays and ramping up certain difficulty aspects while keeping the artificial increases out.

- We see some Atlan gameplay at 6:58, and it convinces me the previously-mentioned sci-fi base environment is likely a Sentinel base on Mars. Note the distinctly red landscape and atmosphere.

- ""Mysterious worlds from the Slayer's past"" at 7:46. This is interesting, could imply Hell locations Doomguy saw after 64, or maybe even seeing the original classic universe again (unlikely). Could also mean Sentinel Prime, Exultia, or Taras Nabad, which we saw in Eternal.

- ""Worlds beyond"" at 7:54. This is also interesting, we could finally get a look at Drumavi, the alien world Hell invaded that is mentioned in the Doom Eternal Lorebook from the Collector's Edition.

- The skeleton at 8:00 is presumably the new way we collect items to help us level up, like the Praetor Suit tokens in Eternal. Skeletons of long-dead Sentinels is interesting.

- 8:13, funnily enough the Sentinels had their own UAC-like keycards. Also lends merit to us still seeing high-tech locations under the Argenta setting.

- The huge, sprawling mission described at 8:23, I suspect, could be the siege on Taras Nabad mentioned in Eternal. To recap, this was the Slayer's first mission after his Divinity Machine stuff, which culminated in him defeating the Dreadnought, whose corpse we see in the level in Eternal. The Titan at the end of this level looks a lot like the Dreadnought, but I suppose a lot of Titans have the same facial structure, so who knows? Also we see the Dreadnought come out of a pit, whereas in Eternal it was already sieging Taras Nabad before Doomguy became the Slayer. Note the look at a younger Commander Valen with dark hair at the beginning of this segment.

- Also note, at 8:29, the presence of a ""Hell battleship"" firing upon the city, as well as many Argenta citizens who are not wearing armor in the shot after. Very interesting to see normal civilian / maybe scientist getups for the Argenta after only seeing them in armor previously.

- Is that a statue of Valen at 8:51, or is my resolution just crusty?

- The structure at 8:59 looks like a metal monument to the Wraiths, maybe.

- The robed figure is back at 10:01, staring down the Slayer in his Atlan. Very interesting, and cements that this figure is probably very important. Again, an Archdemon? Perhaps the Dark Lord of the First Age? (Someone might try to correct me here. That's not Davoth. Davoth was before the First Age of Hell.)

- 10:10, the uncorrupted Deag Grav (or one of them, at least) consults with this robed figure. Given this shot I'm gonna assume the figure is the Dark Lord of the First Age, as Eternal said the Khan collaborated with the Dark Lord in making their pact! Perhaps the Deag are playing envoy to this character on the Khan's behalf. 

- That fat Maykr dude at 10:13 looks fucking wild and I have no clue what to make of him. 

- At 10:14, ""the Slayer is imprisoned at the start of the story."" Perhaps his serving the Maykrs was less consensual than originally implied in Eternal - it's likely the Maykrs are keeping him on a leash so he doesn't rebel, which is interesting. I would imagine the game will have us discover their treachery near the end of the game and find Nekravol, leading into the Argenta Civil War. Note the full quote: ‚ÄúWith the Slayer imprisoned at the start of our story the balance of power between good and evil is shifting and time is running out. **Our hero is a feared outsider among an imperilled people, his strength controlled by the gods they serve, in a world under siege by an ancient evil.‚Äù**

- 10:31, another female Argenta spotted. Again, super excited to see more individual Sentinel characters, and not just faceless soldiers. Right after this, another look at a younger Valen and then another look at this mysterious antagonist.

- 10:39, ""leads directly into the DOOM 2016 Slayer's Testaments."" This is an interesting line, considering the Slayer's Testaments seem to somewhat *begin* with the events of the classic games with the ""first age, first battle"" stuff. I find it likely they just mean the meat of the Slayer's Testaments, as in the era where he roams Hell after Argent D'Nur is lost. This is also interesting, because Eternal's lore implies there were years in between Argent D'Nur's war with Hell and the Betrayal that leads into the Testaments, as the Sentinels waged a civil war with themselves for a while after the Maykrs' treachery was discovered. Could be some retconning, or maybe my interpretation of that was just wrong? Who knows. 

- 10:43, the Slayer lunges at a Titan. If that's its face, could this be the Icon of Sin? It looks a lot like that to me, and the Eternal Lorebook says the Icon was present on Argent D'Nur after the Betrayal. Maybe this scene happens at the end of the game, after the Betrayal?

And that's all. Thanks for reading.

My personal prediction: **The humanoid demon in this trailer is the Dark Lord of the First Age, leader of Hell at this time period. The game will culminate in us learning the Maykrs are in league with the Dark Lord of the First Age and engineering this war to procure Argent Energy, and the climax of the game will either lead into the Argenta Civil War, or we will timeskip through it to end off at the Betrayal. I assume we will kill the Dark Lord of the First Age, ushering in the Second Age where the Slayer will roam Hell in his rage.**

EDIT: The preorder page confirms they are planning DLC for the campaign. **If that's the case, they could either cover the Argenta Civil War in this DLC, or, if we skip through it, show the beginning of the Slayer's eons-long rampage in Hell.**"
2025 Q1 Roadmap Update,duelnow,1i8bezs,2025-01-23 14:16:51,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/duelnow/comments/1i8bezs/2025_q1_roadmap_update/,Particular-Win-1966,,"https://preview.redd.it/4bul569pcree1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=84184d08d599bd339eb0f8e5547a636134488a98

In this update, we outline our achievements from the past year and provide a detailed look at what's coming in 2025. Our commitment to enhancing your experience and optimizing our platform continues to drive our roadmap forward.

**TLDR:** In Q1 2025, DuelNow will launch its token, revamp the user interface, and partner with a new odds provider for timely results. We'll introduce Membership Tiers and improve referrals, boosting user engagement and streamlining the sports prediction experience.¬†

# What We Accomplished in 2024

Last year was transformative for DuelNow. We **launched DuelNow** and several key features that have fundamentally improved how our users engage with sports predictions.

We released the Basketball integration, providing a broader sports offering. We joined an AMA on CryptoRand's Discord to engage the community, strengthening user connections and sharing insights into future plans.

Our social media presence saw impressive growth, with X/Twitter followers surpassing 75,000. We achieved a transaction volume of $1 million in Q4 2024, demonstrating the platform's strong momentum. We upgraded our Pick 'em feature to include game previews, new win options, and prediction sharing, boosting user interaction.

To improve accessibility, we enabled prediction browsing without an account, easing new user onboarding. We also launched a Referral Program to entice users to refer the product to their friends and a Quest & Points Program, rewarding users for participating in creating and joining sports predictions.

We also delivered the website Newsroom, which will act as the source of truth for all project updates.¬†

The strides we made in 2024 have laid a foundation for growth this year, enhancing DuelNow functionality and user engagement.¬†

# Plans for Q1 2025

The first quarter of 2025 is set to be a monumental period for DuelNow, with several significant initiatives planned:

* **Product Upgrade - Enhanced User Interface:** Expect a sleeker, more intuitive, and responsive design that simplifies the navigation and sports prediction process, enhancing your overall experience on the platform.
* **Token Launch:** Launching the token will revolutionize how users interact with sports predictions. DuelNow‚Äôs platform will provide unique ways to engage and benefit from our ecosystem.
* **Membership Tiers:** Hold our token in a connected wallet to unlock one of six membership tiers. Additional benefits include reduced platform fees and increased referral earnings.
* **Improved Referrals:** Increase from the original flat rate of 10% earned from referrers' platform fees based upon membership, giving you more significant opportunities to earn.
* **New Odds Data Provider:** We're upgrading our odds data integration to provide you with more accurate and timely sports prediction data, improving decision-making for all our users and processing resolved predictions faster.
* **Website Update:** We‚Äôre introducing new pages to simplify onboarding and provide clearer, more detailed information about DuelNow‚Äôs features.
* **Blog:** The blog will serve as a content marketing tool, helping us capture attention across niche topics, repurpose content for social media, and drive organic search traffic.
