"Decentr $DEC - Microcap ($193k), DePIN, Established Working Product!",CryptoMoonShots,1i33gh3,2025-01-16 19:11:45,2,0.75,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1i33gh3/decentr_dec_microcap_193k_depin_established/,ZiggyStardustIOV,Other (chain not covered by other flairs),"I've posted about this before, but $DEC for the Decentr browser is going to explode. It's a fully functioning web3-native browser, built on cosmos SDK - this means it is IBC-enabled and can natively transfer between other cosmos SDK chains. They are onboarding trusted data brokers for browse to earn, only tied to the Decentr ID, so privacy-focussed. Because they are IBC-enabled, they are integrating other IBC chains to their browser for intuitive UI.

The DEC token itself is used to pay out for browse to earn, however data brokers will need to purchase the data using DEC, increasing demand. Additionally, the integrated apps will be purchased using DEC (but will be swapped to the relevant token as part of that process/transaction - DEC will effectively be the universal currency). There will also be direct debit card to DEC wallet support, so an all-in-one browser to access web3 intuitively and simply using the token.

They have already integrated Sentinel (DVPN), which is a decentralised VPN service, meaning a browser with a private identity, using VPN services which aren't traced to an individual (unless using a debit card to purchase) - if you were really inclined, using secret tokens (e.g., SAtom to move from one wallet to another) on Secret Network would also mean any swaps are hidden without a viewing key. They are actively working to integrate JKL, AKT and ORAI, which offer decentralised storage, computing and AI services respectively. Currently 193k market cap, but reached 2.5mil in the Dec 23 mini-bull - insanely low. Sitting at $0.0018 with ATH of $0.50.

Not financial advice, but I can't see how a cosmos-sdk web 3 browser, with integration for the DePin projects in the ecosystem, would stay so low MC-wise. Only issue at the moment is small pools and no CEX listings (they apparently have AscendEx, but I think it is the old ERC20 token). But otherwise, active project, great concept tech-wise, and financially very low MC. Would need to purchase via the Cosmos ecosystem at the moment, which may well be very lucrative prior to a major CEX listing... Keplr wallet, then ATOM or OSMO to Osmosis DEX would be the route from a CEX. I'm still expecting at least 100x at this level (NFA), which would still only be 20mil!

The browser is already established and functions really well. Picking up steam on Twitter at the moment."

# Summary

**BGB (Bitget)** dominated the **CEX tokens** with a jaw-dropping **970.2% surge**, followed by **WBT (WhiteBIT)** with **343.7%** and **GT (Gate.io)** at **263.1%**.

**BNB (Binance)** also delivered an impressive **132.2% gain** \- Considering BNB's MarketCap, this is an impressive gain but one would expect even more based on its huge userbase.

**HT (Huobi)** and **OKB (OKX)** underperformed, declining by **47.5%** and **11.6%**, respectively.

On the **DEX side**, **XLM (Stellar)** led with an impressive **271.9% surge**, while **UNI (Uniswap)** and **SUSHI (SushiSwap)** followed with **124.8%** and **54.7%** gains.

**OSMO (Osmosis)** suffered the steepest decline, falling by **71.1%**, followed by **JUP (Jupiter)** at **48.2%**. **LRC,RUNE, CAKE,1INCH** had decline as well - Considering the bull sentiments in 2024, such results could be worrying for their communites.

Overall, **CEX tokens outperformed DEX tokens** in 2024, showcasing stronger resilience and more User-friendliness, people still prefer and trust CEXs more than Dexs.

Numbers are based on CoinMarketCap (08.01.2024-08.01.2025)

2. When clicking Bridge, Error 404 appears.

IBC Swaps from OSMO chain to COREUM Chain work fine.

  
Thus there is no way to Swap back to OSMO or any other chain from COREUM.  It's currently a 1 Way Swap (OSMO ---> COREUM)!

  
Even if one tries to ""Send"" COREUM from COREUM Chain via IBC to Osmosis, the ""Send"" function is not compatible with HW (Ledger); it just hangs.

What happened to Osmosis TVL?,cosmosnetwork,1gnhrai,2024-11-09 14:25:02,9,0.84,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork/comments/1gnhrai/what_happened_to_osmosis_tvl/,VIXtrade,,"We used to see articles all the time a couple years ago how Osmosis TVL was nearly 2B.   It suddenly collapsed around May 2022 and  remains now at 104m on Defilama.
The osmosis.zone page says 583m assets on the platform.  (Not sure what the difference is)

Osmo market cap peaked at nearly 3.5B and collapsed to 300 m by June 2022. 

Did some whales move liquidity to some newer, whatever latest & greatest DeFi projects? Was this somehow because of the Terra/Luna collapse?  What  happened?  What's the real story with Osmosis?

These pools receive flat emissions from the vxASTRO dynamic emissions curve by default and therefore cannot be voted on.

2024 Crypto Bull Run: Altcoins with 10–30X Potential in Web3,2024CryptoBullRun,1fnmg2i,2024-09-23 10:56:39,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/2024CryptoBullRun/comments/1fnmg2i/2024_crypto_bull_run_altcoins_with_1030x/,Significant_Touch692,,"# While Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to capture headlines, several emerging projects offer untapped potential for significant returns. This article delves into promising altcoins, including Mande Network, Akash Network, Osmosis, Celestia, Stellar, Cosmos (ATOM), SAGA, Solana, CUDOS, and Nolus, while addressing the limitations of DeFi and DePIN and emphasizing the lasting impact of blockchain technology.

# The Limitations of DeFi and DePIN

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) have gained traction as revolutionary concepts. However, their scalability and sustainability are often called into question. According to a report by Chainalysis, over $1 billion was lost to DeFi hacks in 2022, highlighting significant vulnerabilities in these ecosystems.

The lack of robust service level agreements (SLAs) in DeFi protocols can lead to unreliable performance, while the decentralized nature makes accountability a challenge. Without clear liability, these platforms risk undermining user trust and operational integrity.

# The Enduring Appeal of Crypto Technology

Despite the challenges facing DeFi and DePIN, the fundamental technology of blockchain remains promising. According to a report by McKinsey, the global blockchain market could reach $1.4 trillion by 2030. The potential for transparency, security, and decentralization can revolutionize sectors like finance, healthcare, and logistics, driving the industry towards more sustainable and practical applications.

# Tokenization: Bridging the Gap Between Web2 and Web3

Tokenization represents a vital step in merging traditional finance (Web2) with blockchain innovations (Web3). By creating digital tokens for real-world assets — such as real estate, commodities, and intellectual property — new markets can emerge, increasing efficiency and transparency.

One of the most promising applications is in credit scoring. Traditional credit scoring methods often exclude underserved populations. Blockchain-based credit scoring systems can provide a more comprehensive assessment, fostering financial inclusion.

# Altcoins with Potential: A Closer Look

The upcoming bull run is poised to be influenced by factors such as institutional adoption, favorable regulations, and increasing public interest. Here are several altcoins to watch closely:

# Mande Network: A Hidden Gem with Exceptional Potential

**Token Symbol:** MAND

Mande Network is carving out its niche as a peer-to-peer credit scoring layer two solution, aiming to be the credibility hub for real-world applications in Web3. The project’s focus on organic growth, transparent engagement, and a highly experienced team enhances its appeal. With a low fully diluted valuation (FDV) and minimal exchange sprawl, Mande Network stands out as a compelling investment opportunity. It has the potential for 10–50X returns as it bridges the gap between digital identity and real-world applications.

# Osmosis: A Decentralized Exchange with Potential

**Token Symbol:** OSMO

Osmosis operates as a decentralized exchange (DEX) within the Cosmos ecosystem. It enables liquidity aggregation and incentivized pools, attracting a strong community. With its innovative features, Osmosis is well-positioned to become a leading DEX. However, as the DEX landscape matures, returns may be capped around 5X.

# Celestia: A Modular Blockchain Infrastructure

**Token Symbol:** TIA

Celestia is designed to improve scalability by separating consensus from application execution. This modular approach allows various decentralized applications to thrive without sacrificing security. While Celestia shows promise, its returns may also hover around the 5X mark as it works to establish itself.

# Stellar: A Scalable Payment Network

**Token Symbol:** XLM

Stellar focuses on cross-border payments and financial inclusion, with low transaction fees and fast confirmation times. While it has the potential to disrupt traditional finance, its best growth days may be behind it, limiting returns to approximately 5X.

# Cosmos (ATOM): A Network of Interconnected Blockchains

**Token Symbol:** ATOM

Cosmos aims to create an ecosystem of interconnected blockchains, fostering interoperability. However, concerns about its centralized decision-making and lack of community engagement have diminished its once-strong allure. Many analysts believe that Cosmos has lost its magic, making significant price appreciation unlikely in the near future.

# Akash Network: A Decentralized Cloud Computing Platform

**Token Symbol:** AKT

Akash provides decentralized cloud computing services, leveraging GPU power to offer affordable resources. However, its reliance on the NVIDIA narrative and existing hardware limits its scalability. The long-term sustainability of this model raises doubts about its growth potential.

# SAGA: A Blockchain Platform for Gaming

**Token Symbol:** SAGA

SAGA focuses on the gaming sector, but it suffers from a lack of solid fundamentals. While it could present opportunities for short sellers, those looking for long-term investment may find more promising options elsewhere.

# Solana: A High-Performance Blockchain

**Token Symbol:** SOL

Solana has gained popularity for its high transaction speeds and low fees. However, it has faced numerous technical challenges and concerns over its long-term sustainability. Given the hype surrounding it, Solana is viewed as one of the riskier bets, with returns potentially limited to 5X.

# CUDOS: A Decentralized Computing Network

**Token Symbol:** CUDOS

CUDOS aims to provide affordable cloud services through a decentralized network. While it has potential, its scalability and performance have yet to be fully tested. Investors should approach with caution, expecting moderate returns.

# Nolus: A Blockchain Platform for Decentralized Applications

**Token Symbol:** NLS

Nolus focuses on decentralized applications but has faced stability issues, impacting user trust. The team’s intentions seem genuine, but the platform’s reliability remains questionable. If Nolus can regain user confidence, it could present a 10X opportunity, but this will require significant effort.

# The Limitations of Bitcoin and Ethereum

Bitcoin and Ethereum have established themselves as industry leaders, but their potential for explosive growth is diminishing. The increasing institutional involvement, including ETFs and derivatives, has shifted these assets into a more regulated and less speculative realm. Analysts predict that both Bitcoin and Ethereum will see a maximum of 5X returns, particularly as regulatory frameworks tighten.

# The Decline of NFTs

NFTs, once the darling of the crypto world, appear to be losing traction. As interest wanes and fatigue sets in, many projects lack the substance needed for long-term viability. The NFT craze, largely driven by speculative hype during the COVID era, has resulted in declining enthusiasm and a search for more meaningful applications of blockchain technology.

# Conclusion

The next bull run in cryptocurrency is poised to be defined by altcoins that offer real-world applications and sustainable business models. Mande Network emerges as a standout opportunity, while other projects like Osmosis, Stellar, and Celestia show promise despite challenges. Investors should approach Bitcoin and Ethereum with caution, as their days of explosive growth seem behind them. As the industry evolves, the focus will likely shift towards practical solutions that bridge Web2 and Web3, paving the way for a more stable and prosperous crypto landscape.

Conduct thorough due diligence, assess the risks, and consider the transformative potential of these emerging technologies as you navigate the next phase of the cryptocurrency market."

Can Reverse Osmosis Remove All Contaminants from Tap Water?,u_KWaterTreatment,1ethkhr,2024-08-16 02:15:13,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_KWaterTreatment/comments/1ethkhr/can_reverse_osmosis_remove_all_contaminants_from/,KWaterTreatment,,"Reverse osmosis (RO) is a highly effective water filtration method, capable of removing a wide range of contaminants from tap water. The process works by forcing water through a semipermeable membrane, which blocks particles and substances larger than water molecules. RO can effectively remove common contaminants like chlorine, lead, arsenic, nitrates, fluoride, and dissolved salts, making the water significantly purer.

However, RO isn't perfect. While it removes many contaminants, it may not eliminate all of them. For instance, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), some pesticides, and certain bacteria and viruses might pass through the membrane if not coupled with additional filtration stages, such as activated carbon filters or UV treatment. Moreover, RO systems also remove beneficial minerals like calcium and magnesium, which may need to be reintroduced if desired.

In conclusion, while [reverse osmosis](https://www.kwater.com/whole-house-reverse-osmos) is highly effective, it may need to be part of a broader filtration system to ensure comprehensive water purification."

VELO is what OSMO is to Cosmos.

So if OSMO has reached almost a 3.5B MC in Cosmos what makes you think that VELO cannot reach the same or even more in OP L2 for ETH?

Think about it…

Specially now that ETH is going mainstream. 

We might even see the biggest DeFi season in history!

Créer des positions 'serrés' sur les pools d'osmosis zone,CryptoFR,1c74e5l,2024-04-18 10:13:34,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoFR/comments/1c74e5l/créer_des_positions_serrés_sur_les_pools_dosmosis/,HellionBerSSerK,,"Bonjour,

je poste ma demande sur la partie FR parce que le sub reddit des anglais m'amène une tonne de scammer qui envoient des mp sans arrêt...  
Bref, je voulais avoir votre avis sur ma manière de générer un revenu via les pools de liquidité d'osmosis.  
Pour ceux qui ne connaissent pas, il est possible en créant une position sur une pool de liquidité, de servir d'intermédiaire lors d'une transaction par une personne souhaitant convertir une crypto contre une autre. Il y a des dizaines de pools comme par exemple ATOM/OSMO, OSMO/USDC etc.

Sur ces pools, il existe la possibilité de créer une position que j'appelle 'serré' : Imaginons la pool OSMO/USDC où le prix de l'OSMO est de 0.90 USDC.  
Je peux donc placer une position entre 0.95 et 0.85 (avec 50% OSMO et 50% USDC) et ainsi, toute personne qui vont échanger de crypto entre ces 2 prix dans cette pool me rapportera un peu de récompenses (rewards). Plus tu reserres ta position, et plus tu gagnes en rentabilité. Par contre, à partir du moment où le prix a baissé en dessous de 0.85 ou augmenter au dessus de 0.95, alors ta position est inutile avec aucune reward possible et donc tu as respectivement soit récupéré 100% d'OSMO, soit 100% d'USDC.

  
J'ai commencé à bien comprendre le principe d'**impermanent loss** qui est le problème n°1 lorsque tu fais ce genre d'action : pour résumé, si le prix augmente pour l'un des actifs de ta pool et que l'autre stagne, alors lorsque tu retireras ta position, tu seras plus perdant que si tu avais juste posséder l'actif. En gros, tu as servi d'intermédiaire et tu as perdu de l'argent.  
Ce principal problème semble être lié surtout lorsque le prix d'un des actifs augmente énormement ( minimum x1,5 à son prix lorsque tu as créé ta position).  
Dans mon cas, mes ranges sont très serrés et donc j'ai considéré que ce facteur était amoindri.  
Par contre, j'imagine que **mon** problème n°1 serait :   
\- retirer ma position lorsqu'elle est **OUT**(en dehors de mon range) le plus vite possible. Pourquoi ? Et bien si on reprend mon cas de tout à l'heure ;  
\- Je dépose une position entre 0.85 et 0.95 avec 1000$, donc 530 OSMO et 500 USDC(\~environ).  
\- Si le prix vient à monter très brusquement à 1,20USDC, alors j'aurai été OUT à partir de 0.95, et je posséderai en théorie 1000USDC et 0 OSMO. Le prix de l'OSMO étant à 1,20 USDC, j'aurai pu avoir 530 OSMO x1,2 = 636$ + 500 USDC = 1136$.  
Un manque à gagner de 136$ si j'avais juste attendu et laisser mon argent grossir de lui-même.  
Si je quitte ma position avant d'être OUT, alors je peux la repositionner afin d'être en train de suivre le mouvement de cette paire de trade OSMO/USDC et ainsi continuer à récupérer les rewards.  
Mais cela à un coût au niveau de la réactivité d'action. Un bot serait une chose parfaite en soi pour ce genre de mission.

Cependant, dans tout ce que je dis, j'ai l'impression qu'il y a encore des choses sur lesquelles je me trompe, alors n'hésitez pas à me le mentionner si vous aussi, vous faites de la liquidity pool.

Merci à tous"

Gelotto isn't just another platform; it's a revolution. At its core is [**GLTO,**](https://blog.gelotto.io/the-gelotto-token-glto-a-brief-summary) Gelotto's proprietary cryptocurrency. This isn't just another coin to trade; it's the engine that powers the entire Gelotto experience, driving transactions and offering users a way to earn passively. GLTO is a non-inflationary token and all rewards are from real yield.

### Staking-as-the-house

SATH allows holders of the GLTO token to participate in the Gelotto platform by playing the role of ""the house"". When holders stake their GLTO as the house, this pool of GLTO becomes the house's money, against which games of chance are played. When a game against the house is won, GLTO is taken from each of the stakers (proportional to the amount of each stake relative to the total amount of GLTO in the pool) and sent to the winning player. When a game against the house is lost, the GLTO that was bet by the losing player is distributed to each staker (proportional to the amount of each staker's stake, as above).

If so, why are people staking they’re Coins instead of providing liquidity? I mean you get higher rewards and chances for liquid staking.

## Understanding the Gelotto Token [GLTO](https://app.osmosis.zone/?from=GLTO&to=OSMO)

Gelotto isn't just another platform; it's a revolution. At its core is [**GLTO,**](https://blog.gelotto.io/the-gelotto-token-glto-a-brief-summary) Gelotto's proprietary cryptocurrency. This isn't just another coin to trade; it's the engine that powers the entire Gelotto experience, driving transactions and offering users a way to earn passively. GLTO is a non-inflationary token and all rewards are from real yield.

&#x200B;

Gelotto is the pioneering Casino built on Cosmos, soon to be interoperable with [**ETH**](https://x.com/Gelotto2/status/1700268926494462148?s=20). ETH will become the liquidity layer for Gelotto, with the Cosmos ecosystem serving as the application layer, seamlessly bridging these two massive ecosystems!

### Staking-as-the-house

SATH allows holders of the GLTO token to participate in the Gelotto platform by playing the role of ""the house"". When holders stake their GLTO as the house, this pool of GLTO becomes the house's money, against which games of chance are played. When a game against the house is won, GLTO is taken from each of the stakers (proportional to the amount of each stake relative to the total amount of GLTO in the pool) and sent to the winning player. When a game against the house is lost, the GLTO that was bet by the losing player is distributed to each staker (proportional to the amount of each staker's stake, as above).

Hyperlane updated guide Part 2! A comprehensive guide on everything you NOW need to know to farm Hyperlane!,ethtrader,1bxfpyz,2024-04-06 12:30:49,12,0.73,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1bxfpyz/hyperlane_updated_guide_part_2_a_comprehensive/,Every_Hunt_160,Original Content,"Hi EthTrader fam, 

1 month ago I made a guide on Hyperlane: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1b77rnf/hyperlane\_farming\_guide\_what\_you\_need\_to\_know/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1b77rnf/hyperlane_farming_guide_what_you_need_to_know/) .  This guide is still relevant and I will be referring to it.

However since that guide, there are various new features in farming Hyperlane. So let's get right into it to that updated version!

**Number #1 priority: Push volume on Hyperlane on usenexus and** **bridge.inevm.com** : **Presenting my updated full step by step guide!**

(first few steps are similar to old guide, and now I add new steps)

I'd be explaining step by step how to actually do the steps 4-6 from CC2 here [https://twitter.com/CC2Ventures/status/1768183482503540995](https://twitter.com/CC2Ventures/status/1768183482503540995)

https://preview.redd.it/4wcg7tzmuvsc1.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=0893095f24d5f722314fb64be68ce355aa2b87e3

**Step 1**: You need TIA and a KEPLR wallet, so create a KEPLR wallet and buy TIA on your CEX (the more the better since gas fees are constant, I recommend minimum 10 TIA worth)

**Step 2:** After buying TIA from a CEX, withdraw TIA from your CEX to your KEPLR address on Celestia blockchain

**Step 3**: Go to [https://www.usenexus.org](https://www.usenexus.org/). Connect your KEPLR and your metamask that you farm Hyperlane. Select Celestia -> ARB

https://preview.redd.it/npd1wxetuvsc1.png?width=1348&format=png&auto=webp&s=59d0029104ab7dd3adb14b5499ecd233558805d7

3b) After bridging to ARB, select **ARB -> NEUTRON** (neutron is on KEPLR) and bridge TIA.n across

3c) After bridging to NEUTRON, select **NEUTRON -> Manta Pacfic** (on Metamask) and bridge TIA.n across

Step 4: Update from old guide: **Now, bridge Tia.n from Manta -> Neutron, then Tia from Neutron -> TIA**

**Step 5: Now, follow Step 4b and Step 5 of the CC2 guide**: 

a) Open Keplr wallet. Click on IBC send, Click Osmosis, and then send your Tia from Celestia to Osmosis chain (remember to leave a bit of Tia on Celestia for gas)

https://preview.redd.it/6h9c4rxhvvsc1.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=794d2858a6ee1c7f6d2a331c6da6d2eae033dd02

b) Go to app.osmosis.zone , and convert all the Osmosis Tia to Inj. 

(Tip: if you need Osmo for gas fees you can convert tia to osmo on Keplr wallet on the arrow logo at the bottom of Keplr wallet)

c) After step B is done, **IBC Send the Inj** from Osmosis chain **to Injective chain.** You are now ready for step 6.

**Step 6**: Go to [https://bridge.inevm.com/](https://bridge.inevm.com/) , connect Keplr wallet and metamask wallet

https://preview.redd.it/wcfv9v96wvsc1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=d90932a532a8eff5ba79925ba5ebac66f3381511

a) Send the Inj from Injective to inEVM. (Keplr to Metamask)

b) Send Inj from inEVM to Injective (Metamask to Keplr)

Now you have completed the full bridging route! There's a good chance you will qualify on BOTH your Keplr wallet and Metamask wallet, so cheers to dual farming!

**Tip 1**: Gas fees on Usenexus is up to 0.27 TIA (around $4) while gas fees on Inj is 0.03 Inj (around $1 or less) - it is significantly cheaper to use inj bridge, so this is something to bear in mind

**Tip 2:** Given the high gas fees, you should try to maximise as much volume per bridge as possible, since gas fee remains constant.

**Tip 3:** As CC2 said above, try to split the total of 5 - 6 transactions over a few days if possible - don't do them all in 1 day to avoid Sybil tagging risk.

**Number #2 priority: You can now push volume on merkly token bridge (but only on metamask)**

1) For bridging of ONFT on Merkly (which you should also do), see my earlier guide.

Now let's get into the volume:

https://preview.redd.it/387w52ezwvsc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a4c72ba080f025432f15681b5d203557f0232e3

Now on merkly, they recently released token bridge for Hyperlane.

I highly recommend to bridge from Scroll or Base, for dual farming since I am farming both Layer 2s (especially Scroll).

Currently there are only 4 chains with the option to bridge on Merkly: ARB, OP, Scroll, BASE

**Tip 1:** It is expensive to Bridge from Scroll -> Base, its cheapest to bridge from Scroll -> OP and next Scroll -> ARB ($1-$2 gas fees)

**Tip 2**: As I said above, this is great for dual farming. But disadvantage of this is that it only hits 1 wallet (compared to dual wallet farming on step 1 above), try to maximise by mainly using Scroll (dual farming)

**3. Cheapest way to increase transactions on hyperlane: Merkly HFT**

https://preview.redd.it/sgalyq1qxvsc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa27c9ef5febb63b39d7c8139a81fa9609c34197

This covers more chains then token bridge. But I still recommend using chains for dual farming, such as Scroll, PolygonZKEVM, and Base. 

Gas fees are around 8 cents to claim, 7 cents to bridge (15-20 cents in total) - if you bridge to Celo, Moonbeam or Gnosis.

**Tip 1: For merkly**, I recomemend using all 3 features (hNFT, HFT bridge, Token bridge) within 1 month - for Polyhedra drop they gave more points (and more ZK) to those who used multiple features.

**Priority #3: Adding Tia liquidity on Arbitrum on traderjoe** 

Please see my earlier guide for the full steps. This is rumoured to give a multiplier to a potential drop, so this is an important step as well.

 4) **Additional tip**: Tracking your progress by searching your wallet address on [https://explorer.hyperlane.xyz/](https://explorer.hyperlane.xyz/) 

So that's it! This guide covers everything you need to know about Hyperlane. I think i've said enough, this is a top 5 project I am farming and I am hopeful for juicy rewards - hope my tips are also useful and **DO NOT FADE** on this one!"

Top Altcoin Sectors/Narratives to Watch this Bull Run,AltStreetBets,1bfluew,2024-03-15 15:11:39,7,0.83,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/AltStreetBets/comments/1bfluew/top_altcoin_sectorsnarratives_to_watch_this_bull/,emlanis,DD,"As Bitcoin hits a new ATH at $73.7k, and Ethereum crosses $4k, the bull run has already kicked off. However, majority of altcoins are left behind with over 50% to break their ATHs. For me, this is a sign that we are still early on altcoins.

Another fascinating fact about this bull run is that there are some profitably interesting narratives or sectors to watch. I’ll be focusing on some of these narratives with examples of projects that are leading in each sector.



Artificial Intelligence - AI

AI tokens are cryptos that power AI-related projects, such as AI-powered portfolio management, image generation, pathfinding, and more. AI tokens may give their holders governance rights on the platform, or they are needed to pay for transactions on the platform. There are over 140 projects in the AI narrative zone, with a combined market cap of $28.6 billion. Some notable projects that are leading the AI category are [Fetch.ai](http://Fetch.ai) (FET) with a market cap of $2.9 billion, Render (RNDR) with a market cap of $4.6 billion, and Akash Network (AKT) with a market cap of $1.4 billion.



DePIN

DePIN refers to Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks which utilize blockchain and tokenized incentives to build real-world infrastructure across areas like wireless networks, storage, geolocation, transportation, and energy. There are over 70 projects making waves in the DePIN narrative zone, with a combined market cap of over $31 billion. Some notable projects that are leading the DePIN category are Filecoin (FIL) with a $5.8 billion market cap and Arweave (AR) with a $2.6 billion market cap. Peaq Network is another promising DePIN project which is going live on the mainnet, with its ecosystem dubbed to be the hub for DePIN projects to thrive.



DeCC

DeCC refers to Decentralized Confidential Compute. Data confidentiality is a critical factor for DePIN and AI to work properly, and DeCC strengthens dApps that work this way. DeCC is a new narrative that’s been gaining momentum in the space. It’s a decentralized autonomous secure computing innovation to support the growth of DePIN and AI. There are a few projects leading the DeCC narrative, with a combined market cap of $1.8 billion. Some notable projects in the DeCC zone are Secret Network (SCRT) with a market cap of $179 million and Phala Network (PHA) with a market cap of $128 million.



SocialFi

SocialFi is also a hot narrative in this bull run. There are over 60 projects that are making an impact in the SocialFi space with a combined market cap of $7.1 billion. Some notable projects are Galxe (GAL) with a market cap of $492.2 million and Theta Network (THETA) with a market cap of $3.6 billion.



DEX

DEXes are Decentralized Exchanges. DEX projects are platforms built on blockchain technology that allow users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with one another without the need for a central authority or intermediary. There are over 160 projects in the DEX category with a combined market cap of $29 billion. Some notable projects that are making waves in the DEX narrative are Uniswap (UNI) with a market cap of $10.5 billion, Osmosis (OSMO) with a market cap of $1 billion. ShadeSwap (SHD) has the potential to hit a billion market cap even though it is currently sitting at $23 million, so it is early. With $40M TVL and 24k monthly visitors, Shade Protocol is a suite of open-source applications that provide the best platform for private DeFi in the cosmos."

How to Receive Future Airdrops?,cosmosnetwork,1b553np,2024-03-02 20:45:28,3,0.61,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork/comments/1b553np/how_to_receive_future_airdrops/,CaptainJimmy_,,"Hey All,

Im currently new to staking and airdrops on the cosmos network and I recently started staking a large portion of my crypto portfolio into atom on keplr. Currently staking a few thousand of dollars; 81.5% into ATOM, 8% into INJ, 7% into TIA and 3.5% into OSM. I also try to do a lot of the voting since i read that it helps you qualify for airdrops, if that’s correct?

Am I staking enough to receive future airdrops? And how does receiving airdrops work? Does it automatically land in my keplr wallet or do I need to follow necessary steps to receive these airdrops?

Some help would be much appreciated!

Cheers,

Action4 - use both internal and bluetooth (dji mic 2) microphones together?,dji,1b41ep9,2024-03-01 13:22:34,2,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dji/comments/1b41ep9/action4_use_both_internal_and_bluetooth_dji_mic_2/,anterialis,Product Support,"Hi! 
Just got the DJI Mic 2 bundle (two Txs and charging case) and have gotten one of the Mic 2s linked with my Osmo Action 4. Works great. But is it possible to link both Mic 2s to the Osmo action 4? Or link one Mic 2 and also use the internal mic on the Action 4 at the same time?

I would like to use this setup and record from two sources at once (either two mic2s, or one mic2 and internal osmosis action 4 mic). Possible?

Thank you!"
