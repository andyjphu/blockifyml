The addition of the Validator Marketplace to Cartesi‚Äôs Technical Evolution Plan opens the way for connecting developers and validators, creating an alignment layer to support the growth of dApps in the Cartesi ecosystem, powered by the $CTSI token. Let‚Äôs explore what this means for everyone involved üßµ

\- Hear this out, developers! The Validator Marketplace will simplify your journey to building scalable dApps with Cartesi Rollups. Here‚Äôs how it will benefit you:

Skip the hassle of recruiting and negotiating with node operators. Easily connect with trusted validators in a decentralized, competitive environment.

By leveraging the marketplace, you can prioritize innovation in your use case, while the security of your dApp is ensured. This will lead to faster deployments and smoother performance for your Cartesi-powered apps.

The Validator Marketplace will lower barriers to entry, making it easier for appchain developers to get started quickly.

\- Attention, validators! The Validator Marketplace will open new opportunities and revenue streams within the Cartesi ecosystem. Here‚Äôs how it will work for you:

Stake $CTSI to participate, or receive delegated stakes from token holders to support your efforts. You won‚Äôt be alone and can count on community backing.

By staking and providing validation services, you will earn easily as a validator. Plus, a community signaling mechanism will help you prioritize which dApps to focus on.

The Validator Marketplace will create a win-win for securing appchains and maximizing potential revenue from validation services.

\- $CTSI holders, your role in the Validator Marketplace will be key to aligning incentives and supporting the ecosystem! Here‚Äôs how you can get involved and benefit:

Use your $CTSI to signal support for promising dApps. By getting in early and ‚Äúbacking‚Äù high-potential projects, you stand to earn greater rewards as those dApps gain momentum.

Want to share validation rewards? You'll be able to delegate your $CTSI to experienced validators, earning a share of their validation rewards while contributing to the ecosystem‚Äôs growth.

The Validator Marketplace will empower every community member, making it easy to engage and benefit from Cartesi‚Äôs thriving ecosystem.

While the Validator Marketplace adds a layer of convenience and aligns ecosystem incentives, it doesn‚Äôt introduce any new trust assumptions. Builders and users can still manage their applications independently, without relying on the marketplace or anyone else. They retain full control and can run their own nodes to verify everything themselves if they choose to.

Looking for a quick walkthrough of what this proposal is all about? Keep reading for all the details:

Building in an appchain model allows for better scalability & performance, but also brings unique challenges, like finding skilled validators and predicting demand for dApps. The Validator Marketplace proposal aims to solve this by creating a dynamic, efficient ecosystem for Cartesi dApps.

The Validator Marketplace would streamline the way dApps & validators connect. Developers could conveniently hire trusted validation services, and validators would have an easier time selling their services.

The Validator Marketplace would also allow community backers to participate by delegating their CTSI to skilled validators. [$CTSI](https://x.com/search?q=%24CTSI&src=cashtag_click) holders could also signal their support for promising dApps through a bonding curve mechanism.

The bonding curve mechanism would be crucial for aligning incentives and generating a clear market signal on the potential of specific dApps. Community backers who stake CTSI in support of promising dApps early on would earn greater rewards than those who jump on the bandwagon later.

Not only would the Validator Marketplace enhance the utility of [$CTSI](https://x.com/search?q=%24CTSI&src=cashtag_click), it would create a system that aligns the token to the growth of the ecosystem. It would create a link between dApps and CTSI, providing a place for users and backers to express their support while also keeping validators accountable."

Bybit offers a user-friendly interface, competitive fees, and various trading options that cater to both novice and experienced traders. Its robust security measures ensure that users can trade with confidence.

## Analyzing Development Trends

The correlation between GitHub activity and market performance is noteworthy. Many of the cryptocurrencies with high development activity also rank among the top in terms of market capitalization. This suggests that projects which prioritize continuous improvement are more likely to succeed in the long term.

### Factors Influencing GitHub Activity

Several elements contribute to the level of activity observed on GitHub:

- **Project Complexity**: More complex projects often require more frequent updates.
- **Community Size**: Larger communities typically result in higher contributions.
- **Market Conditions**: Bull markets may spur increased development as teams rush to implement new features.

Monitoring GitHub activity provides valuable insights into the health and potential of cryptocurrency projects. With leading assets like Cartesi, Status, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Polkadot showing significant development efforts, investors can gauge which projects are likely to thrive in an increasingly competitive landscape.

For those interested in entering or expanding their presence in the crypto market, Bybit stands out as a reliable platform for trading these dynamic assets. As always, thorough research and understanding of each project's fundamentals are essential for making informed investment decisions.

By keeping an eye on GitHub commits alongside price movements and community engagement metrics, investors can better navigate the complex world of cryptocurrencies and identify promising opportunities for growth."

Validator Marketplace: A Governance Proposal to Enhance $CTSI Utility and Align with Ecosystem Growth,cartesi,1gazibb,2024-10-24 06:37:18,8,0.84,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cartesi/comments/1gazibb/validator_marketplace_a_governance_proposal_to/,cartesi,Governance/Grants,"**New governance proposal alert!** üìë



Introducing the Validator Marketplace, a community proposal to enhance decentralization & incentives for Cartesi‚Äôs appchain ecosystem.

Check out the full proposal: [https://governance.cartesi.io/t/appchain-attention-economics-ctsi-holders-as-part-of-the-solution/441](https://governance.cartesi.io/t/appchain-attention-economics-ctsi-holders-as-part-of-the-solution/441)

or read on for a quick summary üëá

Building in an appchain model allows for better scalability & performance, but also brings unique challenges, like finding skilled validators and predicting demand for dApps. The Validator Marketplace proposal aims to solve this by creating a dynamic, efficient ecosystem for Cartesi dApps.

The Validator Marketplace would streamline the way dApps & validators connect. Developers could conveniently hire trusted validation services, and validators would have an easier time selling their services.

The Validator Marketplace would also allow community backers to participate by delegating their $CTSI to skilled validators. $CTSI holders could also signal their support for promising dApps through a bonding curve mechanism.

The bonding curve mechanism would be crucial for aligning incentives and generating a clear market signal on the potential of specific dApps. Community backers who stake CTSI in support of promising dApps early on would earn greater rewards than those who jump on the bandwagon later.

Not only would the Validator Marketplace enhance the utility of $CTSI, it would create a system that aligns the token to the growth of the ecosystem. It would create a link between dApps and CTSI, providing a place for users and backers to express their support while also keeping validators accountable.

This governance proposal wants your input! The proposal is now live on the Technical Vision Forum.

Join the discussion, share your thoughts, and help shape the future of Cartesi.

The Honeypot is now half a year old, and as secure as ever‚Ä¶ or is it? For those who have recently started following Cartesi and have no clue what we‚Äôre talking about, let‚Äôs do a little refresh.

Meet Honeypot: a sweet challenge safeguarded by Cartesi Rollups (which btw is now holding 258,873 $CTSI) üëá

üçØ What is it? Honeypot is a dApp crafted specifically for developers aiming to test the security of Cartesi Rollups. Here's the deal: crack it, and the prize is yours, no strings attached! This isn't your typical user-friendly challenge - it‚Äôs not for every day users to interact with. However, for those not well-versed in web3 development, you can still get involved by following its progress on socials!

ü§î How does it work? Underneath the hood of the Honeypot dApp lies an intricate algorithm, permitting only the Cartesi Foundation‚Äôs depositor account to make fund withdrawals. Challengers face the task of deciphering this code and claiming the funds for themselves.

üêù Why are we doing this? As Honeypot undergoes rigorous testing and fortification, both developers and users can place greater trust in the security of Cartesi‚Äôs technology for launching and utilizing new dApps featuring tangible assets.

üí∞ What‚Äôs in it for me to crack it? The honeypot pot sweetens with an 8% compounding weekly increase, fueled by deposits from the Cartesi Foundation. Should the Honeypot remain uncracked, it will hold 1,772,889 CTSI by the time it‚Äôs 1 year old!

üîê Hacker‚Äôs Keepers Once you crack it, it‚Äôs yours to keep - plain and simple. Cartesi contributors will then analyze the breach, address it, and roll out a new iteration to ensure the vulnerability is patched.

If you‚Äôre ready to start cracking it, head over to [honeypot.cartesi.io](http://honeypot.cartesi.io/) to give it a shot!"

Sunodo's Role in Enhancing the Cartesi Ecosystem: Unveiling Cartesi CLI and Additional Features,CryptoCurrency,1ay0728,2024-02-23 08:15:57,0,0.44,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ay0728/sunodos_role_in_enhancing_the_cartesi_ecosystem/,Blocks_and_Chains,TECHNOLOGY,"Hey everyone! I'm here to share some exciting updates from the Cartesi ecosystem, focusing on the impressive progress made by Sunodo, a prominent contributor within the Cartesi community.

&#x200B;

Sunodo has been diligently working on developing open-source tools aimed at simplifying the process of creating and deploying Cartesi decentralized applications (dApps). They firmly believe that facilitating easier dApp deployment is crucial for boosting Cartesi's adoption and advancing the ecosystem's growth.

&#x200B;

Their main offering, previously known as Sunodo CLI (Command Line Interface), is almost ready to launch. This open-source platform aims to streamline the deployment of Cartesi dApps, making it as smooth as similar processes in other ecosystems, all thanks to the Cartesi Virtual Machine.

&#x200B;

Here's the exciting part: As the launch date approaches, Sunodo recognizes that Sunodo CLI is not just a tool‚Äîit's an integral part of Cartesi's infrastructure. With approval from the Cartesi Foundation, Sunodo is rebranding Sunodo CLI as Cartesi CLI and integrating it with other core ecosystem products like Cartesi Rollups and Cartesi Compute.

&#x200B;

What's even more thrilling is that Cartesi CLI will be managed and maintained by the broader Cartesi community, following the ecosystem's governance frameworks. However, Sunodo will continue to play a significant role in this transition.

&#x200B;

But wait, there's more! In addition to Cartesi CLI, Sunodo is preparing to offer essential services to the ecosystem as the primary professional Cartesi validator. They will provide node-running services for developers and users who prefer not to run their own validator nodes.

&#x200B;

As a validator service, Sunodo is making two major commitments to the ecosystem: adopting CTSI as the payment currency for Sunodo validation services and dedicating a portion of their validator revenue back to the ecosystem (specifics to be determined!).

&#x200B;

Exciting times lie ahead! And the excitement doesn't end there. There's a proposal in progress at the Cartesi Vision Forum outlining plans for a community-governed Cartesi Validator Marketplace. Imagine CTSI as the payment currency alongside an innovative revenue-sharing model.

&#x200B;

Looks like there's a lot to anticipate! It would be great to hear the community's thoughts on this technical concept."

As a validator service, Sunodo is making two significant commitments to the ecosystem: adopting CTSI as the payment currency for Sunodo validation services and allocating a portion of their validator revenue back to the ecosystem (specifics to be determined!).

Exciting times ahead! And it doesn't end there. There's a proposal getting ready at the Cartesi Vision Forum, outlining plans for a community-governed Cartesi Validator Marketplace. Picture CTSI as the payment currency and an innovative revenue-sharing model. 

Looks exciting! Would be great to hear the thoughts of the community on this technical concept."

As the first professional validator service for Cartesi dApps, Sunodo is working on two new exciting commitments to the Cartesi ecosystem:  

* üöÄ A new utility for CTSI token 
* üöÄ % of revenue from validation service will be cycled back into the Cartesi ecosystem  

Plus, read more about their anticipated proposal to build a community-governed Cartesi Validator Marketplace:

*As a core company in the Cartesi ecosystem, Sunodo has been focused on building open-source tooling for the smooth creation & deployment of Cartesi dApps. We believe the convenience of dApp deployment is critical for Cartesi adoption and the modular ecosystem as a whole.*

Sunodo‚Äôs primary product, currently called Sunodo CLI, is anticipated to launch soon. Sunodo CLI is an open-source platform that brings ease of Cartesi dApp deployment on par with the ease of deployment developers have for other RaaS-serviced ecosystems, but powered by Cartesi VM.

*But here's the game-changer: As we approach the product launch, it's dawned on us that Sunodo CLI is more than just a tool; it's a vital piece of Cartesi's infrastructure, too significant to be confined to a single company's governance.*

*In that spirit, the Sunodo team has received permission from the Cartesi Foundation to rename Sunodo CLI to Cartesi CLI, integrating alongside other core ecosystem products such as Cartesi Rollups and Cartesi Compute.*

*Importantly, this means that Cartesi CLI will become governed and maintained by the broader Cartesi community, consistent with the ecosystem‚Äôs existing governance frameworks. But the Sunodo team isn‚Äôt going anywhere!*

*Alongside the creation of Cartesi CLI, Sunodo has been preparing itself to provide critical services to the ecosystem as the first professional Cartesi validator, offering node-running services for developers and users who don't want to run their own validator nodes.*

*As a validator service, we're making two exciting commitments to the ecosystem! First, we're setting CTSI as the payment currency for Sunodo validation services. Second, we're committed to reverting a percentage of our validator revenue back to the ecosystem (details TBD!).*

*Exciting times lie ahead, and we're not stopping there. Brace yourselves for a proposal at the Cartesi Vision Forum, outlining plans for a community-governed Cartesi Validator Marketplace.*

*Picture this ‚Äì CTSI as the payment currency and a revolutionary revenue-sharing model. Let's inspire others to follow suit and propel the Cartesi ecosystem to new heights! Stay up to date with Sunodo and check us out at* [*https://sunodo.io/*](https://sunodo.io/)*.*"

Fast forward, and thanks to the mods of this subreddit for making it happen, here we are now! Excited to host our first AMA here!  
Today we have several contributors eager to answer all your questions and shed more light on Cartesi‚Äôs tech solution and ecosystem:

**What is Cartesi?**

At Cartesi, we are building an app-specific rollup protocol with a virtual machine that runs Linux distributions, creating a richer and broader design space for dApp developers. Cartesi Rollups offer a modular scaling solution, deployable as L2, L3, or sovereign rollups, while maintaining strong base layer security guarantees. [Learn more over on our website](https://cartesi.io/), but let‚Äôs break it down further.

**App-specific rollups:**

Simply put, every dApp has its own rollup chain in Cartesi's ecosystem, meaning that dApps don't compete with each other for blockspace. This results in increased computational scalability as every application benefits from its own CPU resources. [Grok Cartesi Rollups in this article.](https://cartesi.io/blog/understanding-cartesi-rollups/)

**Cartesi Machine:**

The Cartesi VM is designed to work with RISC-V, an open standard for an abstract model of a computer that is powerful enough to run an operating system like Linux as well as the software that it supports. Linux, specifically, can now be a blockchain operating system where web3 developers build dApps that transcend the limitations of the EVM.¬†

So with a full-fledged Linux OS powered by the Cartesi Virtual Machine, developers can import their preferred libraries, compilers, and tools that they are already familiar with from traditional software development. This results in unprecedented abstraction or content scalability. And what‚Äôs even better is that everything that happens in the Cartesi VM is reported back to the blockchain via Cartesi Rollups. As a result, the Cartesi VM can provide verifiable computation that enjoys all the benefits of security, transparency, and immutability that are offered by blockchain networks, while offering superior programmability due to leveraging mainstream tooling. [Grok the Cartesi VM in this article.](https://cartesi.io/blog/grokking-cartesi-virtual-machine/)

**What We've Been Up To Recently at Cartesi:**

1. **Honeypot:** Cartesi Rollups went live on Mainnet in September 2023 with the first dApp Honeypot deployed on Ethereum mainnet. This is a hacking challenge for web3 developers. While attempting to withdraw the funds in a smart contract powered by Cartesi Rollups, they will be testing the security of Cartesi Rollups V1. Honeypot holds 119,908 CTSI tokens right now, and increases by 8%, compounding weekly. Will it get cracked? [Find out more here](https://cartesi.io/blog/introducing-honeypot/).¬†
2. **Cartesi with Celestia underneath:** This collaboration enables data-intensive applications that could benefit from the help of a specialized high-throughput modular DA layer paired with Cartesi‚Äôs execution layer. Developers can now push the boundaries of blockchain by seamlessly integrating extensive data processing and ensuring the security and transparency of video processing on a verifiable Linux VM. [Check this out for more details](https://www.reddit.com/r/cartesi/comments/193ij6j/what_can_cartesi_unlock_for_developers_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).
3. **Espresso integration:** On a recent testnet deployment, [Cartesi processed a 17MB rickroll through the Espresso Sequencer](https://twitter.com/espressosys/status/1744764977972429034?s=46&t=mGHP8Hk4s0azqLZbjA-GfA). Given the Cartesi Virtual Machine‚Äôs unique ability to run Linux-based applications, Cartesi dramatically expands the design space of possible applications. However, for this to happen, it needs access to a performant sequencer protocol. This is where Espresso integration comes into play. By the way, [read here about the first blockchain rickroll and how Cartesi broke the Vienna OP rollup](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/17xdyz5/first_blockchain_rick_roll_incident_a_tale_about/). 
4. **Cartesi as L3 on Syscoin:** With the Cartesi Rollups contract deployed on the Rollux testnet, Syscoin's L2, we are witnessing another facet of Cartesi as an L3. [Read more about it here.](https://x.com/syscoin/status/1742927649146868078?s=20)
5. **Technical Vision Forum:** Now that Cartesi Rollups have reached their mainnet phase, the next roadmap will be a dynamic process involving the community, where everyone is invited to collaborate. [You can read all about it here](https://governance.cartesi.io/t/a-process-for-setting-cartesis-technical-evolution-in-the-mainnet-era/264/1) and we welcome anyone interested to explore the [proposals already populating the Technical Vision Forum.¬†](https://governance.cartesi.io/c/technical-vision-forum/13)
6. **Governance and Grants:** CTSI holders can stake their tokens to participate in the ecosystem‚Äôs [community-driven governance mechanisms](https://cartesi.io/governance/). And developers can explore grants to bootstrap their project and contribute to the development and adoption of the Cartesi ecosystem. The Community Grants Program ($1M in grants available for long-term building, subject to community voting. [Learn more here](https://governance.cartesi.io/)) and Developer Advocacy Seed Grants (fast track grants for up to $5,000 USD to complete your proposal within 4-6 weeks. [Learn more here](https://mugenbuilders.notion.site/DevAd-Seed-Grants-dc0a2420a08c49a983b919aa9246dcbc)).¬†

Held cartesi for a long time but haven't really taken a decent look in a long time to track where it's at. Just believed it will hit the mainstream due to its tech at some point.

Question is for those educated enough to answer. With the ease dapps can be created on ctsi is cartesi ready to compete with other larger blockchains like solar etc.

Have they got quality projects near done or completed that can propelled ctsi into the jeez top 50 would be nice 

I would have hoped we would be there already but I have always thought thos would happen in the next cycle which is from all current signs starting. 

Can cartesi take its place."

"Exploring Small-Cap Cryptocurrencies for Potential Profits and Stability. As cryptocurrency enthusiasts, we often find ourselves engrossed in the allure of Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, there's another avenue to explore for potentially substantial returns without the wild volatility.",AllCryptoBets,17h0age,2023-10-26 12:23:24,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllCryptoBets/comments/17h0age/exploring_smallcap_cryptocurrencies_for_potential/,Electrical-Nobody259,Market Update ,"&#x200B;

The success of a cryptocurrency is typically determined by its fundamentals, real-world applications, and the strength of its community. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have certainly proven their worth in the crypto space, small-cap cryptocurrencies, especially those with staking capabilities, are quietly making waves by addressing real-world problems and offering investors a chance at substantial returns and passive income.

Here's a list of five small-cap cryptocurrencies that have shown resilience in the bear market and hold significant potential:

1. **Cartesi (CTSI):** Cartesi is an L2 scaling solution designed for decentralized applications. It's chain-agnostic, providing scalability and flexibility through both off-chain and on-chain solutions. With features like optimistic rollups, its native token, CTSI, reached a peak of $0.32 in April 2023.
2. **Morpheus Network (MNW):** Morpheus Network focuses on disrupting global supply chains by integrating technologies like IoT, RFID, and blockchain. It's making waves in the supply chain management sector. Additionally, you can participate in its masternode program and earn impressive APY (Annual Percentage Yield) and staking rewards of up to 18%.
3. **Tron (TRX):** Tron offers cost-effective P2P sharing of digital content and empowers creators to sell their work without transaction fees. The blockchain uses Delegated Proof-of-Stake, allowing token holders to stake TRX for governance participation and staking rewards.
4. **Aventus (AVT):** Aventus Network is a hidden gem among Layer-2 Ethereum solutions, helping businesses scale and process transactions at significantly higher speeds and lower costs. It also operates as one of the parachains of Polkadot.
5. **Syscoin (SYS):** Syscoin combines the strengths of both Ethereum and Bitcoin, creating a dual-layer blockchain that marries Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This results in high scalability at an affordable cost.

Here's a quick snapshot of how these ""Dino Alts"" are performing:

1. Cartesi (CTSI) - Price: $0.13, Market Cap: $102M, ATH: $1.75, Staking APY: 8.8%, Potential Upside (2030): 598% ($0.91).
2. Morpheus Network (MNW) - Price: $1.06, Market Cap: $50M, ATH: $4.99, Staking APY: 18%, Potential Upside (2030): 990% ($11.56).
3. Tron (TRX) - Price: $0.09, Market Cap: $8.07B, ATH: $0.23, Staking APY: 3.62%, Potential Upside (2030): 733% ($0.75).
4. Aventus Network (AVT) - Price: $0.70, Market Cap: $7.51M, ATH: $7.04, Staking APY: 11.60%, Potential Upside (2030): 700% ($4.98).
5. Syscoin (SYS) - Price: $0.08, Market Cap: $61M, ATH: $1.31, Staking APY: 3.5%, Potential Upside (2030): 1900% ($1.61).

Morpheus Network (MNW) appears to be a standout performer in this list, offering a small-cap token with tremendous potential. The combination of its real-world utility and high staking returns makes it a promising choice for those looking to diversify their investments.

In conclusion, it's essential to consider diversifying your crypto portfolio beyond Bitcoin and a few well-known blue-chip coins. Small-cap ""Dino Alts"" have demonstrated resilience during bear markets, injected portfolios with substantial returns and passive income, and show significant potential for the future. This could be your opportunity to make a big impact in the crypto space. So, don't hesitate to explore and invest in these little crypto gems."

What‚Äôs an optimistic, application-specific rollup?

For Honeypot, that means it runs on a dedicated rollup infrastructure designed for a single decentralized application. It doesn‚Äôt compete for blockspace with other dApps, and it has the freedom for full customization.

Mainnet Ready: Honeypot marks a major milestone for Cartesi Rollups, indicating that the entire infrastructure is geared up to support the creation of more application-specific rollups!

It paves the way for a new era of dApps. Get ready for the next wave of innovation!

Critical Roles: Honeypot serves as a thrilling arena for hackers and developers to flex their skills. It sets a financial benchmark for safe asset storage limits and fosters open-source bug hunting.

Come test & scrutinize the underlying code: [https://github.com/cartesi/honeypot/](https://github.com/cartesi/honeypot/)

In the context of the Honeypot dApp, successful hacking means either deceiving the dApp into creating a voucher that enables asset theft or executing a voucher that the dApp didn't create.

A tip on cracking the honeypot? The Output Validation library and the Cartesi dApp code itself are critical to understanding the consequences of commitment.

AMA with Cartesi (Verifiable Linux on Ethereum): Introducing Honeypot - First Cartesi Rollups DApp on Mainnet,CryptoCurrency,16ujhlh,2023-09-28 11:46:06,39,0.84,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/16ujhlh/ama_with_cartesi_verifiable_linux_on_ethereum/,Max_Cartesi,*AMA*,"Hello, [r/cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/), thanks for having us for another AMA!

Many of you may be wondering about the new banner you've seen live on this subreddit, which is about Cartesi Rollups on the mainnet and the launch of our first DApp - the Honeypot. Curious to hear what‚Äôs all this about? We'll be here answering your questions on Friday, September 29, from 1 pm UTC until around 3 pm UTC.

**About us**  
Cartesi is an app-specific rollup protocol with a virtual machine that runs Linux distributions, creating a richer and broader design space for DApp developers. Cartesi Rollups offer a modular scaling solution, deployable as L2, L3, or sovereign rollups, while maintaining strong base layer security guarantees.

**Introducing Honeypot: The First Cartesi Rollup DApp on Mainnet** 

Honeypot üçØ is now live on the Ethereum Mainnet! Take your shot at hacking it and see if you can win 35,000 CTSI (and counting - the amount will grow based on compounding 8% weekly allocations from the Cartesi Foundation).

Honeypot is a DApp designed to allow developers to challenge the security of Cartesi Rollups. It is not designed for users to interact with. 

Being the first Cartesi-powered DApp on Mainnet, Honeypot highlights Cartesi architecture and opens a new chapter for the Cartesi ecosystem. As we test and fortify Honeypot, it boosts the confidence of developers (and users!) in the security of Cartesi's tech, making it ready for more DApps holding real assets.

If you‚Äôre a web3 builder, you can jump straight into Honeypot‚Äôs Github repository and follow the instructions to start poking around with the DApp. If you don‚Äôt consider yourself a web3 builder, stick around to learn more about it and see if someone is able to hack it‚Ä¶ 

**We have several Cartesi contributors present to answer your questions today:**

Honeypot is now live on Ethereum Mainnet! Hack it and win 35,000 CTSI (and counting)!

Want to learn more? Here's introducing Honeypot: a challenge secured by Cartesi Rollups!

Read all about it on our new blog post: [https://cartesi.io/blog/introducing-honeypot/](https://cartesi.io/blog/introducing-honeypot/)

What exactly is Honeypot?

Honeypot is a DApp designed to allow developers to challenge the security of Cartesi Rollups. There's only one rule: if you can hack it, you can have it, no strings attached!

It is not designed for everyday users to interact with.

So, if you're a web3 builder, head straight to Honeypot's Github repository to start poking around with the DApp: [https://github.com/cartesi/honeypot](https://github.com/cartesi/honeypot)

If you're not a web3 builder‚Ä¶ stick around to see if someone cracks it!

How does it work? In the backend code of the Honeypot DApp there is an algorithm that only allows the Cartesi Foundation‚Äôs depositor account to withdraw funds. Players face the challenge of breaking the code and withdrawing the funds to their own account.

The honeypot starts at 35,000 CTSI, growing by a compounded 8% weekly with deposits from the Cartesi Foundation. That means if Honeypot goes unhacked, after one year it would hold approximately 1,772,889 CTSI (over $265,000 USD)!

What happens if the honeypot is cracked? The winner gets the funds‚Äîsimple as that. Cartesi contributors will then study the breach, solve it, and a new version of the Honeypot will be deployed to attest that the vulnerability no longer exists.

Honeypot's mainnet launch marks the beginning of a new era for Cartesi! As the Honeypot is tested and fortified, developers and users alike will have increased confidence in the security of Cartesi‚Äôs tech to launch and use new DApps holding real assets.

Ready for the challenge? Give it a shot! Learn more about Honeypot and try to crack it now: [https://honeypot.cartesi.io/](https://honeypot.cartesi.io/)

Don't worry if it's your first time voting, this video will have you up and running in no time! Be quick votes close on Wednesday!  


üó≥Ô∏è Notes on voting:

\- You must stake your CTSI 12 hours before voting starts, or else it cannot be seen by Snapshot and will not count towards your vote power.

\- You can change your vote at any time during the 7 day voting period, but the proposal cannot be edited. 

\- Voting power is proportional 1:1 to the amount of CTSI tokens that a voting wallet has staked in a pool.

\- Tokens held in a wallet, private node, or elsewhere, are not counted toward voting.

\- Voting does not cost CTSI. CTSI never leaves the staking pool and never changes hands when voting.

And once the voting period ends you can unstake - but why do that when you‚Äôre earning staking rewards?!

Cartesi's Expanding Ecosystem and Initiatives - A Testament to Their Continued Innovation and Success,CryptoMoonShots,134ph52,2023-05-01 11:23:30,11,1.0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/134ph52/cartesis_expanding_ecosystem_and_initiatives_a/,lauromafra,ERC-20 Token,"In a recent update on Cartesi, there are several ongoing developments that showcase its ongoing commitment to expanding the project's ecosystem and increasing its adoption. The following highlights some of their latest initiatives.

One of the most notable developments is the Community Grants Program (CGP), which was launched earlier this year to encourage more contributions to the Cartesi ecosystem. The CGP is a pilot program that allocates 1 million USD in funding for 2023 and allows CTSI token holders to participate in the governance process by deciding on grant program funding. For those interested in applying, be sure to review the application guidelines and submit your proposal.

The Cartesi team is also diligently working towards making Cartesi DApps mainnet-ready. As Cartesi Rollups is an application-specific execution environment and not a layer 1 blockchain, the ""mainnet launch"" concept differs from other projects. Instead, the first Cartesi-powered DApp, Honeypot, will signal that Cartesi Rollups is mainnet-ready.

The Honeypot DApp is an upcoming hacking challenge designed to secure real assets in a permissionless and decentralized environment. Unlike traditional bug bounties or capture-the-flag events, participants can simply crack the Honeypot to claim the rewards with no strings attached. The launch of the Honeypot DApp on the Ethereum mainnet will usher in an exciting era for Cartesi as its technology is rigorously tested and proven secure.

Additionally, the Cartesi Foundation plans to create an Ecosystem Incentives Program, which will be community-run and funded with CTSI. This program aims to support Cartesi DApps deployed on mainnet by providing incentives for user acquisition and adoption.

To further showcase the potential of Cartesi Rollups, a dedicated website will be launched to highlight experimental DApps and facilitate community exploration of upcoming projects within the Cartesi ecosystem.

Cartesi will also continue participating in ETH Global hackathons in 2023. It will sponsor events such as ETH Lisbon, ETH Paris, ETH New York, ETH Istanbul, and ETHGlobal Online. With over $50,000 in prizes available, the hackathons are expected to attract more developers to build on Cartesi's technology.

Lastly, Cartesi remains committed to hosting technical workshops for developer communities worldwide. This is done by fostering collaboration with organizations and universities to onboard the next generation of Web3 builders using Cartesi's technology.

These ongoing developments reflect Cartesi's dedication to growing its ecosystem, supporting developers, and promoting the adoption of its cutting-edge technology. Cartesi's future looks promising as it continues to innovate and make strides in the blockchain space."
