The whole concept story for him in short is pretty much he acts like Gray Fox from MGS1 with all the psychotic break downs. And its caused by Kayn stealing experimental software called ""Recombinant Host Augmentation and Assimilation System Technology"" or RHAAST  for short (that unsurprisingly turns out to be evil because it's early technology and its unstable for the sake of convenience) to defeat Zed who turned him into a cyborg as far as lore goes in the actual Project story. And because its Zed who made him or assisted in his creation, we have a lore reason why he can pass through walls. My idea is that he splits into pieces or something like that to go through walls  and into the minds of the champions when he ults. 



And the forms are basically:

 Complete Kayn, who throughout the game (maybe in his emotes and recall animation) is shown tinkering with his body trying to ""fix"" the virus, and him transforming basically means he got what he wanted from the start with the stolen tech and software. Which is why he can cast W and make a projection of him self and still move, and why he has better mobility and so on.



And if Kayn isn't successful in time, Rhaast takes over. But because of all that tinkering, a bit of Kayn's mind still remains and is still struggling with Rhaast. Which is why Rhaast can't move as fast but can still use all the tricks Kayn does with the body.



Unfortunately I am not good with drawing and cant give an exact image of what my ideas look like. "

1. Internal marketplace within the Pi Network ecosystem
2. Potential listing on cryptocurrency exchanges
3. Peer-to-peer trading options
4. Integration with existing financial platforms

I have around 3+ experience in Mobile Telecom Engineering Domain but I always wanted to transition to Management Consulting. So I am considering to either do an MBA or a MIM in UK as I see it as a more accessible path.

The advice I want from you guys are -
1. Post MBA in UK or anywhere, what are my chances of being recruited by a Management Consulting firm given that I have no relevant consulting experience? I am okay with an entry level job as well.

2. What other ways can I get into Management Consulting? I am really passionate about it and do have multiple courses (Coursera) related to it as well."

I’m looking for a game all about decorating. It doesn’t necessarily have to be a house, in fact I’m open for decorating anything! I just want a game where I pick between different chairs, or different floors, or other cosmetic stuff.

Games I have already played that shows (kind of) what I have in mind:

Spirit City

Minami Lane (not the point of the game, but you get to pick and choose roof color of the different buildings)

Sims 4 (though I **don’t** want to build entire houses from scratch, I want to decorate, not build)

Pewdiepie’s tuber simulator (Or, pixilated game where you decorate a room)

Unpacking (Again, pixilated game about decorating a room)

So, take “decoration” game broadly, give me any suggestions that reminds you of these games. I’m open and looking for anything that’s similar/gives a similar vibe.

(However… you know those “garden escape” mobile games where you complete levels, earn stars and then spend the stars to fix your run-down garden? And you get to fix a new bench and you can choose between 3 different ones? If there’s a game *just* about that - pick between these couches, these floors, these windows, these lamps, etc. Then that’s what I’m mainly looking for. (Again, spirit city is the perfect example)).

If it’s on Steam, that’s the best! But I have a Nintendo switch and a PS5 too :)"

The SNT security engineers are revamping their e-commerce web front. The VP of Sales has voiced concerns that customers are getting frustrated of creating multiple usernames and passwords. They have to create multiple login authentication credentials with business partners in order to place an order. The company is especially losing money when users do not stay within SNT's partner websites in order to make add-on sales on other products or items.  
  
Your team is working on a mobile and globally spanning identity transfer system that would save customers time and hassle when making an initial purchase, and then deciding to buy something from a partner website. Their main platform will start with a user, who for example has made a purchase at SNT's Automotive site. If they wish to purchase specialty tires, they will be transferred to a partner website that deals exclusively with custom and brand name tires. If customers wish to purchase Italian leather for the seat covers, then they will be redirected from SNT’s North America site, to SNT's international website.

2 Weeks Post Submuscular Surgery,CubitalTunnel,1i9xdyy,2025-01-25 16:21:18,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CubitalTunnel/comments/1i9xdyy/2_weeks_post_submuscular_surgery/,SlimKevbot,,"Hello, I've been dealing with numbness in my pinky and ring finger and tightness in my wrist since around September of '24 and finally got surgery on the 10th of January after it was identified that my ulnar nerve was popping out of place after various Dr. visits. For as long as I could remember, my elbow popped but I never had issues with it until this past year and since I do mostly computer work, PC gaming, lifting, and playing guitar, I chose to deal with this problem ASAP. They told me the surgery had no complications and that there should be no permanent damage to my ulnar nerve. The first 2 days I could not really move my fingers as everything was still numb. I followed their directions for rotating medicines, was prescribed Tramadol, and Gabapentin and instructed to take Motrin and Tylenol as well. This controlled the pain since I don't especially have any complaints. There was one night that I took Gabapentin too late and the pain made falling asleep very hard to do. Over the days my arm stopped swelling and being in the splint was very itchy.

Disregard the vein like line, my arm was just folded in the splint

https://preview.redd.it/5ms74uqwi7fe1.png?width=2016&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9507dddf3870b70508f5b5fb9e4d04a228d694a

Right now I'm recovering at home, had the arm in a splint for about 12 days then got that removed as well as the sutures and have been able to move my elbow about 90 degrees with no pain and my hand and fingers have full mobility. What I was not aware of while in the splint is that my elbow and the outside of the forearm are still numb and I am not sure when that will go away. I have also noticed that my elbow is still swollen slightly which is what is preventing me from bending my arm more. Finally, I believe the swelling of my elbow/forearm (and possibly just the surgery in general) has caused the nerve connecting to my thumb to be sensitive. If I move my hand/thumb wrong, like say flipping my palm up too fast, I feel a shock at the meaty part of the thumb and down my forearm a bit. I was wondering if anyone has experience with that. Is that normal or should I be concerned? Also, How long until my elbow is not swollen and my forearm and elbow are no longer numb?

TLDR; Submuscular Transposition surgery had no complications, 2 weeks out full mobility in hand but I cannot bend elbow past 90 degrees due to swelling, sometimes my thumb nerve feels ""shocked"", elbow and forearm numb"

Valencia continues to grow! A 'pirate' enclave lead by Diana, a lady who insists she is a pirate because she has a pirate hat. A castle built on a semi-island in an oxbow river, with an anima tree on an actual island, and now spreading out to a few other regions.

The rainbow tower probably needs renovating. I tried for a sort of spiral shape, but I think the circle is just too small to do that. It would probably look better if Green's top wall was brought up flush with Red's. Right now, Red is Research, Orange is Tailoring, Yellow is Crafting/Fabrication, Green is Dining, Blue is unused, Purple is a landing spot for items, and Pink is a royal bedroom for Diana and Strange. The tower curves counterclockwise, and pink can only be reached by going around the spiral. The grey Destruction area heads out back to a geothermal and corpse zones.

[Spinnin!](https://preview.redd.it/oxo74ynue7fe1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=448d40372090bbef0eeb39f81562bc2bd6d24bd3)

The grotto up north was an Area Revealed!, and it seemed like a reasonable place to put apartments. Dunno what to do with the sand pit in the middle though, but clearly it needs to become Something recreational. Colonists don't quite seem to have a grasp of the skipgates: They'll deliver through them, but when tasked with bringing something back they'll walk the long way. Half victories, I suppose.

[This is your hole! It was made for you.](https://preview.redd.it/8hqsi8n7f7fe1.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f62107172f778907a7fe9654e5f13568b2dc1d1)

Randy has been an **absolute Buttface** this year. Not just a toxic spewer, but toxic fallout afterwords that brought us down to 0 food and about 100 meals before production caught back up. About 5 raids back to back. Right as the rainbow tower went online, a herd of 33 bunny people charged in(sappers) insisting that they be allowed to play in the tower too, with their guns. The plan for devilstrand dusters to stave off the desert heat has not happened because all the plants died. The perils of having a sunroof courtyard garden.

This will become less of a problem as turrets come online, but still. Very rude. I think I've hit the maximum size I want for the colony at least: 21 adults/2 children. Ahoy has a sad bug where because he is a faun, he faints constantly at the sight of the cleaning robots. Hopefully that will get patched soon, because it's really dumb. You can see him fainted in the top picture. Just kinda falls over sometimes.

9 Psycasters, filling out the general needs. Calliope the giant spider girl(Anti Material Rifle because she's big) is slowly learning how to upgrade gear psychically. Starlight has put in skipgates around the colony, and only needs a few more levels to get the sixth and final one online. Argo continues to be a dominant sparklord despite her noncombat(mutagun) weapon. She sends the lightning, and then 'heals' the raiders at the end into 100% hp animals. A win for everyone, really.

12 Ranged, 6 Melee, 1 Mutagun, 2 Pacifist. Every colonist has their own specific weapon type, which I try to keep on them but they keep dropping their stuff when they fall over in raids. Current winner in combat is Diana, with two revolvers and a levitation implant that let her just kinda slide around the battlefield going ""pew pew pew"". Izzy has a minigun, and took the idea of an animal going manhunter with a giggle and about 20 bullets in the poor crab's direction. In general the colony is very offense oriented; armor is not as cool as having fancy weapons that they're highly skilled with. Slowly working up to proper defenses though.

I do wish pacifists could equip Thrumbo Plushies. It would be thematic and adorable.

Animals are ramping up to be Mostly Thrumbos. They're about 1/3 of the crowd, but they eat SO much that they might as well be all of them. Some camels, some buffalo, a goat named Crispin, and then various white/silver/crimson thrumbos. They have lots of trees to eat, and enjoy letting the kiddos ride on them. Notable names: Cameleon, Camelot, Mobile Sofa(buffalo), Silvant, Thrumpet, Crimbo, Thrumbone, Mrs. Potato Head(capybara),

Next goals are to get proper turrets up so that the colonists aren't running around putting out fires. Let the shore defend itself while they work on building neat buildings. Some sort of goober cathedral in the upper mountain, walls on the T bridge to make it more of a real structure, and a field hospital rather than the pseudo one we have now.

Feel free to spew thoughts and give suggestions on what can be built next. There's a lot of the map left to conquer! "

I wanted to share a personal finance tool that’s been super helpful for staying on top of money management. It’s an all-in-one dashboard where you can track income, expenses, savings, and investments in a simple, straightforward way. Whether you’re budgeting, tackling debt, or working towards big financial goals, this dashboard makes it easier to keep everything organized.

# Here’s a quick overview of what it does:

* **Transactions Tab**: Record income and expenses, and it handles the math for you.
* **Monthly & Yearly Dashboards**: See where you stand each month and over the year.
* **Calendar View**: Track daily spending visually.
* **Customizable Categories**: Adjust it to fit your needs.
* **Summary Overview**: Get a big-picture look at your financial health.

It’s been very helpful for many people in reducing the stress of managing finances. If you’re looking for a way to simplify money tracking or just want to get a clearer picture of your finances and understand where your money is being spent, I think this could be really useful.

The Ryan Reynolds Theory,ItEndsWithLawsuits,1i9xb6f,2025-01-25 16:17:56,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItEndsWithLawsuits/comments/1i9xb6f/the_ryan_reynolds_theory/,Fresh_Statistician80,Ryan Reynolds 🦸🏼‍♂️⚽️💵,"Sorry for all the posts today, just getting caught up!

Obviously, Ryan Reynolds has been in the conversation since day one of these lawsuits. As these lawsuits have progressed, more suspicion about whose driving them has emerged. Ryan Reynolds was never fully off the hook in terms not being involved, but the primary focus was Blake. Earlier this week, Candace Owens, who I ordinarily would never listen to regarding anything political/cultural, posted on her instagram story that she received at least two pieces of information from people that were allegedly on set. These blinds basically stated that Ryan Reynolds and his fragile ego are the main source driving this entire feud.

I am never someone to fully buy into blinds sent into gossip sites, but I take it with a grain of salt, but it's interesting to look at especially when it's consistent with other information. I also tend to avoid a bunch of theories because they are just that, theories. While I understand it's easy to back into a belief you already hold by trying to find pieces of information that support it, I still think there's decent amount here to take a look at.

* **Scarlet Johansson's statements on why things didn't work out with Ryan Reynolds**
   * ""The logistics of being with another actor are challenging. There has to be a real understanding of how you share your time, especially when two people's careers are going at the same rate. Or even if one person is more successful than the other, that also proves challenging. There may be a competitive thing.""
* **Blake's acting career**
   * In the past 5 years, she has starred in 1 movie other than IEWU. She has only starred in 5 movies in the past 10 years outside of IEWU.
   * In contrast, Ryan Reynolds has starred in 10 films, produced 9 films, and directed 1 film in the past 5 years. He has starred in closer to 20 movies in the past 10 years.
   * Ryan has also bought part ownership of Mint Mobile, and purchased [Wrexham AFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrexham_A.F.C.).
* **Blake Lively on Jimmy Fallon taking about her masseuse**
   * Blake does [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmUfe_QEXM0) with Jimmy Fallon where she's basically joking that Ryan might hear her and her super hot hand therapist outside and think there's something going on. Clearly a joke, but still something to note.
* **Ryan's involvement in the IEWU filming, promotion and premiere**
   * Ryan was so overly involved in everything related to IEWU. He was involved in promotional content, he was obviously at the premiere, he was apparently on set, he was involved in the writing. This feels like a man that won't let his wife have her own moment. Another thing I thought was incredibly concerning, was how often they had meetings and discussions relating to the film at their Tribecca penthouse with Ryan present.
* **Ryan's involvement in the IEWU script**
   * Interestingly, Justin suit claims that Blake Lively wanted a stab at writing the rooftop scene but later on during the premiere she [says that her husband wrote it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9IF7hLXDL4). Which would make sense on why they had the meeting to review Justin's feedback at their house in front of Ryan Reynolds.
* **Nicepool**
   * Most people are brought up to speed on this, but Ryan Reynolds literally [wrote in a character that looks exactly like Justin Baldoni](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwW3jXFLJLM) in Deadpool vs. Wolverine. The character says things like ""he wants to host a podcast that monetizes the women's movement"". This comes off as giant projection and insane amount of jealousy. Not to mention the Gordon Reynolds credit.
* **Tim Miller (different from TJ Miller) leaves the Deadpool franchise**
   * [Dead pool director leaves the franchise](https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29931219/ryan-reynolds-deadpool-tim-miller/) because of Ryan Reynolds.
* **TJ Miller's (yes I understand he's problematic) interview on working with Ryan Reynolds**
   * Basically said that [he bullied him and acted disturbingly mean ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZF_IYkx1hw)for no reason.
* **Blake Lively's interviews in general**
   * Something I've noticed in both Blake Lively's and Ryan Reynold's public interviews is that jealousy seems to be constantly brought up, always in a jokey way, but it's super consistent. There's an interview where Blake states that she's [tortured by Ryan's sex scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC7LWq4z8Gw), then Ryan Reynolds does that [weird interview with Brandon Sklener](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2XmJg3SEa8). Just feels like there's some truth to these ""jokes"".
*  **The unconfirmed/speculative information**
   * Beyond the Blinds, DeuxMoi, now Candace Owen's have all allegedly received so many blind items throughout the years that basically state the same recurring themes, Blake is a nightmare to work with and Ryan is extremely controlling, angry, and jealous of his partners."

Which bodyparts can be restored? (Vanilla Psycasts Expanded - Regrow limbs),RimWorld,1i9x7xq,2025-01-25 16:13:56,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RimWorld/comments/1i9x7xq/which_bodyparts_can_be_restored_vanilla_psycasts/,M4Gn3t1Z3R,PC Help/Bug (Mod),"Title. 

It seems there are some bodyparts that can not be regrown by using the mentioned psycast when destroyed. I also tried searching for this online, but I found literally nothing of the sort except for when you use the fingers for resurrection, but that seems to be different, since the fingers just have a hediff that makes them useless from what I know.

From what I have seen so far, I am quite confident that a crushed spine cannot be restored for example, as even after about 5 castings of this psycast and waiting the entire duration, no spine has grown back and I need to wait for a bionic spine to replace the lost one in order to get my colonist mobile again.

There were also some other cases where an eye and a jaw were not replaced, altough I didn't cast the psycast multiple times since I had replacements on hand.

Did anyone else experience this as well or am I simply unlucky that the parts were not restored? If possible, a list or something would be highly appreciated.

Thank you."

Disappointed with sylus’s standard myth after reading caleb’s,LoveAndDeepspace,1i9x7n7,2025-01-25 16:13:33,10,0.86,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveAndDeepspace/comments/1i9x7n7/disappointed_with_syluss_standard_myth_after/,orchidork,Discussion,"Warning- vague spoilers for both sylus's and caleb's standard myths and the main story

I just finished reading caleb’s standard myth, ""Lucid Dream"" and it shed a lot of light on his behavior and motivations in the main story. It even expanded on the lore by explaining the toring chip and the developers behind it. In contrast, sylus’s standard myth, ""Captivating Moment"", while great as a standalone story, doesn’t contribute much to the main plot. It’s essentially “A Day in the Life of Sylus, Onychinus Leader.” While seeing sylus from this perspective was essential to understand his character better and beyond just being Onychinus's leader, I think his standard myth would've worked better as a bond story. As a sylus main, I can’t help but feel disappointed with how Paperfold is handling him, especially given his lack of base content. It’s surprising that Caleb’s standard myth revealed so much right from his debut, while over 6 months later, we still hardly know about sylus in the current timeline. The OG LIs’ standard myths also added significantly to the game’s world-building but sylus’s didn’t. It makes me wonder if Paperfold don't know what they're doing with sylus's story or if they’re holding back because his content is central to the overarching plot. 

I understand that this game is a mobile otome game so they can't reveal everything all at once but man am I still disappointed. I hope the next big update contains more info about sylus or includes his story branch. I enjoy the limited banners just fine but they're not all that substantial and are even sometimes little more than filler. There is a serious lack of equality between sylus and the other 4 LIs and it's becoming more and more apparent with each update"

Enjoy Music Anytime: Benefits of Converting YouTube Videos to MP3,u_erepresent,1i9x63y,2025-01-25 16:11:37,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1i9x63y/enjoy_music_anytime_benefits_of_converting/,erepresent,,"Music is an essential part of our lives. Whether you're commuting, working out, or relaxing at home, having access to your favorite songs can make every moment more enjoyable. YouTube, with its extensive collection of music and audio content, is a popular source for discovering and enjoying tunes. However, streaming is not always convenient, which is why converting YouTube videos to MP3 is an excellent solution. Let’s explore the many benefits of converting YouTube videos to MP3 format.

# 1. Offline Access to Your Favorite Music

One of the biggest advantages of converting YouTube videos to MP3 is offline access. Whether you're on a plane, in a remote area, or facing internet issues, having your favorite tracks stored as MP3 files ensures uninterrupted listening. This makes it perfect for travel or situations where connectivity is unreliable.

# 2. Save Device Storage

Video files take up significantly more storage space than audio files. By converting YouTube videos to MP3, you can store far more songs, podcasts, or audiobooks on your device. This is especially useful if you have a device with limited storage or need to organize a large music library.

# 3. Convenient On-the-Go Listening

MP3 files allow you to listen to music without being tethered to a screen. You don’t have to keep YouTube open or worry about battery drain caused by video playback. Instead, you can listen while walking, jogging, or driving, making MP3s ideal for multitasking.

# 4. Improved Data Usage

Streaming YouTube videos repeatedly can consume a lot of mobile data. Converting videos to MP3 helps you save data since you no longer need to stream the video every time you want to listen. This is a cost-effective option for those with limited data plans or in areas with slow internet speeds.

# 5. Create Personalized Playlists

YouTube has a vast library of music, including niche tracks, live performances, and remixes that might not be available on other platforms. By converting these videos to MP3, you can curate personalized playlists tailored to your mood or occasion, ensuring your favorite tracks are always just a tap away.

# 6. High-Quality Audio Experience

A good YouTube to MP3 conversion tool preserves the audio quality of the original video, ensuring you enjoy a rich and clear listening experience. Whether you’re listening to music through headphones, speakers, or in your car, high-quality MP3 files enhance your enjoyment.

# 7. Versatility Across Devices

MP3 is one of the most universally accepted audio formats, compatible with nearly all devices. Whether you’re using a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or MP3 player, your converted files can be easily accessed and played, making them a highly versatile choice for audio enthusiasts.

# 8. Perfect for Educational Content

Beyond music, YouTube is also a hub for podcasts, lectures, and tutorials. Converting these videos to MP3 makes it easier to absorb information on the go. You can listen to a lecture during your commute or revisit an insightful podcast while exercising.

# 9. Enhanced Focus

Listening to MP3 files instead of watching videos can help reduce distractions. Without the visual component, you can focus purely on the audio content, whether it’s music, a motivational speech, or an audiobook.

# 10. Long-Term Convenience

Having your favorite YouTube content as MP3 files means you don’t have to worry about videos being removed or unavailable due to copyright issues. Your downloaded audio stays with you, ensuring long-term access to your favorite tracks.

# Conclusion

Converting YouTube videos to MP3 offers unparalleled convenience, versatility, and accessibility for music lovers and audio enthusiasts. It allows you to enjoy your favorite tracks anytime, anywhere, without the limitations of streaming or connectivity. Whether it’s creating custom playlists, saving storage, or enjoying offline access, converting YouTube videos to MP3 ensures that your music is always within reach. Take control of your listening experience and enjoy music on your terms!"

I've been using it for YEARS and I want to love it but it is so difficult to navigate to a review. I can't even find a feed of my own reviews easily, I have to click on my reading list then click on books individually...why is this not all automatically the first thing on your profile? Disappointing.

If I want to see a friend's reviews I only see 2 of their most recent ones — then where do I click to see everything else they've reviewed? I can see their ""read"" list, but there is no simple feed option to just scroll reviews. Unbelievable for the leader in this space to not have figured this out."

In-Depth Analysis of the Stella &amp; Dot 2025 MLM Business Model
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Stella &amp; Dot 2025 MLM business model offers an intriguing opportunity for individuals looking to break into the world of direct sales and multi-level marketing. This innovative model combines fashion with an engaging social experience, attracting those who are passionate about jewelry and accessories. To truly understand this business model, it's essential to analyze its structure, benefits, challenges, and overall effectiveness in 2025.

### Understanding the MLM Structure

In a multi-level marketing (MLM) framework, individuals do not only earn money from selling products, but also from recruiting others into the business. Here’s how the structure generally works:

- **Direct Sales:** Representatives, known as Stylists, sell Stella &amp; Dot's jewelry and accessories directly to customers through parties, social media, and personal networks.
- **Recruitment:** Stylists can recruit other Stylists. When these recruits make sales, the original Stylist earns a percentage of that commission.
- **Commission Structure:** Each Stylist receives a predetermined commission based on their sales volume, with potential for additional bonuses based on their team’s performance.

### Benefits of Joining Stella &amp; Dot

Choosing to become a Stylist with Stella &amp; Dot comes with several appealing benefits:

- **Flexibility:** Stylists enjoy the freedom to set their schedules and work at their own pace, making it ideal for those balancing other commitments.

- **Access to Quality Products:** Stella &amp; Dot is known for stylish and high-quality jewelry and accessories, which are attractive to a wide customer base.
- **Training and Support:** New Stylists receive comprehensive training and resources to help them succeed, enhancing their chances of achieving their financial goals.

### Challenges to Consider

Like any other business model, Stella &amp; Dot's MLM structure presents its unique set of challenges:

- **Market Saturation:** As more Stylists join, the competition can become fierce, making it harder to secure sales and recruit new members.
- **Income Variability:** Income can highly fluctuate based on sales and recruitment success. Not all Stylists earn substantial profits, which can lead to disappointment.
- **Time Investment:** Building a successful business requires significant commitment and effort, and results may not be immediate.

### Evaluating the Potential Earnings

Understanding potential earnings is crucial in assessing the Stella &amp; Dot business model. Earnings can vary widely based on individual effort and market dynamics. Here are some key factors that influence income:

- **Sales Performance:** Stylists earn a percentage off their direct sales, so higher individual sales result in better earnings.
- **Team Growth:** Successfully recruiting and managing a team can amplify earnings significantly through commissions on their sales.
- **Promotions and Bonuses:** Various incentives can boost earnings, such as bonuses for hitting specific milestones.

### Customer Experience and Brand Loyalty

The Stella &amp; Dot brand emphasizes a unique shopping experience, which significantly enhances customer loyalty. The emphasis on quality, design, and the community aspect helps retain customers. Customers are encouraged to participate in events, enabling them to experience products firsthand while building relationships with Stylists.

Moreover, stylish, on-trend offerings ensure that customers feel they’re making a fashionable choice. This commitment to customer satisfaction further supports Stylists by fostering repeat business and referrals.

### Final Thoughts on Joining Stella &amp; Dot in 2025

The decision to join Stella &amp; Dot as a Stylist in 2025 can be rewarding for motivated individuals. With the right mix of enthusiasm, commitment, and strategic organization, it offers an excellent balance of product quality and social engagement. However, potential Stylists should carefully weigh the benefits against the challenges inherent in the MLM model. Conducting thorough research and evaluating personal goals is vital in making an informed decision about this vibrant business opportunity.

Common Misconceptions About the MLM Structure of Stella &amp; Dot
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Many people are drawn to the direct selling world of Stella &amp; Dot, captivated by the opportunity it presents for entrepreneurship and financial independence. However, there are several common misconceptions about the multi-level marketing (MLM) structure that surrounds this company. Understanding these misconceptions can help you navigate the landscape more effectively and make informed decisions about engaging with Stella &amp; Dot.

### The Myth of Guaranteed Income

One prevalent misconception is that joining Stella &amp; Dot guarantees a steady income. It's essential to recognize that earnings in an MLM structure depend significantly on individual effort, sales skills, and team building. Just because you sign up doesn’t mean you’ll start earning a paycheck immediately. Many factors play a role in your financial success, such as:

- Your sales capabilities
- Your ability to recruit others
- The demand for the products in your area
- Your networking skills

Like any business venture, the level of income you can achieve is proportional to the amount of effort you invest.

### High Startup Costs

Some potential recruits hesitate to join Stella &amp; Dot because they fear high upfront costs. While it is true that there is an initial investment to become a Stylist, many find it to be reasonable compared to starting a traditional business. Your investment typically includes a starter kit with jewelry and accessories, training materials, and marketing tools. Also, the beauty of MLM is that you can sell to friends and family to recoup your cost quickly, leveraging your social circle for initial sales.

### Misunderstanding Commissions and Bonuses

Many individuals wrongly believe that earning commissions in Stella &amp; Dot is complicated. In reality, the compensation structure is straightforward once understood. You earn a percentage of your personal sales, and as your team grows, you can receive additional bonuses from their sales. This tiered reward system truly incentivizes Stylists to work both independently and collaboratively:

- Personal sales: You keep a percentage based on your total sales.
- Team commissions: You earn from your recruits’ sales.
- Performance bonuses: Extra incentives for achieving specific sales goals.

Taking time to analyze the compensation plan can empower you with the knowledge to maximize your earnings potential.

### Skepticism Toward Product Quality

A common misconception about Stella &amp; Dot is that the quality of its products might be subpar. This concern often arises when individuals compare it to traditional retail brands. However, Stella &amp; Dot prides itself on offering high-quality, trendy jewelry and accessories. The company continuously invests in design and customer feedback, ensuring that the products resonate with current fashion trends while maintaining durability.

### The Reluctance to Network

Some people fear that multi-level marketing involves pushing products onto friends and family, creating uncomfortable dynamics. This misconception can deter potential Stylists from joining. However, Stella &amp; Dot emphasizes building authentic relationships rather than just selling. The focus is on connecting with people and sharing products that you truly love. Here are some healthy networking tips:

- Create genuine connections with potential customers.
- Host fun and engaging trunk shows to showcase products.
- Leverage social media to share your passion for the products.

You can foster a positive experience without compromising your personal relationships.

### Time Commitment Misunderstandings

Many individuals assume joining Stella &amp; Dot requires a significant time commitment, limiting their ability to participate. However, one of the key benefits of MLM is the flexibility it offers. Stylists can tailor their schedules based on their lifestyles. Whether you want to make it a part-time gig or a full-time endeavor, Stella &amp; Dot allows you to determine your level of commitment. You can work at your pace and adjust as needed based on personal demands and goals.

Understanding these common misconceptions surrounding the MLM structure of Stella &amp; Dot is crucial for anyone considering joining. By dispelling myths about guaranteed income, startup costs, commissions, product quality, networking, and time commitments, you’ll be better prepared to assess your options and make sound decisions. A clear understanding of what to expect can empower you to navigate your journey successfully and thrive in the world of direct sales.

**Chapter 10: Blazing spear:**

As Kosma walked back to the courtyard, Jed saw a marker appear on one of the gunships,

 

""Hey Kosma... looks like you get to ride in that thing, sure beats walking!"" her face lit up as Jed said that. Kosma started to run excitedly towards the plane when she felt something pulling at her backpack.

 

""NO, YOU DON'T!"" said Kalax as Kosma stared back at him, flicking her ears back and giving the captain a glare.

 

""It's so damn cute when you do that..."", Jed admitted, which only made Kosma angrier,

 

""Shut up!"" she squirmed in Kalax's iron grip as he finally let go, causing Kosma to fall to the ground with a loud thud. It took restraint, but Jed made no comment.

 

""The enemy has set up anti-aircraft batteries around the pulse cannon, we have already lost three of our dropships to them,"" Kalax explained as he displayed a holographic map from a projector on his shoulder while the troopers gathered around it. There was a heavy anti-aircraft battery protected by small armor at each corner of the cannon's platform. Kalax pointed to a large road that rose above the jungle, connecting the control center to the position of the anti-orbital gun.

 

""We'll take this logistics highway all the way to their position, but if our scouts are right, we should expect very heavy resistance. We only need to take out one of those batteries and our transports can land... AM I CLEAR TROOPERS!"" the troopers quickly replied with a resounding ""YES SIR!"", with a metallic ""clank"" as their left hand slammed against their chest as they performed the Indaran salute.  Horror washed over Kosma's face at the thought of having to walk all the way to the pulse cannon, and Kalax only confirmed that the path would be littered with enemies. It would be a long slog.

 

""If you want, we can stop here. Doesn't look like any enemies are coming,"" Jed said, seeing how beaten Kosma looked,

 

""No, let's just do this... it would be incredibly annoying to try to sleep with the warzone atmosphere all around, I mean, blow up the enemy mothership with the cannon and we win, right?"" she asked with a nervous smile.

 

""I really hope this is the end of the level, this seems like a fun place to stay... you know, when there aren't murder-bots everywhere..."", Jed replied as Kosma nodded in agreement.

Kosma followed the group as the troopers chatted among themselves. They might only be simple AIs, but the fact that they were robots made it ironically a little easier for Kosma to pretend they were real. As they walked past a cargo bay full of containers and automated vehicles sitting idle at their stations. Kosma ran quickly to try to activate one of them, but to no avail,

""COME ON!... I really don't want to slog through this on foot. Jed, does a prompt appear to interact with any of these?"" asked Kosma as she hooked a cable from her wrist terminal into one of the trucks and randomly tapped things on the interface.

 

""At least you have the robots with you... what's left of them,"" Jed replied with a hint of sadness as Kosma resigned herself to walking to the enemy position. As the huge sliding doors leading to the highway opened with a loud hydraulic hiss, Kalax turned to look at Kosma,

 

""Trailblazer, I have some very distressing news,"" his tone was incredibly dark and made her fear what information he was about to give her,

 

""Y...yes?"" she asked out of pure reflex, though she knew he would continue his dialog anyway,

 

""I know how much it meant to you to walk over 8000 meters of bridge, but I ordered APCs to carry us as it will be safer,"" the Captain explained ironically, Kosma tilted her head to the side as she imagined the non-existent mocking grin on his mouthless face. His eyes, however, managed to express the joking tone as he pointed at a pair of incoming Sadurian defense force transports,

 

""Son of a..."" Kosma exclaimed, her face lighting up as she watched the transports descend before them, dropping a pair of six-wheeled APCs before flying away. The boxy vehicles were covered in angular armor, the logo of the 118th Battalion stamped on the side next to the vehicles' serial numbers. As the doors opened, she noticed that the transports had room for a gunner, a driver, and eight passengers.

They could see the battle raging throughout the facility, with the defense turrets on the control building shooting down enemy dropships and squadrons of defense drones fighting some kind of enemy equivalent. Still hopelessly outnumbered, the defenses would at least hold the line until they shot down the mothership. Deep down, however, Kosma and Jed knew that the battle was nothing more than a skybox, albeit a convincing one.

The APCs had been delivered with just enough troops to fill every seat, including hers and Kalax's. He turned to Kosma and pointed to the vehicle on the left,

""Get on the turret of the rampart,"" the captain ordered as Kosma boarded the vehicle, relief washing over her. She knew they would have to fight through a bunch of enemies to get to the other side, but at least it would not necessarily be easier. The rampart APCs would make it faster, especially if she didn't have to drive. The interior was a bit cramped, but that was to be expected from a military transport, Kosma was just glad to have a comfortable padded seat.

The moment she got into the vehicle, the camera zoomed in as Kosma got into the gunner's seat and stared at the controls, unsure what to do, when a popup appeared with the controls for Jed.

 

""Uhhh... yeah, because of course I can operate military hardware without training..."" as she spoke, Jed tested the controls, her hands automatically reaching for a joystick at her side and pressing a button that lowered a screen showing a camera view of the turret.

 

""It says... I can transform the weapon?"" Jed said a little confused as he pressed the middle mouse button. The APC's weapon rotated, transforming into something shorter but wider as Jed fired a large burst of blue energy bolts at it, which spread out in a cone pattern. Switching back to its original mode, the barrel lengthened and the weapon's struts retracted, making it appear thinner as ventilation slits opened on the sides. This mode fired a concentrated burst of energy, presumably designed to take out armored targets, while the other mode was designed to hit groups of smaller enemies.

 

""Now that's weird..."" said Jed, switching between modes, firing at lampposts and inactive driverless vehicles to test the weapon.

 

""Jed... get your hands off that keyboard. I always wanted to fire one of those things!"", Kosma excitedly fired the weapon, riddling a nearby car with holes from the dispersal mode, then firing a concentrated blast at the engine, causing it to erupt in a fiery explosion,

 

""YESSSH!"" Kosma exclaimed with a sadistic grin, feeling like she could take on anything with this turret,

 

""Hey psycho, when you are ready to go give the word,"" Jed playfully replied, making Kosma frown, she tried to look at the camera but could feel it was somehow outside the vehicle.

 

""Well, let's go... I want to see what this thing does to the robots!"" she made the turret face forward as Jed pressed the interaction button to close the tutorial popup. Shortly thereafter, a female robot voice exclaimed

 

""Next stop, anti-orbital cannon!"", the transports began to move forward, side by side. The APC was driven by a slightly smaller and thinner trooper with a less angular design and a vaguely feminine shape.

 

""What the hell? Who's driving?"" asked Jed, slightly confused.

 

""Another trooper?"" Kosma replied as she moved the turret from side to side, scanning for enemies.

 

""Why would they make female and male robots?"" wondered Jed aloud.

 

""Originally they all had the same voice, but the support troopers were made smaller and with lighter armor to fit better on vehicles and be more mobile, the soldiers kept calling them female troopers soo... on the next versions they just gave them a girly voice, pretty silly if you ask me,"" she explained while trying to adjust the turret seat to a comfortable position.

 

""It probably helps morale, she sounds kind of cute!"" said Jed, oblivious to the jealous look Kosma shot at the driver.

 

""JED! ARE YOU HORNY FOR A PIECE OF MILITARY HARDWARE?"" yelled Kosma as she poked her head out of the turret hatch.

 

""I just said she looks cute, I can't even see what she looks like from this angle... Get back inside, I see something approaching!"", Kosma grumbled as she got back inside and closed the hatch. Seeing that a group of heavy walkers and spider-bots had set up a roadblock, she quickly opened fire, Kalax's transports following shortly after.

 

""DON'T CHANGE SUBJECT ON ME, BOY!"" a very jealous Kosma shouted as she blasted the roadblock with the turret.

 

""Can we discuss this when we're not in combat!"", Jed replied, starting to raise his voice, he didn't want Kosma to get killed over such a stupid argument.

 

 ""Relax, this thing is bolt-proof, ironically it feels like playing a video game. I'm not really mad,"" she said in a cheerful tone, easing Jed's worries, although she was a bit jealous of this driver-trooper.

 

They spread out easily to take care of groups of small robots, adjusting their spread pattern based on the distance to the targets. Sending shards of metal everywhere as their power cores exploded violently on impact. One of the heavy walkers locked its weapons on Kosma's APC, firing large bolts of energy into the armor. The attack shook the transport, nearly knocking Kosma out of her seat and making her regret that she hadn't used her seatbelt, something she quickly set about correcting. However, the attack only managed to dent the plating and take a small portion of the vehicle's health bar.

She fired back using the turret's armor piercing mode, which didn't seem to be very effective against the machine's thick front plating, sending sparks and a burst of plasma on impact as the bolts dissipated against it.

 

""Aim for its ocular sensor to stun it, if you have bad aim, shoot for the legs,"" the captain advised over the comms as Kosma struggled to aim the weapon while taking enemy fire.

 

""Need help?"", Jed offered.

 

""No, no... otherwise I'll never learn"", after a few seconds of fiddling with the control joystick she managed to blow three legs off the walker, causing it to collapse to the ground and burst into flames shortly after.

 

""NICE SHOT!"" Jed and Kalax shouted simultaneously, making Kosma dizzy.

 

A Sadurian gunship, followed by a pair of enemy fighter drones, began to fly parallel to the transports,

 

""Get these things off me, sir!"" the pilot yelled over the comms as Kosma turned the turret and began guiding the targets and peppering them with disperse mode.

 

""WHAT ARE YOU DOING P-26!? YOU ARE APPROACHING AN ANTI-AIRCRAFT BATTERY!"" By the time the pilot heard Kalax's warning, it was too late as a missile hit the gunship in one of its engines. It spun out of control as it barreled toward the bridge, Kosma's APC narrowly avoiding it. The gunship's fuel tank exploded as it hit the pavement.

""Damn... no survivors, don't stop,"" Kalax said in his usual stern voice as the drones turned their attention to the transports and began to follow them.

The drones fired salvos of rockets at the APCs as Kosma swung the turret to face them. She heard one of the missiles explode right next to the vehicle, causing it to lurch sideways as the suspension did its best to absorb the shock.

 

""AAAHHH!"" Kosma exclaimed as the jolt made her head hit the screen hard, shattering the glass. Had she not been wearing her helmet, she probably would have broken her nose. At least the screen was still working.

She alternated between intercepting the missiles and firing at the drones themselves, with Jed helping her aim. One of the drones crashed into the jungle as she managed to inflict critical damage, while the other rammed in front of the transports and into a truck loaded with energy cells, causing it to explode in an azure blast of energy and electric arcs that temporarily disrupted the vehicles' electronics. The drivers stopped immediately,

 

""DAMN IT!"" yelled Kalax as he stared at the massive gap created by the explosion, as a voice came over a nearby PA speaker as a security camera stared at the APCs,

 

""I would appreciate it if you would stop damaging my facility more than the invaders! However, I know a way you can cross, let me angle the solar panels,"" the voice belonged to the Indaran technician monitoring their progress from the control facility. Soon gaps opened in the ground at the sides of the road and large photovoltaic panels appeared, angled toward the transports with one side raised toward the abyss.

 

""Do they want us to..."" said Kosma in a worried voice, noticing that the solar panels were wide enough to fit the entire APC,

 

""YOU HEARD THE MAN! PUNCH IT!"" shouted Kalax in a commanding voice, but the vehicles didn't move an inch. Meanwhile, Kosma saw more enemy drones approaching from the front and prepared herself,

 

""Sir... are you suffering from suicidal impulses?"" the driver of the captain's APC replied in a condescending tone.

 

""KOSMA! GET YOUR TROOPER OUT OF THE DRIVER'S SEAT AND TAKE OVER!"", Kalax yelled as she heard shifting noises and troopers complaining over the comms,

 

""SIR! SEEK A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL! WHAT ARE YOU DOING!??!"", Kosma heard the driver protest as she got out of the turret seat and made her way to her driver,

 

""Uhh... can you please go to the turret?... why am I even talking to this thing..."" she said, staring at the round face of her driver, when to her surprise the trooper answered, mainly thanks to Jed pressing the ""change seat"" button prompt,

 

""Ooo, I get to shoot the bad guys now!"" the trooper exclaimed excitedly as she got to the turret. Meanwhile, Kalax was having trouble with his own driver,

""Hey Trailblazer, just for the record, I would never hit a real woman,"" Kalax said over the comms before she heard a loud ""CLANG"" as the captain promptly slapped the trooper to take her place. Kosma could hear Jed laughing audibly over her head,

""ALLRIGHT, YOU TAKE THE LEFT, I TAKE THE RIGHT!"" Kalax ordered as his APC barreled towards one of the solar panels, Kosma staring at the wheels and pedals a bit confused,

 

""Jed... do you mind? It's been a long time since I've driven anything with wheels..."" the nervousness in her voice was palpable as the enemy drones were already firing missiles at her vehicle. Fortunately, the soldier on the turret was doing a good job of intercepting most of them,

 

""Absolutely!"" said Jed after a quick glance at the popup for the driving controls before accelerating towards the improvised ramp,

 

""CAPTAIN YOU ARE THE WORST OFFICER I'VE SERVED WITH!"" shouted Kalax's former driver as her APC flew over the cap, Kosma's soon to follow. She felt the suspension bounce violently on contact with the ground as Jed lost control of the vehicle and veered toward a gap in the bridge's walls.

She screamed in terror as the transport plunged into the jungle below, Jed watching in horror as the APC crashed into some jagged rocks. For a few seconds, the camera hovered over the wrecked vehicle, the last checkpoint loaded as she was about to jump the gap,

 

""Kosma... I..."", Jed said as Kosma was about to tear off the steering wheel from the sheer stress of hyperventilating,

 

""I know Jed, I know,"" Kosma said with a deep, long sigh, ""No matter how many times it happens, it's still horrible... let's... LET'S DO THIS!"" she exclaimed, trying to keep her brave face on. She knew Jed understood her pain and stress, but it was something she mostly did to trick herself into moving forward without having constant breakdowns.

 

""Are you sure you want me to drive?"" asked Jed hesitantly as a missile hit the back of the APC, knocking Kosma to the ground,

 

""YES, YOU IDIOT!"" she shouted as Jed regained control and heard Kala's ex-driver repeat her voice line as her vehicle jumped with him following through the left solar panel. This time he made the jump, this time maintaining control of the vehicle as they barreled down the highway. Dodging enemy attacks as the trooper in the gunner's seat did her best to keep enemy drones off their tail.

 

While Jed hadn't exactly kept the APC intact, it was still running, and Kosma herself remained in one piece. They were almost at the anti-orbital cannon. A gigantic piece of artillery with a rectangular barrel the size of a skyscraper, secured by three pairs of struts along its length. It stood on a square pyramid-like base surrounded by fortifications that had been taken over by the enemy.

Kosma saw a pair of vanguard units at the base of the pyramid's access ramp. Their gunner was busy targeting something behind them, so Jed simply accelerated toward one of them. As was probably scripted, Kalax ran for the other, and the vanguard eliminators were crushed under the weight of the armored vehicles,

""WOOOHOOOOO!!! That was cathartic, this thing is unstoppable!"" shouted Kosma as she felt the last pair of wheels crush the robot,

 

""You... really don't want to know how much health we have left..."", Jed said with a hint of concern in his voice as he stopped abruptly in front of a row of pylons along their path,

 

""EVERYONE GET OUT OF THE TRANSPOT, WE MUST FOLLOW ON FOOT!"", Kalax shouted as the troopers started to get out of both vehicles. Reluctantly, Kosma got out of the driver's seat as she stared in shock at the sorry state of her APC. The few pieces of armor that hadn't fallen off were riddled with holes and dents, blackened from the fire and explosions, one of the rear wheels was missing entirely, and the headlights had been shot out. On the other hand, Kala's vehicle was spotless, as if it had just rolled off the assembly line,

 

""JED YOU ARE A HORRIBLE DRIVER!"" exclaimed Kosma as she pointed with both hands at her barely functioning ride,

 

""Unlike us, his was probably indestructible... I got us here in one piece, didn't I?"" replied Jed,

 

""That's... technically correct, when you rammed a rock through the cabin, I was only crushed by it, but not split in half,"" Kosma replied cynically,

 

""Please don't joke about such things,"" Jed replied in a hurt voice, feeling extremely guilty about the accident,

 

""Look, it's either cynical humor or crying... these batteries aren't going to blow themselves up, let's just get this damn level over with... I need a very long shower,"" Kosma said, trying to summon up the courage for the coming battle, as one of the Troopers pointed to something in the sky,

 

""INCOMING!"" he shouted as Jed saw red bullet-shaped symbols appear below them, causing Kosma to immediately move out of the way while Kalax pushed one of his troopers out of one of the circles. A single large shell split into a few dozen fragments mid-flight, landing exactly where the circles had predicted, blowing up the APCs and taking out a couple of troopers,

 

""YOU HIT ME IN THE FACE AND DESTROYED MY VEHICLE! YOU ARE THE WORST OFFICER EVER!"" one of the drivers yelled at Kalax as he ran for cover,

 

""HAD I LET YOU KEEP DRIVING WE WOULD ALL HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, NOW SHUT UP AND RUN TROOPER!"", Kalax replied,

 

""Can you see the icons too?"" asked Jed as Kosma froze in shock after a grenade exploded a few meters away from her,

 

""WHAT ICONS!?"" she yelled in confusion,

 

""The game will tell me where the shells will land, just give me full control, even if I make you stand still, okay?"" said Jed as he saw another set of circles appear, causing her to move slightly to the side. Kosma saw the grenades explode around her again, only a few meters away from turning her into red mist,

 

""Okay... that's not scary at all..."", Kosma said with a nervous laugh as Jed pushed her forward.

 

""Ma'am, I just wanted to let you know that I do not blame you for losing my vehicle..."", Kosma's former driver said in the sleepiest voice her voice modulator could produce. Kosma completely ignored her, having other priorities at the moment.

 

At the top of the pyramid, around the massive rotating base of the anti-orbital gun, the enemy had placed AA batteries at the four corners of the structure. The anti-aircraft weapons were large three-legged machines that bore a resemblance to heavy walkers, except they replaced the heavy repeating blasters with an array of missile tubes that fired at incoming security drones from the facility. Protected by dozens of spider-bots, the Heavy Walkers' vanguard units and battle drones, along with transports flying overhead, made Kosma wish she had stayed in the underwater facility.

Running from cover to cover, dodging mortar rounds, Kosma already felt defeated and braced herself for another long series of deaths,

 

""Jed... do you have a plan? because I doubt 16 troopers are going to do much against all of... THAT!"" she exclaimed as Jed made her dodge an incoming burst of enemy fire from a walker that took out a trooper behind her, ""15 troopers..."" she said amidst panting,

 

""I have a plan, but you won't like it, you've played your share of video games, right?"" asked Jed, struggling to concentrate on dodging the grenades and the conversation at the same time,

 

""Yeah..."" she nodded confused,

 

""You know when you get frustrated from dying too often and just run past the enemies to complete the objective?"" he asked as Kosma took a split second to give him an incredulous look,

 

""HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DESTROY THE AA BATTERIES WITHOUT GETTING ANNIHILATED BY EVERYTHING IN THE SURROUNDING!"" she shouted as a piece of shrapnel clipped one of the tips of her tail, making her squeal,

 

""Those mortars are relentlessly targeting you, and if you don't stop to attack something and spam your dodge move, we can just trick them into bombing their own robots!"" shouted Jed as a stray shot hit Kosma in the chest, her armor managing to absorb most of the impact,

 

""Ouch... good, now focus!"" said Kosma, crushing her last vial of regen-gel and shaking her head at how rude that came out, ""I mean it sounds like a decent plan, but enough chatter... let's do this! 

 

With her thruster-assisted dodge and rocket boots, she quickly outpaced Kalax and the troopers. Running into the middle of the enemy formation, Jed had them running in circles for a moment that felt like an eternity to Kosma as energy bolts came at her from all directions. Once she was surrounded, Jed waited for the markers of the next mortar strike and let her boost jump out of the way, the explosions from the barrage pushing her further.

She landed awkwardly, belly up, with burning robot parts raining all around her. She used her back-mounted thrusters to immediately get back up and continue her mad dash for the AA tripod,

 

""JED, I HATE YOU SO MUCH!"" she shouted as she parried a blow from a vanguard unit's blade before lunging backwards to see it torn apart by a blast from a heavy walker meant for her. She threw herself into the air again, and in a clearing in the jungle below, she caught a glimpse of the machine responsible for the mortars. Like its AA cousin, it was clearly based on the Heavy Walker, but thicker to support the weight of its massive armament. It had ground anchors that pinned it to the ground, presumably to keep it from tipping over from the recoil of firing the weapon.

 

""TRUST THE PROCESS!"" he replied, letting her slide right under the AA battery as the enemies swarmed around her. She heard the mortar fire and, sword in hand, dashed out from under the tripod. Skewering a spider-bot through its optical sensor, and fueled by adrenaline, she lifted the blade with the inert robot still impaled. She planted one foot on the ground and used the thrusters on her other boot to spin herself. Kosma gained enough momentum to slam the spider-bot into a vanguard eliminator, completely destroying its upper body along with her blade.

 

""KOSMA, THAT WAS THE COOLEST THING I'VE SEEN YOU DO!"" cheered Jed as he carried her out of the blast zone. She couldn't help but look back at the clustered group of enemies before the cluster shell rained death upon them.  The charge from the mortar rounds combined with the rockets in the tubes of the AA battery to create an explosion so massive that the reflective visor of Kosma's suit lowered to protect her eyes,

 

""Yep, that's what I was going for,"" Kosma bluffed, not wanting to admit that her blade had gotten stuck in the spider-bot's eye and she was shaking it because she couldn't get it out, the same went for her missile boot, which accidentally went off and sent her spinning out of control. And Jed pretended to believe her.

 

""STELLAR JOB KOSMA!"" she heard Kalax say over the radio,

 

As she set off to clear the remaining enemies from the position, the troopers had already caught up to her and opened fire on a group of spiders as they rushed the position,

 

""I WANT THAT ARTILLERY PIECE CLEARED FROM THE FACE OF IRUX!"" the captain ordered, putting a pair of fingers to the side of his head as he took cover from an incoming mortar barrage. Soon after, a gunship fired a volley of missiles at the mortar-bot, causing it to explode in a blast that knocked down the surrounding trees with its shockwave.

A large group of gunships and air transports, escorted by security drones, approached. They unleashed a dizzying amount of bolt fire and missiles, utterly destroying the few enemy aircraft patrolling the area. Kosma felt relief wash over her as the small fleet landed around them,

 

""Cavalry's here, Captain!"" a female soldier's voice, probably the pilot of one of the transports, exclaimed excitedly as a platoon of robot soldiers disembarked from the dropships. As the transports unloaded two heavy tanks, the ground shook as they separated from the aircraft,

 

""85 TONS OF NAROKAN ENGINEERING WITH A MINIATURIZED INDARAN PULSE CANNON!"" said Kalax, his fists on his hips, staring proudly at the armored behemoths. Then he wrapped his arms around the shoulders of the troopers originally assigned to drive their APCS,

 

""Ladies, we weren't able to assign drivers to the bulwarks, so I guess it's you,"" he explained as the troopers' faces literally lit up, before giving the captain an Indaran salute and rushing to the tanks' hatches,

 

""I went out of my way to order them without drivers, I know how those things get attached to their vehicles... let the troopers know and I will skin you alive and turn you into a fur coat to remind me of my days among the organic..."" the captain said in a somber tone, poking his finger into Kosma's chest plate,

 

""Awwww.... has a sweet spot!"" said Kosma as she brought her palms to her chest,

 

""Hell, I'd have a hot spot for those things too....have you seen her hips!"" she snapped her head at the camera the moment he said that, going so far as to raise the visor on her helmet to make sure he saw her scowl,

 

""If I could reach through the screen, I'd knock those stupid glasses right off your face..."" she muttered angrily,

 

""Kosma... we both know something completely different would happen if you could reach through the screen,"" Jed replied with a grin that Kosma couldn't see but felt in his voice, making her laugh nervously as she lowered the reflective visor so he wouldn't see her blush,

 

A robot with bulkier armor and a distinctive pauldron with the insignia of a planet orbited by two moons, probably indicating his rank as a lieutenant, approached the captain and saluted,

 

""Sir, we'll take it from here!"" the lieutenant shouted before turning to bark orders to his platoon to storm the remaining enemy positions.

 

Kosma saw a pair of engineers enter the pyramidal structure, and Kalax stopped her from following by extending his arm in front of her,

 

""Yes, I know the control room is in there, but if you fire that thing from inside... you won't be able to see the fireworks,"" the captain calmly explained as a broad smile formed on Kosma's face,

""Ohhoho no way.... NO WAY!"" she exclaimed excitedly as the struts along the barrel of the weapon disengaged. The entire structure vibrated as the massive pulse cannon aimed itself at the enemy mothership with a mighty mechanical roar. An amber glow spread through the cannon, emitting a low hum as unfathomable amounts of energy flowed into it, filling the air with static.  The captain looked at Kosma, his face projecting a simplified smiling emoticon hologram as he removed his wrist-mounted terminal,

 

""Say, do you want to do the honors?"" he said in the friendliest tone she'd ever heard him use, while handing Kosma the wrist terminal, which showed the hologram of a large red button,

 

""I DO!"", Kosma grabbed the device and hovered her finger over the button. Climbing onto a wrecked heavy walker to make sure she had the best possible angle, she turned to face the camera and raised the visor,

 

""Hey, I couldn't have done this without you... would you like to do the honors?"" said Kosma as a prompt to press the interaction button flashed on the screen,

 

""No way, you heard the man, he wants you to do it,"" Jed replied, surprised by Kosma's gesture, knowing how much firing powerful weapons meant to her. He couldn't possibly deny her the chance to fire the mother of all directed energy weapons,

 

""We do it at once, when I say fire, we both press it,"" she took a deep breath and looked at the enemy mothership,

 

""THREE, TWO, ONE... FIRE!"" they shouted as she placed her finger on the button while Jed placed his on the interaction button. Rings of energy shot from the cannon's body as a sphere of pure energy formed at its tip for a second before unleashing its power. A golden beam of concentrated pulse energy shot from the mighty weapon as it tore through the skies of Irux at the speed of light. Causing a cataclysmic explosion of amber light that split the enemy ship in half and sent it plummeting to the oceans below.

The shockwave from the explosion took a few seconds to reach the island, shaking the leaves of every tree in the jungle and causing Kosma's ears to flap in the wind as she removed her helmet,

 

""WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!,"" Kosma cheered alongside the troopers as the enemy units began to shut down after losing the control signal from the battleship. While the vanguard eliminators were independent enough to function without the control signal, they had no choice but to surrender as they were outnumbered and outgunned by the Sadurian defense forces.

 

She took the liberty of stealing a working blade from one of the captured vanguard units and scavenging for some regen-gel to heal her tail before hopping on a gunship to take her back to the control center,

 

“That… was intense, I don’t know how it looked from the screen but… damn I felt that shockwave go through me”, she said while staring at the tropical landscape from the window of the gunship,

 

“I bet it was way cooler in person, you were incredible back there”, Jed complimented as he sighed in relief that Kosma was finally safe, when her intercom buzzed to life,

 

“Kosma, land on my carrier in orbit, we have to…”, Kalax was cut off as Kosma deactivated her intercom, and simply enjoyed the view as they flew her to the landing pad where she had parked her ship,

 

“Jed, if you don’t mind, I will put off adventures for a few days and relax here… its beautiful, and all to myself”, Kosma said as she gave Jed a tired smile,

 

“Absolutely, it will be nice to put off the madness for a few days… or weeks. Didn’t you say something about stealing food and candles? Maybe we could watch a movie together, I have to show you human science fiction”, said Jed excited about what she would think,

 

""It will be nice not to be torn to pieces for a change... when you get off I will take a looooong shower, raid the cafeteria and tomorrow I will steal a boat and go to the beach!"" she smiled excitedly as she laid out her plan,

 

""Sounds great, see you tomorrow Kosma, sorry about... all those deaths,"" Jed replied in a slightly sad tone as Kosma sat at the edge of the landing pad, just like when they came to the comms array,

 

""I'd still be having a nervous breakdown on Octanor Station if it wasn't for you, goodbye Jed"", Kosma said and waved at him before Jed closed the game and went on with the rest of his day, but not without taking some time to do some drawings of Kosma's journey in his sketchbook.

Betway in 2025: Is It Still a Good Platform for Casino Players?,bitcoincasinoreview,1i9wo8m,2025-01-25 15:49:50,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoincasinoreview/comments/1i9wo8m/betway_in_2025_is_it_still_a_good_platform_for/,funucker26,,"For years, Betway which provides a mix of sports betting and casino games has been a well-known name in the realm of online gaming. Many players still choose it in 2025, however depending on what you want from an online casino experience, this platform might or not be the best one for you. Though there are a lot on the platform after some time on it, there are some things to be aware of.

Betway's game diversity is among its strongest suit. From conventional slots and table games like blackjack and roulette to live dealer games, the casino part offers a broad spectrum of possibilities. Reputable companies like Microgaming and Evolution Gaming run the games, which guarantees fair gameplay and premium graphics. Although the choice is good, some players could find it lacks the sheer volume of titles newer platforms offer.

Navigating the casino and sports betting parts is simple on the well-designed and user-friendly platform. The layout of the PC version or the mobile app is clear and responsive. Especially the mobile app shows good performance and provides the same capability as the website. Still, the design hasn't evolved much over the years, which would seem a little antiquated given more contemporary rivals.

Regarding promotions, Betway runs frequent specials for current players as well as a welcome bonus for new members. Although these bonuses can be enticing, like other online casinos they come with wagering requirements that you will have to satisfy before you may withdraw any gains. Although the phrases are precisely expressed, it is always advisable to confirm your complete understanding of them.

Betway also stands really well in terms of dependability and security. Reputable authorities license and control it; it employs encryption to guard your info. Simple deposits and withdrawals are offered from credit cards, e-wallets, banks transfers among several payment options. Though they might change based on the approach you use, payout speeds are realistic. It's important to keep in mind some consumers have complained about delays during busy periods.

How will Betway in 2025 be experienced by you? Have you seen alternative sites or do you believe it's still a decent platform for casino players? Your opinions on its gameplay, usability, and general dependability would be much sought for. Opinions can enable others choose whether Betway is the best option for their online gambling requirements."

But now seeing many people using the mini form PCs instead. If you have to stay connected, I don't think it makes much sense. Sure they want to save space but that is probably the only valid reason but not good enough reason to go mobile parts on the GPU and CPU etc."

"UPI for foreigners -👽- a review of MONY, a cashless payment app",india_tourism,1i9wm94,2025-01-25 15:47:23,4,1.0,2,https://i.redd.it/kf9brnaqc7fe1.jpeg,CampOne-Parsnip-9755,#VisitingForeigner 🪪,"I recently traveled to India for a month-long trip and landed in Mumbai. Before my trip, I had done extensive research about using UPI (Unified Payments Interface) for digital payments and learned that having a local Indian mobile number was essential. So, I picked up an Airtel SIM at the airport to get started.

I tried multiple UPI apps to set up my account, but the process was frustratingly slow and riddled with issues — mostly delays with KYC verification. Out of all the apps I tried, MONY was the only one that provided a relatively quick and seamless experience. By the 4th or 5th day of my trip, I was all set up with UPI through MONY, with no further hiccups.

Here’s my breakdown of MONY’s features:

**Fees**

In terms of fees, MONY charges a 3.5% service fee, but they do provide some cash back and first-time top up offers as well I think. This might sound slightly privileged, but the fees are really not an issue for me as the convenience of a cashless payment system in India far outweighs trying to figure out each denomination and being constantly worried about misplacing my physical rupees.

**Payments**

Payments through the app were hassle-free and lightning fast. Whether I was paying street vendors via QR codes, buying groceries, or transferring money to friends, the process was smooth. The app supports payments either through the QR code or the UPI address and provides detailed transaction histories for easy tracking. Sometimes, but very rarely, occasional issues may occur with certain vendors and merchants, which happened to me at museum tuckshops when I was trying to buy a patty with chai, but after a few tries again, it generally would work - make sure you check with the vendor if their QR codes are correct too!

**Ease of Use**

The user interface of MONY is intuitive, even for someone like me, who was completely new to UPI systems. The setup process was straightforward once my KYC was approved. The app provides clear instructions for linking your bank account (I paid via my WISE, aka Transferwise card) and setting up a UPI PIN. Also, the in-app support / customer service is very responsive, which came in handy when I had issues.

**Customer Service**

When I was in Jaipur, I had purchased composite tickets (Jaipur Darshan) via the Government of Rajasthan website, and I had made a payment that failed the first time via UPI, so I tried again, and it failed a second time. Since I was buying for myself and two other foreigners, I ended spending 6600 rupees that simply got sucked into the cyberspace black hole. I was very upset and worried, but I contacted the MONY app customer service, they got back to me in a matter of minutes and told me they would
Investigate both the payments - obviously I gave them a the relevant information that they had requested (also, top tip: make sure you have a WhatsApp account you’re active on and provide that number when registering!) - I think it took them a day or less, but they resolved it and paid the rupees back into my UPI wallet. That definitely solidified my trust in the MONY team ultimately.

**Payments In/Withdrawals**
In terms of payments into your UPI wallet, I’ve tested with my local Indian friends and it can’t work, i.e. you will not be able to receive payments from anyone as a foreigner since you aren’t registered with a local bank (and trust me that process of opening a bank account as a foreigner is a complicated one, as I’m sure is the case in many countries). And in terms of withdrawals, I’m not sure if you’re able to withdraw, so I recommend budgeting BUDGETING *BUDGETING*! It’s a big part of being money savvy and I was left with only about 200 rupees on my last day, which I just tipped a chaiwalla (try Dada Ki Chai at Assi Ghat in Varanasi!) in the end. I think, when you close your UPI account, they offer the option to withdraw back into your bank account, in my case - WISE, but I didn’t really go down that route so can’t attest to it.

____

Anyway, all in all, it made my experience significantly easier. I’m sure you could try other similar apps, but MONY deffo stood out during my trip for its reliability and excellent customer service. For international travelers planning to use UPI in India, I highly recommend starting with MONY. "
"OnePlus 12r only ""partially compatible""",mintmobile,1i9wm4b,2025-01-25 15:47:15,0,0.5,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mintmobile/comments/1i9wm4b/oneplus_12r_only_partially_compatible/,Ambiguous_Bowtie,,"For anyone that likes OnePlus and is wondering if it works well on Mint, take caution. After a phone death, I picked up a 12r because of the price point and battery life. I'd also been looking to swap to Mint for a while after some time with Google Fi. Convenient timing.

Since the 12r wasn't listed on the compatibility assessor on the Mint website, I put in my IMEI#. It showed ""Compatible""! Great stuff! 

Maybe 2 months into my membership with no problems, I'm connecting randomly to 2G. After 2 hours with tech support, I learn the tragic truth: my device isn't fully compatible with Mint networks...which was never communicated to me. The tech rep showed me T-Mobile documentation that showed partial compatibility. How on earth should I have known to look at another company's documentation??

Fat lot of good that does me now that I've bought a year membership. I feel cheated tbh. This post isn't to stir up anything, but to serve as a warning for anyone that had the same question I did (and didn't see anything but ""it works""). "
How Good Is Jackpot City Casino in 2025? My Honest Opinion,bitcoincasinoreview,1i9wlss,2025-01-25 15:46:53,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoincasinoreview/comments/1i9wlss/how_good_is_jackpot_city_casino_in_2025_my_honest/,funucker26,,"For years, Jackpot City Casino has been a top choice for online gaming; its simple design and large selection of games will draw gamers in 2025 as well. After some time investigating what the platform offers, I found that it has a lot going for it, but depending on what you’re looking for in an online casino, there are a few areas that might be improved.

Jackpot City Casino's assortment of games is among its strongest suit. Mostly run under Microgaming, the platform offers hundreds of slots, table games, and live dealer choices. With both traditional and current themes accessible, I particularly thought the choice of slots to be really appealing. Designed effectively, the live dealer portion offers a reasonable casino experience for games including black jack, roulette, and baccarat. Although the game range is good, some players could like casinos that deal with several software providers for even more possibilities.

The user interface of the casino is basic and straightforward. The arrangement makes it simple to locate your preferred games whether you are using a desktop or mobile device. Particularly the mobile app runs perfectly, which is fantastic if you want to gamble on the run. If you're seeking for a more current experience, the design could seem a touch antiquated compared to some more recent platforms, though.

Regarding incentives and promotions, Jackpot City Casino provides a large welcome bonus to fresh users. Starting this is a great approach, but like other online casinos, the bonus comes with wagering requirements you will have to satisfy before withdrawing any profits. For regular gamers, regular promotions and loyalty prizes are also offered and add worth. If you intend to play casually, however, the wagering rules could seem somewhat limited.

Jackpot City Casino offers easy payment choices supported by credit card, e-waliter, and bank transfer capability. Though the speed depends on the payment method you employ, deposits are handled fast and withdrawals are typically seamless. One thing to keep in mind is that, should some players demand quick access to their earnings, the withdrawal process entails a waiting period that some would find irritating.

Your experience with Jackpot City Casino in 2025? Do you believe it lives up to its reputation, or have you come across other sites with improved experience? Your opinions would be much sought for, particularly on the game choices, bonuses, and general dependability. Sharing ideas will enable others determine whether Jackpot City Casino is the best fit for their online gaming requirements."

My Review of Casumo Casino in 2025: Is It the Best for Slots?,bitcoincasinoreview,1i9wlfz,2025-01-25 15:46:29,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoincasinoreview/comments/1i9wlfz/my_review_of_casumo_casino_in_2025_is_it_the_best/,funucker26,,"Having been in business for some time, Casumo Casino is well-known for its vibrant layout and simple interface. With its vast array of games, especially slots, it will draw gamers even in 2025. Although the site has a lot to offer after some time of exploration, whether it is the greatest for slots will rely on your tastes and what you are searching for in an online casino.

With hundreds of titles from reputable companies including NetEnt, Microgaming, and Play’n GO, Casumo Casino boasts an amazing range of slots. There is plenty to pick from whether your taste is for basic three-reel slots or newer ones with bonus features and interesting visuals. I thought the choices were varied, and new games are added often to keep things interesting. If you have no idea where to start, though, the sheer volume of choices can be a bit taxing.

Regarding performance, the site performs well and the games load fast even on mobile devices. If you would want gambling from your phone, Casumo Casino's well-designed app makes playing on the go simple. Unlike some online casinos, the mobile experience feels exactly as nice as playing on a desktop. Having said that, some older slots could seem a little out of current in relation to more recent arrivals.

Another advantage of Casumo Casino are bonuses and promotions. New players might benefit from a welcome bonus they provide, which will let you investigate their slot machine selection. Regular gamers also get incentives and continuous advancements. Although the benefits are tempting, their waggering conditions could be difficult to satisfy. Before jumping in, always make sure you thoroughly review the terms.

The way Casumo Casino supports safe gaming is one thing I value. Tools abound to assist you keep under control by let you establish limits on sessions, losses, and deposits. Although the site is entertaining and exciting, it's crucial to maintain things in balance especially if you intend to play slots regularly. The general dependability of the platform is enhanced by the prompt and available customer support personnel for handling any concerns or problems.

Your 2025 Casumo Casino experience is what? Do you believe this is the ideal for slots, or have you discovered alternative sites with better choices? Your opinions on the game variety, bonuses, and general experience would be much sought for. Sharing ideas can enable others choose Casumo Casino as the best fit for them."
