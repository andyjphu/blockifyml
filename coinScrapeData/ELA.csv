I been buying plenty of low supply tokens , because in my opinion they loosely follow bitcoin tokenomics, Scarcity breeds value as long as there demand for it. So here goes nothings. Also you might wanna check out Badger dao: 21 million tokens like bitcoin. Elastos or $ELA: 28.22 million tokens. Rarible, NFT based token: 25 million. Cheers and Happy New Year 🥳"

I went to ground in Elastos after the big crypto crash in 2020.  I have the old ELA 1.5 wallet on my iPhone that still shows my ELA tokens. But it is out of date, can’t sync and can’t send or receive.

I downloaded the new Web3 essentials wallet and inputted my 12-word seed phrase. But for some unknown reason it keeps rejecting my master password. I have verified the accuracy of both the seed phrase and master multiple times. They are clearly typed up in a little book that I kept. I never set up biometry.

Any ideas how to get past this? 
Thanks"

Defendants argue that their actions are too far removed from the secondary market transactions to be considered to have sold or solicited the sale of the ELA Tokens. However, even indirect solicitation efforts are sufficient to state a claim under Section 12. See Capri v. Murphy, 856 F.2d 473, 478 (2d Cir. 1988) (“indirect solicitation can suffice to state a claim under Section 12(a)(2)” and “the language of sections 12(1) and 12(2) is identical in meaning”); see also In re Vivendi Universal, S.A., 381 F.Supp.2d 158, 186 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (finding adequate allegations that CEO was a statutory seller where he “regularly appeared before investors and financial news agencies to tour the financial vitality of \[the company\] and thereby encourage investors to purchase \[the company's\] securities”); In re WorldCom, Inc. Secs. Litig., 294 F.Supp.2d 392, 423 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (finding sufficient allegations that an underwriter was a statutory seller where the underwriter “participat\[ed\] in ‘road show' meetings”); Ripple Labs, 2020 WL 922815, at \*12 (finding that defendants qualify as “sellers” were plaintiff alleged that “defendants ‘have earned over $1.1 billion through the sale of XRP'” and “that defendants published various tweets, interviews, and articles pushing the adoption of XRP” (a blockchain platform similar to Elastos))."

Jednakże, wybór odpowiedniej platformy do zakupu ELA może być kluczowy dla Twojego sukcesu inwestycyjnego. Istnieje kilka renomowanych giełd kryptowalutowych, na których możesz zakupić Elastos. Poniżej przedstawiamy kilka opcji, które warto rozważyć:

1. **Binance**: Jedna z największych i najbardziej popularnych giełd na świecie, Binance oferuje handel ELA w parach z innymi kryptowalutami. Platforma jest łatwa w użyciu, ma silne zabezpieczenia oraz szeroki zakres funkcji, co czyni ją atrakcyjnym miejscem dla zarówno początkujących, jak i zaawansowanych inwestorów.

2. **Huobi Global**: To kolejna znana giełda, która oferuje ELA w swojej ofercie. Podobnie jak Binance, Huobi Global ma dobrą reputację i zapewnia szeroki zakres narzędzi i funkcji, aby ułatwić handel. Dodatkowo, giełda ta cieszy się zaufaniem wielu inwestorów na całym świecie.

Wybór konkretnej giełdy zależy od Twoich preferencji, takich jak dostępność usług w Twoim regionie, opłaty transakcyjne oraz preferencje dotyczące interfejsu użytkownika. Warto również sprawdzić opinie innych użytkowników oraz dokładnie zbadać każdą platformę przed podjęciem decyzji.

Pamiętaj, że inwestowanie w kryptowaluty wiąże się z ryzykiem straty kapitału, dlatego zawsze należy dokładnie przemyśleć swoje decyzje inwestycyjne i inwestować tylko środki, których nie jesteś gotowy stracić.

TLDR: Elastos coming to Bitcoin L2. Post your ELA ESC address to win 50 $ELA worth of $175 at the time of writing

In the light of upcoming Elastos launch on Bitcoin L2, and recent BeL2(Bitcoin Elastos L2) BTC Swap Demo, where you can exchange BTC L1 for ELA on ESC without cross chain bridge. And upcoming ability to earn BTC with your ELA I decided to celebrate it with a give away of 50 $ELA worth of 175 USD, with previous all time high worth of 3500 USD, but I believe this bull run it can hit even higher with the current tech and Bitcoin merger. 

All you need to do to participate is to comment with your Elastos Smart Chain address before April 1 end of the day. 

Here’s my address to prove that I have 50 $ELA on ESC which I intend to give away if I get at least 100 comments.

# [S&P 500 futures climb after the index's worst session since September: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/20/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures climbed Thursday morning after the recent market rally took a breather.
*****
> S&P 500 futures added 0.5%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.66%. Futures connected to the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 160 points, or 0.4%.
*****
> Micron jumped more than 4% in postmarket action after beating Wall Street expectations for the first three months of its new fiscal year. The company also offered current-quarter guidance that exceeded analysts’ consensus forecasts. Salesforce gained 2% following an upgrade from Morgan Stanley.
*****
> The moves follow a losing day on Wall Street, during which investors took profits after recent gains. The S&P 500 dropped almost 1.5%, its worst day since September.
*****
> The Dow and Nasdaq slipped about 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively, to notch their worst sessions since October. Wednesday’s session also also snapped nine-day winning streaks for both.
*****
> Those drops mark a breather from the recent market rally. From their late October closing lows through Tuesday, the Dow and S&P 500 both jumped more than 15%. The Nasdaq Composite surged roughly 19% over the same period.
*****
> “The markets have run so strongly for so long,” said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Asset Management. “There’s maybe just some exhaustion in terms of buyers, and we’re starting a bit of a short-term consolidation phase.”
*****
> Investors will watch Thursday for data on jobless claims and the third-quarter gross domestic product before Friday’s reading of the personal consumption expenditures price index, which is a closely followed gauge of inflation. Traders will also monitor Nike earnings expected Thursday after the bell.

Traders will also monitor Nike earnings expected Thursday after the bell.

# [S&P 500 futures climb after the index's worst session since September: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/20/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures climbed Thursday morning after the recent market rally took a breather.
*****
> S&P 500 futures added 0.5%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.66%. Futures connected to the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 160 points, or 0.4%.
*****
> Micron jumped more than 4% in postmarket action after beating Wall Street expectations for the first three months of its new fiscal year. The company also offered current-quarter guidance that exceeded analysts’ consensus forecasts. Salesforce gained 2% following an upgrade from Morgan Stanley.
*****
> The moves follow a losing day on Wall Street, during which investors took profits after recent gains. The S&P 500 dropped almost 1.5%, its worst day since September.
*****
> The Dow and Nasdaq slipped about 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively, to notch their worst sessions since October. Wednesday’s session also also snapped nine-day winning streaks for both.
*****
> Those drops mark a breather from the recent market rally. From their late October closing lows through Tuesday, the Dow and S&P 500 both jumped more than 15%. The Nasdaq Composite surged roughly 19% over the same period.
*****
> “The markets have run so strongly for so long,” said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Asset Management. “There’s maybe just some exhaustion in terms of buyers, and we’re starting a bit of a short-term consolidation phase.”
*****
> Investors will watch Thursday for data on jobless claims and the third-quarter gross domestic product before Friday’s reading of the personal consumption expenditures price index, which is a closely followed gauge of inflation. Traders will also monitor Nike earnings expected Thursday after the bell.
