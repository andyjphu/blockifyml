Back From the Dead? John McAfee's Twitter Used to Promote Solana AI Token,bitfate,1i9n40w,2025-01-25 08:38:23,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitfate/comments/1i9n40w/back_from_the_dead_john_mcafees_twitter_used_to/,MammothBattle33,,"üö®Just IN: John McAfee's Legacy Reborn as AI Memecoin

In a surprising turn of events, the late John McAfee's legacy has been revived in the form of an AI-driven memecoin called AIntivirus. The announcement, made through McAfee's X account, sparked both excitement and skepticism among the crypto community.

The AIntivirus token, launched on January 23, quickly gained traction, reaching a market cap of $100 million within five hours before stabilizing around $27 million. Despite its volatile start, the token's price fluctuated between $0.27 and $1 in its initial trading hours.

Janice McAfee, John's wife, is behind the initiative, which aims to combine John McAfee's advocacy for privacy, crypto, decentralized technology, and AI capabilities. The project promises to integrate AI tools for cybersecurity, a nod to John McAfee's antivirus software fame.

However, the authenticity of the launch has been questioned, with some speculating that McAfee's account might have been hacked. Blockchain security service PeckShield initially warned of a potential hack but later retracted the statement.

The AIntivirus project is positioned as a ""string of defiance wrapped in cryptographic brilliance"" that represents freedom, privacy, and a stance against the establishment. This aligns with John McAfee's outspoken and often controversial persona in the crypto space.

As the crypto market continues to evolve, with BTC testing all-time highs above $100,000, memecoins like AIntivirus are gaining attention. However, their performance often mirrors broader trends, with initial hype sometimes outpacing sustained demand.

Despite initial appearances, Trump's digital currency transactions, including wrapped bitcoin, are primarily tied to Ethereum's ecosystem. Wrapped Bitcoin is an ERC20 token on Ethereum, offering exposure to Bitcoin's value with Ethereum's smart contract benefits. This shift suggests Trump's alignment with Ethereum, challenging the 'Bitcoin President' narrative and highlighting the evolving landscape of digital currencies.

Why on earth world people continue to use social media after it turned to complete shit slathered in ads, endless narcissism, and the worst takes you'll ever read in your life? Terrible product with zero value add.

**Result: it took about 15 years, but it had has now colonized 90% of our attention spans. Vast majority of people and future generations are now hopelessly glued to it.**

**Crypto** - great, a get rich quick scheme for neck beards. Won't last!

**Result** - Bitcoin rocketed to the moon, up a million percent and there's no end in sight. Our own president is now crypto grifting.

**Tesla** - spiritually gay electric cars for a tiny niche of tech douchebags, totally reliant on government handouts.

**Result** - Tesla has more market cap than all other automakers combined and musk is arguably the richest, most powerful person in the world. Trump loses without him.


I've learned my lesson about AI. It's still immature, but in a decade, it'll have it's tentacles wrapped around every facet of our existence.

You'll never talk to a real customer service agent again, elections won and lost without us ever being aware, healthcare, tech, energy, manufacturing, literally everything. All with the goal of concentrating the remaining wealth of the world into the hands of a few."

Meaning 1 pwbtc (pulse wrapped btc costs 1.6k USD)  
will be  
1:1 with regular bitcoin ($100k USD)

saying how if you buy 1 coin of pwbtc at $1600 could be worth 100k USD this year in a matter of months (his words)

pulse chain is an exact replica of eth and if you end up getting in before the chain gets 1:1 you will have made the best play in crypto history

I wanted to know what the community thinks about this and if they have any input/info on what is going on. If what he's saying can be backed by something. Not that I doubt him. I just thought about doing my research and seeing what everyone else thinks.

Crypto world, brace yourselves! World Liberty Financial (WLF), a decentralized finance project tied to none other than Donald Trump, is once again making waves. After a jaw-dropping $2.6M purchase of $TRX just days ago, WLF is now ready to scoop up an additional $2.65M worth this week.  

And that‚Äôs not all, honey! Their already loaded treasury boasts a delish $352M in crypto assets, including $ETH, $WBTC, staked $ETH, and of course, $TRX. WLF clearly knows how to keep its bags bougie.  

If you think this started small, think again. The project threw a financial party on Trump‚Äôs Inauguration Day, stacking $112.8M of crypto in one flirty move, with a spread that included $47M in $ETH and $4.7M each of AAVE, LINK, TRX, and ENA. Talk about goals. üòè  

But hold up, the WLFI token sale isn‚Äôt over yet! Only 2.4 billion tokens are left out of a spicy 25 billion total, and since its September launch, a sizzling $1.1B has already been raised.  

Btw, it‚Äôs not just WLF making plays. $TRON founder Justin Sun is all smiles, having earlier snatched up $30M worth of WLFI tokens. With the new US administration bro-ing out with crypto, seems like 2024 might just be the year to pop champagne for decentralized coins. üçæ  

Who's vibing with this pro-crypto energy? Drop your thoughts and let‚Äôs get this blockchain convo lit.

"Trump's DeFi project buys $25 million worth of cryptocurrencies, including LINK, TRON, AAVE and ENA",CapitalistExploits,1i7rxrx,2025-01-22 20:30:38,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1i7rxrx/trumps_defi_project_buys_25_million_worth_of/,kayakero,,"US President-elect Donald Trump, through his DeFi project¬†**World Liberty Financial (WLFI)**, recently made a major operation in the cryptocurrency market.

WLFI acquired approximately $24.6 million worth of altcoins including Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Tron (TRX), Chainlink (LINK), Aave (AAVE), and Ethena (ENA).

According to data from the Arkham platform, the WLFI treasury converted around $24.6 million of the USDC stablecoin into these cryptocurrencies.

Specifically, the project purchased $4.7 million of each token, except for Ethena, with an investment of $2.3 million. These acquisitions reflect a strategy of diversifying WLFI's assets, moving away from stablecoins and betting on more speculative tokens.

# Trump's crypto project

Currently, WLFI has a diversified portfolio, with the largest holding of¬†**43,000 ETH**, valued at approximately¬†**$143 million**¬†, representing the largest stake. Additionally, it holds¬†**$96 million in Tether (USDT)**¬†and¬†**$56 million in USD Coin (USDC)**.

Other assets include nearly¬†**$6.5 million in Wrapped Bitcoin, Aave and Chainlink**¬†,¬†**$4.6 million in Tron**¬†and¬†**$3 million in Ethena**.

>Also, WLFI added memecoins to its portfolio, purchasing Hoppy (""Pepe's friend""), and interestingly Pulsechain  (PLS), Richard Heart token is part of the holdings.

It is important to note that despite the recent launch of Trump's official memecoin,¬†**$TRUMP, which generated¬†$25 billion**¬†in revenue in 24 hours, WLFI did not acquire any tokens of this cryptocurrency.

In November, Tron founder Justin Sun invested¬†**$30 million**¬†in WLFI tokens and was quickly appointed as an advisor to the project.

Recently, WLFI sold close to¬†**$10 million worth of WBTC tokens**¬†days before the presidential inauguration. This move sparked speculation, although WLFI stated that these transactions are part of its regular asset management.

The WLFI wallet also saw significant deposits in Ethereum and USDT. Despite the controversies and with a total value estimated at over¬†**$17 million**¬†, the project remains open and is looking to raise¬†**$300 million**¬†by selling¬†**20 billion WLFI tokens**.

Bitcoin Today 01/22/2025: Trump reference dominates cryptocurrency purchases,CapitalistExploits,1i7h5rt,2025-01-22 12:52:37,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalistExploits/comments/1i7h5rt/bitcoin_today_01222025_trump_reference_dominates/,kayakero,,"Leaving behind the sharp correction of the previous day, Bitcoin (BTC) rose again and reached¬†$105,000 USD, with a 2% increase in the last 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the main cryptocurrency in the market reached¬†$105,275 USD, registering a growth of 2.1% in this period.

With this recovery, the Top 10 cryptocurrencies also showed notable gains. Solana (SOL), which suffered one of the biggest drops during the correction, appreciated by 6.3%, achieving the largest rise in the Top 10. This pushed its price up to¬†$254 USD, accumulating a 36% increase in the last seven days.

On the other hand, the slogan ‚ÄúDOGE to Mars‚Äù benefited Dogecoin, the largest of the memecoins, which registered a 5.6% increase on Wednesday (22). In the Top 100, the AI16Z memecoin appreciated again with a rise of 34%, while XDC led the few falls in the ranking with a loss of 7%.

**Number 47**

Following the first day of the most pro-crypto president in US history, cryptocurrency prices experienced a sharp drop before recovering. But how can this be explained?

For Bitget analyst Bonveti, the market has a short memory, ‚Äúlike that of a goldfish.‚Äù According to him, investors tend to react more to immediate fears than to long-term plans.

Interestingly, while many were selling their tokens, Donald Trump made significant buying moves that are drawing attention. On the day of his inaugural address, President Trump invested¬†$28 million USD¬†in cryptocurrencies. According to Bonveti, the distribution was as follows:

* **$4.7 million USD**¬†in ETH
* **$4.7 million USD**¬†in WBTC
* **$4.7 million USD**¬†in AAVE
* **$4.7 million USD**¬†in LINK
* **$4.7 million USD**¬†in TRX
* **$4.7 million USD**¬†in ENA

>

It is worth noting that these purchases occurred after a sharp sell-off in the price of the¬†$**TRUMP**¬†memecoin, when several investors decided to take profits.

**Recovery**

Furthermore, Trump‚Äôs treasury wallet now contains¬†$35.5 billion USD¬†worth of TRUMP and¬†$17.5 billion USD¬†worth of other memecoins. This shows that the president has not yet liquidated all of his tokens, which have had a considerable impact on the prices of other cryptocurrencies.

On the other hand, the¬†**World Liberty Finance**¬†project, backed by the Trump family, continues to diversify its sources of income. According to CriptoF√°cil, this project has accumulated at least¬†$25 million USD¬†in tokens such as LINK, TRX, AAVE and others.

President Trump Sidesteps Crypto on Day One,bitfate,1i7elnc,2025-01-22 11:08:06,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitfate/comments/1i7elnc/president_trump_sidesteps_crypto_on_day_one/,MammothBattle33,,"üö®Just IN: Trump‚Äôs First Day in Office Brings Mixed Signals for Crypto

In a whirlwind of executive actions on his first day back in office, President Donald Trump left the crypto community with more questions than answers. Despite pre-inauguration hype suggesting a potential boost for digital assets, Trump's inaugural address and subsequent actions did not include any crypto-related orders.

Bitcoin, which had surged to nearly $110,000 in anticipation of Trump's presidency, experienced a volatile day. It climbed to new heights before plummeting to around $100,000 and then rebounding to the $102,000-$104,000 range. This rollercoaster ride reflects the cautious optimism and speculative nature of the crypto market.

The absence of explicit crypto policies in Trump's first-day actions was a surprise, given his recent hints at a more favorable regulatory environment. However, the acting SEC head's announcement of a task force to create a clear regulatory framework for crypto assets provided some solace, helping BTC recover from its earlier lows.

Other crypto tokens, such as $TRUMP and $MELANIA, which had gained traction due to political fervor, saw significant declines. These memecoins, which had skyrocketed in value leading up to the inauguration, dropped by 20% and 32%, respectively, as the initial excitement wore off.

Despite the lack of immediate policy breakthroughs, there are indications that Trump's administration may still support the crypto sector. World Liberty Financial, a DeFi initiative linked to Trump's family, made substantial cryptocurrency purchases on his first day in office, including $47 million in Ether (ETH) and $47 million in Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).

As the crypto community waits for clearer signals from the Trump administration, one thing is certain: the next few months will be pivotal in shaping the future of digital assets in the United States.

WLFI announced that these investments were tied to Trump‚Äôs inauguration. On January 20, WLFI completed the placement of 20% of its token supply (100 billion tokens), raising $300 million. The project is now looking to sell an additional 5% of tokens due to strong investor demand.

This initiative was officially announced in September 2024 by Donald Trump‚Äôs sons, along with a token sale that began in mid-October.

I believe that the connection between cryptocurrency and political figures like WLFI and Trump adds significant weight to the perception of cryptocurrencies as a key financial instrument. This precedent may attract new investors, increase legitimacy for the industry, and encourage the development of favorable regulations. However, such initiatives bring risks as well. The politicization of the market could lead to increased volatility, dependence on government decisions, and heightened regulatory pressure. I think WLFI will serve as a test of how these political ties impact the industry in the long term.

Zano is the Solana of the Privacy-Coin Sphere. Want to understand what Zano is? Give this a read. This essay is a work in progress I‚Äòve been working on for a few days so anyone with ideas of what to add or change lemme know :) I have a part 2 which focuses on the Zano Matrix which I‚Äòll add soon.,Zano,1i726c3,2025-01-21 22:46:26,22,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zano/comments/1i726c3/zano_is_the_solana_of_the_privacycoin_sphere_want/,muffinman418,,"Solana‚Äòs growth and ecosystem is quite amazing and the people over at Zano are building a similar project within the privacy-coin sphere. No other privacy-coin has attempted anything quite like this, making the project incredibly unique. Far from being just a pipe-dream the ambitions of Zano are already well on their way to full development and several milestones have already been implemented (like the Zarcanum hard fork which made Zano the world's first Proof of Stake scheme with hidden amounts... all while maintaining its hybrid Proof-of-Work/Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism). Like $SOL, you can build on top of Zano, and various developers are already working on projects like a private stablecoin and much much more. Zano is modernizing privacy-coins by making private transactions practical for everyday use without sacrificing performance or decentralization.

The collaboration with Bitcoin.com is set to integrate $ZANO's native blockchain into the Bitcoin.com wallet app, potentially reaching over 50 million users. This partnership is expected to significantly boost $ZANO's visibility and integration within the crypto ecosystem. This is hardly the only bullish piece of news when it comes to Zano getting noticed and standing out in the crowd. Roger Ver (the so called ‚ÄúBitcoin Jesus‚Äú) praised Zano extensively when speaking to Tucker Carlson in an interview for example. This event alone sent Zano‚Äòs market cap from under $80 million to over $180 million and then upwards towards a peak of $229 million. Other past notable events that have influenced the market cap and brought in talented devs have been the Zano team‚Äòs dedication to engaging with the crypto community and especially the Monero community through in-person appearances at Monerotopia 2024, multiple guest appearances on the podcast MoneroTalk and published interviews on TheStreet, OneSafe, IQ.wiki and several other sources. Articles, videos and posts keep popping up with bullish articles on Zano. This project is a sleeping giant which is already waking up and beginning to stand tall.

How does Zano work? I implore you to read into this yourself as its quite fascinating but in short Zano leverages a hybrid Proof-of-Work/Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism and uses adaptive block sizes to ensure efficient, scalable transactions while maintaining robust security. This mirrors Solana‚Äôs innovations in high-speed, low-cost consensus mechanisms but within a framework tailored to anonymity. $ZANO also integrates advanced cryptographic tools like ring signatures, stealth addresses, and bulletproofs to ensure transactional privacy, comparable to how Solana reshaped dApp infrastructure with its speed and efficiency but combined with all (and more) of the privacy innovations of Monero.

$ZANO is advancing its mission to become the $SOL of the privacy-coin world by implementing several significant developments that enhance its technological capabilities, privacy features, and user accessibility. Central to these advancements is the Zarcanum hard fork. This introduced Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) and the pioneering addition of the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm *with hidden amounts* to the Proof-of-Work (PoW) Zano already . This innovation further obfuscates transaction details, thereby strengthening user anonymity and aligning with $ZANO‚Äôs commitment to robust privacy.

$ZANO also offers 'Confidential Assets,' enabling the creation of privacy-focused tokens on its blockchain. This feature allows developers to launch privacy projects without the complexities of maintaining separate blockchains.

If you are worried about the fact that everything is hidden and you want to be more transparent worry not. Users of Zano can provide an audit key to allow transparency ***only when desired*** ***and only to those you wish to have that transparency with.*** This makes it an ideal platform for customizable privacy solutions for both developers and investors.

If you want to pay taxes you can provide your audit key and if you want to prove asset holdings to an individual, business or company to show you have the amount you claim you have you can provide your audit key.

This is what true privacy is all about. Think about how you keep a lock on your home and only unlock that door and let people in only when you choose to. You do not leave your door open and windows unlocked and unblinded while a pile of money sits on the living room table. If a company or investor wants to transact with the privacy current banks offer only its most prestigious users Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not exactly ideal as all wallets and transactions are transparent with everything being permanently logged for all to see. Privacy-coins are an advancement which provides investors n devs with the autonomy to have optional anonymity that rivals and even outperforms current banking systems. Speaking of current banking systems many have been known to have breaches, sketch behavior and people on the inside selling customer data:

>In a recent case, a staff member at TD Bank's New York branch, who was responsible for detecting money laundering, misused her access to distribute customer details to a criminal network via Telegram. Prosecutors revealed that her phone contained images of 255 checks and personal information of nearly 70 individuals.

>There was also a Florida-based employee of Navy Federal Credit Union who recorded customers' personal information and advertised it for sale on Telegram. This breach led to the exposure of approximately 50 accounts to over 2,700 subscribers.

>Another example was at Wells Fargo where an associate operations processor at a Philadelphia facility misappropriated confidential customer information and sold it to third parties, resulting in fraudulent transactions amounting to approximately $688,000.

>On November 27 PayPal began sharing personal data from customer purchases, such as product preferences and sizes, with retailers to enhance targeted advertising. While users have the option to opt out (we all know how few people actually pay attention to stuff like this and would have opted out).

>Consider also The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) fined U.S. Bank $37.5 million for illegally accessing customers‚Äô credit reports and opening various accounts without their consent. The bank's policies pressured employees to meet sales goals, leading to unauthorized account openings.

None of this would be possible with *careful* use of privacy-coins like Zano and Zano‚Äòs audit keys. I wrote ‚Äúkeys‚Äú plural because a Zano user can generate distinct audit keys for different parties, such as:

* **Tax Authorities:** An audit key that provides access to transactions relevant for tax reporting.
* **Business Partners:** An audit key granting access to transactions tied to a specific contractual agreement.
* **Internal Audits:** A self-generated key for internal bookkeeping or compliance purposes.

By creating multiple keys, Zano users can ensure that each auditor sees only the information pertinent to their purpose, maintaining personalized control over transparency. It is important to note that this key is view only and does not in any way give control over held assets to any chosen parties. Your Zano is your Zano.

Privacy-coins, despite the reputation certain news propaganda are attempting to establish in the minds of readers (just as they did in the early years of Bitcoin), are *not designed for criminals* but rather to address **the human right to privacy** and the **right to fungibility with their assets**. Zano‚Äòs privacy features and tokenomics ensure that Zano coins are not tainted based on their transactional history. In some cryptocurrencies without robust privacy mechanisms, coins involved in illicit activities (that a buyer might end up owning through no fault of their own) might become less desirable or outright rejected by recipients, thereby compromising fungibility. Zano's design mitigates this issue by making all coins appear indistinguishable from one another and through its multiple layers of security.

As I mentioned before in Bitcoin‚Äòs early years the same sort of propaganda we now see concerning privacy-coins was rampant (inferring only criminals use it or that it was a useless investment with no purpose) and yet now in 2025 we have massive institutional and governmental adoption with the Trump administration advocating for a U.S crypto reserve which considering investment firms like Blackrock (themselves worth $11.5 Trillion) now publicly recommend investors put as much as 2% of their investments In Bitcoin. Blackrock owns nearly 3% of the total supply of Bitcoin (563,134+ BTC) and Microstrategy owns 423,650+ BTC (2.14%+ of the total supply) it seems like a no-brainer that the U.S should have set up years ago (RIP Germany who sold their seized BTC at a low, which they could have sold and made more than 1 billion more than they did). Times change and they change quickly. The usefulness of privacy-coins to both massive investment entities as well as the average investor cannot be understated. With the Trump administration now in control concerns around regulation are decreasing exponentially. While Trump and Melania‚Äòs meme coins garner the most attention Zano has been the more serious up and coming project that is wrapped up in all the massive changes we are about to see to the crypto world.

Advanced algorithms and systems like that of Chainalysis (utilized by various clients, including banks, brokers, and government agencies such as the F.B.I. and the D.E.A.) can trace even the most elaborate attempts to obfuscate ownership of mainstream transparent crypto assets (BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP etc etc). Compare that to the technology harnessed and utilized by privacy-coins like Monero and Zano. Despite over 1,500,000$ in ‚Äúbounties‚Äú given by U.S authorities to various companies like Chainalysis privacy-coins have never been cracked.  Even if some ‚Äúsuper sekret‚Äú algorithm is being kept from the public and being used by groups like the CIA, FSB, Mossad etc which could try and trace privacy-coins like Monero and Zano privacy projects are constantly evolving and adding new security measures such as genius innovations that protect crypto and privacy-coins from the insane potential of quantum computers (which are a major threat to many less robust crypto projects).

This aligns with the original intent of those who developed Bitcoin: the cypherpunks. Crypto folk: don‚Äòt forget your roots. Read some of the early conversations between Bitcoin devs and you‚Äòll see just how much projects like Zano and Monero are exactly what these guys were all about. The stunning flexibility and unique unrivalled possibilities for development on top of Zano could well see it become the Solana of the Privacy World and if common sense regulations and unfair biases against crypto and privacy-coins continue to lax (quite likely in the wake of Trump‚Äòs reelection) it is not impossible we will see a market cap of 500 million - 1 billion or more over the next few months and years. If Zano's market cap were to reach $500 million, its price would be approximately $37.23 USD per ZANO. If the market cap were to increase to $1 billion, the price would rise to approximately $74.46 USD per ZANO."

Elon Musk ‚Äôs Sonic Boom Salute: The Natural Reflex of a Billionaire Beast,Sarcgasm,1i6yt76,2025-01-21 20:06:16,3,0.81,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sarcgasm/comments/1i6yt76/elon_musk_s_sonic_boom_salute_the_natural_reflex/,s4rcgasm,,"[Elon Musk‚Äôs hand shot forward‚Äînot a Nazi salute, of course not! No, it was a sonic boom aimed at our values.](https://i.redd.it/12e5e6y53gee1.gif)

Fuck Chaos Theory. This butterfly flapped its wings and caused a load of pointless discussion about whether or not we all saw what we know we fucking saw.

**Yesterday, amidst the grotesque theatre of Donald Trump‚Äôs Second Coming Inauguration, Elon Musk‚Äôs hand shot forward. Not a Nazi salute! Perish the thought, you paranoid plebs. No, this was something far more primal. A billionaire chest-beating ritual, a movement as natural as a lizard flicking its tongue or an incontinent orange octogenarian baby shitting into a nappy while people applaud it for writing its name indecipherably in a grand gesture as obscene as public onanism.**

Picture it: the Tesla titan, quivering with triumph, chest puffed out, eyes glazed in the manic glow of a man who thinks Mars is his side chick. Then the arm shoots out, flat-palmed, cutting through the air like Guile‚Äôs Sonic Boom from Street Fighter 2. BOOM! The gesture echoes through the void, a butterfly flaps its wings, and a hurricane spawns in Shenzhen. That‚Äôs Chaos Theory 101, mofos. Musk just handed physics its eviction notice.

Now I know what people are saying. Musk definitely DID NOT do a Nazi salute (wink wink) and he most certainly did not intend to send a secret (not so secret) message to his Nazi followers. Yeah, that is just fake news. The REAL story is this: Musk got excited, beat his chest and threw his hand out flat because that‚Äôs the NATURAL gesture that people give in those kinds of situations. Like when you‚Äôre thinking, you scratch your head. When you are hungry, you rub your stomach. And when you are fleecing the world, when you are riding mother earth and all her gullible yuppies around and around, then the Musk salute is as natural as reaching your finger into your nose to get rid of some dangling nose turds.

And the media? Oh, they were salivating. ""Was it deliberate? A signal to secret Nazi followers?"" screamed The Guardian. Let me tell you, folks, it wasn‚Äôt a dog whistle. It was a foghorn strapped to a space rocket, blaring, ‚ÄúI AM INEVITABLE,‚Äù while flamethrowers torched any semblance of doubt. Questioning IF it was a salute is as pointless as ducking behind a tin-can in the wake of a nuclear explosion. Your shadow will just be frozen in disbelief, as shit comes back to bite its own ass.

# The Apartheid Roots of Reflexes

Elon‚Äôs reflexes are honed by history, by the golden sands of Apartheid South Africa where little Elon learned two things‚Äîhow to enjoy his sheltered life showered with opulent privilege, and how to exploit the life that he inherited without doing a day‚Äôs work for it himself. Dig deep into that emerald mine of lore, where his family fortune glistened with blood-stained dirt. A Nazi salute? Nah. This is muscle memory, folks, carved into the very sinews of a man who grew up in a system built on hierarchy and unflinching power.  
That hand shooting forward? It‚Äôs the same instinct that has him firing engineers on Twitter after lunch, launching Teslas into orbit because why the fuck not, and slapping his name on AI babies like he‚Äôs some kind of ordained technopriest of shitposts.

# Not His First Rodeo

Now, let‚Äôs ask: has he done this before? Erm‚Ä¶ yes. Remember when Musk‚Äôs arm flailed uncontrollably at a Tesla Cybertruck unveiling, causing several Mars rovers to start fucking each other on the space live-feed? Or that time he gestured wildly during an AI conference and accidentally summoned the spirit of Ayn Rand? ChatGPT‚Äôs logo briefly changed into one of those stickers where the lady‚Äôs clothes melt off if you pour a hot beverage in it. Musk‚Äôs hand is a goddamn maverick, unbound by mortal will. If you told me it‚Äôs controlled by a neural link prototype gone rogue, I wouldn‚Äôt blink.

# Musk and the ‚ÄúHurricane Effect‚Äù

But this isn‚Äôt just a gesture; it‚Äôs a phenomenon. A butterfly on steroids. Musk‚Äôs moves warp global markets. X stock plummets? A twitch. Bitcoin tanks? A wink. Trump's inauguration? The US dollar dives, the Yen strengthens, and his meme coin, $TRUMP, surges to an $11 billion market cap, only to tumble later, lol. Hurricanes form? That‚Äôs the Musk Salute in action, cutting through the world‚Äôs collective psyche like a Tesla autopilot ploughing through stop signs and mannequins/humans (what‚Äôs the fucking difference? Depends what colour the mannequin is I suppose)??!? Sorry my brain is imploding as I write this. Musk is just so clever, such a fucking GENIUS that I cannot wrap my tiny mortal brain around it. Maybe only Grok could explain this shit. But then again, seems unlikely. Usually when people do a Nazi salute, they get punched in the face shortly afterwards, or kill themselves in a bunker. Here‚Äôs hoping.

And yet, Musk dances away unscathed. Immune. Untouchable. Like a hologram or a virus that doesn‚Äôt need a host, just a microphone and a megaphone. He‚Äôs Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs tech bro: both the villain and the visionary, the puppet master of a digital dystopia, flicking us off while pretending he‚Äôs the saviour.

# Conclusion: The Sonic Boom That Never Stops

So, next time Musk throws that hand out, don‚Äôt think ‚ÄúNazi salute.‚Äù Think of it as an apex predator marking its territory. A natural reflex in the swirling vortex we call existence. The Musk Salute is no mere gesture. It‚Äôs the modern war cry of a man who sees the world as his sandbox, humanity as his beta test, and the universe as his PR stunt.

And as for that hurricane in China? It wasn‚Äôt chaos theory. It was marketing. Sorry if it took your face off though, eh?

>Elon Musk‚Äôs hand shot forward‚Äînot a Nazi salute, of course not! No, it was a sonic boom aimed directly at our most precious values.

I'm not an Nazi... I'm an ancient fucking roman duhfunn

Anyways after watching Trump‚Äôs speech about his plans for the economy/money and lack of plans for anything having to do with pressing social issues, climate change or realistic foreign policy- he mentioned adopting cryptocurrency/bitcoin so America can lead in the currency.

Part 2 - The Offshore Tax Haven Ramble),PersonalFinanceNZ,1i6dupw,2025-01-21 03:07:29,15,0.86,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceNZ/comments/1i6dupw/part_2_the_offshore_tax_haven_ramble/,Jasoncatt,,"OK, firstly, for those that have been waiting, my apologies for this taking a little longer than initially mentioned. It has been a busy week at work. Also apologies also for the length of the post - it wouldn't be a ramble without a large surplus of words.   
  
Second, and by way of a disclaimer, this post is written purely for ""edutainment"" purposes, and describes my own journey to minimise my NZ tax exposure both legally and ethically, by setting up an offshore entity in a ""tax haven"" whilst creating generational wealth for my descendants. It is not financial advice,  you should get this from a professional. I am not one of those.  
  
There's a TL:DR at the end. Scroll down if you're lazy or only slightly curious.

For those of you that didn't read my previous post, it was about US estate (death) tax, and how you could protect your legacy by putting your overseas market holdings into an irrevocable trust, so that Uncle Sam couldn't claim up to 40% of your holdings at the time of your death.

This post is about how I started with the process to avoid US death taxes, but ended up setting up an offshore investment entity in a tax advantaged jurisdiction so that I could actively invest in foreign equities, maximising returns while at the same time minimising my personal tax exposure here in NZ.   
  
Everything I'm about to discuss is what I have done, for my own situation. It is both legal and doesn't evade tax in any way. I'll intentionally be a little vague in some areas to encourage you to get your own advice, as there are several ways to achieve what I have done. Plus, as mentioned, I'm not an expert - I pay others to set this up and manage it for me. Even my eyes gloss over from time to time when discussing matters with them.  
This therefore is a snapshot, a shortish (lol) view of a very long process that took almost a year to complete.  
  
Further, this is for those with significant assets, and for those that want to actively trade and invest in foreign domiciled equities, funds etc, and are therefore subject to higher taxes on their endeavours. It's not something that will even begin to benefit you until your account size reaches well over 7 figures, as the cost of setting up together the annual cost of maintaining the entity are a factor.   
  
You may be in your 40s or 50s with a business that you're looking to sell for your retirement and are wondering what to do with the proceeds. You may have a property portfolio that brings in a very healthy income which you are looking to liquidate for retirement. You may have both, as I have. Or you may just be in your 20s, wondering how this sh!t is done so you can effectively plan for your future. Either way, to achieve the most (or any) benefit from this, you will need a NW figure sufficient to make going through this process worthwhile.   
  
If your entire portfolio is in NZ domiciled PIE funds and you're looking at a retirement nest egg of anything less than say $1.5 - $2m there will be little or no benefit to you, at least in the short term (although it could still benefit you in terms of getting you to the larger account sooner). Above $4m this starts to make real sense, and anything above $6+m I would definitely recommend exploring your options.   
  
What this *isn't* about, is avoiding paying income tax on your income here in NZ. As they say, the only certainties in life are death and taxes. I pay tax on every dollar distributed to me as income and am happy to do so. However, as you will see, I legitimately pay far less tax compared to someone that has their entire portfolio domiciled in NZ (with some caveats and considerations).

So... having got that out of the way, let's dive in. 

Back in the UK as a much younger man almost 40 years ago, I would sometimes wonder how the wealthy managed to pay significantly less tax than the average man in the street. I often read about their offshore ""Tax Haven"" bank accounts, their ""Cayman Islands"" investment companies, or their ""Lichtenstein Trusts"" and I assumed that these were purely the domain of the ultra wealthy. I wasn't entirely wrong, but as I was to discover decades later, they were a great deal more accessible than I had first imagined. 

After having this thought swirling round my subconscious over the years, I finally reached the point in my journey through life where my net worth was such that I started to actively investigate the idea.   
The result below are the details of my ""offshore tax haven"" investment structure, in its three constituent parts:  
  
1: An offshore (foreign) irrevocable family trust, domiciled in the Isle of Man in the UK. Although I was the original settlor (funder) of the trust and continue to fund it until I retire, I have transferred control of the trust to appointed professional trustees. When I retire and transfer the remaining of my capital to this trust I will relinquish my role as settlor.   
I am not the beneficiary of this trust (although I am a ""discretionary beneficiary"" that benefits from it). The combination of these things ensures that as far as either the US IRS or NZ IRD are concerned, the funds and investments held in the trust are no longer mine (and indeed they are not), and are therefore not part of my personal income or holdings.   
Why in the Isle of Man? Purely convenience, although it does have its own particular benefits, i.e lower cost than other UK offshore jurisdictions such as Jersey. I could have set up in the Cayman Islands, Dubai or any number of other tax advantaged jurisdictions, but for me as a UK citizen that used to travel back to the UK regularly while my parents were alive, this made sense purely from a convenience standpoint.   
There are quite a few other moving parts to this setup which I'll exclude here, or you'll be reading all night. If you decide to follow this path, your advisers will be able to assist you on the details. 

2: There is an investment Company, owned by the family trust, whose job it is to invest the funds in the trust wisely, on behalf of future generations.

3: The trust has an independent board of trustees/directors both for the trust and investment company, whose job it is to administer the investment goals of the trust in accordance with the trust deed. 

Ok... I know what you're thinking (f#ck me, that's a huge commitment). But it is more simple than it sounds at first reading (even if it's not cheap and has many steps that need to be taken).  
  
First, setting up an irrevocable family trust in the Isle of Man wasn't much different or more expensive compared with setting one up here in New Zealand. If you estimate a similar amount of pounds as it costs here in dollars you won't be far wrong.   
Why an ""Irrevocable Family Trust""? Because an irrevocable family trust permanently and irrevocably transfers the ownership of any of the assets that it contains away from myself and into the trust, with my children as the beneficiaries. Further, the trust is structured to be ""perpetual"" so that once I've passed, succession planning becomes easier, with my children's children becoming the beneficiaries, and my children becoming the discretionary beneficiaries.

Other costs in setting up the trust:  
Aside from the bare shell of the trust, you need a very comprehensive Trust Deed, which details exactly what the trust is for, who it is to benefit, who manages it and what their roles are, plus the method by which the investments are to be managed (how the money is invested, in what asset classes, investment goals regarding active vs passive investing, growth ETFs, dividend holdings etc etc). This costs a significant amount of money to get right, with (in my case) around half a dozen revisions, discussion with tax and trust experts in both Isle of Man and here in NZ, plus my lawyer. You could easily spend a further $20k+ on this. I did. 

The Investment Company:  
A limited liability company owned by the family trust. The purpose of this is to hold brokerage accounts and invest in international equities, in line with the directives set out in the trust deed. In my case, this incudes long term growth portfolios, an income portfolio, a currency trading portfolio (for hedging) and a speculative account which can actively trade in more risky asset classes such as IPOs, early stage growth companies, etc. (This is just my structure but you could structure this any way you like, much in the way that you might have several portfolios yourself today).  
Crucially, the trust employs me as investment advisor and gives me the ability to manage the portfolios on behalf of (and in conjunction with) the trustees. This relationship between myself and the trustees is highly nuanced. I won't say more, but your trust/tax advisor will understand what I am alluding to here.

So, having done all that, what are the benefits, both for me personally, for the investment company, and for my children as beneficiaries?  
  
I'll start with the investment company:  
Well, it operates in a jurisdiction that has no corporate or income tax on gains made on investments, whether they are considered long term capital gains or gains made from actively trading assets (unlike NZ...). All gains are tax free. If the investment company turns $7 million into $15 million, whichever way it achieves it, the tax bill is $0.   
(An exception is income generated from US domiciled funds such as VOO, SCHD or any dividend bearing holding, which are subject to US withholding tax on the income derived from dividend payments. UK income holdings however are zero rated in terms on income tax on dividends. Each country where an asset is domiciled will have its own tax laws which need to be adhered to).  
  
The investment company actively invests in most asset classes, and following my advice, actively trades on equities which, had the investment fund been domiciled in NZ would be subject to tax on trading profits. These taxes are therefore avoided. Does this benefit me personally? Well no not directly, however, a faster growing investment fund allows greater distributions to me in the future, so I can still benefit from the gains. It also allows me the comfort of knowing that I'm building something that will greatly benefit future generations, in an environment where the growth is hugely tax advantaged.   
  
For my children:  
Well obviously they will receive the benefit of investments that have grown tax free over a number of decades. They only pay tax on distributions made to them, and no tax on capital distributions, provided it is structured properly, per IRD rules.    
Distributions to beneficiaries in lower tax brackets (such as the trust paying for my daughter's university education for example, or buying her a new car).  
If you think 1% fees charged annually by private fund managers compounds like crazy over say 30 years, imagine what benefit the favourable tax jurisdiction provides over the same period on an account that's achieving a CAGR of say 15%...

For me:  
Distributions are passed from the trust in several ways.   
As an investment adviser to the trust, I am paid for my advice. I pay income tax on this here in NZ. This will essentially be my retirement ""job"".  
Capital distributions - for example, the trust buys $100k of Apple shares, sells them several years later by rebalancing the portfolio, this initial capital (not the gains) can be distributed tax free (provided that NZ tax laws are also adhered to).  
Gifting. This is more complicated, but there are avenues for the beneficiaries to gift distributions or capital returns to me.  
A lot of what I would traditionally be paying for is now managed by the trust (such as my daughter's education). Mind you, that also applies to me in many ways. I live in a house that no longer belongs to me, the maintenance of which, any renovation work and upkeep is all paid for by the trust also...

Setting the structure up to be compliant with NZ tax laws:  
Ok, so this is an area that I will be intentionally vague on. Not because I don't want to tell you, but because I really don't understand all the nuances myself. I'm not an expert. If you're interested in this, you will need to get your own advice.   
  
However, some considerations that I can think of that you'll need to be aware of (and which you absolutely have to get right), amongst others are:   
  
1: IRD will need to be shown that this trust exists not for your benefit, but for the benefit of future generations.   
  
2: You will need to essentially give up any personal ownership of the assets contained in the trust. They are no longer yours - they will belong to the trust and are managed by trustees, even if under your guidance.   
  
3: The trust needs to be structured in such a way that there is a genuine reason to be domiciled offshore, rather than purely existing to avoid NZ taxes. For example, to minimise currency fluctuations to the NZ dollar (being heavily invested in US, UK and other market equities), or to enable more efficient investing in multiple assets from various global markets. In my case it was also a benefit that my children have access to British citizenship, therefore part of the raison d'√™tre for the trust is to support beneficiaries no matter where in the world they reside. You'll need advice on this as these are only the things I can remember were pertinent, and are definitely not the only things you might consider. There are other reasons that you can use.

4: You will need to ensure that you are fully compliant with NZ tax laws, as well as the tax laws of the jurisdiction where you establish your offshore entity. Everything needs to be very carefully documented and reported and NZ IRD needs to be informed of what you are doing. Needless to say, this is a minefield, and you need very specific advice on how to proceed. This can get expensive. It will get expensive. But, once done it's done. 

Downsides:  
The entity, being domiciled in a jurisdiction that doesn't have reciprocal tax agreements with the US and other countries, will have to pay withholding tax on those holdings that generate income and are liable for this. Unlike New Zealand where we have a reciprocal tax agreement with the US where I can claim withholding tax back. It's a small downside for me, as withholding tax on dividends is far outweighed by the overall tax benefits for the lion's share of the portfolios. 

It's somewhat of a shift in mindset - giving up ownership of all (or most) of your holdings and having someone else involved in the management of these assets (even if they are following your advice). As alluded to above, this external management can be structured in a way as to ensure that your own goals for the trust and its investments are still adhered to, but it does add a layer of administrative drag.   
  
For example, I cannot suddenly decide to invest in a particular asset class that isn't already documented in the trust deed. Anything out of the ordinary needs to be discussed with the trustees to ensure that the investment aligns with the trust's goals and is in the best interest of the beneficiaries. If I suddenly decide I want to invest $500k into Bitcoin because it's going to the moooooon, I can expect significant kickback from the trustees and would have to convince them of the benefits of such a move.  But... this isn't necessarily a bad thing. In all day to day investments, as long as they're aligned with the Trust's goals and solely for the benefit of the beneficiaries, and including broad investment strategies already detailed in the trust deed, I'm free to invest how I see fit. 

Setup and management costs:  
All told, this cost me around $40,000 to set up, but has ongoing management costs also. This is why you need to be above a certain level for this to make sense. I have monthly minuted online meetings with the trustees (which they charge for), plus email communications (which they charge for), plus any phone calls or other online contact (which they charge for) plus the annual accounting fees, etc, etc.   
Some of these fees, such as the accountancy fees would be necessary in an NZ domiciled fund in any case, so it's not all additional to what I would be doing anyway. 

So I think I have gone on long enough. I could continue for hours, but hopefully this gives you some insight.  Is it for everyone? No, absolutely not. However, if you're looking at building intergenerational wealth and have the resources to do something similar it may well be worth considering. 

Wrapping it all up (TL:DR)  
Actively investing a big account in overseas markets from NZ? That‚Äôs a tax buffet I don‚Äôt want second helpings of. Instead, I packed my wealth into an offshore trust, where it works hard for the next generation, tax-free as long as gains stay in the trust. I still pay my fair share on what comes back to me in NZ, because I like to keep IRD happy. 

The real winners? My kids. They get turbocharged, tax advantaged growth, with distributions that even IRD can‚Äôt touch (capital ones, that is).   
If you‚Äôve ever wondered how the wealthy keep their wallets fat while avoiding unnecessary tax, here‚Äôs one way they do it, both legally and ethically.

WLFI isn‚Äôt just dabbling; they‚Äôre diving headfirst into the elite crypto league with a clear focus on premium assets.  

Meanwhile, y'all still sleeping on Ethereum? Don‚Äôt! It‚Äôs not just a blockchain; it‚Äôs the lifeblood of the next-gen internet. With projects like WLFI betting big on $ETH, you might want to swipe right on this crypto bae too.  

$YOI is coming soon to shake things up, btw. Just saying. Who‚Äôs ready to take this ride with me?

Crypto omitted from White House priorities and Trump‚Äôs inaugural speech,Blockmandev,1i63ux6,2025-01-20 18:01:18,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockmandev/comments/1i63ux6/crypto_omitted_from_white_house_priorities_and/,MammothBattle33,,"üö® Trump‚Äôs Inaugural Day Ignores Bitcoin, But Actions Speak Louder  

President Donald Trump wrapped up his inaugural speech without a single nod to $BTC or crypto, leaving enthusiasts raising their eyebrows. Adding to the suspense, a Republican-led document outlining the administration‚Äôs new priorities also steers clear of naming digital assets. But does this silence mean crypto‚Äôs out of the spotlight?

While Trump‚Äôs speech spotlighted border security, energy independence, and government reforms, it skipped over recent buzz surrounding his crypto-focused promises. This includes potential executive orders to establish a Bitcoin reserve, foster mining initiatives, and create a national crypto advisory council.

Yet, behind the scenes, pro-crypto appointments tell another story. Trump‚Äôs pick for SEC chair, Paul Atkins, boasts a track record of supporting innovation and blockchain development. Meanwhile, David Sacks, once PayPal‚Äôs COO, has been tapped as the administration‚Äôs first-ever ""Crypto Czar."" Even at the CFTC, names like Summer Mersinger and Brian Quintenz, known for their crypto advocacy, are rumored front-runners for leadership roles.

Adding a tangible twist, fresh on-chain data suggests a Trump-backed entity recently snagged $47 million in $BTC. Coincidence? Perhaps not.  

The markets didn‚Äôt flinch either‚Äînone of the top 20 digital assets saw a dip post-speech, signaling resilience in the space.

Crypto may have been omitted from the White House‚Äôs priorities on day one, but the whispers and moves behind the curtain imply a promising trajectory for the sector under Trump‚Äôs leadership.

Rumble, the Tether-backed video-sharing platform, has officially made its entry into the Bitcoin space. On Jan. 20, CEO Chris Pavlovski announced that the company completed its first-ever $BTC acquisition last Friday, marking a historic moment for the platform. While he kept the purchase amount under wraps, Pavlovski hinted this was just the opening act in a much grander Bitcoin strategy.

This move aligns with Rumble‚Äôs November 2024 announcement to allocate $20 million toward $BTC due to its strong belief in the crypto‚Äôs long-term resilience and potential. The platform sees Bitcoin as a vital hedge against inflation, immune to the negative effects of excessive monetary printing. Pavlovski has been vocal about Bitcoin's role in shaping the future of corporate treasuries, emphasizing its strength as a strategic asset.

Rumble‚Äôs jump into the Bitcoin pool also mirrors a broader corporate movement. Notable firms like MicroStrategy, SpaceX, and Block.one have stockpiled hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin in their reserves. The latest data reveals that both public and private firms are collectively holding nearly 1 million $BTC, underscoring crypto‚Äôs undeniable appeal in the financial playbook.

This growing adoption trend has been further heightened with the Financial Accounting Standards Board‚Äôs updated rules, enabling corporations to report Bitcoin at market value. And as more companies like Rumble step into the Bitcoin ecosystem, this ""megatrend"" seems poised to keep expanding.

Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, and key execs from Bitcoin mining giant Marathon Digital recently met with Trump‚Äôs incoming administration. The meeting, hosted by Vice President JD Vance, has the crypto community speculating about potential advancements in US Bitcoin mining initiatives.  

Although details remain under wraps, Marathon Digital‚Äôs VP Robert Samuels revealed his team is ‚Äúexcited about the future of mining in the US‚Äù after discussions with Trump‚Äôs inner circle. With MicroStrategy holding 450,000 BTC and Marathon Digital sitting on 44,893 BTC, these firms are among the biggest influencers in Bitcoin‚Äôs corporate adoption.  

Trump‚Äôs interest in Bitcoin continues to make headlines. From proposing a national Bitcoin reserve to boosting domestic mining for job creation and energy security, his administration seems poised to embrace Bitcoin more than ever before. Could we see Day One executive orders making Bitcoin a national priority? The crypto space waits eagerly for further developments.

find high probability trades targeting the NY session's midnight open | ICT opening retracement,technicalanalysis,1i4dphv,2025-01-18 13:19:27,3,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalanalysis/comments/1i4dphv/find_high_probability_trades_targeting_the_ny/,GetEdgeful,,"# what is the ict midnight open retracement?

the ict midnight open retracement is a strategy based on the idea that price tends to retrace back to the midnight open (the open of the 12:00am ET candle) at some point during the New York trading session (9:30 am to 4:00pm ET).

the theory, popularized by ICT (inner circle trader), suggests that if price opens above the midnight open, it's likely to retrace down to that level. conversely, if price opens below the midnight open, it's likely to retrace up to it.

here are some visuals:what is the ict midnight open retracement?

https://preview.redd.it/4rr9rrvzlsde1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8643c62fbc650061e87f083e0dcb64bbad1b373

let's get right into some stats that may have you rethinking how you trade this setup...

using edgeful's ict opening retracement report

to help you understand and apply this concept, we've created the ICT opening retracement report. here's what it tells you:

* how often price retraces to the midnight open during the NY session
* breakdown of retracement frequency when price opens above vs. below the midnight open
* retracement probabilities by weekday to identify day-specific patterns

let's take a look at the data for some popular markets:

ES:

https://preview.redd.it/et8ylvy6msde1.png?width=2184&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7083948fc72b5ee33e58daca0db76c51f95680d

  
you can access the report pictured above by clicking [here](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01JHWYEZD8CK78EFBXBS7ECB5R_3).

* over the past 6-months, when price opens above the midnight open, it retraces back 58% of the time (and 42% of the time, it doesn‚Äôt retrace)
* over the past 6-months, when price opens below the midnight open, it retraces up 69% of the time (and 31% of the time, it doesn‚Äôt retrace)

this is useful information for you to use ‚Äî¬†at any point you see ES is set to open below the midnight open, you can be looking for long trades with targets to the midnight open price (knowing that it retraces upwards nearly 70% of the time).

then, when we filter the report by weekday, you can see Thursday is the strongest day to trade a NY open below the midnight open, with targets at that level:

https://preview.redd.it/i526f51dmsde1.png?width=2140&format=png&auto=webp&s=7315086f4ab7557f730f049f2487e408123955d4

this is exactly why we've included this data for you to use ‚Äî build an edge with a setup, and then make it that much more profitable by filtering other factors like weekday... ü¶Ö 

NQ:

https://preview.redd.it/gu4a49kimsde1.png?width=2212&format=png&auto=webp&s=da7cedc08eafaf4c657a5f845944d02911ae6f32

you can access the report pictured above by clicking [here](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01JHWYEZD8CK78EFBXBS7ECB5R_4).

* over the past 6-months, when price opens above the midnight open, it retraces back 57% of the time (and 43% of the time, it doesn‚Äôt retrace)
* over the past 6-months, when price opens below the midnight open, it retraces up 63% of the time (and 37% of the time, it doesn‚Äôt retrace)

compare these stats with what we just saw with ES and ask yourself why you'd want to trade this setup on NQ over ES?

our reports are set to show you what tickers/instruments to trade, while also showing you which ones NOT to trade. i've also filtered by weekday on NQ, and the only day that's worth your time trading this setup is Tuesday:

https://preview.redd.it/hkga8gsomsde1.png?width=2226&format=png&auto=webp&s=edbefecc92f48cebc9b30526c916878dddeb8753

* over the past 6-months, when price opens above the midnight open, it retraces back 69% of the time (and 31% of the time, it doesn‚Äôt retrace)
* over the past 6-months, when price opens below the midnight open, it retraces up 73% of the time (and 27% of the time, it doesn‚Äôt retrace)

let's check out GC now:

https://preview.redd.it/662s96vsmsde1.png?width=2262&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d3f47f15432e75464041098579fdf7e854ec2c8

you can access the report pictured above by clicking [here](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01JHWYEZD8CK78EFBXBS7ECB5R_5).

* over the past 6-months, when price opens above the midnight open, it retraces back 47% of the time (and 53% of the time, it doesn‚Äôt retrace)
* over the past 6-months, when price opens below the midnight open, it retraces up 50% of the time (and 50% of the time, it doesn‚Äôt retrace)

clearly not a big edge here either way ‚Äî so if you‚Äôre a gold trader, it‚Äôs best you don‚Äôt use the ICT opening retracement as a setup if you're solely looking at the standard report.

if you are set on trading GC, it's best you use our ""by size"" report variant, and only trade gaps from the midnight open to the opening range within 0.1-0.19%:

https://preview.redd.it/patddzdwmsde1.png?width=2334&format=png&auto=webp&s=4391d3e61c56072936d6aead1061193a20327147

even with these stats, you're better off only trading this setup on GC when price opens below the midnight open...

BTCUSD:

https://preview.redd.it/3h39nlc1nsde1.png?width=2244&format=png&auto=webp&s=b49e468fdbcd9bee88c57b13556aea60195bc962

you can access the report pictured above by clicking [here](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01JHWYEZD8CK78EFBXBS7ECB5R_6).

* over the past 6-months, when price opens above the midnight open, it retraces back 63% of the time (and 37% of the time, it doesn‚Äôt retrace)
* over the past 6-months, when price opens below the midnight open, it retraces up 64% of the time (and 36% of the time, it doesn‚Äôt retrace)

much higher probabilities here that price retraces on an open above or below the midnight open. bitcoin would be a strong instrument to look to apply the ICT opening retracement report with, targeting each area as a take profit depending on an open above or below.

ETHUSD:

https://preview.redd.it/jftd5tw5nsde1.png?width=2272&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab37d784ac87c986a7d619960688f7b532bd1852

you can access the report pictured above by clicking [here](https://ctrk.klclick.com/l/01JHWYEZD8CK78EFBXBS7ECB5R_7).

* over the past 6-months, when price opens above the midnight open, it retraces back 62% of the time (and 38% of the time, it doesn‚Äôt retrace)
* over the past 6-months, when price opens below the midnight open, it retraces up 48% of the time (and 52% of the time, it doesn‚Äôt retrace)

how would you interpret the stats here for ETH? should be simple for you when comparing to other tickers on the same report: ETH does not represent the best instrument to trade the ICT opening retracement report.

if you‚Äôve been losing money trading ETH & using the ICT opening retracement setup, here‚Äôs your sign to switch tickers (BTC is a great one based on the stats above).

yet another clear example as to how edgeful can be an invaluable analytical tool for your trading.

building your ict opening retracement trading planso, how can you start using this data to find high-probability trades? here's a simple framework:

1. identify the midnight open level for your market
2. determine if price is opening above or below that level
3. if price opens above, watch for short setups with the midnight open as your target
4. if price opens below, watch for long setups with the midnight open as your target
5. use the weekday data to further refine your bias and target selection OR check the ‚Äúby size‚Äù report variant

and to be clear:

when trading the ICT opening retracement report, look for probabilities > 60%. filter by weekday and by size to ensure those probabilities are even higher (near 70% or even 80%, as we saw above).¬†  
  
avoid anything near 50%,

# some real world examples:

in all of the examples below, this is what you‚Äôre going to see (thanks to our TradingView indicators):

* midnight open is plotted automatically as blue horizontal line
* the New York session is outlined in a blue box

and then I‚Äôve gone ahead and marked clear arrows on the chart where you should be focusing your attention. here we go:ES example from 1/13/2025:

https://preview.redd.it/elo7ytwdnsde1.png?width=2381&format=png&auto=webp&s=55be8cdb06007ab48a0fec47b9558263ef800620

* as we know with ES, on an open below the midnight open, ES retraces back upwards 69% of the time. in the example above, this is exactly what we see (and price actually goes on to trade much higher by the end of the session)

entering the trade is dependent on which system you trade, but a clear level to take profits would have been this midnight open area.

BTC example from 1/12/2024:

https://preview.redd.it/xnuumdyinsde1.png?width=2381&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d5a6b3bdbc6543464cfeae9d36320abcb9fff00

* as we know with BTCUSD, on an open above the midnight open, BTC retraces back downwards 63% of the time. in the example above, this is exactly what happened, with a clear short on a trendline break with targets at the midnight open working perfectly.

ETH example from 11/29/2024:

https://preview.redd.it/jdn2nhpnnsde1.png?width=2870&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6254b20f8b3d61a46bd4a6fb87e47662485eb50

* as we know with ETHUSD, on an open above the midnight open, ETH retraces back downwards 62% of the time.
* but if you filter by weekday, you'll see that Friday's (the day this trade takes place), has an 80% chance of retracement on an open above

we‚Äôre not going for home runs in these examples, but it should be clear how simple technical setups work well when you have a plan in place (your stop loss and take profit orders, specifically).

as you can see, when applied to certain tickers, the ICT midnight retrace can be a profitable strategy for you. the key is knowing which tickers and instruments are worth trading vs. which ones aren‚Äôt (easily done with edgeful).

we covered a lot today, so let's recap the key points:

* the ICT opening retracement report measures how often price retraces to the midnight open during the NY session
* you can use this data to find high-probability trades by targeting the midnight open level when price opens above or below it
* combining the ict concept with other technical analysis can help you build a more in-depth trading plan
* shoot for probabilities higher than 60% on this report, specifically by filtering by weekday or by size

Berachain Hasn't Launched Yet But Has Already Attracted $1.7 Billion‚ÄîHere's Why,bitfate,1i45z7w,2025-01-18 06:52:10,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitfate/comments/1i45z7w/berachain_hasnt_launched_yet_but_has_already/,MammothBattle33,,"üö®Just IN: Berachain Attracts $1.7 Billion in Pre-Launch Liquidity

In a staggering display of investor enthusiasm, Berachain, the highly anticipated layer-1 blockchain, has managed to amass an impressive $1.7 billion in pre-launch liquidity deposits. Despite not having launched its mainnet yet, Berachain's pre-launch deposit vaults have become a magnet for crypto investors eager to secure early rewards.

The pre-launch program, which includes collaboration with various protocols such as StakeStone, Lombard Finance, and ether.fi, allows users to deposit assets like Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to gain early access to the Berachain ecosystem. This initiative has attracted over 130,000 active wallets, with deposits split across 12 different protocols.

The strategy behind this pre-launch frenzy is to solve the notorious ""cold start problem"" that many new blockchains face. By bootstrapping liquidity early, Berachain aims to ensure that its decentralized applications (dApps) have the necessary depth and functionality from day one, preventing users from losing interest due to lack of liquidity.

Berachain's Boyco platform, described as a pre-launch liquidity hub, is set to play a crucial role in this process. Boyco will seamlessly integrate the liquidity aggregated from the pre-launch vaults, creating a robust ecosystem where dApps and users can negotiate directly with liquidity providers for incentives.

The rewards for participating in these pre-launch vaults are substantial, with users receiving stacked rewards from multiple projects within the Berachain ecosystem, such as Lombard, Babylon, Concrete, Kodiak, and Dolomite. For instance, StakeStone vaults hold over $450 million, while ether.fi has attracted nearly $480 million.

This early liquidity surge has propelled Berachain to the 10th largest blockchain by Total Value Locked (TVL), surpassing notable blockchains like Avalanche and Aptos. With its innovative proof-of-liquidity consensus mechanism and recent $100 million funding, Berachain is positioning itself for a significant impact in the crypto space.

As the mainnet launch approaches, just weeks after the Boyco launch, the excitement and anticipation around Berachain continue to grow. It's clear that this blockchain is not just another player in the crypto world but a potential game-changer.

Coinbase Restarts Bitcoin-Backed Loans via Ethereum Network Base,bitfate,1i44ar6,2025-01-18 04:52:07,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitfate/comments/1i44ar6/coinbase_restarts_bitcoinbacked_loans_via/,MammothBattle33,,"üö®Just IN: Coinbase Now Offers Bitcoin-Based Loans Through Morpho on Base Network

In a significant move that highlights the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency lending, Coinbase has partnered with Morpho, a decentralized lending protocol, to introduce bitcoin-backed loans. This new offering allows Coinbase users to borrow USDC by using their bitcoin as collateral, all facilitated through Morpho on the Base network, an Ethereum layer-2 solution.

This collaboration marks a notable step in bringing Coinbase's services further into the on-chain lending space. Morpho's protocol, known for its robust and audited smart contracts, ensures a secure and trustless environment for lenders and borrowers. The protocol operates on a permissionless market creation model, allowing users to create isolated markets with predefined parameters such as Liquidation Loan-To-Value (LLTV) and interest rate models, which are immutable once set.

The demand for such products is evident, with Coinbase's VP of Product, Max Branzburg, noting a strong appetite for bitcoin margin loans. This move follows Coinbase's earlier initiatives, such as its wrapped bitcoin product, which enabled users to utilize their bitcoin exposure on the Base network.

While this initial offering is focused on bitcoin, there is potential for future integrations with other assets and projects. As more developers build on the Base network, Coinbase is poised to expand its on-chain lending services, further integrating its user base with the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

Coinbase has teamed up with decentralized money market Morpho to offer on-chain loans backed by $BTC, officially launched on Jan. 16. This innovative service will allow users to borrow $USDC by pledging their Bitcoin as collateral, effortlessly processed through the layer-2 Base blockchain.  

Here‚Äôs how it works: the pledged BTC is automatically converted to cbBTC (Coinbase Wrapped Bitcoin) on a 1:1 ratio and transferred to Morpho. Borrowers can access up to $100,000 in $USDC, with interest rates dynamically determined by Morpho‚Äôs market mechanisms.  

This service offers flexibility with no fixed repayment schedule, but borrowers must watch their loan-to-value ratio to steer clear of liquidations if $BTC‚Äôs value dips. On-chain loans are being touted as a tax-friendly alternative for unlocking liquidity without triggering capital gain events‚Äîa game-changer for crypto-savvy investors.  

Morpho has become a rising star in decentralized finance (DeFi), now ranked as the 12th-largest dApp, with total value locked exceeding $3.2 billion in an astonishing 444% growth year-over-year.  

Coinbase‚Äôs move underscores the growing impact of DeFi tools in shaping the future of finance. Moreover, users can convert their borrowed $USDC to fiat dollars at no extra cost, making this a practical option for immediate liquidity needs.  

This development follows Coinbase‚Äôs September cbBTC launch, which enabled seamless movement of Bitcoin to the on-chain ecosystem. As of now, cbBTC‚Äôs supply has surpassed $2.1 billion, while rival Wrapped Bitcoin ($WBTC) has seen a 13.4% supply decline over the same period.  

Big moves, bold ideas‚ÄîCoinbase is proving DeFi and crypto-backed loans are critical steps in merging traditional finance with blockchain tech.

Switzerland's state-owned financial giant PostFinance AG is taking its blockchain game to the next level! The bank has rolled out its Ethereum ($ETH) staking service, allowing users not only to earn rewards but also contribute to bolstering the security of the blockchain network. Customers can get started with as little as 0.1 $ETH, though there's a 12-week lock-up period before they can cash in on the rewards.

The move is yet another step in PostFinance‚Äôs mission to embrace the digital asset revolution. And they‚Äôre not stopping here! The bank has hinted at expanding its staking services to include other cryptocurrencies in the future, although the timeline and specifics remain under wraps.

PostFinance first entered the crypto market back in April 2023 through a partnership with Sygnum Bank. Fast forward to early 2024, the bank expanded its offerings to include trading for 11 cryptocurrencies and even set up crypto savings plans for its 2.5 million customers.

Switzerland continues to solidify its position as a trailblazer in the blockchain ecosystem. From proposals to integrate $BTC into its national reserves to explorations of using Bitcoin mining for energy stabilization, the country is making big waves in digital innovation. PostFinance's latest effort amplifies Switzerland‚Äôs ambition to remain a global leader in this rapidly evolving crypto landscape.

XRP Lawsuit News: Expert Reveals Why SEC Won‚Äôt Miss January 15 Deadline and Risk Dismissal,draqai,1i0y0ac,2025-01-13 23:27:23,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/draqai/comments/1i0y0ac/xrp_lawsuit_news_expert_reveals_why_sec_wont_miss/,MammothBattle33,,"üöÄ XRP Drama Unfolds: SEC Racing Against January 15 Deadline üòè  

Looks like things are heating up in the Ripple v. SEC saga, and this Wednesday could make or break the SEC's case. With the January 15 appeal deadline creeping close, everyone's watching SEC Chair Gary Gensler as his tenure wraps up on January 20. Will the SEC secure a last-minute win, or fumble the ball on this high-stakes crypto case?  

ICYMI, Judge Torres previously ruled that XRP itself isn‚Äôt a security, but sales contracts might say otherwise. If the SEC misses this deadline, it could spell potential dismissal, leaving Ripple and $XRP stans to celebrate like it‚Äôs 2025. üçæ  

Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel gave us some insight into how tight legal deadlines work (looks like they rarely miss them). But here‚Äôs the plot twist: even if the SEC files the appeal, it might take up to a year for any decision‚Äîunless a new, more crypto-chill administration decides to step in and shake things up.  

This isn‚Äôt just any legal drama‚Äîit‚Äôs laying the foundation for whether crypto-friendly vibes will continue to glow up in Washington. So stay tuned, babes. Whether you're riding with $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, or sliding into $DOGE and $SHIB, the Ripple decision could ripple right through the entire market.  

Is the SEC about to fumble the bag, or will they come in clutch? Either way, this case is giving the ultimate chaotic energy we love. üî•
