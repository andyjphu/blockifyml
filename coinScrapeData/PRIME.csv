Tips for natural looks on fair skin,PaleMUA,1i9xjy3,2025-01-25 16:28:50,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PaleMUA/comments/1i9xjy3/tips_for_natural_looks_on_fair_skin/,tiny_al,Discussions,"I'm very fair with cool undertones + I'm a tinkerer who loves makeup, so here are my tips from years of trial and error:

Three revelations upped my natural makeup skills a LOT. 

1. Undertones  
   1. Discovering my undertone made choosing natural-looking shades suddenly much easier. It's also a language that beauty retail employees speak, so they can help you better. 
   2. For example, bronzers and contour always looked so orange on me until I realized that I needed very cool shades. Cool pink blush makes me look naturally alive and awake, whereas anything too warm just looks like heavy makeup.
2. Sheer, buildable formulas
   1. Formulas that are very pigmented and brushes that lay too much makeup on at one time make makeup look like paint on fair skin. 
   2. Find ""buildable"" formulas (or ""sheer"" for lips). 
3. Techniques (and tools) for sheer, subtle, natural makeup
   1. For liquid and cream formulas, apply it to the back of your hand. This is your palette. Now PRIME the brush with the makeup and apply subtly, building up if you need more.
   2. For powders, get a ""powder fan brush"" for a really subtle sheer application that you can build up if you want. 
   3. In general, dense bristles = dense application. Fewer/more spaced out bristles create a more subtle layer, meaning you have more control over building it up. 
   4. Katie Jane Hughes is a celebrity makeup artist with super educational technique videos! Follow her on IG/tiktok/whatever - I've learned so much from her. 

Holy grail no-makeup-makeup products for fair cool skin:

* **Foundation**
      * Liquid 
   * **MAKE UP FOR EVER HD Skin Hydra Glow Hydrating Foundation** in the shade **1R02 or 1R12** (comes in mini). My holy grail. I'll never use anything else for everyday natural looks. 
      * I blend 1/2 a pump with my SPF to create an undetectable sheer coverage base. On me, it needs to be matted out with a powder in the T-zone.
      * Powder: IMO cheap powders look cheap. I use **Hourglass Veil Translucent Setting Powder - Talc Free.** The full size is not cheap but it has lasted me years and years and years. Also, loose looks more subtle and natural than pressed. 
* **Contour**
      * Cream/stick
   * **Anastasia contour stick** in the shade **Fawn** \- best subtle contour for fair skin I've found! No orange tones. It's a stick/cream formula so you'll want a cream friendly brush to blend out
* **Bronzer**
      * Powder
   * **Hourglass ambient lighting bronzer** in the shade **Nude Bronze Light** \- my favorite powder bronzer for fair skin. I've had the full size for... 8 years? 10? It will last ages.
      * Liquid
   * **Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Contour Wand bronzer** \- it looks intense but its actually very sheer and blends out to be subtle if you don't apply too much.
* **Blush**
      * Liquid
   * **Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Liquid Blush** in the shade **Happy (cool pink)** \- get the mini for $15, a little goes a long way.
   * **Glossier cloud paint** in the shade **Puff** (cool pink) - $22 for years of blush. Years. A little goes a long way. Pro tip: poke the foil with a pin to only squeeze out the tiniest bit at a time and it will last you forever. 
   * Don't apply either of these with your fingers or directly to your cheeks. Seriously it will look so much more natural to apply to the back of your hand and apply with a brush.
* **Eyeliner**
   * **Urban Decay 24/7 Glide-On Waterproof Eyeliner Pencil** in the shade **Demolition (dark, dark brown)**
   * Can apply super quickly to your upper waterline and look more awake in 2 seconds
* **Lips if you want**
   * **Clinique almost lipstick** in the shade **black honey** is so good for cool toned skin. Sheer formula you can dab on (don't apply like chapstick). Super comfortable wear. 
      * Note: the sheerer the lip formula, the shorter the wear. It's just part of it. The nice thing is that you can reapply without a mirror.  "

Is it possible to be immune to the flu?,flu,1i9xg16,2025-01-25 16:23:52,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/flu/comments/1i9xg16/is_it_possible_to_be_immune_to_the_flu/,JimBrosBurrit0s,Question,"So my gf tested positive for the flu, after someone called her and told her she’s had it.

We’ve been together pretty much every other day, made out, cuddled, etc. So ive 100% had direct exposure

But this was a week ago. We since isolated from eachother but I never got sick. I’ve never had the flu before or atleast known so, or tested positive 

Is it possible I’m immune? I’m 23m so I’m sure I’ve been exposed to it at some point, with this being a prime example, however have never gotten sick or felt a single symptom "
The whole cryptocurrency market Will crash,Buttcoin,1i9xfpb,2025-01-25 16:23:27,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/1i9xfpb/the_whole_cryptocurrency_market_will_crash/,kappa47bang,,"Im studiyng cryptocurrency, the originale idea was cool. But now its just a speculative asset where only the founders are making real Money promising tò poor people to become Rich. The whole thing Is becoming too big, Much Bitcoin traders sees It like a religion. Countries are putting people Money on cryptocurrencys. People wrongly compare cryptos with Gold, cause they are both speculative assets but gold :
1- is Limitated
2- has other uses than making Money.
3- Is real and you can touch It.
In my opinion cryptos are more like penny-stocks and packets of sub-prime.
I dont know of everyone Is being fooled or i am wrong, but the only way cryptos are not going tò crush Is that they'll become the currency in an hypotetical metaverse or web 3.0. Even if the scenario of us living in a simulation of reality exchanging items wich are not real with Money wich are not real It seems a Little distopic in my opinion. Until this Moment, crypto are only good for buying drugs online. My prevision Is that the whole cryptomarket Will crash nearly before the  Trump's term ends.
Im trying tò figure It out how tò make Money from that, if you know how tell me, if i am wrong on something tell me. 
Thank you for Reading my ideas, Sorry for the broken English."

I'm trading any of the games listed below for some steam keys, any offers are welcome, I'm very open to anything you have to offer and hopefully we both find something we like! Fyi, I am in NA (US) so just keep in mind any region locks. From what I've read at least in terms of Humble Bundle it would be best to directly send the key itself instead of gifting so we'll just go with that. As stated below, all of my keys are from official sites, likewise, I would want official keys from official sites in return, NO KEYSHOP KEYS. If you're offering something from my wishlist, it still has to be a fair trade, so keep that in mind. If I don't respond, I'm probably busy or asleep, so just give me some time and I'll get back to you, thank you!

Valvetrain noise after Stage 2,Harley,1i9xchs,2025-01-25 16:19:33,1,1.0,1,https://v.redd.it/n94spzdgi7fe1,akoutdoors27,TROUBLESHOOTING,"TLDR: Trying to diagnose a noise that occurred after my Stage 2 build that wasn't there before. New lifters or torched pistons? 

2024 FXLRS

Parts list: MHP 485 cam, Fueling HP+ lifters, S&S adjustable pushrods, S&S tappet cuffs, SE oil pump and plate with new chain tensioner, new cam bearing, SE intake manifold and 5.5 g/sec injectors, SE air filter. All is tuned with a PV4 and a map from FuelMoto. NOTE: I did go from heavy breather to open ventilator style air filter so I know I'll have increased noise there but this is excessive. 

Installed everything following the Service manual and various video suggestions, crank had .004 runout and i had .007/.008 crank/cam gear difference. I made sure to use new gaskets and make sure i didnt crush the oil pickup o-ring. Initially pumped up lifters with an oil can adjusted pushrods to 4 full turns from zero lash with the lifters on the cam base circle with each cylinder at TDC compressions stroke. It did seem the lifters bled down fast cause I could turn my hand within 5 mins. I used HD360 Dino Oil and primed the oil system with two 20 sec starts without the spark plugs out, oil light went out both times. 

Noticed the noise right at startup after I got done enjoying my new harley sound. It does seem to increase with light reving, less that 2500 RPM. I could feel 3 of 4 pushrod covers moving a decent amount so I thought maybe I had some contact or adjusted the push rods wrong. 

Took out the lifters and pushrods and inspected everything. Didnt see any wear marks on the pushrods or pushrod tubes. Lifters looked great so I re-pumped them up with oil to push out any air and noticed one of the lifters sprung back out when i pumped it with oil. Is that indicative of a collapsed lifter?

After putting lifters back in and spacing the tappet covers with .002 feeler gauges, i re-installed and re-adjustedpushrods according to their spec with says 3.2 turns with 32 TPI push rods, putting in about .105 preload on the lifters. Waited 30 mins for each to bleed down and i noticed they were still tight, but if I spun them with a pair of pliers for about 10 seconds, they loosed up and i could spin them by hand. This happened on both cylinders pushrods. 

Hoping I fixed the problem, I started the bike again and still had the noise, maybe 5% less this time. I noticed I had no vibration on the pushrod tubes this time but still had the clicking/tapping. Using the screwdriver method, I can hear the ticking in the rear rocker box and no where else. I didn't hear anything down in the lifter covers or camchest area. 

So I tore the bike apart and took off the rocker covers to discover that everything looks fine as can be. Rocker shafts are tight to the head and are still at torque spec. Valve lash (with pushrods able to be spun by hand/valves closed) is less than .0015 as I cannot get a Feeler gauge in there. The only thing I noticed with the rockers is about .010"" clearance between the rocker arm and the mounting stud on the head. 

I'm at a loss at what to do. The bike sounds fine and has a very snappy throttle. I cant take it for a ride because I'm in Alaska so I'm stuck with idle testing. My next move is to buy the Fueling Gorilla rocker shaft/stud kit with spacer and to buy new lifting hoping that the ones I have are bad. 

Any suggestions are appreciated. "

haven't changed any water or added any chemicals in over a week. Do we think I'm out of the woods? I'm fine checking water daily for as long as it takes. Everything seems fine but the nitrates being so low makes me think it might be stalled if that's a thing.

"How do you know which details are part of the plot, and which ones are not?",SeveranceAppleTVPlus,1i9x4x6,2025-01-25 16:10:11,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1i9x4x6/how_do_you_know_which_details_are_part_of_the/,Agitated_Twist,Question,"This show is so well-written and the set design is so beautifully executed that sometimes it feels like there are half a dozen easter eggs in every episode, just hinting at what's coming next. I love unraveling the plot. I love decoding the symbolism. I love the work they've done to make this world feel just always slightly wrong.

But then, occasionally, something tiny will happen that makes me hesitate. I've started severely annoying my roommate by saying things like, ""Is that the actress, or the character that has that scar?"" or ""That lamp was on and now it's off, but nobody seemed to touch it. Do you think it's a listening device?"" 

In other shows, like Prime Suspect or Silo, I feel like they either zoom in or repeat the exposure in some way for things that are supposed to be there, and then I know what I'm supposed to let go. I like that Severence is more subtle - but the cast and crew aren't perfect. There are definitely still plot holes and continuity errors and the occasional odd choice in costuming. So, how do you know what's on purpose?"

So if you have been following some of my calls on Reddit you will have seen me mention a few VERY successful projects. In total I am approx 50x on average from my investments right now. 

My typical style of Reddit post is substance over hard shilling. I for one see people spamming Reddit with unoriginal ai content with a lot of botted responses and see it as a huge red flag. I don’t want to fall in to that stereotype. 

That leads me on to my next point. 

$PLATH. I’ve been calling it for a few weeks now but I genuinely believe in this project, I am part of the team so this may seem biased but here’s what’s happening behind the scenes. The artwork is all hand drawn by a friend of mine. The charity incentive regarding Platypus conservation and a whole bunch of other stuff I’ll bullet point below. 

- [ ] We’ve been made an offer from an extremely large KOL (we are discussing the pros and cons of this now before we sign a contract) but think big and then think bigger - I’m not even exaggerating. Elon Musk and Murad both follow him. 
- [ ] NFTs are primed and ready for dropping at 7m market cap. Enter the telegram for more info. 
- [ ] A team of 35 incredibly experienced and active whales from various reputable projects all backing $PLATH. 
- [ ] Adopting real life platypus at each market cap goal. Already adopted a huge amount.

I could go on but like always, I try and keep it short, simple and straight to the point. We really have something special going and I believe you will be a fool to miss out on this. I’ve been around crypto for quite a few years now and I haven’t seen a project with this much commitment from so many reputable legends and I certainly haven’t seen a chart look so healthy before. I would imagine short term 3-5x long term 100 - 1000x. This is speculation based on insider information and my own opinion. Dyor. 

We also have regular giveaways - one of the latest being a custom ps5 with PLATH artwork. 
Our tech dev has almost finished the final touches on the Reddit engagement bot so the most active users will be rewarded each week for shilling! 

Thanks for reading guys, I hope you enjoy the sporadic posts and things I talk about, but, as always please just join the telegram, look at the charts and make up your own mind. I seriously don’t think you’ll be disappointed. 

Much love everyone and thanks for reading.

All these ""lyrical"" guys we got coming from the towns now is doing generic dusty boom bap rap & it just don't sound good....not as bad as the drill raps but These dudes are Too Generic & boring for me to even care about em like that....& The boom bap beats SUCK Now....either doing wack ass 1995 type beats they found on YouTube or doing that boneless chicken wing beat shit that conductor and alchemist be doing nowadays for Griselda (who I feel is boring now but I still listen from time to time)....we the only region focused on going back to the past while the South and even the West are innovating with new sounds...

For example, one of my favorite albums of all time is ""We are the streets"" by the Lox (TODAY IS THE 25th ANNIVERSARY OF THAT CLASSIC BTW) & I still love how BANGING that album was and is production-wise as well as lyrically & that made me appreciate how innovative Swizz was in his prime during the Ruff Ryder Dayz! Made that pete rock, lord finesse sound sound like Childs Play....who are the lyrical spitters who has a creative mindset to pop out with a banging new sound like DMX/Swizz in 98???!!!

I love Niggas like Joey Bada$$, Dave East, Don Q, Griselda etc but they couldn't incorporate into they own unique sound.....Joey got stuck being a 90s Cosplay Rapper, East Ended up making bullshit trap music with a drugged out flow son is borderline trash to bump now & Q's fat ass got bodied by a singing nigga & in the end just ended up being a generic mixtape rapper (just like Dave) & That Boneless Chicken Griselda sound got Boring & stale REAL QUICK....don't get me wrong I still bump these Niggaz cuz they keep it NYC just like mad other underground rappers in NY but I just want a new TRENDSETTING Lyricist who can make bangers AND Spit...Truth be told most of the legends from the 90s didn't blow up off boom bap (50, Jigga, Camron, The Lox etc)"

I DIY replaced the battery on my ODT Chips.,snowboarding,1i9wxlv,2025-01-25 16:01:04,1,1.0,0,https://i.redd.it/v492ygf6f7fe1.jpeg,BD-TxState,Pic Link,"Hey fellow kids, I know the ODT chips are a beloved headphone in this sub but many of us have experienced the battery crapping out after a few years. Mine were constantly dropping Bluetooth, lasting only about and hour, and were very low on volume even at full volume. I was bummed thinking it would need a new pair. 

After some long conversations with ChatGPT I figured out this battery would be a good substitution as the OEM battery is pretty much impossible to find unless I ordered 10k from India. This battery is slightly smaller and a tiny bit thicker but I was able to put it back together without issue. Beyond that it should have all the same specs as the 2014 battery my V1.0 came with. So if you have the diy spirit and know how to solder, this was actually a very simple repair and I should have years more life back in my Chips.

Amazon ID,recruitinghell,1i9ws06,2025-01-25 15:54:27,0,0.5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1i9ws06/amazon_id/,Weekly-Sweet-6170,,"Around Christmastime my account password was hacked. It took me almost a month to log back in, and change the password. The reason it took me so long is because they would not send me log in OTPs. The numbers they send them from are not blocked, and my phone account is fine. They just clearly are not being sent. Yesterday I took a chance, and was able to change my password, and log in from my browser. Thinking the problem could have just been the app, I deleted and reinstalled. The same issue occurred. Sure I could purchase from my browser, but using the phone app is much more secure.

Edit: I can't chat after logging in to the  browser. It always says to first enter the OTP. I thought that maybe I could clear this up chatting with them. So I am highly suspecting that purchases  made through my browser would also require an OTP as well. BTW I am not against OTPs. They are very useful security tools. *If they are sent.*

You know, the OTP, they won't send me.
  
Anyway I have an extremely disabling speech impediment, and because I cannot log in to use chat, two weeks ago, I got help from a person who works for a disability organization. This may have raised some red flags with Amazon, because now they are requesting ID in order to let me in.  
  
Still honestly I’m not completely sure that this is the reason. You see I already have my welfare card on file. This allows me to get a reduction in the price of Prime, as well as be able to use my food stamps in order to purchase food from pantry. With my bank card, welfare card, and ID, the amount of possible fraud is immense. I read the fine print, for submitting you ID, and Amazon are allowed to share it with anybody. Sure technically  they say they don't share personal info, but the form that you send the ID with says they can share it.
  
Something very fishy is going on. I have belonged to Amazon for a decade. Still I have already cancelled Prime, and am strongly thinking about canceling Fire TV, and getting rid of my Audible and Kindle memberships as well."

Female characters having 'breathy', very feminine voices?",Beastars,1i9wo3f,2025-01-25 15:49:40,1,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beastars/comments/1i9wo3f/is_this_a_common_thing_in_anime_or_am_i_just/,Sorsha_OBrien,General Discussion,"I started watching Beastars a few weeks ago and LOVED it -- I don't watch a lot of anime and Beastars was completely different to what I'm used to. After hearing good things about Delicious in Dungeon, I also decided to watch it. I really like these shows so far, however, why do some of the female characters talk like that?! It's like so breathy/ very feminine/ damsel in distress like, whereas a lot of the male voice actors/ characters just seem to talk like normal people. 

For example, in Beastars, the wolf girl (the one who likes Legoshi) is a prime example. In Delicious in Dungeon, Laois' sister is another example, as is the girl they rescue in episode 2/ 3 when they're in the second floor of the dungeon. Ik not ALL female characters are like this but it's strange bc in other animated media I've seen, the female characters have their own distinct voices but don't have this like breathy/ feminine voice. Ik as well that Haru in Beastars DOESN'T sound like this, nor does the elf chick from Delicious in Dungeon, but in other media I've seen, NONE of the female voices are like this. Katara, Toph, Azula and Suki from Avatar the Last Airbender, for example. Ty Lee is probably the only one who sounds most feminine, but even she doesn't have this breathy way of speaking and just sounds like a more feminine girl. Female characters in Invincible don't have this breathiness, nor do others I've seen in other super hero media (DC or Marvel animated TV shows), nor ones like Star Wars Rebels or Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Blue Eye Samurai as well doesn't have this. 

Is this like a Japanese(?) thing? I've never seen it in American media/ other media, and I don't want to cry 'sexism' when this could be just a different cultural thing. Is there an explanation for this?"
Something Needs to Change,Helldivers,1i9wo30,2025-01-25 15:49:39,0,0.5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1i9wo30/something_needs_to_change/,johnny_whoa,FEEDBACK / SUGGESTION,"We either desperately need a way to organize better in-game (some people have suggested clan systems, but I don't think that will be sufficient), add 1 DSS per war front (so bot bashers, bug divers and squid smashers can all coordinate amongst themselves) or the required player percentage to take or defend worlds needs to drop. On 3 fronts, players are incredibly scattered around, and the blob keeps leaving planets half-finished.

I love this game, it's incredibly fun. But with us being unable to coordinate anything or make any progress anywhere, I'm losing interest. I like making progress in games, I like seeing that what I do has an impact. But right now it doesn't. Any every time it feels like it does, that slips away. Martale, Heeth, Cirrus, Vernen Wells, Aesir Pass, and now Erata Prime. It's been one colossal failure after another and no amount of effort from players who actually pay attention to strategy or how the galactic war works matters if the blob keeps jumping around like this. I don't even want to try on Garcrux anymore, because as soon as we get halfway through it I know everyone's going to leave when Fenrir gets hit in a couple of days.

I'm rapidly losing interest in playing, because as things stand, it's just becoming a point of frustration when we can't achieve anything. The only one of the worlds I just listed that we took back is Heeth, and that's because Joel handed it to us on a silver platter and said ""yeah the weather took out half of the enemies here.""

Something needs to change. I know the war is supposed to be unwinnable and perpetual in its current state, but it shouldn't feel so impossible to make even the smallest amount of progress. Give us the heavy enemy resistance as we push deep into enemy territory, but let us do SOMETHING at the 1-1.5% planets."

Help Me Choose: The Perfect PC Case for My New Build,buildapc,1i9wl2s,2025-01-25 15:46:02,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1i9wl2s/help_me_choose_the_perfect_pc_case_for_my_new/,Hot_Lake_6323,Build Help,"Hello,

I’m finally planning to build a new PC after several years, as my RTX 2070 and i7-9700K are starting to show their limits.

I’m considering a build with a Ryzen 7 X3D and an RTX 5070 Ti (or possibly a 5080). To kick off the project, I’d like to start by choosing the case, but I’m torn between these four models:

**Fractal Era 2**

* ITX form factor, which is very appealing to me.
* Beautiful design and convincing airflow tests, despite its small size.

**Asus Prime AP201**

* mATX form factor, larger than the Era but just as attractive.
* Excellent thermals according to reviews.

**Fractal North**

* ATX form factor, larger but still compact.
* Clean and elegant design, not overly “gamer.” Solid reputation.

**Lian Li DAN CASE A3**

* Compact ITX form factor, with an aesthetic similar to the Fractal North.
* Good airflow performance based on feedback.

I like ITX, mATX, and ATX formats equally, which makes the decision quite difficult since each has its own advantages. Do you have any advice to help me decide?

Thanks in advance!"

So if you have been following some of my calls on Reddit you will have seen me mention a few VERY successful projects. In total I am approx 50x on average from my investments right now. 

My typical style of Reddit post is substance over hard shilling. I for one see people spamming Reddit with unoriginal ai content with a lot of botted responses and see it as a huge red flag. I don’t want to fall in to that stereotype. 

That leads me on to my next point. 

$PLATH. I’ve been calling it for a few weeks now but I genuinely believe in this project, I am part of the team so this may seem biased but here’s what’s happening behind the scenes. The artwork is all hand drawn by a friend of mine. The charity incentive regarding Platypus conservation and a whole bunch of other stuff I’ll bullet point below. 

- [ ] We’ve been made an offer from an extremely large KOL (we are discussing the pros and cons of this now before we sign a contract) but think big and then think bigger - I’m not even exaggerating. Elon Musk and Murad both follow him. 
- [ ] NFTs are primed and ready for dropping at 7m market cap. Enter the telegram for more info. 
- [ ] A team of 35 incredibly experienced and active whales from various reputable projects all backing $PLATH. 
- [ ] Adopting real life platypus at each market cap goal. Already adopted a huge amount.

I could go on but like always, I try and keep it short, simple and straight to the point. We really have something special going and I believe you will be a fool to miss out on this. I’ve been around crypto for quite a few years now and I haven’t seen a project with this much commitment from so many reputable legends and I certainly haven’t seen a chart look so healthy before. I would imagine short term 3-5x long term 100 - 1000x. This is speculation based on insider information and my own opinion. Dyor. 

We also have regular giveaways - one of the latest being a custom ps5 with PLATH artwork. 
Our tech dev has almost finished the final touches on the Reddit engagement bot so the most active users will be rewarded each week for shilling! 

Thanks for reading guys, I hope you enjoy the sporadic posts and things I talk about, but, as always please just join the telegram, look at the charts and make up your own mind. I seriously don’t think you’ll be disappointed. 

Much love everyone and thanks for reading.

So if you have been following some of my calls on Reddit you will have seen me mention a few VERY successful projects. In total I am approx 50x on average from my investments right now. 

My typical style of Reddit post is substance over hard shilling. I for one see people spamming Reddit with unoriginal ai content with a lot of botted responses and see it as a huge red flag. I don’t want to fall in to that stereotype. 

That leads me on to my next point. 

$PLATH. I’ve been calling it for a few weeks now but I genuinely believe in this project, I am part of the team so this may seem biased but here’s what’s happening behind the scenes. The artwork is all hand drawn by a friend of mine. The charity incentive regarding Platypus conservation and a whole bunch of other stuff I’ll bullet point below. 

- [ ] We’ve been made an offer from an extremely large KOL (we are discussing the pros and cons of this now before we sign a contract) but think big and then think bigger - I’m not even exaggerating. Elon Musk and Murad both follow him. 
- [ ] NFTs are primed and ready for dropping at 7m market cap. Enter the telegram for more info. 
- [ ] A team of 35 incredibly experienced and active whales from various reputable projects all backing $PLATH. 
- [ ] Adopting real life platypus at each market cap goal. Already adopted a huge amount.

I could go on but like always, I try and keep it short, simple and straight to the point. We really have something special going and I believe you will be a fool to miss out on this. I’ve been around crypto for quite a few years now and I haven’t seen a project with this much commitment from so many reputable legends and I certainly haven’t seen a chart look so healthy before. I would imagine short term 3-5x long term 100 - 1000x. This is speculation based on insider information and my own opinion. Dyor. 

We also have regular giveaways - one of the latest being a custom ps5 with PLATH artwork. 
Our tech dev has almost finished the final touches on the Reddit engagement bot so the most active users will be rewarded each week for shilling! 

Thanks for reading guys, I hope you enjoy the sporadic posts and things I talk about, but, as always please just join the telegram, look at the charts and make up your own mind. I seriously don’t think you’ll be disappointed. 

Much love everyone and thanks for reading.

Introverts and Anxiety: Practical Strategies for Sustainable Wellbeing,selfhelp,1i9we0j,2025-01-25 15:37:18,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1i9we0j/introverts_and_anxiety_practical_strategies_for/,EERMA,,"Introverts. Those of us who prefer calm situations and environments. We may enjoy socialising but we recharge by spending time on our own, we often enjoying getting lost in our own thoughts – just enjoying being inside our own heads for a while. We tend to lean toward smaller, close-knit social lives. But let’s clear up a misconception: introversion doesn’t mean we’re anti-social. It just means we are at our best in situations that aren’t overwhelming.


Anxiety. The emotion that warns us when something threatening seems to be just around the corner. In moments of true danger, it can be life-saving: the foresight that there is trouble ahead, and those vital few seconds to get ready for it saved many of our ancient ancestors (while their peers perished – unable to pass on their genes.) That’s one of the factors why we’re here today. But, when anxiety lingers beyond its intended purpose, it becomes not just tiring—it’s exhausting. If this sounds familiar, you’re definitely not alone.

Not all introverts experience anxiety, and you don’t have to be an introvert to struggle with it. But many introverts do. It’s a common combination, and knowing how to navigate it can make all the difference.


Signs You’re an Introvert with Anxiety—which ones do you relate to the most?
1. You Typically Overprepare
You think through worst-case scenarios in detail. It makes you feel more in control—but it can also be draining.
Tip: When you find yourself imagining worst-case outcomes, think about a balanced ""most likely scenario"" scenario too. Give yourself permission to think about the ‘’best case scenario’’ – luck isn’t a good strategy, but take it when you get it! Thinking through these scenarios helps to bring your anxious thoughts back to a more realistic middle ground. This practice doesn’t stop your mind from thinking about risks but it does help add perspective.


2. You Tend to Overthink and Listen to Your Inner Critic
Introverts often have rich inner lives, which can mean their internal dialogue is active—sometimes too active. Anxiety amplifies this, often turning up the volume on self-critical thoughts.
Tip: Develop a ritual for challenging anxious thoughts. When a negative thought comes up, ask yourself: ""Is this thought 100% true?"" Most often, it won’t be. Questioning and even writing down these thoughts can give you some distance from them, reducing their power. If this is an issue for, look up my article ‘From Limitations to Liberation’ – it takes a dive in to tackling limiting beliefs. 


3. You Always Feel the Need to Be Busy
Anxiety often compels you to keep moving (it’s a high energy ‘state’ – one of the reasons it can be so tiring)—constantly doing something. But staying busy can sometimes just mean staying distracted, without actually being effective.
Tip: Replace ""busy"" with ""purposeful."" Each day, set just one or two specific goals that really matter to you. A small amount of focused effort is often more satisfying (and less stressful) than a day spent rushing from one task to the next with no real direction. Ask yourself at least five times a day: ‘what is the most value adding thing (in the context of what your life is about) I could be doing right now?’


4. You Prefer Routines and Struggle When Things Go Off-Plan
Routines give a sense of control, but sometimes they turn into rigid safety nets – sometimes beyond them being value adding. When something unexpected happens, it can trigger deep unease.
Tip: Practice gentle flexibility. Start small: maybe change the route you walk or try a new café. These small ""novelty exercises"" help build resilience for when larger, unexpected changes occur. The key is to show yourself that change, is often manageable. Remember that change is neither good or bad (change can also be for the better). Remember also that we have been ‘programmed’ by our evolution to perceive change as bad: once we transcend that ‘programming’ new avenues of opportunity open up for us.  


5. You Hide Nervousness Behind a Mask
You’ve learned to mask nervousness well, but that doesn’t mean it’s not taking a toll internally.
Tip: Identify trusted people who you can be honest with. Even if it’s just one close friend or a journal entry, letting out what you're feeling helps you process the anxiety instead of holding it all in. Vulnerability is powerful; it connects you to others and often takes the edge off anxiety.


6. You See More Danger Than Others in Everyday Situations
Anxiety primes your mind to be vigilant (and reduces your options – see my article ‘Live the life you choose – expand your Thought-Action Repertoire’), sometimes turning neutral situations into seemingly threatening ones.
Tip: Try reframing the ""threat."" If you’re anxious before a social event, instead of focusing on what could go wrong, set a small, achievable goal for the event—like having a meaningful conversation with one person. Reframing your focus can help your mind move away from perceived threats and toward positive intentions.


7. Perfectionism and People-Pleasing
Perfectionism often stems from a need to feel worthy. Beliefs like “I need everyone to like me to be valuable” create intense anxiety around how you’re perceived.
Tip: Shift from a focus on being liked to being authentic (are you living your life for you or for ‘them’?) Practice saying ""no"" in low-stakes situations. Remember, you’re not responsible for everyone else’s happiness: you are responsible for your well-being (not theirs!) The right people will appreciate your true self more than a perfected (according to who?) version of you.


8. Nerves Sometimes Turn You In to an Over-Talker
Normally, you speak only when you feel confident, but anxiety can shift you into overdrive, where you say too much to fill the silence.
Tip: If you catch yourself over-talking, pause and take a deep breath. Silence can feel awkward, but it’s not a problem. Giving yourself permission to pause helps reduce the pressure to fill every moment with words.


9. Trouble Sleeping
Anxiety makes it hard for your mind to shut off at night, leading to trouble falling asleep, frequent waking, or early rising.
Tip: Create a ""wind-down"" routine. Dedicate the last 30-60 minutes before bed to relaxing, tech-free activities. Reading something light, or writing down your thoughts can help signal your brain that it’s time to rest. Top tips (1) get as cold as you can (reductions in our core body temperatures are a cue to go to sleep) (2) forget the clock telling you it is ‘lights out’ time – read until your eyes close and your head nods.


Moving From Awareness to Action
Being an introvert with anxiety can feel overwhelming at times, but it’s also something you can learn to manage with care and practice. Anxiety may not disappear overnight, but you can make shifts that help it lose its hold on your everyday life. You’re not alone. Many of us walk this path, learning how to balance the gifts and challenges of introversion and anxiety. Keep being gentle with yourself—there’s strength in softness.


Practical Strategies for Thriving as an Introvert

1.	Create and Protect Your Recharge Time
For us introverts, alone time is essential for recharging. Make it non-negotiable. Whether it’s 30 minutes in the morning or a quiet evening ritual, schedule time just for yourself. Communicate this need with those around you—it’s a matter of maintaining your well-being, not just a preference.


2.	Leverage Your Strengths in One-on-One or Small Group Interactions
We tend to excel in deeper, more intimate conversations. Rather than pushing yourself to thrive in large social gatherings, seek out or create opportunities for one-on-one or small group interactions. You could host a dinner with close friends, or meet up individually for coffee. Cultivate the type of social life that aligns with your strengths.


3.	Prepare and Plan for Social Situations
One of the best tools for introverts is preparation. If you have a social event or a work meeting coming up, prepare conversation topics, questions, or think about what you hope to get from the interaction. This doesn’t mean scripting everything, but it does mean having some mental prompts to feel more comfortable and confident. You don’t even have to say much: a few thoughtful questions can go a long way.


4.	Create a Space at Home that Grounds You
Set up a specific space in your home where you feel completely relaxed—this could be a reading nook, a meditation corner, or even just a comfy chair by a window. Use this space to do whatever helps you feel grounded, such as journaling, reading, or simply sitting in silence. Having a dedicated spot to return to helps to re-centre yourself, especially after having been with people.


5.	Harness Your Listening Superpower
Introverts are often strong listeners, and this can be a powerful skill in both social and work settings. Make it a habit to ask thoughtful questions and really listen—this not only helps you navigate social settings more comfortably, but also makes people value your presence. Remember, quality over quantity is where you shine.


So, ask yourself: What is one thing from this article that resonates most with you? What small action can you take today to start navigating your life in a healthier way?
And what are your own go to strategies?"

[EVENT] Football and Syria.,ColdWarPowers,1i9w8bf,2025-01-25 15:30:13,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/1i9w8bf/event_football_and_syria/,Penulpipo,EVENT,"As tensions between NATO and the Warsaw Pact flared up over Albania, the Ba'ath Party was considering the place of football within their nation-building program. Football in Syria had a complicated history. The sport was brought over by French settlers and practiced by the sons of the elite. While the Ba'ath Party didn't have strong feelings over sport, unless a clear political gain could be seen in the near future, Hafez began to change that trend. In 1973 Hafez published Decree 1080 or ""Decree to regulate, develop and promote cultural and physical activities in the Syrian Arab Republic"" nationalizing de facto all 12 football clubs in Syria through controlling their funding.

In most instances, this would have destroyed Syrian football. However, Hafez took special interest in developing the Syrian league to compete with the likes of Turkey, Israel or Greece. The reason why is not yet clear, some attribute it to an interest in gaining an edge over their more wealthy, developed neighbors in a symbolic manner, others attribute it to his exposure to the sport during his talks with the French government. Regardless, the changes quickly made an impression.

Al Jaish was renamed to ""Nadi Jamieat Dimashq"" or ""University of Damascus Club"" after the dean of the institution agreed, with a personal promise of Hafez Al Assad to move its facilities closer to the newly renamed Michel Aflaq Stadium, expand the number of faculties and the creation of student dormitories. Al Shorta, the smallest of the three clubs in Damascus was merged with NJD.

Continuing the trend of merging football clubs with universities, Al Ittihad was renamed to ""Nadi Jamieat Halab"" ot ""University of Aleppo Club"". The University of Aleppo, renowned for its architecture and engineering faculties, had fallen into hard times as many students preferred to go abroad and study in European schools. The University Council hoped to revert this trend by promoting the school through its football club, as well as an investment in the maintenance and expansion of its facilities. During the first few days of the announcement, the leadership of the club announced (edited)

that the Aleppo International Stadium would be renamed to Al Qifti Stadium, after a prominent Arab intellectual of the Arab Golden Age. 500 meters north, a similar situation was developing. Al Assad wanted to promote football as the Syrian national sport through investments, marketing and intense rivalry. Al Ittihad was the only club in the city, presenting a problem to his plans. A small party official pointed out during one of the endless meetings of the Ministry of Culture that a small amateur football club had already been using the sporting facilities of the university as leisure. Some days later, ""Nadi Halab Alriyadii"" or Aleppo Athletic Club was born. The city announcing the construction of a smaller stadium in the Az Zaahra District named Nicetas of Remesiana, after an early Christian poet of the city.

The trend of merging clubs and universities continued through the principal cities in the country. Homs became the home of ""Nadi Hims Alriyadiu"" or Homs Athletic Club and ""Nadi Al'Umawiiyn Likurat Alqadam"" or Umayyad F.C. In Latakia, ""Nadi Jamieat Tishrin"" (University of Tishrin Club) arrived at a similar agreement with the local university to represent them at the Syrian Premier League against ""Janub Allaadhiqia"" (Latakia South F.C). 

The Al Assad family was Alawite, specifically form the Latakian countryside. Hafez Al Assad took special interest in turning the city into a football powerhouse in Syria and the region. The fact that cities like Tartus, Latakia and Aleppo were more progressive than other zones in the country played a role too. While most still couldn't afford a ticket to visit Europe or Turkey, they had access to foreign media and sports, making them a prime market for the reformed Syrian Premier League.

Various clubs were born in the city through 1973: Golden Eagles F.C, Corniche Athletic Club, Al Shamali Athletic Club, Al Azhari Athletic Club and University of Manara Club all began their registration process. 

The chairman of the Syrian Football Federation, Abu Bakar Al Amman, spoke to the press in late June, announcing the creation of the Syrian Championship League as the country's second division of professional football and the Syrian Regional League as the semi-professional league of Syria. He encouraged more amateur associations to register and contact authorities to go through the creation process.

For example, my biggest expenditures are groceries, restaurants, Amazon, and other online shopping. I have a current four-card setup that is well suited to me: Citi Double Cash, Amex Blue Cash Preferred, Amex Blue Cash Everyday, and Chase Amazon Prime Visa.

However, based on my 2024 spending, I calculated that an Amex Gold, less the annual fee, would yield about another $350/year in rewards (not including the 100,000 point signup bonus). It's not a big number, but it's not nothing either. On the other hand, five credit cards seems like a lot and I don't need the extra line of credit.

A while back I was having the hardest time trying to get people to liberate Martale with 0% resistance and honestly, yall fumbled so bad the restless spirits of the Creek is truly rolling in their graves.

However! A chance to redeem your democracy-loving jackasses have presented itself on CIRRUS. With the liberation of Heeth, a Martale 2 galactic boogaloo scenario has formed once again on the galactic map. 

FOR THE LOVE OF LIBERTY, LIBERATE THE PLANET IN LIEU WITH THE MAJOR ORDER! 

I am not even gonna talk about how Cirrus was lost in the first place, but if you truly want to do something impactful for the war effort the 1000+ divers holding the siege right now would definitely appreciate more friendly faces on the piss planet. DIVE! DIVE NOW FOR SUPER EARTH! Take Cirrus, contain the Gloom, and spread managed democracy for the sake of our citizens and your children! (following C-01 permit approval)

However, I'm getting a lot of lag/stuttering, llow fps and high frame time at 1080p on low settings. My RX580 ran most of my games at low settings but I'm struggling with the new card. 

The spikes in frametime is huge and comparing the  tests that I have seen with this card on YouTube, mine is not performing well at all!

My setup:
AMD Ryzen 2600 3.4Ghz 6 core
EVGA 600w Psu
RX5600xt Thicc III pro 6GB VRAM
Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 16GB 3200mhz
Asus Prime B450-M
1TB SSD
1TB HDD

I used DDU to remove the old GPU drivers and did a fresh install of the new ones. I have updated the AMD software to the latest.

XMP has been enabled in the BIOS. SAM has been enabled. Windows power plan is maximum performance. SAM is disabled in BIOS

What could it be? I read somewhere it could be to do with Pcie 3/4 compatibility with the GPU card? Or is my cpu bottlenecking?

I am happy to post benchmarks/anything else to show you what my system is doing.

For those wondering what kind of an abomination it is, it's a EVGA FTW3 Hybrid 1080ti with an Arctic Accelero Xtreme IV slapped on it because the Hybrid's pump was awfully noisy.

Wir haben seit einiger Zeit einen Samsung QLED 4K Q60C. Leider funktioniert die Prime App regelmäßig nicht. Hat noch jemand dieses Problem und vielleicht eine Lösung parat? 
Die App startet entweder gar nicht (hängt sich beim Amazon Logo auf) oder sie startet aber die Inhalte laden nicht. Über den Fire TV Stick funktioniert es ganz normal."
Please don’t judge! I’ve been overwhelmed with the abundance of info out there and want to know if I can add fish yet,bettafish,1i9w16c,2025-01-25 15:21:18,1,1.0,2,https://i.redd.it/zfhgks0387fe1.jpeg,brandoesco,Introducing,"I set up a 5.5 gallon tank with a heater, filter, and 3 plants on Jan 12. I put in prime and just let it go. I tested it (strips, not ammonia) on Jan 18 and everything was normal except the water is a bit hard so I added an aqueon bacteria ball and 2 nerite snails. I have also been adding a smidgen of the nutrinsect fish food that came with the tank every day. The snails were very active at first, now they chill sometimes and move around sometimes. I want to add a beta- do I need to just do an ammonia test before hand? These are the two options available for me (pic attached)

When searching this sub I saw that some people ADD ammonia so now I’m even more confused. Please let me know if you have info I should know before moving forward with adding a fish. "
