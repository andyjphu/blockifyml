Utility Token Series: The Graph (GRT),u_Colorado-6,1hnd92b,2024-12-27 06:48:48,5,0.86,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Colorado-6/comments/1hnd92b/utility_token_series_the_graph_grt/,Colorado-6,,"**The Graph ($GRT)** is a decentralized protocol designed for indexing and querying data from blockchains, starting primarily with Ethereum but now extending to over 70 blockchain networks.

https://preview.redd.it/xwy4wj92qd9e1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3c12845e750a5fc3ffa9b4eef56b733d24152b7

Here are the key aspects of The Graph:

**Indexing Protocol:** It functions much like a search engine for blockchain data, allowing developers to build and publish open APIs called ""subgraphs"" that organize blockchain data in a manner that is easily accessible for querying. This is particularly useful for decentralized applications (dApps) that require quick and reliable access to on-chain data without the need to manage their own indexing infrastructure.

**Subgraphs:** These are essentially open APIs that can be created by anyone to query blockchain data. Subgraphs make it possible for dApps to retrieve data from blockchains efficiently, handling complex queries that traditional blockchain data fetching might struggle with due to issues like finality, chain reorganization, and query security.

**Participants and Roles:**

   * Indexers: These are node operators who stake GRT tokens to index blockchain data. They earn query fees and indexing rewards for providing these services.
   * Curators: They signal which subgraphs should be indexed by depositing GRT into a bonding curve, earning a share of query fees for the subgraphs they support.
   * Delegators: They stake GRT to Indexers, helping secure the network and earn a portion of the rewards without operating nodes themselves.
   * Consumers: These are the end-users, typically developers or projects, who query the subgraphs and pay query fees, which can either be covered by the application or passed onto users.

**GRT Token:** The Graph Token ($GRT) is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain used within the network for various purposes like staking, paying for query fees, and incentivizing participation. The token economics are designed to ensure the network's economic security and integrity of data querying.

**Use Cases:** The Graph supports a variety of dApps across different sectors like DeFi, NFTs, and more, by providing a scalable and decentralized data layer. Examples include applications like Uniswap, Synthetix, and Aave, where The Graph's infrastructure helps in extracting and processing data from smart contracts.

**Decentralization:** The network aims to provide a decentralized, censorship-resistant, and incorruptible data service, enhancing the reliability and performance of dApps by avoiding reliance on centralized data sources or middlemen.

**Multichain Support:** Beyond Ethereum, The Graph now supports many other blockchains like Avalanche, Solana, Base, Optimism, zkSync, and others, making it a versatile tool in the broader Web3 ecosystem.

Feeling Bullish on The Graph üöÄ,thegraph,1hnbgy1,2024-12-27 04:40:17,51,0.9,46,https://i.redd.it/y02x5d5a3d9e1.jpeg,shreader12345,,"Hey everyone,
Just wanted to share my stake in The Graph! (Check out the screenshot attached). I‚Äôm feeling very bullish on GRT this time around. The last time I invested in The Graph was back in 2021. I dropped about $800 into it and managed to make around $3,000‚Äîso you can imagine my confidence in the project.

This time, I‚Äôm investing 35 bucks a week sometimes twice a week since September & I‚Äôm optimistic about where things are headed, especially with the growing relevance of Web3 and decentralized data protocols. The Graph has proven itself as a foundational tool in this space, and I can‚Äôt wait to see how it evolves.

What about you all? How‚Äôs your position looking in GRT? Are you as bullish as I am, or taking a more cautious approach? Let‚Äôs discuss!

When The Graph???,Hedera,1hg3d3n,2024-12-17 00:07:46,11,0.92,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hedera/comments/1hg3d3n/when_the_graph/,JeffreyDollarz,Discussion,"I'm curious why The Graph doesn't have support for Hedera yet. They do support Fantom, amongst other bigger and smaller networks, so Hedera seems like a reasonable addition.

With Chainlink integration in place, it seems logical and reasonable to see The Graph add support at some point. The two compliment each other well and make for DeFi development easier in a sense.

Support would likely add value to DeFi development. Some of the biggest DeFi protocols rely on The Graph.

I'm not here trying to shill GRT. I'm just wondering why no integration? Lack of interest from developers? Or does Hedera not need such a service? I'm assuming the EVM side of Hedera would benefit at least.

Any developers want to chime in? Idksaf after all."

AI Crypto Projects by Revenue: How Does OriginTrail $TRAC Compare?,CryptoCurrencyTrading,1h4qm7d,2024-12-02 03:42:24,41,0.95,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyTrading/comments/1h4qm7d/ai_crypto_projects_by_revenue_how_does/,snakeo087,DISCUSSION,"I put together a table ranking some top AI-driven crypto projects by their revenue and market caps. It‚Äôs intriguing to see how OriginTrail ($TRAC) stands out with a strong revenue-to-market cap ratio compared to other projects:

|Project|Revenue (Last 12 Months)|Market Cap|Revenue/Market Cap %|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
||
|**NEAR**|$8M|$7.08B|\~0.11%|
|**OriginTrail (TRAC)**|$5.6M|$0.407B|\~1.38%|

|**AKT**|$1.05M|$0.98B|\~0.11%|
|**LPT**|$0.31M|$0.39B|\~0.08%|

# Key Observations:

1. **TRAC‚Äôs Undervaluation**: TRAC‚Äôs revenue-to-market cap ratio of \~1.38% is still far ahead of its peers. Despite a slightly higher market cap ($407M), it remains undervalued relative to its revenue compared to other projects.
2. **Real-World Usage**: TRAC powers OriginTrail‚Äôs Decentralized Knowledge Graph, which is already being adopted in supply chain, healthcare, and enterprise ecosystems. This makes it a utility-first project rather than one driven by speculation.
3. **Growth Potential**: With TRAC sitting at $407M in market cap, it has substantial upside. Scaling to market caps like RNDR or ICP (in the billions) would represent significant gains for holders, especially given its revenue metrics.

**Questions for Discussion**:

* Does TRAC‚Äôs revenue efficiency indicate its potential for larger adoption and market cap growth?
* Should market valuations better reflect actual revenue performance?
* What‚Äôs your take on TRAC compared to projects like RNDR or ICP in terms of innovation and utility?

Ich habe gerade einen Blick auf mein Portfolio geworfen und festgestellt, dass ich GRT (The Graph) dieses Jahr f√ºr 0,23 ‚Ç¨ gekauft habe ‚Äì ich hatte es v√∂llig vergessen, bis ich sah, dass es um 6 % gestiegen ist und jetzt bei 0,2447 ‚Ç¨ liegt. Ich habe 1.800 Aktien, also ist es etwa 440,46 ‚Ç¨ wert.

Jetzt frage ich mich, ob ich verkaufen und einen kleinen Gewinn sichern soll oder ob ich noch halte. Wenn es 0,50 ‚Ç¨ oder sogar 1,00 ‚Ç¨ erreicht, w√ºrde ich eine 2x-4x-Rendite sehen. Ich brauche das Geld nicht wirklich, es geht eher um das Potenzial. Der Markt war in letzter Zeit schwierig, aber mit dem n√§chsten Bullenmarkt, der m√∂glicherweise 2025 startet, k√∂nnte es mehr Upside geben.

Geht es hier jemandem √§hnlich? Haltet ihr oder verkauft ihr? Denkt ihr, GRT kann diese Ziele erreichen, oder ist es besser, den aktuellen Gewinn mitzunehmen? W√ºrde gerne eure Meinung h√∂ren!

I finally achieved to put my hands on a C96 w/ a good condition barrel (which is pretty tought) and i was wondering, I already know that 7,62x25 tt and 7,63 mauser are the same cartridge in term of shape. The dies can be used for both, and the bullet are strictly the same diameter. But do you think I can use my light loads of tokarev inside of my C96 ? 

Here are the GRT graph, the tokarev one is terrain confirmed and the 7,63 Mauser is theorical only :

Trouble finding funds,thegraph,1g6l7f1,2024-10-18 11:43:46,6,0.87,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/thegraph/comments/1g6l7f1/trouble_finding_funds/,up_and_atom,,"Hello, I bought a large amount of GRT about 3 years ago and have been delegating it since then. Today, I went to the explorer, connected my wallet, and it's completely unable to see any of my activity. I believe my indexer was called ""node hodler"", and I recall it doing very well for me. When I search for that indexer, I'm not able to find anything.

When I go to Etherscan and look up my transactions, I see the last one back in May of 2021 going to The Graph Proxy 2 for the correct amount, so I know I haven't withdrawn any of it. 

I'm hoping I'm just making an error somewhere, but has this happened to anyone else? Could my indexer have disappeared with my money? What should I do?"

### Emerging Trends in‚Äã the ‚ÄçCryptocurrency Market Amid Economic Optimism

Altcoins Surge in Response‚Äç to Positive U.S. Economic IndicatorsOn a recent Friday, the cryptocurrency ‚Äãmarket‚Å¢ saw significant gains, particularly among ‚Äãalternative cryptocurrencies, ‚Äåcommonly known as altcoins. This uptick was‚Å§ influenced by a combination of easing geopolitical tensions and an optimistic economic outlook from the United States.

Among these‚Äã altcoins, Bittensor‚Äôs tokens associated with its‚Äå artificial intelligence-focused protocol and Render‚Äôs‚Å¢ tokens both experienced notable increases.‚Äå Bittensor surged by 14%,‚Äã while Render recorded an 8% rise within ‚Äãa 24-hour period. This activity greatly contributed to the overall performance of ‚Å¢the CoinDesk Computing Index, which tracks AI-related tokens and emerged ‚Å¢as one of the top performers in this period.

### Investment ‚Å§Shifts ‚ÄåHighlight Confidence in Decentralized‚Å¢ Technologies

In response to these trends, Grayscale,‚Äç a leading asset management firm, made significant ‚Å£adjustments within its decentralized ‚ÄãAI-focused crypto fund. The‚Å£ firm ‚Äåincreased its stake in‚Äç TAO from 3% to an impressive 27%, while integrating The Graph (GRT) into its portfolio and phasing out Livepeer (LPT). These changes reflect a growing confidence in decentralized solutions driven by innovative technologies.

Bitcoin Maintains Steady Growth‚Äã Amid ‚Å§Broader Crypto RallyDuring this same time‚Å£ frame,‚Äç Bitcoin demonstrated solid ‚Å§growth during U.S trading hours with it ‚Äãclimbing to $62,300‚Äîa gain of ‚Äã2.2% for ‚Äåthe day‚Äîmirroring broader movements seen across ‚Äåvarious‚Äã crypto‚Å£ indexes such as‚Äå Coindesk‚Äôs own benchmark index that rose by 4.2%.

This upward trend was bolstered by data from September‚Äôs labor market report where job‚Å¢ additions far exceeded expectations at‚Å¢ over twice what analysts predicted at approximately 251k new jobs down from assumed figures around140k‚Å§ ‚Äì directly‚Äå influencing ‚Äçunemployment rates which notably‚Äã diminished to just ‚Å£above four percent staving off any looming anxieties surrounding potential recessions‚Äç provisos should‚Äôve arisen temporarily dissipating investor worries regarding imminent downturns lingering up until now especially prevalent considerations revolving‚Å¢ around fiscal policies upcoming expectedly tendered decisions pending finalized Fed determinations expected later November poised‚Äç towards lesser reductions amounting approximate quarters rather than larger fractional cuts previously much anticipated all‚Å£ aligning well confirmed hence ‚Äçprojections seeing ‚Å£S&P500 alongside Nasdaq ‚Å§concluding‚Äç trading sessions strongly upwards‚Å£ reflected through marginal ‚Å§yet significant daily inclines calculated ‚Å§near or about‚Äå one respective ‚Å§cumulative percentile rankings‚Å¢ respectively‚Å§ further supported‚Å§ composite bonds reflecting similar sentiments through pronounced basis strategical hikes other financial instruments suggesting strong future tendencies predicated upon current operational ‚Äåcircumstances inherently driven ‚Å§confident economic standing presently witnessed globally enduring markets ‚Å§target recoveries across diverse industrial sectors fundamentally‚Äå capital intensive areas mainly including‚Å§ newly-marketed leverage options prevailing‚Å¢ today potential towards‚Å§ rising trajectory upcoming stretches presumably observing‚Å§ relative stability timeline forecasted assured ‚Å§estimations calculated based precise diplomatically necessitated discourse procedural‚Å¢ enactments toward possible softer stabilization measures fostering enhanced conditions‚Å§ conducive fostering ‚Äçintended transitional phases‚Äå ideally ‚Å¢suited adapting reasonably foreseeable normalized ‚Å¢cyclical ‚Å¢trends‚Äã primary aspects‚Äç taken consideration effectively.

Expert Opinions‚Äå Reinforce Positive Outlook for Crypto AssetsLeading experts have voiced optimism regarding this positive shift within digital asset markets:

  - Markus Thielen remarked on initial tumultuous declines now largely receded believes prices will continue‚Å£ improving short-mid terms derivative market indicators ‚Å§equally suggesting waning concerns price depressions adverse ‚Å£scenarios previously considered plausible

I discovered the Graph project. Using GraphQL to query data is incredibly convenient. I customized a data schema specifically for SSV Token, focusing on transfer events and analyzing statistics about token holders. After modifying a few versions, I quickly obtained the data query service I needed, which is very convenient. Now, I can easily check the number of SSV Token holders in just one second‚Äîit's so cool!

  
It's now running quickly, and I find the design of GRT quite interesting as I'm learning. As my need for SSV data queries increases, I will continue to optimize this subgraph, and everyone is welcome to use it.

Analysis on The Graph (GRT): A Deep Dive into Blockchain Data Indexing  
  
Abstract  
  
The Graph (GRT) represents a pivotal innovation in the blockchain ecosystem, functioning as a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data from various blockchains, with a significant focus on Ethereum. This analysis explores The Graph's architecture, its role in enhancing data accessibility for decentralized applications (dApps), and its economic model driven by the GRT token. By examining real-time trends and historical data from X posts, alongside broader market sentiment, this study aims to provide insights into GRT's performance within the volatile cryptocurrency market. It delves into how The Graph's infrastructure supports developers in creating efficient, scalable dApps by simplifying the process of accessing blockchain data. Additionally, the analysis will cover trend following strategies applied to GRT, assessing its market resilience, and potential growth avenues based on technological developments and adoption rates. This comprehensive review not only evaluates The Graph's current standing but also speculates on its future trajectory in the ever-evolving blockchain landscape.

I have GRT delegating for 3 years now. I'm just wondering if I chose the right Indexer. 

As of now I'm delegating 13.3k GRT and I accumulate roughly 100 grt of delegation rewards per month. 

My Indexer is named ""stake squid"" and his parameters are 90.0% Query Fee cut and 14.82% Effective Reward Cut. 

Do these parameters seem ideal? Thank you. "

"The Graph (GRT) - A Good Buy for the Short-Midterm?

GRT has made some moves lower, just like the rest of the crypto market, and has now dipped into the bullish Orderblock from earlier this year.

In Addition to that, we can see multiple liquidity pools being taken and a nice rejection off of the last one in combination with the Orderblock.

Looking at the RSI Divergence and Moving Averages (9,21), we can clearly see a Divergence and a Cross of MAs. However, the 200 MA is still above the current price which could mean, a little slower price action or a small retracement and then a nice break above.¬†

There's also other strategies that suggest a long signal, but I'll try to keep this one short and clean :)

Besides that, Bitcoin is also is moving upwards, dragging the whole space with it, and since I'm long on Bitcoin too, I believe GRT to be an interesting ticker right now.¬†

I like taking profits along the way, but my top intermediate-term projection would be 0.50. What do you think?"

Why Has The Line Graph On My Profile Disappeared?,thegraph,1dfaqlz,2024-06-13 17:50:25,6,0.88,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/thegraph/comments/1dfaqlz/why_has_the_line_graph_on_my_profile_disappeared/,VinceColeman1,,"I have my GRT delegated for the last 3 years. I used to be able to go on my profile page on thegraph.com and see a line graph indicating when my unrealized rewards would be deposited. I liked to be able to see how often I'd get paid, and to see the overall trend. 

Now, it still displays Delegating Total, Original Delegation, and Unrealized Rewards but the line graph is no longer there. "
