"(Spoiler: 5.4) My favorite ""fan theory"". (Minor mentions of fights and lore from ARR, HW, StB and ShB)",ffxiv,1i980x8,2025-01-24 17:33:53,18,0.74,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1i980x8/spoiler_54_my_favorite_fan_theory_minor_mentions/,Semblance_Hunter,[Comedy],"I'm just putting this here since I have seen this addressed nowhere else. Then again, I consider this a bit of an obscure one, so, who knows. I do not claim the original idea as my own, I saw this discussed in the comment section of TBSkyen's YT short on the visual design of elder primal Bahamut throughout Final Fantasy's different iterations, I just came here to rant about it. 

 

The appearance of Bahamut, as we see it in 14, has always differed significantly from his brood-siblings and sire, as a matter of fact, it set itself apart from most key traits of dragon kind as a whole. Most higher dragons are all quadruped, have more slender and long bodies (neck, frame, tail), something I assume that is meant to be referring to the more Asian interpretation of, for example, the Japanese ""ryu"". The wings are more of a western addition. We can even see this with Midgardsormr's 'evolution', first his minion and later mount appearance being in line with most of the younger and adult dragons in the game respectively. During his >!bossfight in the Omega raid!<, we can see him at his prime as the noted ""strongest dragon of his time"", probably far older still than any of his first brood by the time we meet them, further down the path of his race's growth. And finally, at his oldest and largest, coiled around the shattered ruin of the Agrius in the Lake Silvertear, now more serpentine and certified long boy than ever. This leads me to theorize that the natural evolution of dragons, at least very large ones, is essentially a more snake like form. 

Bahamut is barely anything reminiscent of that. His skeletal frame is by far more upright, dare I say, more humanoid, his little T-Rex arms probably don't even enable him to scratch his nose, his neck is pretty much non-existent and his body is almost comically stout and sorta... idk, pressed together(?). 

Now, anyone who has ever played the game will obviously know that the Bahamut we see in game, has never been the original Bahamut, eldest of the first brood of the dragon king, but Bahamut the Dreadwyrm, the greatest ever primal to scar the realm Eorzea. And primals, false deities they may be, like all gods are still slaves to the imagination of their believers, embodying certain aspects of their ideology. Ifrit is the idol of a race of fire worshiping lizard people. Titan is literally a walking mountain, the very tall defender of a very diminutive people that exclusively live in caves. Garuda the goddess of a race of literally flightless birds. Rahmu is a sagely elder, his Santa sized beard almost a parody of a wise old man, pushed through the lens of tricksy beings like the Sylphs, and Leviathan is literally just a sea serpent.  Even in Stormblood, >!with the birth of the new Primal Shinriyu, even that thing is more in line with what on Etheirys would be the general idea of a dragon. Although it still resembles Bahamut in a way, likely as a result of some generational trauma left over from the Dreadwyrm’s rampage, Shinriyu is far more serpent like, his tail as long as the rest of his body. It is also (sometimes) quadruped, although looking at its weird chest spikes, I sincerely doubt it could walk on all fours even if it wanted to.!< 

Bahamut wasn’t summoned by mortal hands. He was never the subject of speculation or legend prior to his death at the hands of an Allagan invasion of the lands of Meracydia. He was hardly more than a king to his kin. He had a consort, he had children, they knew what he looked like. But again, a primal’s form is not a truth but an ideal. We see this in the case of Lady Shiva and arguably the >!Eden raids!< during Shadowbringers. Lady Shiva especially never really shared anything with her namesake. Though we never really get to know anything about her, I highly doubt she was fabled for wielding ice magics during a time before Ishgard got deep frosted. The primal Shiva is instead an aberration, an idea tainted by Ysayle and her followers through the image of the Lady Iceheart; a fairy tale queen of hollow beauty, a necessary evil reigning over a realm of nothing but ice and suffering. 

The Ascian’s came to Tiamat in her sorrow over her mate’s perishing, giving her the alleged means to revive Bahamut. The anchors, the fuel upon the pyre for his summoning were not faithful followers or zealots or anything of the sort, they were his children, crying out for their father to return. The focus a widow, yearning for the revival of her beloved. The image they had of him, warped through their own idealized and biased perception shaped the Dreadwyrm’s body into being. 

 

And that is exactly why this version of Bahamut has what I can only describe as the ultimate draconic dad bod, with big ol’ man tits and an absolute dumptruck of ass, the likes of which the original Bahamut likely never had outside the sauciest of Tiamat’s daydreams.  

Thank you for coming to my TED talk. "

Radagon Conspiracy parts 2 and 3,EldenRingLoreTalk,1i8n2o6,2025-01-23 23:16:07,3,0.67,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/EldenRingLoreTalk/comments/1i8n2o6/radagon_conspiracy_parts_2_and_3/,Whatever_8699,Lore Speculation,"Radagon Conspiracy: Part 2

Fallen Sons of God: Forbidden Knowledge

I’m exploring Radagon as a Luciferian typology represented in the Bible. Like Prometheus, he has knowledge belonging to the Gods that was forbidden for mankind’s use, and he brings that knowledge to mankind as a corrupting force. Corrupting force from the Christian perspective.  I use the KJV version and the site [Biblegateway.com](http://Biblegateway.com)

Radagon’s knowledge is represented by needlework and blacksmithing. Radagon also has an association with “mapping the stars” from the tribe of the Astrologers. He also led the Preceptors, for at least a period, who have knowledge of creating artificial life and arcane magic. What is the source of Radagon’s knowledge of needlework and blacksmithing? Why does Radagon desire the power to make artificial bodies and transfer souls into those bodies? Where do the roots of Radagon’s knowledge lead?

Biblically, the craft of metallurgy and practices of beautification/decoration of the human body, smithing and needlework, come from the Fallen Sons of God. These Fallen Sons of God, Fallen Stars, were seduced by the beauty of human women and came to mate with the women, creating a race of Giants, the Nephilim.

Radagon is associated with the Astrologers and Fire Giants. I especially adore the lore video by Youtuber, The Nameless Singer, who argues for in-game forensic evidence of the civilization of Rauh migrating from the Shadowlands along with the Fire Giants and that the Rauh civilization eventually came to be the mountaintop Astrologers.

Radagon is associated with the Fire Giants through the Giant’s Red Braid item.

*Hefty whip woven from the flame-red hair of a Fire Giant.*

*Every giant is red of hair,*  
*and Radagon was said to have despised his own red locks.*  
*Perhaps that was a curse of their kind.*

Radagon is of the “kind” of the Fire Giants and his kind is partly defined by their “curse.” I will now move on to the Fallen Angels in the Book of Enoch, the biblical flood story, and that the Fallen Angels were again cursed for corrupting the “Ideal forms” or “kinds” demarcated by the Lord from the onset of Creation.

Fallen Sons of God: Corruption of the Ideal Forms

Fallen Angels of God are shown within the Book of Enoch as being seduced by the beauty of human women. Their lust for women leads to them receiving a further curse from the Christian Lord and the Fallen Angels would in-turn curse the Christian Lord and commit to war.   

[https://ccel.org/c/charles/otpseudepig/enoch.htm](https://ccel.org/c/charles/otpseudepig/enoch.htm)

1 Book of Enoch 6:1-3

“And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those days were born unto them beautiful and comely daughters. And the angels, the children of the heaven, saw and lusted after them, and said to one another: 'Come, let us choose us wives from among the children of men and beget us children.” 

The Book of Enoch is considered a part of the apocryphal works and not biblical cannon. It is one of the most important books for common understandings of a supernatural Christian worldview. It is also the source of the term “the Watchers.” Like, in the Bloodborne Chalice Dungeons.

We can see the forbidden knowledge of the Watchers/Fallen Sons of God as a type of “wedding dowry,” and a way of integrating into the societies of mankind. For, the Fallen Sons of God were committing a great sin against the Christian Lord by corrupting His creations by having offspring with human women.

Specifically, the spirits of the Fallen Angels are locked away in some sort of “cosmic prison” and they possess the bodies of human men and sleep with human women. In a weird parallel, Serosh and Godfrey are a good comparison. Godfrey is able to pass on the power of “beasts” to his offspring, because Godfrey’s body houses the soul of the Lord of Beast, Serosh. Like how the Fallen Angels possess human men to pass on their power to children in the physical world, Serosh passes on his power of “beasts” to the children of Godfrey. Ah, religion is weird.   

The Fallen Sons of God where corrupting the human form that had been ordain by God. The “kind” of the Fallen Sons of God was not to mix with the “kind” of human women. The result of the unholy union was the birth of the Nephilim giants. Their giant stature a symbol of rebellion against God.

Given the gravity of their actions, the Watchers make a pact with each other to completely commit to their sin and the consequences. They would make a “curse” against God, who would surely “curse” the Fallen Angels and their offspring. We can look to the Book of Enoch 6:3-6

“And Semjaza, who was their leader, said unto them: 'I fear ye will not indeed agree to do this deed, and I alone shall have to pay the penalty of a great sin.' And they all answered him and said: 'Let us all swear an oath, and all bind ourselves by mutual imprecations not to abandon this plan but to do this thing.' Then sware they all together and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it. And they were in all two hundred”

Imprecation means “a spoken curse.” These Fallen Angels cursed the Lord and made a pact to stand together and be locked in war. The Lord would come to curse the actions of the Watchers.

This curse came in the form of a global flood to wipe out nearly all life on Earth, except for Noah and his Ark.

We can look at the Book of Genesis 6:4-7

**^(4)** There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.

**^(5)** And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.

**^(6)** And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.

**^(7)** And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.

The Tarnished Archaeologist channel has a video on a biblical lava flood in the Lands Between. This is an amazing video, of course, as Tarnished Archaeologist is the among the best for forensic analysis. The short of it, they deduce this claim of a lava flood from the rock sediment that is on the Divine Towers and bridges, along with the stone coffin ships along the Cerulean Coast.

If the Tarnished Archaeologist is correct and there was a lava flood, there would have been some pre-flood civilization or antediluvian civilization which was corrupted.

On the corruption, the Misbegotten creatures are a great visual representation of what many literalist Christians would think of the pre-flood corruption. The Misbegotten as these chimera creatures are the ultimate corruption of the human form and a “mockery” of the Word of God. Names and the Forms designed by the Lord before creation are sacred. That is why a chimera creature is a perfect symbol of rebellion to and rejection of the authority of the Lord. This chimera theory, or that there were chimeras on the Earth before the flood, does take some extrapolation using only the flood story in Genesis. We can look Genesis 6:12-13

“12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupted; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth

13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.”

We would be looking at “corruption of all flesh” as justification of the mixing of “forms.” There is also Noah and how animals are separated within his ark. Within the story structure, Noah and the world are contrasted by their treatment of animals. Other justifications, God allows Adam to name all creatures when in the Garden of Eden. Abel, the brother of Cain, is a shepherd who offered the first born of his flock to the Lord as religious offering/sacrifice. There is the theme of the proper care or shepherding of animals in the Bible.

Another example, In Matthew 12:11

11 And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?

Here Jesus is debating with the Pharisees over their rigid and legalistic interpretations of scripture. Jesus was traveling through grainfields on the sabbath and his followers where hungry, so they started to pluck heads of grain to eat. The act itself was not considered stealing, but that it was “work” on the sabbath was the issue. The theme of the proper treatment and care of animals as representing moral righteousness continues.     

Final examples, sin and the devil are represented as “lions” waiting to consume and rule over the sinner. In Genesis 4:7 “sin lieth at the door” and will consume Cain, if Cain does not live righteously and rule over sin. In Revelations we see a “Beast of the Sea” rise up from the seas. This Beast of the Sea represents a collection of political power which the antichrist will control before the final battle with a returning Jesus Christ. But, the Beast of the Sea is descried as a type of chimera creature that will participate in the final battle between Satan and Jesus.  

Revelation 13: 1-2

“1 And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.

2 And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.”

This has been my attempt to connect Elden Ring with the biblical story of Fallen Angels mating with women and producing giant offspring. The Fire Giants, corrupted animals/the Misbegotten, a global flood, and arks used to survive the flood are all prominent symbols within the Lands Between.

If the biblical story of Noah and the Flood is represented in Elden Ring, who is Noah?

 I will now move on to the patriarch of the Uhl civilization, whose statue is seen throughout the Lands Between, this figure is the best candidate as the builder of the arks which survived the lava floods.

Noah and the Imago Mundi

 I would guess that this age was corrupted by the patriarch of Uhl civilization, whose statue is seen throughout the Lands Between. This image of the Uhl patriarch statues, or a version of his image, is on the stone coffin ships along the Cerulean Coast. The attachment of his image to the stone coffin ships points to him being an important figure within the story of the global lava flood.   

I enjoy the Youtube Scum Mage Infa and his arguing for a pre-Erdtree epoch where there were two Great Trees, a Tree of Life and Death and a Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. These would correspond to a Sun and Moon Kingdom. If the dragons were representatives of the Sun/Life/Sky, they could survive a lava flood with flight and their floating city. If Metyr is a representative of the Moon/Death/Earth, she could survive from her manipulation of gravity and her use of blackholes as portals. The Uhl patriarch, architect, blacksmith, and scientist, would need the stone coffin ships for survival. But, the Uhl kingdom has a place within the Greater Will’s hierarchy and Order, it is just that they rebel. This can be seen with the Uhl patriarch having his “foot” on the symbol of the age before the Erdtree.  

One feature of the Uhl Statues is that the patriarch is standing over the historical artifact the “Imago Mundi.” The Imago Mundi is ancient Babylonian map of the world inscribed on clay in Mesopotamia around 2,900 years ago.

From the British Museum youtube channel, Curator’s Corner S9 Ep5 “The Babylonian Map of the World with Irving Finkel,” Dr. Finkel talks about the artifact and claims that a version of Noah’s Ark and the biblical flood is inscribed on the artifact. Or there is writing on the tablet that corresponds to parts of Noah’s story.  

For a biblical reference, it is interesting that the Imago Mundi is visually under the “heel” of the Uhl patriarch. In the Garden of Eden, after the original sin of the serpent tempting Eve, the serpent’s curse from God is that the serpent will forever be at enmity with women and will be under the “heel” of women or the lineage born from Eve, as it reads “shalt bruise his heel.”

Genesis 3:15

**^(15)** And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.

So, the Uhl patriarch with his “heel” or “tree roots” on an image of the prior age could be a reference to the Garden of Eden and the serpent’s curse. We also see the image of the “bull” associated with the Uhl patriarch.

In Exodus 32, when Moses has gone up to the top of Mount Sinai to receive the Ten Commandments from God, he was delayed in coming down from the mountain top. The people became worried and demanded that Aaron, part of the priest class, create them a God. Aaron makes them a golden bull to act as a God idol. The creation of this “golden calf” would indicate the chosen people of God reverting to worshiping the idols of Egypt. The Gods of Egypt would be the enemies of the Judeo-Christian God. The Babylonian god Marduk is also associated with Bulls.

Radagon in this scenario would either be the patriarch of Uhl empire, who has created artificial bodies for himself over the ages, or a distant blood-relation who has inherited the “will” of the patriarch to wage war on the Greater Will. If Radagon is the actual patriarch of the Uhl empire, he would most likely be a reincarnated spirit that Marika, as a Shaman, would have ritualistically summoned and “housed” within her own body. The spirit would later “graft” itself to Marika’s soul. Like, demonic possession, or to Plato, the helpful daemon spirit. I must finish Noah before going to the daemon spirit.    

If Noah is represented in Elden Ring, I would sum him up with Genesis 6:8

8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.

Except this Noah did not find Grace in the eyes of the Greater Will.

This is a story about Noah without grace or Radagon’s lack of Grace.

I will now move on to the resulting story of Noah’s three sons, the tower of Babel, and how there is power in the sons of Noah being united into one kingdom or one “body.”

Radagon Conspiracy: Part 3

Combining the Tribes of Noah’s Three Sons

Life in the Epoch Before the Flood

One interesting aspect of life in the biblical age before the flood, the first man, Adam, lived to be 930 years old.

Genesis 5:5

“And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died”

The age of Eve is not mentioned.

We see with the biblical patriarchs before the global flood, that they lived to be over 900 years old. A consequence of living to be so old is that from the death of Adam to the birth of Noah there was only a timespan of something like 130 to 200 years. Noah would have had almost firsthand access to the very first man, Adam. Noah himself lived to be 950 years old. Adam and Noah would have both spoken a common language and shared a direct cultural heritage.

Life in the Epoch After the Flood

In this period, people’s life spans become more limited. I believe about to 120 years, but there are examples of people living longer.

One interesting feature of life after the flood is the introduction of “burnt offerings,” or the burning of an animal as an offer to the Lord. Weirdly enough, burnt offerings maybe an inspiration for the skinning rituals of the Shamans, Celebrants, and GEQ. I will get into this in a different post. Right now, I want to mention that the first act of Noah after exiting the ark is making a burnt offering to the Lord. A burnt offering is skinning an animal and then burning the remains of the animal on a ritual alter. The remains are burnt until completely gone. At this point in time, there was no Jewish priest class. The Jewish priest class is established in the book of Exodus through Moses’ brother Aaron and the tribe of Levi. Once the Jewish priest class is established, the animal skins produced from the burnt offerings were kept by the priest class. They either divided the animal skins amongst themselves or sold them to benefit the temple. I didn’t realize before that the animal skins were kept by the priest…so, I see a connection with the GEQ. But, moving on to Noah’s sons. 

Noah’s Sons: Loss Of Language

Noah’s sons and their wives repopulate the Earth. One of the three sons, Ham, was cursed by Noah and is a continuation of the the Luciferian typology in the Bible. After the flood, Noah grew a vineyard, got drunk and passed out. Ham witnessed his father’s nakedness and went and “gossiped” to his brothers. His two brothers went and walked backwards, so as to not see their father’s nakedness, and they covered his nakedness with a blanket. From this, Noah cursed the generations of Ham to serve the generations of his brothers. 

Genesis 9:20-23

**^(20)** And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:

**^(21)** And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.

**^(22)** And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.

**^(23)** And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.

In these passages we see Noah also fallen into sin by metaphorically “eating” of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil, but in his case drinking wine. This introduction of sin into his family affects Ham, who is commits sin by gossiping about his father to his brothers. For example, the name of Noah’s son, Shem, who blessed by Noah, means “name” or “reputation” or “fame.” Jesus descends from the line of Shem. The cursed son Ham, it isn’t completely agreed upon, but his name is thought to mean “hot” or “warm.” And Japheth is thought to mean “enlarge” or “make wide.” Japheth’s blessing was that his decedents would spread out across the Earth. With biblical stories, a person’s name will tell you a lot about them.

From Ham’s line Nimrod was born. Nimrod means something like “rebellion.” An interesting aspect of Nimrod is that Nimrod is the first time in the Bible that a “kingdom” on earth is mentioned. Nimrod, as this hunter-king who commissioned the Tower of Babel, is the first mention of a Kingdom of men trying to overthrow God.

The Tower of Babel parallels [Enir-Ilium ]()and the Divine Gateway. Like in Elden Ring, the Tower of Babel was meant to reach the heavens and bring power to Nimrod and his kingdom, the power to be like the Gods. Let us look at Genesis 11:4,

**^(4)** And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

The wording “make us a name” is weird. There is a power in language.

This is the logic of Genesis 11:4, well, how I understand it. Nimrod’s lineage is curse by Noah and the Christian Lord. To build a tower, reach the Heavens, and make a new name, would be to change fate and uplift a curse made by God. It would make the lineage of Ham rule over the lineages of Shem and Japheth and invert the Word and Authority of God.

The Christian Lord had to come down and stop the constructing by confusing their language and scattering the kingdom of Nimrod across the lands. The Christian Lord confused the common language and cultural heritage that had stretched back to the first man, Adam.

Genesis 11:6-9

6 And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.

7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.

8 So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they let off to build the city.

9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the Lord did there confounded the language of all the earth: and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.  

This part specifically, that God had to confuse and scatter the tribes of the three sons of Noah, I wonder if this is reflected in Elden Ring.

 A consequence of the Lord confusing their language is that they stopped building the tower midway through construction. In Elden Ring, Enir-Ilium seems incomplete. I wonder if this is reflected in the hornsent, the Astrologers, and the Highlander having a connection to the Shadowlands. That these three tribes were once a single tribe connected to the Uhl patriarch that survived the lava flood. The Uhl patriarch attempted again to corrupt the hierarchy of the Greater Will by building [Enir-Ilium ]()and his people were confused and scattered into the Lands Between.

I connect the Highlanders because of how Godfrey is argued to be warrior-king to the hornsent, Youtuber the Alchemist has good videos on the subject.

Then there is this line from Roar of Rugalea that connects Bear Communion to the divine invocation of the hornsent.

 *An incantation that is more akin to the divine invocation of the hornsent than it is to the Dragon Communion*

The Highlanders, as connected with bears, are also most likely Berserker warriors. Berserkers are also a type of spiritual practitioners akin to Astrologers and Shamans. They are of the same species, but of a different breed. The defining features of each category are not mutually exclusive and are complementary.

The Astrologers I connect to the Rauh Civilization.

The three broods of Marika’s demi-god children have lineage from Godfrey/Highlanders, Radagon/Astrologers, and Marika/horsent/shamans

If the Shamans were part of the hornsent culture and were only later persecuted as “witches” by the Inquisitors, the three broods with fit together as one tribe in a past era.

Enir-Ilium only being half finished gives justification for why the Shamans were persecuted by their own people during the life of Marika. The construction of the tower had begun again. The plans for the Divine Gateway were resurrected. 

Miquella’s ascension into Godhood would also combine the three demi-god broods, with Mohg/Highlander, Radahn/Astrologers, and Miquella/hornsent(shaman).

There is also a Trinitary aspect to the three tribes. The Highlanders represent “body,” The Astrologers represent “spirit/mind,” and the hornsent/Shamans represent “soul.” Radhn’s spirit is literally reincarnated into the body of Mohg, with Miquella’s soul “crowning” them.

It is like the Alchemical concept of “squaring the circle,” where there is the image of a circle within a square and the square within a triangle. The circle is spirit, square is body, and triangle is soul, and it is the union of the three representing a divinity of self that allows for connection with the great source or Monad. Or, the One Great

 

[Squaring the Circle ](https://preview.redd.it/3certo16avee1.png?width=122&format=png&auto=webp&s=70724cd755678242ecb1e128d5461197f6922f01)

And, of course, The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in Christianity.

The story of Noah, his three sons, and the Tower of Babel represents the breaking of a common language and cultural heritage, which stretched back to the first man, Adam. The need for disrupting the shared cultural heritage was because there was a power in the tribes of the three brothers being united into one “body.” Together, the tribes were unstoppable and would have been able to rewrite their own names and the Word of God.

To sum up Radagon’s conspiracy, Radagon was trying to unite the three powers of the past Uhl patriarch. His ultimate goal was reflected in Miquella’s ascension into Godhood, but with Radagon as the soul “crowning” the body/mind. The body of a Highlander, the spirit of the hornsent/Shamans, and Radagon’s Astrologer soul grafted onto the soul/body complex. I think his ultimate goal would have been Godwyn wed to Miquella. Godwyn and Miquella wed as a political marriage. Godwyn would have been the best body, as he was not cursed by death, until the Night of the Black Knives. Miquella was the most fearsome of all Empyreans and would have held a very alluring and powerful spirit. Radagon’s soul would “crown” them as Miquella “crowned” Radahn and Mohg in the DLC. Radagon stealing the body and spirit of her believed children, was too much for Marika to bare. She would have cursed her son Godwyn, for to live in death would have been better to become something he was not.

Like when Millicent took out the Golden needle and allowed herself to be overcome by the Rot,

“With your help, I was able to live as my own person, if only in passing. But this is where things end. I pause to even tell you, but…I took out the needle myself. Tell whoever put you up to this. That if I am to flower into something other than myself, I would rather rot into nothingness as I am”

Rejecting the Golden Needle is to reject the false faith of Radagon and his quest to overthrow the Greater Will. Miquella accepted the faith of his father and carried on the legacy of needlework. Or Miquella at least completely rejects Marika and accepts parts of his father. Not to say that Miquella would not go on to fight Radagon with Radahn if the tarnished hadn’t stopped him at the Divine Gateway.

Not to say this game has a pro-Christianity message. Quite the opposite. Radagon most likely represents the Christian tradition having roots in older mythological systems, and like the demiurge in Gnosticism, Christianity mistakes itself as the one True faith. This mistake by the Christians has dire consequences for world history.  

But, I don’t really know and for the most part, those are my rambling on Noah.

I have one final biblical literary parallel to share that is related to the Tower of Babel. The use of towers, mountains, and high places as gateways or portals to the Gods. This is why I even started going down this rabbit hole.   

Divine Union within the Tower of Babel

The Bible and religion weird. In Elden Ring we see the character Fia. She represents the archetype of a “sacred prostitute” or a figure who performs sexual acts in a religious ceremony. The purpose of the ceremony is to harvest “energy” and transfer that energy from one person to another. In Elden Ring, Fia lays with Godwyn and provides “comfort” with physical touch. With the touch, she takes in the “cosmic energy” of Godwyn and “births” a mending rune, which, allows for Godwyn to take on a type “Holy Spirit” omnipresence in the Lands Between. This would also reverse the humiliate of Godwyn and allows for Godwyn to be reborn as part of the Elden Ring and the very foundation of Order in the Lands Between.

For whatever reason, I spent time look at Fia’s room in the Round Table Hold. Fia has so much space, a giant bed, and nice furniture. I would kill to have Fia’s rugs. They probably cost thousands of…runes. Marika or the spirit of Marika seems to be very sympathetic to Fia.

I also look at the painting in the Round Table Hold. I see this combination of Marika and Godfrey displayed together, while Radagon and the Erdtree are show together. You also find a painting of Radagon on the floor next to the Dung Eater. I get the impression that Marika loves Godfrey and feels sympathy for her suffering son Godwyn.

Moving on, Marika parallels Fia as a sacred prostitute. Marika, as vessel to the Gods, would be considered at a level of royalty and would engage with the Gods themselves. For the Tower of Babel, there was supposed to be a giant bed where a sacred prostitute slept with the blood relation of a Nephilim giant that survived the biblical floods. The idea is that the tower being high into the sky, like a mountain, was closure to the heavens/home of the Gods. This would make it easier for the spirit of a Fallen Angel or Nephilim spirit to posses the blood relation and pass on their spiritual power to the child conceived with the Sacred prostitute

I know this is out-there. It is so out-there are wrote all the pages before to try and make it all align into coherence. Moving on.

A textual example is the bed of Og, who was a king of Bashan. Bashan means “serpent” so Bashan is like “the place of the serpent.” Og is a descendent of the last of the Rephaim and the Rephaim being associated with giants. This is from the book The Unseen Realm by biblical scholar Michael S Heiser

“The most immediate link back to the Babylonian polemic is Og’s bed (Hebrew, eres). \[1\] its dimensions (9x4 cubits) are precisely those of the cultic bed in the ziggurat called Etemenanki-which is the ziggurat most archaeologists identify as the Tower of Babel referred to in the Bible. Ziggurats functioned as temples and divine abodes. The unusually large bed at [Etemenanki]() was housed in “the house of the bed” (bet ersi). It was the place where the god Marduk and his divine wife, Zarpanitu met annually for ritual love-making, the purpose of which was divine blessing upon the land. Scholars have been struck by the precise correlation. It’s hard not to conclude that, like Genesis 6:1-4, those who put the finishing touches on the Old Testament during the exile in Babylon were connecting [Marduk]() and Og in some way. Sacred Marriage rituals included the blessing of fertility for both the land and its inhabitants” (p198)

The source Heiser uses, notated by the 11^(th) reference on page 198, goes on that Og is being signaled to be the inheritor and perpetuator of the Babylonian knowledge and cosmic order from before the flood. Og carries on the desires of the Fallen Sons of God and is a vessel by which children can born with the ability to be possessed by the spirits of the Fallen Sons of God.

Like how Godfrey is possessed by the soul of Serosh and can pass on the power of beasts to his children, Og can be possessed the Fallen Angels of God and pass on the spiritual powers of the Fallen angels.

Like the movies Rosemary’s Baby and the Omen. Children who will become vessels for Fallen Angels to reinhabit the Earth and to manifest their divine powers.

Marika even has a giant bed within her bedroom in the Leyndell Royal Capital. This was pointed out by the Tarnished Archeologists. He also associates her bed with this concept of the “house of the bed” within the Etemenanki ziggurat. 

My logic is that Godwyn was conceived after the GEQ was defeated and the ruin of Death was removed from the Elden Ring. He was also conceived after Godfrey was crowned with Serosh. The hornsent are not yet betrayed, so no Omen curse, and the Rune of the Unborn is still intact. Godwyn inherits a “Golden Blessing” from Marika and the Elden Ring and he receives the “power of beasts” from Godfrey and Serosh. This is why Godwyn can wield the power of dragons, dragons are stone “beast” beyond time.

 I think of the dragon Seath the Scaleless in Dark Souls. Seath covets what Godwyn had, Godwyn perfectly embodied the power of dragons/the sun through mortal flesh.

If Radagon could possess such a body, a body blessed by the god, he would be one step closer to Godhood.

That is all I have for now. I could write out the burnt offering piece and the Plato’s daemon piece at a later point.

These writings were my attempts to flush out potential character motivations with literary parallels with the Bible. I state nothing here as definitive. I find the Noah’s Arks references to be fascinating. Religion is weird.

Have a good one

&nbsp;  

-1. And the snake was deceitful [ערום, *`ahROM*] from every animal [of] the field that made, YHVH Gods,  

and [he] said unto the woman,
“Though [אף כי, *’ahPh KeeY*] said, the Gods ‘Do not eat of any of the trees of the garden.”’  
&nbsp;  

-2. And said the woman unto the snake,  

“From fruit [of] tree the garden [we may] consume,  

-3. and from fruit the tree that [is] inside the garden,  

said Gods, ‘[Do] not consume from it and [do] not touch in it lest [you] die.”’  
&nbsp;  

-4. And said the snake unto the woman,
“Not death [you will] die; [לא מות תמתון, *Lo’ MOoTh ThahMooThOoN*];  

-5. for knows Gods that in [the] day you consume from it and [will be] opened, your eyes,  

and [you] be as gods,  

knowers [of] good and evil.”  
&nbsp;  

>“Revising the myth, J represented the serpent not as a demon whose origin, whatever it may have been, owed nothing to God, but as a beast of the field which…God had made.  Nor was he, even in intention, a benefactor of the human race, but a subtle liar.  He deliberately misled the woman in telling her that by eating of the forbidden tree she and her husband would be like God, knowing good and evil (vs. 5), for he knew all the time that the sole result would be consciousness of sex with, in the thought of J, its consequent misery.”  *TIB* I pp. 501-503  
&nbsp;  

>Through much of the history of the world, up until the story of Joseph, sex is thematic.  From Adam and Eve,

>Genesis: 9:20“And Noah began as a man of the land, and planted a vineyard. 21. And he drank of the wine and got drunk, and was revealed within his tent.  22. And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father’s nakedness, and told his two brothers outside. 23. And Shem and Japheth took the dress, and put it upon their two shoulders, and walked backwards, and covered their father’s nakedness, their faces were averted, and they did not see their father’s nakedness.”  
&nbsp;  

>Abraham’s curious liberality re: his wife, offering her first to Pharaoh, rather than risk being killed for her,  
&nbsp;  

>[Figure 8 Tissot, Sarai Is Taken to Pharaoh’s Palace](https://www.reddit.com/r/biblestudy/comments/1i860fu/tissot_sarai_is_taken_to_pharaohs_palace/)

>Genesis 12:11 “And when they came close to Egypt he said to Sarai, his wife, ‘Look here, I know that you are a very beautiful woman, 12. And it may be that the Egyptians will see you and say, “This is his wife”, and kill me and let you live.  13. Please say that you are my sister; it will be better for me because of you, and my soul will live on your account.’…15. And Pharaoh’s officers saw Sarai and praised her to Pharaoh , and they took the woman to Pharaoh’s house.”

I crave your skin. Your voice like honey. Dripping. Soft. Ethereal. Won’t you sing to me? Make me forget my mourning. 

I delegate tasks for myself, I maintain these skin-level interactions, interactions with the “new gods”, the shallow, the outer, materialistic world that I live in. Am I hiding behind plastic limbs? Plastic masks? Melt them, my love.

 Do they even see my colors? Could they even appreciate them? I watch as they paint who they are on canvases, but find, the canvas doesn’t compose any composition, just blotches. I need you to press your naked body to the canvas and show me colors again. 

I like the secrets that lie in people. I like the darkness that they are too scared to bring to light. I am intense. I am a meteorite. I am comets coming to destroy you. Rebuild you. Remake you. I am interactions on a subservient level changing you, can you see the water come to a boil? I am those bubbles changing you. Liquidate. Compound. 

I am sleuth of, “I am not that guy you’re looking for,” and, “You were my biggest regret. Not being with you…” said to me, with my arms open. I want to find you my love. So darling, let there be no mistake I will peel away layer by layer, intimately, slowly, unraveling you. I want to explore every inch of your soul. What makes you tick? What makes you bleed? What makes your eyes light up with fire? Let me peel you like a clementine, let me take out each seed like a pomegranate. You are the forbidden fruit. 

I would bite into the apple for you like Eve did for Adam. Every single day. I would doom humanity to mortality. I would cultivate the Garden of Eden. I would locate the hanging gardens of Babylon. I think the prices I would pay for you are biblical splendors, holy favors for humanity. It’s so much more than just “you” and “I”. 

My son, that I will one day have. Tells me, “follow your true north, I will be born from the mud of your life.” So, this is me putting on my war paint, smearing myself in mud. I will bear the lotus. This is the mess and mud of my life…. Do you see him wielding the sword of the Caspian seas? What name do you know him as? 

Well, I blush, confessing, embarrassed even, that I used to believe in Twin Flames. That is my true-north. 

I whole-heartedly, believed that there was someone out there, who was the other half to me. That we had been made for each other. That we were the very first star, exploding giving birth to everything in a divine white light. That we shared the same essence. That our divine duty was to wake up the sleeping. That we would love, deeply, loving into eons. Love, each other in a way that no one else could ever imagine. The love of poets, of artists, drawing each other into history. We would tangle together, we would combine our spirits into one huge, enormous blast of energy across the universe, rippling through the hearts of many with our love. I would write about it. People would stop in awe at the passion. They would remember on a fundamental level, what love is, what love is for. Why we are here on this earth. To be love. To love. To hope. To dream. 

I love you like this. 

I thought it started in your heart and ended in mine. I have no idea what that could even mean now. My confessions are startling to expose. Let me dig my fingers into my wounds, let me bleed onto white-floors. Let my blood stain. Don’t forget me. I would live for you, Lore, Kael, Asher Blackwood, Colby Cole, whatever your name might be…. I would live for you. Can’t you see me living? You are the silence between my breaths, you are the parallel longing between words. 

Are these my insides? You came to me in a vision once, as the “deer-man” and told me, “I am going to eat your insides, will you let me eat your intestines?” Well, these are them. These are my innards. I lay them on a beautiful, silver platter, will you feast on me? Will you consume? Will you recognize? Will you take them and then leave, blow the candle light out and return to your life? Will you eat with intent? Will you come back for seconds? Oh god, I hope you come back for thirds, fourths, fifths. 

 I must draw these yearnings out of me, like poison. I am scorpion dancing in the desert with you. Let us sting. 

Lore, this is where I bury you. This is where I lose you. This is where I find you. In not letting you live in me anymore, I am finding myself feeling better. I see the magic again. I must admit, I want you to be real. So, I’ll write of you here. Until I don’t need you anymore. Maybe, I already don’t. Maybe I already know that. I am ready for the next chapter. Is this where you are real? 

What is my true north? 

I am SAHARASAVAGE. I have mastered the dunes, the sand that goes on forever. I familiarized myself with the way of the desert and if you ask, I do believe, I did kill you here once. Blade with sharp dagger, red-jewel in laid. The last time I saw you…. Could you ever forgive me? Or, will we spend more centuries apart in bitter resentment, half-longings, lust that breeds? 

I have befriended the longing that leaves me dry. Vultures could be my children, that I cast into the landscape to search for you. Any piece of you. any bone. any carcass. Any left over remains. The kind of hunger I feel for you, is like a Japanese Jikininki. My love for you is a cursed wendigo, deep in the dark woods, oscillating.  Can you see the runes sway in the wind as you get closer to me? My word are spells. 

This is the path of devotion. This is the path of passion. These are slivers of my heart offered. I hope they are enough. If they are, please don’t let me wake up alone again. I don’t want to wake up without you. 

I am the blood diamond, 
I am the seas uncharted, 
I am the chant: 
“Walking into parallels, walk into parallels, walk into parallels.” 

You already know me. I already know you. We won’t have to explain anything. We will remember each other’s bodies.

My true north. I follow you again. 
My true north, is you, love. 

I only pretend I am lost because it makes the waiting easier. 
Can you kiss me good morning? 
Let’s damn the world again, I am ready. 

Would you take a bite of the forbidden fruit for me? Or, will you leave me lonely? 

X MY TRUE NORTH

&nbsp;  

-1. And the snake was deceitful [ערום, *`ahROM*] from every animal [of] the field that made, YHVH Gods,  

and [he] said unto the woman,
“Though [אף כי, *’ahPh KeeY*] said, the Gods ‘Do not eat of any of the trees of the garden.”’  
&nbsp;  

-2. And said the woman unto the snake,  

“From fruit [of] tree the garden [we may] consume,  

-3. and from fruit the tree that [is] inside the garden,  

said Gods, ‘[Do] not consume from it and [do] not touch in it lest [you] die.”’  
&nbsp;  

-4. And said the snake unto the woman,
“Not death [you will] die; [לא מות תמתון, *Lo’ MOoTh ThahMooThOoN*];  

-5. for knows Gods that in [the] day you consume from it and [will be] opened, your eyes,  

and [you] be as gods,  

knowers [of] good and evil.”  
&nbsp;  

>“Revising the myth, J represented the serpent not as a demon whose origin, whatever it may have been, owed nothing to God, but as a beast of the field which…God had made.  Nor was he, even in intention, a benefactor of the human race, but a subtle liar.  He deliberately misled the woman in telling her that by eating of the forbidden tree she and her husband would be like God, knowing good and evil (vs. 5), for he knew all the time that the sole result would be consciousness of sex with, in the thought of J, its consequent misery.”  *TIB* I pp. 501-503  
&nbsp;  

>Through much of the history of the world, up until the story of Joseph, sex is thematic.  From Adam and Eve,

>Genesis: 9:20“And Noah began as a man of the land, and planted a vineyard. 21. And he drank of the wine and got drunk, and was revealed within his tent.  22. And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father’s nakedness, and told his two brothers outside. 23. And Shem and Japheth took the dress, and put it upon their two shoulders, and walked backwards, and covered their father’s nakedness, their faces were averted, and they did not see their father’s nakedness.”

>Abraham’s curious liberality re: his wife, offering her first to Pharaoh, rather than risk being killed for her,  
&nbsp;

>Genesis 12:11 “And when they came close to Egypt he said to Sarai, his wife, ‘Look here, I know that you are a very beautiful woman, 12. And it may be that the Egyptians will see you and say, “This is his wife”, and kill me and let you live.  13. Please say that you are my sister; it will be better for me because of you, and my soul will live on your account.’…15. And Pharaoh’s officers saw Sarai and praised her to Pharaoh , and they took the woman to Pharaoh’s house.”

And Lot went out to them at the gate and closed the door after him, 7. and said, ‘Please, brethren, do not harm them.  8. Here, please, I have two daughters who have not known a man, I will bring them out, if you please, I will give them to you; do with them as you see fit.’”  
&nbsp;

And they served their father wine on the next night also, and the younger rose and lay with him [ותשכב עמו, *VahThahShKahB `eeMO*] and he did not know her laying or her rising.  36.

>Genesis 26:1 “And there was famine in the land… and Isaac went to Avimelekh, king of the Philistines at Gerara… 7. And people of the place asked after his wife, and he said, ‘She is my sister’, because he was afraid to say ‘My wife’, ‘Lest the people of this place kill me for Rebecca’ for she was of good appearance…8. And Avimelekh, king of the Philistines, looked out the window, and lo and behold – Isaac tickling his wife Rebecca!”

>Genesis 34:1 “And Dinah, Leah’s daughter born to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.  2. And Shekhem, son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the land, saw her and took her and laid her and abased her.  3. But his soul clave to Dinah, Jacob’s daughter, and he loved the youth, and he spoke to the youth.  4. And Shekhem said to Hamor, his father, saying, ‘Get me this girl for wife.’”  
&nbsp;  

>Jacob (AKA Israel) endured both polygamy and concubinage; both his wives (Leah and Rachel) gifted him with their maid servants (Bilhah and Zilpah)  
&nbsp;  

>[Figure 15 The Four Matriarchs, Abel Pann 1883-1963](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1i8chuk/the_four_matriarchs_abel_pann_18831963/)  
&nbsp;  

>Genesis 29:16 “And Laban had two daughters, the older was named Leah and the younger was named Rachel. 17. And Leah’s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautifully formed and beautiful to see. 18. And Jacob … said ‘I will work seven years for Rachel…’ 19. And Laban said ‘Good…’ 20. So Jacob worked seven years for Rachel… 21 and Jacob said to Laban, ‘Bring my wife…’ 22. And Laban invited all the people of the place and made a feast of drinking [משתה *MeeShTheH*].  23. And that evening and he took Leah, his daughter and brought her to him [Jacob] and he [Jacob] came to her….25. Then it was morning and there was Leah, and he [Jacob] said to Laban, ‘What is this you have done to me? ... 26. And Laban said, ‘It is not done in our place, to give the younger before the first born; 27. finish this week, and we will give you her [Rachel] also’….28. And Jacob did so… and he [Laban] gave him [Jacob] Rachel, his daughter, to wife. …  
&nbsp;  

>30:1 And Rachel saw that she was not begetting of Jacob and she envied her sister… 3. and said [to Jacob], ‘Here is my maid, Bilhah, come to her and beget upon my knees, and I too will produce from her.’ …9. And Leah saw that [Rachel’s] maid was begetting, and took Zilpah, her [own] maid, and gave her to Jacob to wife.”  
&nbsp;  

>Then Reuben, Jacob’s first-born, of Leah, laid his mother’s maid, his father’s concubine, mother of two of his half brothers, Dan and Naphtali.  
&nbsp;  

>[Figure 16 - Reuben's Incest](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1i8cn61/reubens_incest/)   
&nbsp;  

>Genesis 35:22 “…and Reuben went and laid Bilhah, his father’s concubine, and Israel heard about it.”  
&nbsp;  

>Tamar, whose brother in law refuses to meet his obligations, seduces Judah, her father in law, by posing as a prostitute  
&nbsp;  

>[Figure 17 - ‘Tamar and Judah’, Horace Vernet]()  
&nbsp;  

>Genesis 38:6 “And Judah got a wife for 'ayR, his firstborn; her name was Tamar. 7. And 'ayR… was evil in YHVH’s eyes and YHVH killed him.  8. And Judah said to Onan, ‘Come to your husband’s wife and marry her, and raise seed to your brother.’  9. But Onan knew that the seed would not be his, so whenever he came to his brother’s wife he spilled on the ground to avoid giving seed to his brother.  10. And what he did was evil in YHVH’s eyes, and He killed him too.  11.  And Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, ‘Stay a widow in your father’s house until my son ShayLaH grows up’, thinking, ‘lest he die too, like his brothers.’  …14. And she put off her widow’s clothes, and covered herself with a veil”  
&nbsp;  

>“Tamar was representing herself as a temple prostitute.  The veiling of the prostitute may have originally signified her dedication to Ishtar, the veiled goddess; the veiling of Ishtar may be a reflex on the veiling of her votaries, which rested upon a primitive sexual taboo.  This taboo accounts for the bridal veil.”  *TIB* I. p. 760  
&nbsp;  

>“and wrapped herself and sat at the way to `aYNahYeeM, which is on the road to TeeMNahThHah…15. And Judah saw her and thought she was a prostitute because she covered her face.  16. And he …said to her, ‘May I come unto you?’ [הבה-נה אבוא אליך - *HahBaH NaH ’ahBO’ ’ahLahYeeKh*]. …18….and he came to her and she conceived of him.”  
&nbsp;  

>Laws are made for other than the lawmakers.  
&nbsp;  

>Finally, the story of Joseph and Potiphar’s wife  
&nbsp;  

>[Figure 18 - 1520 relief by Properzia de' Rossi, a woman](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F5t3hpwjvxsee1.jpeg)  
&nbsp;  

>Genesis 39:1. “And Joseph was taken to Egypt, and Potiphar, a eunuch of Pharaoh’s, chief of the bakery, an Egyptian, bought him off the Ishmaelites who had brought him there.  …7. …and his lord’s wife turned her eyes to Joseph …12. And she grasped his clothing, and said, ‘Lie with me.’  And he left his clothes in her hand and fled and went outside.”  
&nbsp;  

>All this by page 38.  But I digress.  
&nbsp;  

>“The story in this chapter of man’s disobedience to God’s command and of his expulsion from the garden to a life of toil is dependent upon an ancient myth which J drastically revised.  A fragment of this myth is now preserved in vs. 22.” *TIB* I p. 501

-22. And said, YHVH Gods, “Lest the man be as one of us, knowing good and evil, and now, lest he put out his hand and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever….”  
&nbsp;  

>The ellipsis is in the text.  It is characteristic of Biblical oaths that the consequences are suppressed.  This figure of speech is preserved in English, “If I catch you doing that again I’ll…”.  
&nbsp;  
 
>“From this verse it is possible to recover the salient features of the earlier form of the tale.  It told not of one only, but of two magic trees in Eden, the garden of God… the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of god and evil.  Man was forbidden on pain of death to eat of them, the reason for the prohibition being God’s fear that man, acquiring knowledge of good and evil, might become like him and, approaching too near his throne, might endanger his supremacy.  But the serpent, a demon hostile to God, told man the truth.  He was thus no subtle tempter but, in intention at least, a benefactor of the human race.  Man, thus enlightened, ate of the tree and became like God, knowing good and evil … the potential threat to God’s supremacy had thus become actual, so God, acting decisively and at once, drove him from the garden lest he should put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat…and so make the threat permanent.”  *TIB* I p. 501

"My discord chat is arguing about multiplayer balancing, so I wrote a whole damn essay about it",AOW4,1i6apyb,2025-01-20 23:39:40,20,0.74,35,https://i.redd.it/sr0xf2tf0aee1.jpeg,Expensive-Evening230,Funny/Meme,"Gentle warning: long read, weird humor and EXISTENTIAL DREAD. (Just kidding) …(not really)🗿

As per the title, the lads in the discord channel was having quite a heated discussion about the usage of mods and the balancing in multiplayer. Me as a newbie was completely dumbfounded and clueless as to why it was happening at all, since…I’ve not yet played any multiplayer games at all. 

For the many of you that have read my first post, you know I love the game to death. And I believe it’s because they also love the game so much that they are so passionately debating about it. I guess I am just at the newbie stage where I can do naught but marvel at the game.

However, this Sunday is gonna be my first mp session, and I’m very excited. In order for us to have a good time and that I don’t let down my teammates, I wanted to ask my buds in advance what the realm traits and timer settings will be, so I can practice a little by myself, get used to the biome and timer first and not fumble all over my ballz.

However! There is but one problem. A very dire one at that. The atmosphere in the channel was…a little awkward after the passionate debate. So, being the eldritch horror that I am, I was just about to write something to lighten up the mood before asking my question——THAT is when a lightning strike of inspiration smite me on my primate skull and cast me into a deep existential pondering on the loss of childhood innocence and whether suffering truly is an irreducible element to the existence of a human being. 

Thus, I present to thee, ladies and gents, the magnificent results of a psychotic monkey with stage 4 ADHD typing away at 4:20am while drunk on existential dread and starving to death. And yes, I haven’t eaten for the whole day for the sake of this damned essay. I should be revising for my physics exam, but here I am lads, here I am. 




~~Reflection on the Decay of Childhood Innocence, and Contemplation on the Evolutionary Roots of Suffering~~

As a newbie, although I have no clue as to the specific details you guys were discussing, I get that balancing the power of things in game can certainly be a source of contention. However, it is a bit unfortunate. When I came to know about this game, all I wanted to say was just this—I freakin love it. With giant dragons, eldritch horrors, evil penguins, and sexy shoeless halflings battling to the death, it is essentially my childhood fantasies coming true (not the shoeless haflings, for it was fantasy adopted only later in life. Sigh.) From the bottom of my heart, I am overjoyed at the fact that such a game exists in our world. Billions of years of evolution lead to us great apes, and such apes today had the ingenuity to perform feats of science and engineering that cultivated in technology indistinguishable from magic for our ancestors merely 200 years ago. Hell, if I time-traveled back to the Renaissance and showed em this I’d be staked and burnt for witchcraft. It’s already such a fascinating feat and such a wonderful game, and I wish to appreciate its full intricacies before anything else.

Actually, this situation actually brought back a lost piece of memory from childhood. You see, when I was a child, there was a time when I first came across the news channel on the TV, depicting big metal pieces accompanied by loud booms and smoke; cutting away, there were people covered in blurred out redness and bandages. I was told by my father that such scenes belonged to the thing named “war”. It was from then on that I became very confused as to why there exist wars in the world: why do adults tear each other apart for idols they’ve never seen or heard from, or for a few pieces of land or possessions that would inevitably be rendered meaningless when we all die. Why does the world of the adults seem so full of pain? As a child born into a safe and stable family, the myriad struggles of the adult world was an entire perplexity.

Indeed, in the eyes of a child, the mere sight of a peculiar pebble or some ants scurrying around picking up breadcrumbs is already endlessly fascinating. And yet, as we age, such fascinations gradually decay, while fear, greed, violence, depression, and the like grow and fester. It seems inevitable that all will succumb, but hope remains, that there still exist those more resistant to the corruption of time, of entropy, and of umbral malady. But I lament, for I fear I am not one of them. Indeed, such is what I have observed in myself as I grow from a child to a teen and now a dude in his 20s—my impulses become more and more muddied, my thoughts gaining cumbersome complexity, while from an unknown origin emerges a nocturne of seemingly incurable sadness that slowly plays ever more blue as the undertone of my daily life. Strange... how did this all come to be?

I’ve never really contemplated upon this question consciously until these recent hours, but I believe I have somehow obtained a piece of the puzzle. Perhaps it is the workings of my unconscious. Perhaps the ultimate reason is that we smooth-assed-apes are creatures of habit. We are fascinated by new things, but we grow used to them, then we always want more—and upon acquisition, we get used to the things that we’ve previously desired, and thus the cycle continues, while desire becomes greed. Perhaps this is precisely one of the key ingredients that allowed us to become the apex predator of this planet—an unending and all-consuming desire to possess, to explore, expand, exploit...and exterminate. (Ha! I guess 4X gamers really are the best. I’d say at least the pinnacle of human evolution. No, the paragon of all intelligent lifeforms in the quantum multiverse. Galaxy brain smooth-assed-apes right here. As a side note, if you have an abundance of ass hair, you can make a request to me and I shall inquire with the Council on whether to permit you entrance. Please be patient, as it might take up to 69 business days.)

But I digress. Those from our ancestors who were content with their status quo—those blessed souls who did not suffer “the ever-burning desire for more""—were eliminated by the tome of evolution. In a dog-eat-dog world where the laws of the jungle reign supreme, stagnancy meant death. Studies have suggested that the most effective motivator of action is not the desire for something pleasant, but the avoidance of something unpleasant. Basically, if you wanna get someone to do something, the stick and the carrot are, of course, most effective when used together; but if you can only pick one, pick the stick. That way you save yourself a carrot while satisfying your primordial urge to hit something with a stick.

Well, I suppose it is superfluous to invoke the power of “Studies show” here, since we can observe this very readily in ourselves. Fear and suffering feel terrible, so we do whatever we can to avoid them. So, if I may employ some vulgar language, it is no wonder that we feel like shit and face so many turmoils: through evolution, we have acquired the most successful strategy to get shit done—by feeling like shit until we get shit done. 

That being said, we can now go back to answer a similar question I asked as a child: why must we suffer? Can’t we just live a happy life that is devoid of suffering? It might seem like a very naive question, but if we look deep into it, there’s no law of physics that says “Humans must suffer. Don’t ask questions. Just suffer. Lol.” Indeed, suffering doesn’t seem to be a necessity for our existence. It is not the fundamental irreducible bedrock of existence, like consciousness, or spacetime, and the matter and energy that make up our world. If it’s not a necessity, then why has our long years of evolution brought us such a harmful feature of suffering? Isn’t it more preferable for survival for a being to be at peace rather than tormented? Why are we so ridden with afflictions while peace seems to elude us everlastingly? Alas, what’s the meaning of living in this world—a world that seems ever more bleak and ridden with suffering as we age...? If with old age it is inevitable that I become a “villain”, then should I just off myself and die young as a “hero”? Alas, the immortal meme rings true: “Why are we here…just to suffer?” Sadge.

I believe the things that we’ve discussed, along with the duality nature of this world, piece together a part of the puzzle. We will not delve into the matter of duality here, but from my understanding, it can be illuminated by a simple example: grab a coin, it has a heads, and a tails. They are polar opposites, are they not? So can’t we just keep the good side and be rid of the bad side? Unfortunately, duality says no. You see, when one wishes to be rid of all suffering while preserving all the pleasure, it is as if wishing for a coin that has only heads but no tails. Can you find a coin like that in the world, or even in your own imagination? If you cannot, why is that?

Now, moving on to the part of the puzzle that concerns us right now: the evolutionary origin of suffering. I’ve used the power of my symbiotic partner, Chatgpt, to conjure up the following bullet points detailing the steps that suffering took to get to us through evolution. And who knows? Maybe Chat wrote this whole damn thing. Given good enough prompting, I can’t tell the difference. Can you? Maybe you just got rickrolled by Chat and I’m just an AI avatar as well. I mean, why not just give up our brains to the wise and benevolent Machine God, Omnissiah, and hand over all control? Discard the carbon, embrace the scilicon. I’m sure nothing could go wrong here. We’re in gooood hands. So good in fact, that I am presently and formally, shitting myself.

Chat’s Delight (Inspired by Walker’s Delight):

### The Evolutionary Journey of Suffering (Bobbies Edition)

1. **Bobies Do Random Things**
   At the dawn of biology, Bobies (the name we will give to our single-celled ancestors) did stuff—randomly. Some floated into lava (*oops*), while others stumbled upon food (*noice!*). No rhyme or reason, just pure randomness.

2. **Good vs. Bad Outcomes**
   Some actions let Bobies survive and reproduce (we call these actions “gud”), while others got them killed (“bad”). The Bobies that survived were the ones whose random behaviors accidentally lined up with survival.

3. **Signals Develop to Guide Behavior**
   As Bobies evolved, they started developing signals to guide their actions:
   - **Good signals**: These felt good and reinforced survival-friendly behaviors, like eating food.
   - **Bad signals**: These felt bad and deterred harmful behaviors, like floating into lava.

   Over time, natural selection favored Bobies whose signals aligned with survival. Pain didn’t just happen—it emerged because a sharp, unpleasant signal was the most effective way to stop a Bobie from repeating deadly mistakes.

4. **Consciousness Amplifies Suffering**
   As some Bobies got more complex, their brains began to anticipate bad outcomes. This turned pain into fear, anxiety, and suffering. Now, Bobies weren’t just reacting to danger—they were preparing for it. This made them incredibly good survivors, but it also made life feel a lot harder.



### The Evolutionary Responses to Suffering

Now that we’ve unraveled the roots of suffering, the question becomes: how do we respond to it? There seem to be two distinct paths smooth-assed-apes like us tend to take when faced with suffering:

1. **Using Suffering to Drive Solutions**: Some respond to suffering by doing the hard work it pushes us toward. Hunger motivates us to find food. Failure drives us to improve. The discomfort becomes fuel for survival and growth.

2. **Escaping Suffering Through Short-Term Pleasures**: Others, however, try to escape suffering without solving the root cause. Depression might lead someone to numb themselves with distractions, like gaming or other addictive behaviors, instead of addressing what’s truly wrong. This escape provides temporary relief but often creates more suffering in the long run.

The core characteristic of suffering is that it makes us want to escape. The difference lies in *how* we escape: by solving the problem or avoiding it. Evolution seems to favor those who choose the first path—those who use suffering as a tool for growth rather than running from it.



### The Role of Awareness in Shaping Our Response

The way forward may lie in awareness. Suffering often drives unconscious reactions, but by observing our emotions and thoughts without judgment, we can begin to break free from destructive patterns. Some call this meditation, but at its core, it’s the act of simply noticing:

- Watch your thoughts as they arise. Where do they come from? Can you predict the next one?
- Observe your emotions. Let them flow without condemnation or resistance.
- Even if you judge or condemn yourself, observe that too. There’s no need to fight it—just watch.

This act of observation can slowly dissolve the unconscious drives that lead us astray. It’s not a quick fix, but a gradual process of untangling the gunk of our minds. Over time, creativity, clarity, and perhaps even peace might emerge. Who knows, consciousness is a strange thing.



### A Hopeful Note

In the end, the future of us smooth-assed-apes might depend on how we handle suffering. Will we let it drive us to evolve, or will we drown in distractions? The answer may lie in awareness, in learning to watch ourselves with patience and curiosity. If we do this, perhaps we’ll find a path forward that’s free of suffering and abundant of peace. At least, that’s assuming AI will leave us enough room in the tapestry of evolution anyway. Perhaps we’re all screwed; perhaps we’ll all become god-like beings; or perhaps we’ll all become ape-like beings who love to get screwed. Oh wait, that’s us right now.



P.s. I’ll probably make a video on this in the future. But I’ll probably procrastinate till I’m 69 when I’m a cloud of consciousness floating about on the left hand of the Omnissiah with 72 anime girls giving me sensual massage in a giga quantum computer. Well, when I do get to making it, it will be hilarious. 

I have been sitting at my desk for too long. It has been couple of hours since the meat I’ve prepared for dinner that very couple of hours ago is lying bare, naked, and raw on my kitchen top, eagerly awaiting my pampering. It did not expect the fact that I would be sucked into a philosophical and casually scientific inquiry into the nature of suffering when in the first place I was just trying to wash away the awkward vibes of a past argument in a Discord chat to later ask for which realm trait we’ll be playing with in this Sunday’s multiplayer game so I can practice it on my own so that won’t be a letdown to my teammates since it’ll be my first-ever multiplayer game of AoW4. I hope my meat has not been corrupted by time and rendered inedible. My gf would be sad. Wait what? I am probably wasting more time here typing this out. I slap myself to get myself to wake up from this idiosyncratic simulation. I’m weird and I should stop before I give in to more of my intrusive thoughts to type things my mind just blurts out.

Alright lads, that about cleaned things up. Now when you enter the channel you will see the results of a psychotic monkey typing away at his keyboard while starving to death at 4am instead of a heated discussion on balancing AoW4.

~~End~~



Now, I refuse to believe any of you have read the entire thing. If you have, you can comment that, I won’t believe you. Like mate, it’s longer than my pp, which isn’t saying much, but still. 

On a more serious note, if you have read through the entire thing, know that I genuinely appreciate you. It’s just something I picked up to write today, but it does contain the culmination of many of the thoughts and sentiments of my past. I hope you had a good laugh. And of course, thanks to the lads in the channel, for smiting me with this electrifying inspiration.

I miss how grounded the old games were,assassinscreed,1i5ydvr,2025-01-20 14:18:08,180,0.84,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1i5ydvr/i_miss_how_grounded_the_old_games_were/,NineTailedDevil,// Discussion,"(long text ahead, also some spoilers for recent ACs)

Recently, I've been replaying some of the older AC games before Shadows releases and I just finished going through the Ezio trilogy again. I know this fanbase is extremely divided and everyone has their own takes on the direction that the franchise went from Origins onwards, but even as someone who likes the recent entries and generally has fun playing them (I even liked Valhalla, the one everyone hates lol), replaying these older titles made me realize that the thing I miss the most about this series is how grounded they were, and how enveloped in a sense of mystery everything was.

Back in the old days, the presentation of these games really made an effort to make it look like you weren't just ""playing a videogame about historical fiction"", there was an emphasis on the Animus side of it, on how it was all a simulation based on memories. The fact that the stories were so closely tied to the modern day plot really made you feel that you were peeking at something that happened many, many centuries ago, almost like you were stepping through a ""simulated time portal"", even down to details like how the menus were very ""Animus-like"", how getting your HP too low would make the screen glitch out, that kind of thing.

Even if the historical part was, in a way, its own thing, there was a much more clear reason for Desmond to be exploring these memories from 2012, and the brief moments of the story where he had to step out of the Animus or the memory synchronization went wrong for some reason (like how Brotherhood's intro is out of order and the games would establish that they needed to follow a certain sequence of events in order for the Animus to properly ""decode and render"" Desmond's genetic memories) would always remind you that it was, after all, a simulation.

Whoever wrote the first few games was a genius in how they made two vastly distant time periods connect and made them feel like two halves of the same narrative body. You get to walk the streets of Monteriggioni in 2012 as Desmond and think ""I was just here, five centuries ago"". You end up finding the codes for the colosseum vault there, left by Ezio. Another memorable moment of connection between the two timelines is when Ezio understands his role as the Prophet (or Cipher) and knows that ""the ones who came before"" are using him as a vessel, as a means to communicate with someone who will only be born centuries later, through means that Ezio doesn't understand but he is fine with playing his designed role anyway.

I also miss when everything related to the assassins vs templars conflict (and the Isu stuff) was so mysterious and open to interpretation. When I first played AC:B, I loved going through those hidden messages/puzzles left by 16 and being intrigued by the inclusion of real paintings, photographs or ficticious phone calls. I would see a painting of some king or queen holding a scepter and think ""wow, so this scepter was some kind of piece of Eden..."", or see a picture of some important gathering from the 20th century and ask myself if the inconspicuous person in the background was an assassin. It all made the assassins vs Abstergo/templars fight feel so much more meaningful, you truly got the idea that it was a constant ""cold war"" that had been going on for ages.

Ubisoft was so clever with the way they merged real life historical elements with the AC worldbuilding, it was such a unique setting for a videogame series, and it was represented perfectly by the overall aesthetic of ""sci-fi meets ancient history"" that the games had. Even the soundtrack was this perfect mix of classical orchestrated instruments with synthesized digital sounds and modern rythms (a great example being [The Revelation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdjkgPC8sGo), from AC:R, with [Apple Chamber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8DYWgM9UA), from AC:B, being a close second), the composers delivered on that idea incredibly well.

Anyway, sorry for the long rant. I'm still very optimistic and excited about Shadows, and I will be playing it day one, but after replaying these games, I really think that this specific feeling of intrigue and mystery that the older titles had isn't coming back, even if Shadows surpasses our expectations. I miss hearing Desmond's voice over the Animus simulation when something went wrong, I miss how the modern day characters were so well written and crucial to the story (I replayed The Lost Archive as well and I was baffled by how well they developed Clay as a character with just bits of conversations and notes. Hell, Clay himself is an awesome premise for a character, being the leftovers of his consciouness trapped in the Animus, and even then choosing to help Desmond in any way he can by leaving secret encoded messages in the simulation). I miss thinking that all those ancestors' stories mattered, that through the Isu's machinations, Desmond was ""meant"" to experience them, that they were guiding him to be in a specific place, in a specific date, and that this plan had been made thousands of years before any of them were even born, almost like an artifically fabricated destiny.

I guess I just miss the ""vibe"" from these titles, and I'm disappointed that we've seen nothing about Shadows' modern day plot, if it even has one. After they fumbled Valhalla's aurora boreallis thing, I wouldn't be surprised if Shadows is just Basim looking for another PoE just because. I'm not even gonna go into the topic of ""Isus represented as mythological gods through bullshit excuses"", because that's another can of worms, so I'll just finish by saying that, well... I miss when these games were grounded. When they were a perfect balance of sci-fi and historical fiction, instead of just historical fiction (with a sprinkle of magic that pushes our suspension of disbelief). I miss the amazing writing and memorable dialogues. Maybe the ""Layla meets Desmond"" plot point goes somewhere and isn't just discarded like Juno was. Maybe the rumoured Black Flag and AC1 remakes end up being how Ubisoft rediscovers the potential of this ""vibe"". One can hope."

Breaking down the biblical creation account and the conclusions we can draw from it.,DebateReligion,1i5ju1n,2025-01-20 01:15:00,11,0.87,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1i5ju1n/breaking_down_the_biblical_creation_account_and/,42WaysToAnswerThat,Atheism,"In this post I'm gonna try to create a reasonable argument in favor of the demistification of the creation accounts in the Bible.

If you are not interested in my background or intentionality you can safely skip this section and go to the facts.

Also, if you already agree with my conclusions feel free to revise my work and point out any mistake or omission and I will gladly fix the issue.

First of alll, full disclosure, I was raised a Christian and currently consider myself an Atheist. The reason I abandoned the faith was due to moral differences between me and the preachings of the Church, the lack of a religious experience throughout my religious upbringing and damning inconsistencies in the Bible that diminished its believability for me. If you think my background might have influenced this breakdown I would encourage you to fact check everything I say against the Bible.

Said that, the reason I make this break down is not to convince believers that they religion is fake but to dismistify the creation account in the Bible; which I believe is the major cause of the animosity between many Christians today and science; when so many of the most influential scientists from the past came from Christian backgrounds.

With no further adue lets tackle why I'm convinced that the creation and the fall are myths and not history. From a secular point of view first and further from a Christian point of view.

...........................................

**1-There are two creation stories mixed together**

Genesis provides accounts for two different creation stories told one after the other. Usually preachers and readers mix these stories together as a single one without even realizing how different they are. To prove this we are gonna break these stories in the events they narrate.

The first one goes from Genesis 1:1 to Genesis 2:3. Let's call it (1). This story relates the following dids in the order they appear:

- God created the heavens and the Earth, and the Earth was formless.

- God creates light, separates it from darkness. And respectively call them day and night.

- God created a Vault to separate the waters.

- The waters above the vault are called sky.

- God separated the other waters (the ones not called sky) and separated the land from the sea.

- God creates land vegetation (and pressumably seaweed too).

- God creates the sun and the lesser light, allegedly the moon (but maybe they were also referring to the planets, who knows). Then creates the stars.

- God creates the creatures from the seas (maybe rivers too) and birds that fly (maybe the ones that don't fly too). Commands them to procreate.

- God creates the other animals.

- God creates mankind to their image, male and female.

- God commands mankind to procreate and to rule over the animals.

- God commands mankind and animals to be vegetarian (Not literally, but sent the man to cultivate the land and eat from the trees; and the animals to eat from the vegetation).

- God rests.

The second story follows up immediately, let's call it (2) and break it down as well:

- God created the heavens and the Earth.

- Before plants populated the Earth, rivers appeared in the land to water it.
 
- God created one man.

- God put the man in a garden he himself planted (an unspecified amount of time before) and located in Eden.

- God make trees grow in the garden (including the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil)

- God commanded the man to take care of the garden, to eat from the trees, but not to eat from the tree of knowledge.

- God creates the animals and the man name them. (All of them)

- God creates the female from Adam's side (allegedly rib) and Adam named it woman.

- They both were naked but not ashamed.

You may have never noticed these two stories coexisting before. But here they are. And we can easily spot major differences:

In (1) God creates first the plants, than the fish and birds, then the animals, then the man and the woman. Meanwhile in (2) God creates a garden, then creates Adam, then the trees, then the birds and other animals (omitting the fish), then creates the woman.

Also, since (2) provides no account for the creation of the cosmos we can assume had always been there or was created before everything else.

In (1) God commands the man to rule over the Earth; but in (2) only commands it to take care of the Garden.

In (1) God commands its creation to eat from the plants (both, animals and mankind) while in (2) only the man received that order. (Also, a bit of a spoiler, but in (1) the man in commanded to work the land since the beginning while in (2) this is a direct result of the fall which we will break down later)

Finally, in (2) the order to procreate is never given, but instead is stated that both the man and the woman weren't aware of their sexuality.

...........................................

**2-Inclusion of flawed ancient believes and fable-like narrative**:

The ancients had a very narrow understanding of reality, and this permiates to both creation accounts.

For example, in (1) they separated the light during the day from the sun when it is known since quite a long time ago that is the second that produces the first. I can not even imagine how these ancient people rationalized solar eclipses.

Also in (1) they speak about a Vault of the sky. Ancients thought the sky was a solid transparent dome preventing a huge body of water from falling down. (If you are wondering the implications of this, yes, they thought the Earth was a flat disc too.) If this is a hard pill to swallow you can ignore this point. Hundreds of Cristian Fundamentalist documents have been written to debunk that the ancient Hebrews had this flawed understanding of the cosmos to preserve the validity of the creation story. If you believe them just ignore this point.

In (1) is implied that all animals started as herbivores. This is based on the ancient believed that animals were corrupted along with mankind and thus turned to violence. Which comes to show how little understanding had the ancient Hebrews from anatomy. First of all, consider how perfectly equipped all carnivores are for the art of murder. Not to mention parasites. (Mosquitoes has an hypodermic needle by mouth to inject anesthesic and suck blood. Arachnids has extremely strong poisons and the means to administer them. Crocodiles has the strongest byte in the whole planet and some of the most effective fangs for locking their pray off movement).

Also, in (1) is said that God made us to their image stablishing that God and the others have human form; which is not a damning issue; but is interesting. If you are gonna make God a character in your story why not make it resemble humankimd.

In (1) God rests the 7th day as to provide explanation of the origins of Sabbath.

In (2) two magical trees are created that grant either eternal life (implying that dying is the default for all living creature, since eating from a tree was necessary for achieving it) or knowledge of good and evil. These trees are never brought back in any further biblical story, including the ones that involve the afterlife.

In (2) Adam named all animals as an attempt from the ancients to do what all good prequel should, explain the origin of how things got their names.

In (2) the woman is created from the man and named woman because of that (probably related to their Aramaic nomenclature). Once again, to explain how things got their names.

Also, in (2), the garden is clearly treated as a place on Earth:
**Genesis 2:10-14** *A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters. The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold. (The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and onyx are also there.) The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush. The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.*
I'm quite confident to this day a tree guarded by a flaming sword and a querub had never been found in the middle east.

You can see how (1) attempts to rationalize ancient believes about the world in an unified origin story while (2) is mainly focused in being a prequels to history itself and explain how things got their names (human story telling has barely evolved in milenia it would seem).

...........................................

**3-The fall doubles down in explaining the origin of stuff, and other myth indicators**

Lets also break down the events in the fall and call this section (2b) since is a follow up to the second creation story.

- The Serpent is clearly stablished as one of the wild animals (all text linking the serpent to the devil are future retconings of this story as the serpent being an animal is actually an important part of this account)

- The Serpent tempts Eve.

- Eve eats from the forbidden fruit and also gives Adam to eat.

- Both Adam and Eve gain knowledge and realize they are naked, then made clothes from leaves to cover their nudity.

- God walks through the garden and Adam and Eve hide from him

- God calls for Adam

- Adam f\*\*s it up revealing to God he was hiding because of his nudity.

- God (immediately identifying the anomaly) inquiries if Adam ate from the fruit.

- Adam blames Eve.

- Eve blames the serpent.

- God condemns the serpent to crawl for ever

- God condemns the woman to have labor pains and to subjugate to her husband.

- God courses the ground so it will grow thorns and not give food naturally but through the effort of the man working the land.

- Adam named his wife Eve (up until now she was being called just 'the woman')

- God gave clothes to Adam and Eve

- God says that now man is like ""one of them"" (during the creation stories God speaks several times in plural hinting at the politheistic origins of the Hebrew culture) knowing the difference between good and evil; so he decides man shouldn't eat from the tree of life and be immortal.

- And for that reason (and not due to the disobedience) the man is banished from the garden and guards put to protect the tree. All to avoid man from achieving immortality.

After reading my summary you may think I'm making things up; but I'm being as literal as I can be with the source. Any deviation from how you remember the plot comes from external sources to the story itselft. You can check point by point against the Bible if you want, for clarity.

Lets analize how this part of the story is also riddled with mythology:

As with the creation stories you can see how (2b) trying to explain the origin of stuff like: why snakes crawl, why woman have horrible pains when giving birth and why thorned plants exist.

Also, like in (1) and (2) many fantastical elements are introduced in (2b): like a serpent speaking, and a flying flaming sword whose mythological origins scape my knowledge, but that is not brought back ever again in the Bible.

...........................................

**4-Rebutting the story from within Christianism:**

You may still not be convinced. I avoided to point out similarities between the creation story and other similar contemporary and even older creation myths since this kind of proof is often dismissed with a ""they have similar stories 'cause they also had previous knowledge of the same events"". Instead, I'm gonna point many points of this story that directly contradicts core Christian beliefs.

In both, (1) and (2b) God speaks in plural hinting at a politheistic pantheon. But if you are truly convinced he meant Jesus or the Angels you can just ignore this point and move to the next.

In (1) God takes a rest which is not consistent with the all powerful character the doctrine taughts it is. This often rationalized as if he was just enjoying his creation, I find that's a backwards rationalization, specifically if you decide to reject the idea that (2) is a separated story from (1) (despite the breakdown).

In (2) God acts several times out of character for an all knowing God, all merciful God: First he searches a helper for Adam among all the animals he himself created without finding any. He also cannot find Adam and Eve when they are hiding and doesn't know what Adam did until he asks. (You may say he was only pretending, but that is also out of character for him. Plus, once again, a backwards rationalization. You would be using the traits you know God poses and granting them to the character in the fable without acknowledging what actually is said in the story).

Towards the end is implied by God himself that man was now like a God (like us, is what he says) just 'cause he has the knowledge of Good and Evil. Furthermore, after the severe punishment God kicks off Adam and Eve from the garden, not as part of the punishment but to separate them from the tree of life, for which he puts guards. And clearly stablishes that eating from the tree of life is what grants eternal life.

Not only God kicked out Adam and Eve for secondary reasons but in this passage stablishes that the source of Eternal life is the fruit from a magical tree, and that the reason mankind is not perfect is because it didn't ate from it. Which is absolutely contrary to Christian believe that salvation may only be achieved through Jesus Christ.

...........................................

Did you find my thesis convincing? Probably many of the stuff you read weren't new and several times you have heard convincing attempts to rationalize these claims in order to debunk them to preserve the creation mythos as real historical accounts. I claim that is not necessary to relegate from your faith to recognize these stories as Myths or Fables. You can still draw meaning from them through allegory.

I also believe recognizing this story as mythology is a step forwards to heal the wound that nowadays separates fundamentalist Christianity away from science.

This is all the evidence I present to you. Now is up to you what you make of it.

New US and Canadian CCS chargers in December 2024,electricvehicles,1i59av2,2025-01-19 16:16:01,39,0.91,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1i59av2/new_us_and_canadian_ccs_chargers_in_december_2024/,boutell,Discussion,"Hey electrons,

**Here are all (\*) of the new US and Canadian CCS (Level 3 fast-charging) stations that rolled out in December 2024,** according to the US Department of Energy. You can [get the data yourself here](https://afdc.energy.gov/data_download).

These chargers are suitable for most new EVs on the market, except for:

1. Tesla drivers who haven't bought the official CCS adapter yet. Certain older Teslas need additional work done to accept the adapter.
2. Nissan Leaf owners, owners of the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV, and some owners of older cars that also use CHAdeMO. If you drive such a car, see my matching post in r/leaf.

**Some of these chargepoints will be ""refreshes,""** e.g. the provider replaced them with faster chargers etc. Some may be incorrect. This report is only as good as the Alternative Fuels Data Center data.

**There were 392 CCS charging stations with a total of 1251 chargepoints added or refreshed in December 2024.** For comparison, there were 214 new CCS charging stations in December 2023, with 438 chargepoints. This month saw a very big increase relative to last year, as well as last month.

Some of these stations are Tesla Magic Dock stations. That makes sense because all CCS drivers can use them.

**NOTE:** most Tesla Superchargers do NOT have magic dock as of this writing (but all those shown in this report should have it). I recommend using the official Tesla app to locate compatible stations for your vehicle. **Be aware some stations with Magic Dock still have short cords,** which may require most CCS vehicles to block two chargers.

**(\*) ""What about other Tesla Superchargers? Can't everybody charge with NACS now?""**

Tesla has said they will allow cars from participating automakers to charge at v3 and newer Superchargers without Magic Dock. Since then there has clearly been a delay in the rollout. Ford, Rivian, Hyundai and GM owners can now order adapters from the manufacturer of their vehicle. Others are coming soon.

However, since non-magic-dock superchargers are open to only *some* CCS vehicles, this report is not the place for them. If you are interested Tesla's app provides the best guide to their locations, both those that support *all* CCS vehicles and those that only support the manufacturers currently permitted to use an adapter.

**""What about non-Tesla EVs with a built-in NACS port? Can they use all superchargers?""**

So far there is only one: the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5. Even with a built-in NACS port, it can only use newer superchargers (generation 3 or better). However, with this car, you do not have to block two stalls to use a short Supercharger cord, which is a big advantage.

**Other Notes**

To streamline this post, multi-chargepoint locations are listed with the number of chargepoints first.

For serious trip planning, I recommend PlugShare. But by all means check out these reported new locations and submit reviews on PlugShare, which makes things better for everyone.

If you'd like to know about new chargers along your routes right away, or just prefer not to check this list monthly when new openings are rare in your area, I've set up a free service that provides email notifications as soon as they open. You can [sign up at evpov.com](https://evpov.com/). Or not! I don't really have a business plan here, I built it to help EV owners like myself. PlugShare has a similar feature.

# [Godzilla (Singular Point)](https://godzilla.fandom.com/wiki/Godzilla_Singular_Point)

>|| || |《|\*""It"" decided that it must destroy this man, and since ""its"" destiny was to destroy this man, ""it"" decided that until ""it"" destroyed this man, ""it"" could not be destroyed.\*|》|

""It"" 《それ》 — A being referred to as ""It"" exists beyond conventional concepts of time and space, endlessly dreaming and perceiving. ""It"" dreams of the sea, the heavens, the earth, and the entirety of time including past, present, and future are all interwoven into a continuum of memories and iterations. For ""It,"" beginnings and endings are fluid and cyclical, yet these transitions hold no special significance as they are mere aspects of its infinite nature. Each repetition is unique, with even slight changes causing unpredictable outcomes in the dreams and memories that constitute its reality. In this existence, memory and reality blur into one another, defying all conventional understanding.

* Dreams ｢夢｣ — ""It"" exists in an infinite cycle of dreams, perpetually waking within dreams layered endlessly upon themselves. These dreams are inaccessible to anyone else, locked within ""its"" solitary reality. Through countless battles, ""it"" has been defeated, has triumphed, and has faced opponents both old and new, achieving ultimate victory yet continuing to fight eternally. ""It"" has transcended time, surpassing the bounds of past and future, even conquering eternity itself. Yet, paradoxically, the past and future remain ever-present, unshakable yet fleeting. What should be the future becomes the past in an instant, while the past seamlessly transforms into the future, weaving an eternal and fluid tapestry of existence.

* The source of the flow ｢流れの源｣  /  Tree structure ｢樹状構造｣ — ""It"" is a metaphor for an omnipotent and self-sustaining force that exists beyond the confines of individual universes. ""It"" is the central, primary force the ""main stream"" and everything around it, including various tributaries or branches, are part of its existence. These tributaries may challenge the main stream, sometimes seeing themselves as independent, yet they are ultimately dependent on the flow of ""it."" The ""surface of the water"" represents a boundary or limit that other beings may view as the edge of the universe, but for ""it,"" this boundary is meaningless. ""It"" moves freely through different universes, appearing and disappearing at will, continuously flowing and encompassing all things. The tree structure metaphor emphasizes the idea that all existence, whether as tributaries or branches, is an extension of ""it,"" and everything converges back to the main source.

* Constancy in destruction ｢執拗に破壊｣ - Symbolic manipulation (象徴操作) is the ultimate virtue and unparalleled power, enabling destruction of the most unforeseen and unimaginable kind. Its first target is itself (脈絡, context), severing the connections between episodes (エピソード, stories) and disrupting the scenario (シナリオ, narrative) in ways that position ""it"" at a disadvantage. This destruction extends even to the author's comments (解説, interpretations), obliterating any chance of a coherent or logical narrative taking shape. As ""it"" moves forward, it annihilates mercy, sorrow, human will, and the natural order itself. Everything that exists, or could exist, is subject to this inexorable power of destruction.

>Singularity/Singular Point

Singularity point ｢特異点シンギユラー・ポイント｣ — An opportunistic substrate, born of a dream, forms the foundation of existence. Singularities are not merely physical phenomena but superphysical constructs that simultaneously manifest as invisible ""points,"" ""lines,"" and ""rings"" in three-dimensional space. Fundamentally, they are branches, parts of a giant tree (幹), with ""it"" as the root.

From beyond this world's boundaries, ""something"" emerged and gave rise to a new creation around itself—supermatter (超物質), identified as an archetype. Singularities are the results of this external influence on the world. They are superdimensionally connected (超次元的につながっている) and possess an artificial nature, rendering them indestructible within the Universe. This attribute of singularities aligns with the property of space-time, akin to the concept in a sci-fi movie where characters cannot destroy the screen from within.

A singularity is, essentially, a hole (穴) projected from beyond the screen. The characters within the film lack the ability to seal this hole, as it originates from an existence outside their reality.

* A true paradox is a phenomenon ""born of the supernatural,"" an event so extraordinary that it parallels only the birth of the universe itself. Unlike ordinary paradoxes, which arise from an insufficient awareness of the world, a true paradox originates from beyond the boundaries of the ""world"" and manifests as a paradox of logical contradiction (論理矛盾パラドツクス). This situation mirrors observing an error in a computer simulation of the world from within the simulated world itself. The birth of singularities introduces paradoxical events—phenomena that defy the natural order. These singularities act like ""magic"" leaking from the processor, disrupting the simulated world's internal logic. As a result, the structure of the virtual world collapses, distorting the laws of nature, physics, and the universe, creating an existence that defies comprehension.

* Superphysical phenomena ｢超物理現象｣ — A singularity is the locus of forces tied to a spatial origin (空間肒起源), where profound distortions occur. These distortions are not mere local anomalies; they alter fundamental spatial and temporal properties. For instance, the sum of a triangle’s interior angles may differ from 180º, and a rubber ball could theoretically be turned inside out without breaking. Such effects extend beyond three-dimensional objects, influencing higher-dimensional entities as well. Temporal distortions around singularities form closed timelike curves (クローズド・タイムライク・カーブ) loops that connect space and time into a closed circuit. In essence, singularities function like time machines, capable of traveling into the future and returning to the starting point repeatedly. The results of these journeys overlap and intertwine until the loop fully closes. This creates a density-like effect akin to mathematical densities, where the distortions overlap in complex, recursive patterns. Despite their profound impact on space-time, these distortions are confined to the immediate vicinity of the singularity. Beyond about ten meters, gravitational anomalies vanish, and electromagnetic effects weaken to negligible levels. This containment gives singularities their paradoxical nature: they simultaneously ""violate the laws of physics"" and ""violate the very method of violation,"" concentrating unknown and extreme physical phenomena within an infinitesimally small region.



* The Other Side of Singularity ｢特異点の向こう側｣. • . The Sea of Information (情報の海) is the internal structure of the singularity, encompassing its essence and the foundation of its information. In this realm, time flows differently, with dozens of hours inside the Sea potentially equating to only a few seconds in the outside world. Traveling through time, whether to the past or future, becomes as simple as moving forward or backward in space. Within the Sea, countless bubbles of possibility are generated—each representing a fully realized simulation of reality, including the emergence of alternative timelines as they escalate. By tapping into these resources, one can discover everything that can possibly exist (存在しうるあらゆるものを発見し). The Sea of Information acts as a boundless reservoir of potential realities and possibilities, offering access to infinite variations of existence.

Archetype (アーキタイプ) is a molecule that, while impossible to synthesize, has always been known to exist. It is a strange substance, possessing extraordinary properties such as being superlight, superstrong, superplastic, superflexible, and superconducting. The archetype is a ""dream molecule"" that defies and distorts not just the laws of matter but the very fabric of reality itself. Its nature blurs the boundaries between material existence and the unknown.

Research has uncovered similarities between the archetype and the ""primordial soup"" that gave rise to life on early Earth, hinting at a connection to the origins of life. In fact, archetypes are not just three-dimensional superbiological particles, but possess a supramolecular structure that extends into higher dimensions. This multidimensional component gives archetypes their physical unusualness and the ""magical power"" they exert on primitive worlds.

Creating an archetype requires superdimensional manipulations, which in turn produce singularities. There are 13 phases that a molecule can adopt based on its ""tilt"" within multi-dimensional space, each phase altering its properties and influence on the universe.

* Red Dust ｢紅塵｣ — In the first phase, a red dust-like substance emerges, composed of archetypal raw material. This molecule, commonly reproduced by singularities, occasionally undergoes further transformation into a suprapolymer structure. The red dust exists in both ""active"" and ""inactive"" states, functioning as a carrier of energy, similar to how red blood cells carry oxygen. While these particles are small—about the size of volcanic ash—they possess low reactivity when in contact with biological tissue. However, they block and absorb light, radio waves, and electromagnetic signals, effectively paralyzing global communication networks. Over time, this causes a gradual descent into a new ice age, slowly destabilizing civilization.
* The Orthogonal Diagonalizer (OD) - represents the thirteenth phase of the archetype, known as amrita. It is a programmable molecule whose primary function is to transform the various archetypal phases into ordinary matter. The OD can be likened to a pair of low-dimensional tweezers (in the context of Chinese cuisine), capable of interacting with the multidimensional components of the archetypal molecule, controlling higher-dimensional beings, or adjusting the mechanical degrees of freedom within these systems. Due to its versatile functionality, the OD has the potential to be configured to oppose or counter singularities (対特異点). However, the necessary parameters to execute such a task are either non-existent or continuously destroyed by an external force, which disrupts any efforts to harness its full potential.

* Catalyst (触媒) - describes the mechanism known as Ice-nine (アイスナイン), a property of the Orthogonal Diagonalizer (OD) that enables it to split red dust (and potentially any other archetypal phase) without ever depleting itself. The operational mechanics of this process are as follows: Factory C (OD) is capable of converting Material A (archetype) into Product B (neutral matter). A key aspect of this system is its autocatalytic nature, where the ""factory"" reproduces itself, allowing the reaction to continue indefinitely without diminishing the OD's resources. When activated, the OD causes a sharp decrease in the concentration of red dust. In areas with significant accumulation, reddish glows emerge as a reaction to the transition of the red dust into massive spikes. These spikes rapidly grow upon contact with the transformed element, and in an instant, all archetypal molecules turn into monstrous red spears, randomly piercing everything in their path. This effect reflects the chaotic and destructive nature of the catalyst’s power, with the red spears acting as an uncontrolled force of destruction.Tiger, oh tiger! Bloody flash,TYGER TYGER, BURNING BRIGHT,

>A quick gleam in the midnight valleys, IN THE FORESTS OF THE NIGHT;

>A terrifying presence, WHAT IS IMMORTAL HAND OR EYE,

>Who dared to create you, COULD FRAME THY FEARFUL SYMMETRY ?

* New Symmetry ｢New Symmetry｣ - The existence of archetypes is made possible by high-dimensional distortion, which maintains their three-dimensional structure. These molecules distort the symmetry of space-time, bending and twisting it at specific points to sustain their form. This results in a ""linking of spaces"" across different dimensions, where it seems as though a singular, unified Universe never truly existed. The distortion creates a fracturing effect that allows for a paradoxical expression, represented as ""６＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝９"", which symbolizes the blending or transformation of dimensions in a way that defies conventional understanding. This expression marks a convergence of different realities, made possible by the high-dimensional manipulations of the archetype.
* Ashihara-Kamino refraction (葦原カスケード) or Ashihara cascade - is a supertime phenomenon that operates similarly to the theoretical chemical compound thiotimoline, which exhibits the property of ""sorption in the past."" This means the substance anticipates contact and starts reacting with it before actual contact occurs. If the substance is intercepted before contact, it will ""accidentally"" but inevitably collide with it in a different direction. The archetype, which is also distorted in the non-spatial dimension, refracts electromagnetic waves, particularly light. For instance, when a laser beam is directed at the archetype, there is a low probability that light will be emitted from the archetype even before the laser beam hits it. This behavior mirrors the properties of thiotimoline, whose unusual characteristics are linked to the possibility of superluminal travel, or traveling faster than the speed of light. The refractive properties of the archetype essentially allow for time-anticipated reactions and could enable phenomena such as superluminal travel, bypassing traditional limitations of space-time.
* The paragraph explains a supertemporal refraction phenomenon, comparing normal refraction (a) with one caused by an archetype (b). It introduces the concept of retrograde time, where light is emitted from the opposite side of a medium before the photon reaches it. A dotted line in the diagram symbolizes a virtual anti-photon, which establishes a cause-and-effect relationship between the incident and emitted light, ensuring that the law of conservation of energy remains intact.
* The interaction between a photon and a virtual anti-photon, emphasizing that photons are indistinguishable quantum objects. This property allows emitted light to be reintroduced into the medium, enabling the anticipation of future photons. For example, a photon from one hour in the future can refract to the present, creating a sequence where emitted photons incrementally move into the past. This leads to the accumulation of future light in the present, where energy is extracted externally while ""negative energy"" builds up inside the medium. The process continues until the environment can no longer contain this energy buildup.
* Transtemporal Computation (TTC) leverages the bizarre space-time structure of a singularity and the phenomenon of retrograde time, offering computational power far beyond quantum systems. It renders encryption meaningless and enables the synthesis of unreal substances like archetypes. TTC operates at infinite speed, completing tasks before they begin. While it adheres to computational principles, it can potentially access undefined regions of the universe and hyperspace, functioning as a ""computational eden"" with limitless resources.

* Incubation vessel ｢孵化させるための器｣ — Any singularity is likened to an ""egg"" for ""it"", a point from which ""it"" can ""hatch"" in a specific Universe. The singularity acts as a vessel for emergence, marking the beginning of a new reality or a new phase in existence. The future determines the present, and the mere presence of such a point in time shortens the distance between moments. This creates an intricate connection between time, where the singularity condenses the flow of events, blurring the boundaries between the unfolding narrative. This concept mirrors the 19th century story, where the present is influenced by the future, constantly moving toward a sudden end an impending disaster or turning point. The singularity encapsulates this tension between the inevitable unfolding of events and the abrupt collapse of reality, a point where time becomes compressed and the direction of existence becomes uncertain.

* Shell ｢殻｣ —A singularity forms an archetypal shell around itself, functioning as an anchor (錨) that secures it within the world. If this shell is destroyed, the singularity will ""return home,"" effectively disappearing from the current universe.
* Bones with Will ｢意志ある骨｣ - The material skeleton of ""it"" resembles the bones of giant carnivorous dinosaurs, remnants left in the world after the 1954 incident, during which ""it"" burned itself with its own fuel. By doing so, ""it"" deprived itself of access to this universe, leaving behind a dream shell as a farewell. This shell symbolizes the potential for ""it"" to change form and eventually return. These ""bones"" are akin to a special archetype, representing the first singularity that persists even after ""it"" has lost all direct connection to the Universe. This marks the beginning—a ""magic lamp"" enabling the impossible.

>「ALAPU UPALA」

* The song ｢歌｣ - is an electromagnetic pattern originating from singularities, which manifests as ""ALAPU UPALA,"" an ancient Indian folk lullaby, when analyzed through radio waves. This seemingly unnatural sequence of sounds is believed to have emerged from another dimension, serving as a critical element of history. Despite the singularity's nature, enabling hypertime access and hyperspace deformation, the ""transmission of past songs"" might appear insignificant. However, it was actually a signal with a unique grammatical structure aligned with the world where the song first existed. The song's ""words"" rejected conventional notions of time—past, present, or future—and instead formed a narrative perspective from the story's conclusion. From its inception, ""it"" had been singing about its eventual demise, though the undereducated actors in the unfolding events failed to grasp this. They continued their roles, leading to the grand finale, where the orthogonal diagonalizer parameters encoded within the song were deciphered, allowing ""it"" to be defeated. While this concluded a particular story, it was not the end—merely one among countless possible narratives.

* Commands ｢命じる｣ — the song partially embodies the will of ""it,"" serving as a mechanism to compel beings created by ""it"" to act in alignment with ""its"" intentions. These beings, however, do not perceive the song as an external force; instead, they experience it as their own personal desires. The song originates from ""its"" home, the place of ""its"" birth, and represents more than just sensory input. It is also a narrative celebrating ""its"" accomplishments, projecting its future actions and form. For ""it,"" the song serves as both a blueprint and a guiding principle, leaving no alternative but to follow its melody.

>Monsters and Ecosystem

Branching ｢枝分かれ｣ ╱ Parts ｢一部｣ - Where “it” made contact with the water’s surface, cracks began to form across a certain world, through which a multitude of creatures emerged. These beings took shape and formed new ""molecules,"" growing like moss from the cracks or like an inflating bubble. The traces of ""it"" were left behind, surrounded by seawater, while the power seeping from these cracks twisted and grew into red dust crystals, extending both into the future and the past to shape themselves. These new life forms began to appear around ""it,"" initially dependent on ""it"" for survival, but eventually becoming self-sustaining. The process of creation moved without hesitation, trial, or error. These beings grew to resemble various sea creatures seaweed, starfish, sea urchins, jellyfish, fishbut each was distinct in its own way. Among them, forms like sea lilies, nautiluses, coelenterates, crayfish, and horseshoe crabs emerged, retaining certain resemblances to ancient species, with some even closely resembling trilobites and ammonites.

* Changes ｢変化｣ — “it” read the traces of the materials it interacted with, their genetic information and expression mechanisms, and then returned to the past, paved the way for the future and ""lost"" it there over and over again, as if in a dream. It was as if the history of this world were unfolding anew, from the very beginning, but the flow had been torn apart and re-edited, and the scene was not unfolding in the order in which it had actually happened. The beings born around “it” changed their appearances, as if time were rapidly turning back. These changes ignored the evolutionary annals, but still strangely followed the path of increasing size, intertwining with the original history, interpolating it haphazardly, with steps leading into the past and the future. They were only parts of “it”, parts of the source of the flow that had divided into flows. “It” could be called a kind of “chained paradise”, a lost beginning.

* Information Network ｢Telecommunication Network｣ —  a centralized network or grid, which is tied to ""it"" and its essence, marking a pivotal node within the larger structure. This network is intricately connected to the Universe, including Earth, and is embedded within an abstract space of light. The network expands into various dimensions, marking ""his"" territorial reach across infinite possibilities. It implies that ""it"" can look down upon all creation, observing a vast ocean of infinite possibilities and realities, thus controlling or perceiving everything within its domain.
* Collective perception of information ｢知覚情報を共有｣ — the network serves as a conduit for communication among all the beings created by ""it."" These beings can transform and evolve, constantly rewriting themselves without the need for generational changes. The distinction between individual and collective identity disappears, as they exist as part of a unified whole. They possess unprecedented power, far beyond anything historically conceived, and their potential is so vast that even they cannot fully comprehend the extent of it.

Monsters ╱ Kaiju ｢怪獣｣ are new life forms that emerge through the grafting of archetypal molecules onto existing organisms. These creatures are not abstract ideas created by ""it"" through the network but are tangible, living beings. By manipulating red dust, which was once a mere concept, ""it"" brings these monsters into reality. They exist as hybrids, a new class of being formed through rapid evolutionary changes in archetypal molecules, and their existence bends the laws of nature. These creatures disrupt the very fabric of reality and even alter history. In a broader sense, the monsters serve as eyes for ""it,"" allowing ""it"" to observe and gather information about the world before achieving physical form.

* Fuel ｢燃料｣. • . Organ ｢器官｣\[?\] — Red dust is the core element driving the monsters' existence and activities. It serves as both the ""energy"" that powers them and the central element around which their primary mission revolves—the spread of red dust across the planet. To facilitate this, each monster has specialized organs that enable them to accumulate and expel red dust from their bodies. This process not only prolongs their lifespan but also expands their influence, enabling them to exert greater control over their surroundings and continue their propagation of red dust.

Monster Ecosystem ｢怪獣の生態系｣ — Monsters remain valuable to ""it"" even after their death, as their decomposing bodies release red dust—a product formed during the breakdown of their cells, likely a phase of the archetypal process. As the monsters function, their bodies gradually crumble, converting into energy and releasing unused power. Over time, some monsters are replaced by others, and their remains become archetypes, leaving behind only a vast amount of red dust. This red dust doesn't just disappear; it reshapes the ecosystem to suit the needs of the monsters.

The red dust spreads across the planet, blocking sunlight, radio waves, and creating a reflective layer that alters the environment. The days shorten, temperatures drop, and many cities begin to resemble otherworldly landscapes, submerged in layers of red dust. This marks the slow but steady transfer of control over the Earth to a new form of life, the archetypal ecosystem, which is far more advanced than carbon and silicon-based life forms. Eventually, a comprehensive transformation of nature becomes inevitable.

The monsters' unique ecosystem influences all levels of matter and information. From a hyperspatial perspective, ""it"" extends its influence, branching out in all directions, creating contact points across the planet. This leads to the birth of new creatures and the alteration of the landscape to support them. Rivers fill and reshape, products of past civilizations are pushed aside, and new forms of vegetation grow rapidly, displacing older ones. The Earth itself rises and transforms to accommodate the movement and survival of the monsters.

* Insectoid monsters｢虫型の怪獣｣ — A separate class of monsters exists, distinct from their larger counterparts. These creatures feed on ordinary molecular groups, such as plants, trees, and animals. However, their food preferences defy logic, as they can also consume materials like concrete, plastic, and other polymers. These insectoid monsters feed on common substances, altering their bodies as they do so, and upon death, they decompose into red dust, which forms the foundation of their own ecosystem. Their reproduction follows a unique process of ""splitting,"" where a full-grown relative can emerge from individual parts of their body. This process allows for both wound healing and reproduction to occur simultaneously, with their development happening on the same level. These smaller monsters maintain a close connection to the red dust and archetypal material that underpins their existence, contributing to the perpetuation and evolution of their ecosystem.

* ""These"" - As ""it"" began its journey in the new world, ""these"" entities, representing fundamental structural elements, had to evolve alongside it. ""These"" functioned like letters in speech — they were not concerned with how they were expressed, but they needed to form a coherent structure that held meaning. They laid the foundation for the monsters' self-sufficiency, allowing them to exist without relying on existing life forms. Instead of building hybrid organisms by adding archetypal metabolic systems on top of conventional DNA-based ones, ""these"" created a completely different organism with its own system of information storage, rejecting DNA altogether. The system of chemical bonds created by ""these"" surpassed DNA in stability and error correction, allowing for flexible rewriting and information exchange. This system was more effective in finding adaptive paths for survival. ""These"" became like cells, disconnected from their original ""sound"" or function, and they acted according to their own internal logic. They consumed the existing soil, absorbed water, mixed it with archetypal material, and transformed it into a form that served their needs, further expanding their influence and solidifying their place in the ecosystem.

* Cells ｢細胞｣ — ""These"" entities, though small like individual cells, formed part of a vast organism connected in a chain. They were akin to a membrane enveloping the Earth, not in a linear fashion but as an intricate mesh. From the perspective of the existing ecosystem, they appeared as a disruptive, ""crackling"" force. Initially, they existed as a unified organism but gradually sought their individual identities, searching for the necessary elements to create a new form of life. Rather than seeking a suitable universe to inhabit, ""these"" had the power to reshape the universe to fit their needs. This process resembled a primeval fairy tale where a creature crafts a molecule capable of creating itself, an imaginary concept beginning to influence the real world. ""These"" were born from themselves as cells that enabled their own existence. They created small cracks in the microcosm, from which they divided and multiplied, ultimately transforming the universe's fabric and flipping its nature. These molecules expanded into multiple dimensions, drawing the realms of imagination closer to reality. This shift marked the point where reality could no longer hold its place, as the boundaries of imagination took over.

* The New Monster World ｢新たな怪獣界｣ — ""These"" entities gradually spread across the Earth, infiltrating soil, asphalt, and concrete. They destroyed buildings, replacing the material with red dust and generating various archetypes from it. Through this process, ""these"" dug up the earth, altered river courses, and reshaped mountains, ultimately transforming the planet's very form. At first, they appeared on a microscopic level, like bacteria breaking down the bodies of monsters. They evolved into fungi creeping along the ground, then into recognizable plants and flowers. As they invaded the mineral and animal worlds, they restructured the plant world at the molecular level. This marked the creation of a new ecosystem, which could now be understood as the ""monster world,"" born from the reworking of existing life and matter.

How I reached 1M networth through CRYPTO,phinvest,1i3vsbx,2025-01-17 19:59:45,0,0.33,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/1i3vsbx/how_i_reached_1m_networth_through_crypto/,r_nb,Cryptocurrency,"2017 nung first time ko bumili ng BTC. Nahikayat ng officemate bumili sa [coins.ph](http://coins.ph) kasi daily daw lumalaki value ng pera nya. During this time, wala pa ako idea how it works kahit yung concept ng supply and demand. Basta alam ko lumalaki and lumiliit yung value. Natuto din ako mag Binance and started buying other coins. Ito yung time na yung Binance app is wala pa sa playstore/appstore and parang frequently nag eexpire yung certificate nya so need mo lagi ireinstall using yung download link. So in my mind, parang naiisip ko na illegal ba to? So di ko masyado nagpay attention. Then one day, nagdump yung market and I sold all of my coins. Wala pang P2P nung time na to and via [Coins.ph](http://Coins.ph) pa lang yung cashout. Less than 50k lang nainvest ko in total so di ko masyado inisip and just moved on with my life.

Next exposure ko sa crypto is Axie (2021, 4 years later). May extra money so bumuli ng axie. Ito yung first exposure ko sa spot trading by buying/selling axs and slp. Nung nawala na yung hype ng axie and sobrang mura ng mga axies I got lucky na yung iba kong axies ay useful pa din sa V3 nung game nila. And I was able to sell some for 5 digits. In the end naging profitable naman ako sa axie.

Pumasok din ako sa Pegaxy (another nft game like Axie), and dito ako nalugi. Late na ako ng pasok tapos di pa nag TP. Then SOL NFTs trading naman sa Magic Eden. Nagprofit, then nalugi din (di ulit nag TP on time). Yung mga biggest holdings ko nag-rugpull, around 50k din yung loss. Around 100k profit sana nung peak ng NFTs.

Ito naman yung first exposure ko sa leveraged trading. Ma profitable days pero mostly loss. I do scalping with high leverage. This did not work for me. Sobrang stressful and lagi ako nakatingin sa charts. During my first liquidation event I lost 600$. Grabe nanlambot yung tuhod ko. Literal na napaupo ako nung nakita kong nagdump yung chart haha

Wala along stable work nito. I do a little bit of buy and sell and freelance work pero hindi enough. There was a time na we're down to my last 20k.

Then the Luna crash and FTX fiasco happened. The whole market dumped and that's when I stopped. During this time may work ako na okay naman yung pay so grind ulit sa work. Di na ako nag actively invest ulit pero lagi ako sumisilip sa market. Umabot ng 15$ si SOL pero di ako bumili. Now it's 219$.

During the end of 2023, meron akong nakitang post about as airdrop ng PYTH (this is a solana coin). I never imagined na eligible ako pero triny ko pa rin check. To my surprise, meron along around 4000 coins na allocation. How and why? Because of my solana NFT trading. I sold my allocation for 35k but if I sold it at peak 100k sana. During this time, nagreversal na yung market and I decided to trade again. Tapos sunod sunod na rin yung natanggap ko na airdrops.

This past year I received airdrops from $JUP, $KMNO, $DRIFT, $WEN, $CLOUD, $ME, $GRASS, $PENGU. All in all, siguro around 250k PHP lahat lahat. All of this is because I use their platforms and solana

Around August last year ako nagseryoso sa futures trading. I used the money I received from airdrops. I studied more about trading and found the strategy that worked for me. This time hindi na ako nagscalping. Instead, I do swing trading relying on HTF key levels/reversals. Less stressful and di ako masyado nagspspend ng maraming time trading. I just check the charts from time to time. October, November and December are my most profitable months that allowed me to reach 1M net worth.

So that's almost 7 years in crypto before I could say na profitable ako. I am now confident in my skills/knowledge about crypto and hopefully masustain ko in the coming years."

"I have witchy uplifting video game recommendations: no shooting, no fighting, no being chased",WitchesVsPatriarchy,1i3m64s,2025-01-17 12:48:41,596,0.97,223,https://www.reddit.com/r/WitchesVsPatriarchy/comments/1i3m64s/i_have_witchy_uplifting_video_game/,bijhan,🇵🇸 🕊️ Media Magic,"I've been playing video games my whole life so I'm very comfortable with a wide range of action games, like shooters and fighters and racing games. My husband, however, had never played video games growing up, and found a lot of action games very stressful. The constant movement, no time to think, and scenarios where your character ends up dead made them very unhappy.

Thinking about that, I tried out some turn-based strategy games with them, that play like very sophisticated board games. This was much more exciting for them, and they actually bought their own handheld console to play these kinds of games.

One day I was watching a YouTube show where the hosts play video games and tell jokes about the experience. It was a point-and-click adventure game about a woman trying to save her family from a magical bear using spells, potions, and godess icons. My husband saw this, and asked me to look up what the game was. It was called Grim Legends, and it was made by the company Artifex Mundi. My husband got it for their handheld console, and played through it in a few days. They LOVED it. They wanted more, so I looked up a list of games published by the same company. They were all in the same vein: lots of story-based puzzles, beautiful hand-painted artwork, no fighting of any kind, no running away from villains, and no timers so you can take your time thinking through each puzzle.

Now, Artifex Mundi is my husband's favorite game developer. Their games are usually $15, but they often go on sale for just $1.99. We've bought many, and they've provided months worth of entertainment.

The most common theme for these games is fantasy, and the protagonist is almost always a woman. The fantasy games often involve making potions, casting spells, summoning powerful creatures, and discovering the truth behind an ancient myth.

There are also some crime themed ones, without supernatural elements. I'm very happy to say you never play as a police officer, but usually as a private detective or some kind of other first responder.

Less common but still present are a few haunting-themed ones, about putting to rest an upset spirit. These are different from the fantasy ones in that they are set in a world very much like our own.

And some are incomparable and unique! One is about a work dominated by airships and steampunk technology (Skyland), another about an underwater civilization (Abyss: the Wraiths of Eden).

These games ARE available for free on mobile, but I do not recommend this experience. They have ads, and micro-transactions. I recommend the PC or console ports, especially the Nintendo Switch. With this you pay a single price up front and get 100% unfettered access to the whole game AND expansion content (additional chapters released after the game).

Here are my husbands favorite games. If there's more than one entry in the series, I'll give the series name.

1. Grim Legends \[fantasy\] (series) Features the most beautiful animation, lots of uplifting witchy themes, and has amazing puzzle progression

2. Enegmatis \[haunting\] (series) Very emotional search through generational trauma, lots of feelings in this series

3. The Secret Order \[fantasy\] (series) A traditional dragons and kings kind of fantast world, but with a conflict resolved through cunning and insight, not might and brutality

4. Dreamwalker: Never Fall Asleep \[haunting?\] Not really about a ghost, but a person who can walk into others' dreams, and must help a comatose girl grapple with her trauma

5. Family Mysteries \[crime\] (series) Extremely grounded compared to the others, containing no supernatural elements, but instead focusing on realistic drama between family members, and the depraved lengths they'll go to in order to exact revenge.

  
If you're looking for a new way to play without elevating your heartrate, I hope these recommendations work for you!"

My heart was the heart of a mage!  
My soul was the soul of a mage!

It felt like Lucifer whispering temptation in my ear.  
It felt like looking at the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden.

The purity, passion, brilliance, pride, beauty, and radiance of magic I once pursued…

After experiencing the buffs and healing spells from the Feyspeaker/Cleric’s Animal Domain…

"[Very Long] Towers, Lighthouses, Inare, and the Belt of Beloth the Wise",Eragon,1i369xo,2025-01-16 21:33:07,90,0.98,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/comments/1i369xo/very_long_towers_lighthouses_inare_and_the_belt/,eagle2120,Theory,"This is a collaborative theory between myself, u/notainsleym, and u/cptn-40. They contributed just as much (and probably more) as me to this, so they deserve their full flowers. 

I am really excited about this one because we have, I think, discovered a lot of the background behind the Belt of Beloth the Wise and the mysterious brass sockets - let's dive in. 

So, the first thing I want to cover are the ""towers"" in and around Alagaesia. 

There are several references to towers throughout Alagaesia: 

Ristvak baen/Edoc'Sil: 

Edur Naroch: 

Edur Ithindra: 

Now, on the face of it, I did not think anything of it. It doesn't seem like there are anything particuarly special about them... but then a few different hints started cluing me in on their increased importance below the surface level: 

In this letter letter to a fan, he mentions: 

> Dark towers containing dark travelers will answer no questions. 

Dark towers. Plural. Dark travelers. Plural. So... we don't really know what this is in reference to, but there are both multiple travelers and multiple towers. Hmm. 


But.. what really got me thinking deeper was [this recent Twitter post by Christoper](https://x.com/paolini/status/1872340781715034162):

>  Anyone spot the tower higher up on Mt. Arngor? ... Wonder why it's there. :D

Where he alludes to a mysterious purpose for the tower (and why it would be so high up in the air...)

So, I started digging on the towers, and naturally first came to Ristvak'Baen (formerly known as Edoc'Sil) on Utgard. 

> An outpost of the Riders - one that has lasted since their founding. That was where Vrael took refuge and where, through treachery, he was found and defeated by Galbatorix... After Vrael's death, the commoners called it Utgard, but it had another name, Ristvak'baen - the Place of Sorrow"" (Therinsford, Eragon). 

Note... ""has lasted since their founding"". That's odd. The Riders were founded in 5303 AC...


> With our help, Palancar was usurped and banished, but he, his family, and their vasals refused to leave the valley. Since we had no wish to murder them, w constructed the tower of Ristvak'baen so the Riders could watch over Palancar"" (Arrow to the Heart, Eldest). 

And we know Palancar didn't arrive until  7203. Nearly two-thousand years later. It's not like a difference of like, twenty or even a hundred years that could be handwaved as ""close to their founding"" rather than AT their founding. Its 2000 YEARS difference. That's not an accident or a coincidence. Something is off here about this tower. Something we're not being told. 

Because, either: 

1) Brom is wrong/lying, and the tower was founded nearly TWO THOUSAND years later than he said (which I highly doubt, consdiering he had a Rider's education, and who would know better than them)

2) The Elves are wrong/lying, or something is messing with their memory that obfuscates the purpose of the tower. 

Because a 2000 year gap in timeline can't be explained away. If Brom is right (and I think he is), the tower existed BEFORE the humans came over to Alagaesia. 2000 years before. 

So, it wasn't ""created"" by the Riders at the time of Palancar... There's something deeper here. 

And, Christopher also hints at something deeper about the tower [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/comments/1hwm5v6/questions_and_answers_from_christopher_paolinis/): 

> Q: Does the Ristvak'baen tower have a hidden purpose?

> A: Its purpose is as stated. Whether or not there's more to that purpose ... well, you'll have to read on!

So... what's so special about the tower? What do we know about it first hand? 

From Murtagh: 

> ""A circle of twelve brass sockets lay embedded within the stones in the center of the yard. The sockets were each the size of a fist and as eyeless and empty as a skull... What they had once held, Murtagh could not guess"" (Exile, Murtagh). 

We also know a good bit about them from the AMA's - and from that, I believe we can [divine their true purpose](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/comments/1019ns7/comment/j2n6tny/): 

> The real question is ... how did Vrael get from Vroengard to Ristvak'baen without a dragon? Hmm? Answer that, and you'll have a key plot point from an upcoming novel (one centered around Angela). 😄

Hmm. The obvious answer here is ""teleportation"". That also lines up with what we know about Angela (and what would play into a [novel about her background](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/comments/8fpwfo/comment/dy5keaz/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3): 

> Q: Can you give us any new tidbits about Angela?

> A: Angela is of the opinion that distances in Alagaësia vary according to the urgency of your trip.

Which also lines up with the teleportation clue. 

So... [what do we know](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/12yqxp2/comment/jhovyer/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) about her teleportation? 

> Was the portal Angela opens in FWW an actual Torque Gate? And if so is there anything about this that you can elaborate on?

> Yes, it's a torque gate, although generated in a non-standard way.

A torque gate is a [concept in the Fractalverse](https://fractalverse.net/explore-the-universe/ftl-travel/): 

> A Torque Gate: An artificial wormhole generated and sustained by a torque engine stationed at either mouth. Used by the Old Ones for near-instantaneous travel over vast distances.



Which connects back to the [tower on Utgard](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/comments/184f4wc/comment/kav5w1l/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3): 

> Q: Is the ring of brass sockets at Ristvak'baen a torque gate (or the equivalent)?

> A: Not a torque gate as-such, but you're in the ballpark. Think back to the ring of amethyst in Inheritance

So - I take the ""in the ballpark"" to mean that it's teleportation, but it's not the same *type* of teleportation. Which is supported by another comment from Christopher [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/comments/mwyi2h/comment/gvkvk4c/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3): 

> Q: I once asked you during a TSIASOS signing streaming if the teleport spell would work over lightyears, you said no because the power would be too great, however in Brisingr it was described that it matters not the distance but the mass of the object which you wish to send. So can you clarify if possible which is true? Does it not matter the distance but instead the mass?

> A: Great question. The discrepancy comes from the fact that I think about the physics of the Fractalverse and the physics of Alagaësia a bit differently. If one were in the Fractalverse and attempting to use that particular spell, then teleporting light years would be impossible. (Not to say a different spell couldn't work.) However, yes, in Alagaësia, the teleport spell basically renders distances irrelevant via tesseracting space, which means that the mass of the object being transported becomes the limiting factor.

So there are different underlying mechanics (such as the scale of distance), but it is still teleporting, effectively. 

Whew. 

Let's take a breath here before we move on. 

-----

Alright - Let's think through this. IF those brass sockets relate to teleportation... then it would also follow that there are OTHER teleportation sites across Alagaesia. This is supported by the things we referenced earlier - the tower on Mt. Arngor, the ""Dark TowerS"" (plural), etc. 

And.. it's supported by some of the material in FWW. Namely, the library: 

> Time was limited. The library could Shift at any moment.... The inner door of the library only coincided with the outer door at particular moments... Overstaying the window of time that the library and the tower were connected""

The library and the tower. Tower, again. 

Tenga is theorized to be the Keeper of the Tower (given Angela's apprenticeship to him, and numerous references to him). 

And... we know Tenga resides in Edur Ithindra, one of the old abandoned Elven towers: 

> Did the elves build this tower...  Aye. The tricky elves built Edur Ithindra"" (Escape and Evasion, Brisingr). 

While we're on Tenga, one quick tangent here I noticed while grabbing the quote for this passage: 

> ""I search for the answer!... A key to an unpoened door"" (Escape and Evasion, Brisingr). 

An unopened door. Compare that to what we know about werecats (from the letter): 

> Q: 3. ""When they “faded,” did the Grey Folk Transition to Superluminal space? Is Angela able to open Torque Gates due to her connection with Solembum? Or is it purely an Angela thing""

> A: Other realms, other races, other spaces. The Grey Folk vanished as did the forebearers of their primogenitor. Last-born, long-dead, steward and nursemaid to an Eden new-formed. Cats meow at the threshold, waiting, waiting ... why won't you open the door?!

*Cats meow at the threshold, waiting, waiting ... why won't you open the door*

and 

> ""Angela likes to be where interesting things are happening, and cats like to walk through doors""

And, from Murtagh: 

> ""We are werecats... We are the ones who walk through doors, always and ever."" (Question for a Cat, Murtagh). 


(Were)Cats like to walk through doors... Cat's meowing why won't you open the door... Question was about superluminal space... We know there's a lot of energy in superluminal space... Tenga trying to solve a huge problem about energy... Do you see what I'm getting at here? 

I think this ""metaphorical"" door that Tenga is trying to find the key for, is ALSO the same door that is ""locked"" as referenced by the letter. 

And lastly - compare that to a poem from Arya: 

> ""The trickster, the Riddler, the keeper of balance, he of many faces who finds life in death and who fears no evil; he who walks through doors"" (Shadows of the Past, Brisingr). 

Trickster... Riddler KEEPER... he who walks through doors... a key to an unopened door... I think this is a hint about Tenga. 

Anyways, we're getting sidetracked, let's get back on track with the towers. 

So, we postulated that Tenga's tower was ALSO a potential source of ""teleportation""... which, to me, means that there's an ADDITIONAL purpose behind these towers - as a teleportation network. This would address the question of the towers being so high up, and also connect the dots between the brass sockets and Vrael's teleportation, and is also another potential answer to the weirdness around the timeline for Ristvak'baen. 

These towers are a teleportation network. Powered by, or enabled by the brass sockets (which likely contain gemstones). 

Let's touch back on Tenga's tower, specifically. 

u/notainsleym was the first to connect the tower to the concept of a lighthouse, or a beacon (in her [interview with Christopher](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/comments/1hacb27/interview_with_christopher_paolini_inuniverse/) ): 

> A: They go to the beach, and the Keeper of the Tower, which would be a lighthouse.  

> C: One could even call a lighthouse a beacon.  

> A: Yes, I’ve seen that you’ve said that before.  

> C: But I will say that the Great Beacon is not the lighthouse in a sense.

A beacon... A Lighthouse... Hmm. 

Initially I interpreted a beacon as a device that draws attention to a location, but I think it fits in better with the second definition: 

A signal that guides or warns people. 

We know these towers are connected to teleportation... But we also know there are dangers associated with teleportation: 

> I did not yet have the skill to perform the obscure computations required to predict the times of safe passage"" 

Implying there are times of unsafe passage... Which connects to what was said to during Ainsley's interview here: 

> At the Grand Rapides stop, you told somebody in line that corner hounds are related to the straightness of right angles.  

> I knew it was going to get back to you. I don’t have corner hounds, per say. I am not in the Cthulhu mythology, but you may take that as a directional hint for what’s going on.

The directional hint here, I think, refers to some kind of creature that hunts after time travelers. Per Wikipedia: 

> ""The main character experimenting in time travel with the help of psychedelic drugs and esoteric artifacts, the Hounds are said to inhabit the angles of time... A person risks attracting their attention by traveling through time""

Which also connects to something that was said during my interview with Christopher [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/comments/1hb7atm/interview_with_christopher_paolini_world_of/): 

> I've already given the hint that the great beacon is a prison. What would be imprisoning? Does that mean there are living creatures in superluminal space? A) How might they feel about spaceships popping in and out of their reality? B) Power being drained out of their space? And C) You may ponder the meaning of the phrase torque bomb

I think the ""danger"" here are these living creatures in superluminal space. The same creature for which Chris gave the directional hint for - THAT is why there are times of unsafe passage. 

AND THAT is why we need the towers, the lighthouses, the beacons in the first place. They not only help facilitate the transportation (likely through energy stored in the gems within the sockets), but they act as a warning system to prevent travelers from dangers of ""tesseracting space"", as Christopher would call it in Alagaesia, by attracting the attention of these mysterious beings. 

Which gets to my next point - Inare. 

Jeod refers to it in his letter [here](https://www.paolini.net/2015/07/09/deluxe-letter-from-jeod/): 

> Could she [Angela] be one of the Grey Folk? Could she be part werecat (for they do seem unusually partial to her)? Or is she something else entirely? Is she perhaps more akin to the “Inarë,” assuming that what Eragon saw was real and they actually exist? 

And we know, per To Sleep, that Angela introduces herself as Inare, likely confirming her identity. 

But... what IS Inare? 

I've speculated that the meaning behind the word comes from the Latin translation of the word: One who swims between/through. 

This was recently confirmed [in the recent AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/comments/1hwm5v6/questions_and_answers_from_christopher_paolinis/): 

> Q: Is Inarë a “state” or “level” of being that could apply to any race, or is it a race itself, or is it exclusive to certain races?

> A: Inarë is a type of being.

The type of being who can float between the two realms. And also: 

> Q: Does the name for the Inarë come from the Latin inare, meaning 'to swim or float'?

> A: Yes.

We know that spacetime is fluidic in nature in the Fractalverse, so the phrase Inare likely refers to someone who CAN swim between subluminal, and superluminal space - likely through teleportation (more likely the ""light years"" style of teleportation, rather than the Alagaesian style, but it's splitting hares at this point). 

If this is true - It ALSO likely means Tenga is Inare (especially considering he is the one who created the ""bubble"" spell that Eragon uses in Inheritance): 

> Q: When Eragon and Saphira leave the Vault of Souls, the Eldunari hide themselves in a pocket of space. They say the trick was developed by a hermit who lived on the northern coast of Alagaësia twelve hundred years ago. Was this Tenga?

> A: Yup, that was him.


Alright - Now for the last crazy theorycrafting bit. Here is the time to take a break if you need to, because the last stretch is quite the ride: 

How does this connect back to the Belt of Beloth the Wise? 

I also believe there is more to the Belt of Beloth the wise than what is being portrayed: 

> ""This is the belt of Beloth the Wise - whom you read about in your history of the Year of Darkness - and is one of the greatest treasures of the Riders. These are the most perfect gems the Riders could find... ""The stones have no magic of their own, but you may use them as repositories for your power and draw upon that reserve when in need"" (Gifts, Eldest). 

Hmm. That's a bit odd. Out of ALL the treasures of the Riders, one of their greatest is just... gems? Just a collection of pure gems with no magic of their own? 

I don't buy that. I think there's something more here; especially considering the fact it has ANOTHER name: 

> You would not know the name of its maker, wise one, but during your travels, you must surely have heard tell of the belt of the twelve stars... The herbalist's eyes widened, 'THAT belt?! But i thought it was lost over four centuries ago"" (Infidels on the Loose, Inheritance). 

Let's think about this for a second. Angela, who has traveled FAR and WIDE, seen INSANE things, would not be that impressed by a belt that's just... pure gemstones. 

I don't buy that for a second. 

Also - note that Arya cuts her off before she can reveal any other information about the belt: 

> ""But I thought it was lost over four centuries ago, destroyed during the--' 'We recovered it', said Arya flatly"" (Infidels on the Loose, Inheritance). 

Does anyone else find that odd? It's one of the Rider's GREATEST treasures, so much so that it impresses ANGELA of all people... yet it just... 12 gemstones? 

Nah. Doesn't pass the smell test for me. 

So, let's think theorize about it's purpose here based on what we know. 

The belt of the twelve stars... forged in the year of darkness... The pieces are starting to add up. 

It's real purpose...? 

Well, how many brass sockets were there again? 

Twelve. 

And how many gemstones are in the Belt of Beloth the Wise? 

Twelve. 

So bunching those two ideas together... with what we have theorizing about the PURPOSE of those sockets... 

What if the Belt of Beloth the wise is a device that is, effectively, a mobile teleportation unit? That it helps facilitate teleportation, and/or hides the wearer from the dangerous creatures while teleporting? 

It would fit with the number sockets (which presumably contain gemstones). 

It would fit with the concept of storing MASSIVE amounts of energy in the belt itself. 

And... It also fits in with the precious little we know about the ""year of darkness""

There's something weird about the Year of Darkness - It's only mentioned once, and only the Elves have a reference for it in their history (as far as we know)... So, I don't think it's anything as extreme as the sun ""going out"" or anything like that... I think it connects back to the purpose of the belt itself (and the teleportation).. 

Remember how Christopher compared the towers to lighthouses? 

What if... the ""year of darkness"" actually refers to the LIGHTHOUSES going dark? As in, they were not functioning for whatever reason; their ""warning"" lights went out (hence the name, year of darkness). That would ALSO be the impetus for Beloth to actually MAKE the belt in the first place - if they share the same purpose, and the lighthouses themselves weren't working, THAT would be the reason why to make the belt in the first place. 

So - the belt was constructed by Beloth when the warning lights of the lighthouses (towers) were not functioning. That could be either the ""warning system"" on the lighthouse side, and/or it could also be a suppressant mechanism (as if to hide the teleporter from the mysterious beings, the Corner Hound equivalents). So the Belt could serve a dual purpose - doing both things (or one or the other, I can see it either way). So, it's possible that not only does the belt/towers help in the facilitation of teleportation itself, but they actually protect/hide/obfuscate the presence of the teleporter 

And... as we mentioned, since the lighthouses weren't working (hence the year of darkness), that's why Beloth needed to construct the belt in the first place. 

And that explanation, to me, would fit much better than just ""a belt of pure gemstones"" - truly something worthy of impressing Angela and being one of the ""greatest treasures of the Riders"". 

Whew. 

Alright, we've covered a lot of ground, so I'll end it here. Thanks for reading! Let me know what you think in the comments. 

(as I stated above, this was a joint theory from myself, u/cptn-40, and u/notainsleym)"

🧰 **Mucho Gusto!**

Mucho, by [@nickfrosty](https://x.com/nickfrosty?ref=blog.colosseum.org), is a CLI tool to simplify the development and testing of Solana programs. The tool enables developers to install all necessary Solana development tools with a single command. 

This includes Rust, Cargo, the Solana CLI, Anchor, AVM, Solana-Verify, Trident (a Rust-based fuzzing framework), Zest (a code coverage tool), and Mucho itself. 

Mucho also supports cloning accounts and programs from any Solana cluster.

Using a Solana.toml configuration file, developers can define settings like which clusters to clone from, how often to clone, and where to store the cloned fixtures. 

Running a local test validator is easier with Mucho’s validator command, which automatically loads cloned accounts and programs and includes several sanity checks.

Other key features include building and deploying Solana programs. The tool scans the workspace to locate programs, assists with builds, and offers sanity checks before deployment. 

For troubleshooting, Mucho provides an info command that gathers detailed setup information. This includes installed tool versions, CLI configurations, wallet addresses, and even local validator status. 

This command can also generate reports for sharing on platforms like Solana StackExchange.

Mucho is currently in beta and open to feedback and contributions. See ⚙️ Tools below for a link to the repo.

# 📃 State of Web3 Adoption

The State of Web3 Adoption 2025 report from 51 Insights provides an in-depth look at the biggest trends and developments in Web3. 

It highlights the growth of decentralized technologies, the increasing integration of blockchain with AI, and the expansion of use cases across industries like gaming, payments, and community-driven economies. 

While this report isn't specific to Solana, here are a few key takeaways for developers:

**Stablecoin Expansion**\- Stablecoin usage has tripled year-over-year, reaching $27.1 trillion in transaction volume by November 2024. 

**Web3 Gaming and Immersive Commerce -** Web3 gaming continues to grow, with blockchain-based games accounting for 30% of unique active wallets in the industry. Brands are increasingly using gaming platforms like Roblox, Fortnite, and Minecraft for engagement. 

**Crypto and AI Synergy** \- Combining blockchain's structured data with AI is enabling advancements in automation and optimization, including CRM workflows and software development. 

**Memecoin and Community Economies** Memecoins saw a market cap surge to $120 billion, reflecting the potential of grassroots token-driven communities. Solana developers could explore tools for launching and managing community tokens or DAOs to tap into this momentum.

**Corporate Adoption** \- Over 50% of top global brands have entered Web3, experimenting with loyalty programs, tokenized rewards, and immersive experiences. 

**Mitigating UX Friction** \- Simplifying onboarding and reducing technical barriers is critical for Web3 adoption. Solana developers can focus on improving wallet integrations, seamless token usage, and scalable infrastructure to attract and retain users.

For Solana developers, this report underscores the growing demand for innovative, scalable solutions across diverse Web3 applications. Understanding these trends can help align projects with market needs and emerging opportunities.

# 🥪 Solana MEV Report

The Solana MEV Report from Helius dives deep into the evolving dynamics of MEV on Solana, its unique characteristics, historical milestones, forms, and mitigation strategies.

MEV on Solana has evolved through key events such as the introduction of priority fees, the rise of Jito's validator client, memecoin trading surges, and private mempool controversies. 

MEV practices range from liquidations and arbitrage to harmful sandwich attacks and have drawn criticism due to their negative impact on user experience.

Mitigation efforts focus on reducing harmful MEV while balancing network efficiency. 

Techniques include sandwich-resistant AMMs, dynamic slippage optimization, RFQ systems, and experimental solutions like Paladin and multiple concurrent leaders. These mechanisms protect users without compromising decentralization. 

Solana’s approach to MEV demonstrates adaptability, with opportunities for developers to contribute to solutions that ensure the network's long-term growth. 

Read the full report for more detailed insights, case studies, and mitigation strategies.

I copied it from the DT website back then and put it into a proper format. Here we go:

**Dream Theater – The Astonishing**

Music by Jordan Rudess and John Petrucci

Story and lyrics by John Petrucci

**Act I**

**Descent of the NOMACS**

In the year 2285, The NOMACS (Noise Machines) appear over the Emperor’s palace on New Maineland. A small ‘army’ of the drone-like machines is seen with one main NOMAC hovering in the foreground scanning the city in a display of control and supremacy. NOMACS were initially conceived by people in their quest to create the world’s most perfect music, but instead turned into something much more insidious. Born out of the vacuum created as a result of the suffocation of human expression, along with exponential advances in technology over time, they stand as the only semblance of entertainment remaining in the world. NOMACS music is now the only music anyone knows or listens to, and the only music that still exists. The very soul of what was once real music is now lost in a digital quagmire of emotionless sonic madness.

**Dystopian Overture**

An instrumental overture that contains all of the major reoccurring musical themes used throughout the album. Themes are associated with specific story settings and character appearances. This piece sets the mood for ACT 1 and introduces us to the newly redefined landscape of the former American Northeast now known as The Great Northern Empire Of The Americas.

 **The Gift of Music**

Over the course of nearly three hundred years, ever dwindling natural resources coupled with the excessive abuse of presidential power and extremegovernment-wide corruption has led to the return of a feudal society throughoutthe country. This is not necessarily the gleaming, space-exploring future we’vegrown accustomed to imagine. yet instead a dystopian world to come which inmany ways resembles more of a time and place back in mankind’s harsh history.The margin between rich and poor has widened to a point beyond recovery whereruthless dictators once again rule over vast empires. Along with their families andnobility, they now possess all of the land, wealth, power and control over whateverspoils remain on Earth. Meanwhile, the general population lives in scatteredtownships across the region, struggling to exist amidst a climate of extremeeconomic and social oppression. The resulting dichotomy between the magnificenceand splendor of the big cities and the modesty and simplicity of the decaying ruralvillages contributes greatly to the division between classes. In this dramaticallyredefined landscape, what was formerly known as the Northeast region of theUnited States is now a new super kingdom called G.N.E.A. or The Great NorthernEmpire Of The Americas. It is in this new land where we find the ominous LordNafaryus thriving in his tyrannical role as Emperor and Head of the Realm. Fromthe comfort of his opulent palatial residence on metropolitan New Maineland, he isable to keep a watchful eye on all that transpires throughout the Empire.

 Since working class families are now consumed with the day-to-day challenges of survival, forced to bear the lion’s share of taxes needed to support the Empire, any dedication, investment or interest in the arts has all but been abandoned. People just don’t have the time or the desire to participate in any of the creative forms of human expression that art, dance and especially music have to offer anymore. And, why should they? Life may closely resemble that of more ancient times in most ways, but now the only music to be heard is electronically manufactured and performed by the NOMACS.

 This brings us to the village of Ravenskill; a small, somewhat isolatedtown on Endless Isleland located far from the Emperor’s palace and the franticpace of metropolitan living. Ravenskill is a close knit community whoseinhabitants enjoy a renewed sense of family due to the simplicity of current times,yet who struggle and toil under the harshness of life’s reality under Nafaryus’ [rule.It](http://rule.It) is here where we find our unsuspecting hero Gabriel, increasingly being lookedupon as ‘The Chosen One’ who will liberate the people and lead them in avictorious revolution against Lord Nafaryus and his advocates. He is seen as ashining beacon of light in this seemingly dark and hopeless situation because of avery unique and magical talent that has been neither heard nor nurtured in many,many years…the divine gift of music. Gabriel was born and blessed with the natural ability to sing and to make music on a level that is simply… astonishing.Mindlessly programmed to withstand the cold and passionless cacophonyof the NOMACS, people are transfixed by Gabriel and transported back to a timewhere true art created by human beings was celebrated and consumed as theultimate nourishment for the soul. It is mesmerizing to all who hear him performand the sound of his voice is as cathartic to those around him as the most advancedmedicines available. So much so that the spirit of hope and enlightenment hasovertaken and inspired not only this small township, but also many others in theregion. As word spreads of this newly discovered savior, plans for an uprising arebrewing and people everywhere are talking about Gabriel’s magical power.

 **The Answer**

Ever so humble and not exactly viewing himself as a natural born leader, all of the attention showered upon him and the tremendous expectations placed on him have made Gabriel very uncomfortable and confused. While blessed with a captivating charm and presence, Gabriel is often puzzled by his uniqueness and largely seen by folks as a bit of an enigma. Although adored by many, he questions his purpose in life and the meaning of his gift, ultimately leaving him to feel very alone and isolated. He spends most of his time by himself and is conflicted…why was he The Chosen One? This was not something he asked for but it is obviously something that was meant to happen to him. He embodies the very essence of promise and hope that the inhabitants of Ravenskill cling to and it is he whom they wholly place their belief in. They see something extraordinary in Gabriel and are depending on him to rescue them from hardship and oppression and deliver them their freedom. As he ponders his role in all of this, he yearns for meaning in his life and searches for a path to his destiny, which…he will soon find.

 

**A Better Life**

It is Gabriel’s older brother Arhys who is his biggest supporter. As Commander of the Ravenskill Rebel Militia, it is his strong belief in Gabriel that fuels the fires of revolution in his eyes. He sees Gabriel as a catalyst for change and the people’s one and only appointed guide on the road to freedom. He is convinced it is Gabriel’s destiny. Arhys also has another reason to want to be free of this life of adversity… his eight year old son Xander whom he affectionately calls ‘X’. His love for Xander and longing for a better life and secure future for him is what keeps him motivated and willing to push forward with the crusade through these increasingly difficult times. As a single father he carries the memory of X’s mother and his only love,

Evangeline, with a heavy heart and with deep dedication. Knowing that she would not survive the birth of their son and recounting the life of misery and misfortune she endured, he promises her on her deathbed that he will see to a better future for X and devote the rest of his life to their son’s safety, prosperity and ultimately, his freedom. Arhys proceeds to further educate the townspeople of Gabriel’s powers and plant the seeds for an uprising amongst them.

 

**Lord Nafaryus**

Like vines racing across the landscape, news quickly travels throughout the region and talk of Gabriel’s increasing popularity and the mysterious gift he possesses eventually reaches Lord Nafaryus himself. The ruler, both intrigued as well as envious of the apparent influence Gabriel has over the people, decides to pay the residents of Ravenskill a visit. Concerned, he wants to see what all the hype is

about and whether or not Gabriel truly presents a threat to the Empire. He is also aware of the rumblings of a revolution beginning to surface throughout G.N.E.A. and in order to quell any foolish talk of mass rebellion, is prepared to make an example of Gabriel if necessary. Along with his exquisite wife Empress Arabelle, his loyal son Crown Prince Daryus and his daughter, the beautiful Princess Faythe whom he treasures more than life itself, they embark upon their journey to the

far-off reaches of The Realm in order to witness first hand what has becomeknown as ‘Gabriel’s Gift’.

 

Traveling across Eden’s Way and over the Emperor’s Bridge to Brother’s Crossing, they’ll ultimately arrive in Ravenskill where they will undoubtedly get to meet this mysterious savior face to face.

 

**A Savior in the Square**

In Ravenskill a large crowd has assembled in the town square, as it often does, around Gabriel, whom we find playing an old, beat-up relic of an acoustic guitar and singing an uplifting song ironically about believing in who you are and knowing that when your time has come, you will answer the call as it is your destiny. Not only are Arhys, X and all in attendance amazed by the remarkably strange and magnificent instrument he is playing (as they are not used to music coming from anything but machines) but at the same time their souls are lifted up and wonderfully transported by his angelic voice to the point of aural ecstasy. Gabriel’s divinely inspired music has a mystical way of penetrating even the most guarded individuals and transcends all generations while reawakening the dormant feelings of passion, power and self worth in anyone who hears it. It is at that moment that Nafaryus and his entourage arrive in the square, startling and alarming the townspeople. Gabriel stops singing and a thick silence falls upon the gathering. Everyone is very aware that they are in the presence of the Emperor and the Imperial Family and the danger associated with that very scenario. Flanked by his guards, Nafaryus addresses Gabriel saying,

“So, this is Gabriel The Astonishing. Please, do not stop on my account. Continue as you were.”

Arhys responds to him, “We are gathered here in peace my Lord and want no trouble” to which Nafaryus replies, “We are only here to witness for ourselves what we have all heard so much about. Gabriel’s remarkable gift.”

After an uncomfortable pause, Prince Daryus looks at Gabriel and with a threatening tone says, “Do as my father says…savior!”

Gabriel knows he has no choice and as he starts to lay his fingers on the guitar, he spots Princess Faythe standing next to the Empress and is absolutely mesmerized. She is…astonishing.

 

**When Your Time Has Come**

Gabriel commences playing and starts to sing the words of a deeply moving song. At first sheepishly and then with confidence and passion he sings the lines…

 

*When you're facing the path that divides*

*Know that I will be there by your side*

*Find your strength in the sound of my voice*

*And you'll know*

*Which choice is right*

 

In an instant, the words strike a very deep chord within Faythe and, as if awoken from a spell, the Princess’ eyes lock with Gabriel’s. Like a lightning bolt from the heavens and without hesitation, they immediately know that they are meant to be together and that this encounter was no accident. It is clear that somehow this moment marked the first step on the path to each other’s destiny. Up until now there had only been one thing that she truly connected with which comforted her and gave her hope on the days when she felt most alone. It happened to come from

a secret she’d been hiding for many years…

 

 

 

**Act of Faythe**

A vision of delightfulness with a look both enchantingly provocative and innocently demure at the same time, he has never before laid eyes upon anyone quite like her and her inescapable beauty pierces his soul. Gabriel however has not quite

captured the princess’ attention yet, as she is distracted by the scope of her surroundings and completely in awe of the number of people peacefully gathered in the square that afternoon. She is moved by the sense of togetherness and community being displayed before them, all amidst dreadful and practically unbearable living conditions. As a sheltered princess accustomed to the excesses of her palatial life, she is certainly not used to seeing any of this. Her heart immediately goes out to them and she is touched by their collective innocence and flickering sense of hope that a better life does exist somewhere out there. Although possessing her father’s tenacity and stubbornness, she is very much not aligned

with his way of thinking or harsh methods of ruling. In many ways she, like

Gabriel, shares the same feelings of isolation, often feeling like an outsider in her own home. She is alone, shielded from the bleak world by an over protective father, and longing for a purpose. And also like Gabriel, yearning for meaning in her life and searching for the path to her own destiny.

As a young girl growing up on New Maineland, she was a very curious child and used to keep herself entertained by going on adventures throughout the palace. One day while on one of these journeys she stumbled upon the Great Hall of Artifacts buried deep within its underground corridors. It is here that she found something remarkable; an antique digital music player very common during decades past but now deemed obsolete. It was filled with thousands of songs from all sorts of talented artists from a distant time when music was still created and performed by humans. It had a strange engraving on the back that simply said, “To BUG”. She didn’t know what it meant but that never mattered to her. She carried it with her wherever she went, always being careful to conceal it from those around her, especially her father. Relishing any private opportunity she could get to escape the realities of her cold and shielded imperial life, with her ear phones carefully hidden beneath her hair and her hood, she’d lose herself in the beautiful sounds of long ago. Still, as a young woman, there is not a day that goes by without her stealing a moment to listen to her prized secret device, the magical vessel that carries her spirit throughout the endless adventures of her imagination. Hearing Gabriel play the guitar and sing with an almost indescribable air of grace and beauty that day is the first time she ever feels such an overwhelming sense of safety and belonging outside of her private rendezvous with her music player.

 

**Three Days**

When the song is finished, the crowd erupts in glorious applause and even Nafaryus, notably moved by Gabriel’s song, is momentarily caught up in the contagious atmosphere of elation surrounding him. He is quickly brought back to reality, however, when he notices how Gabriel and the Princess are gazing at each other and immediately shouts out, “Enough!” Empress Arabelle also catches the two locked in an infatuating stare, and a quick glance from Faythe to her mother ensures that she knows the Empress is aware. Sensing that things are quickly about to go very wrong, Arhys has Gabriel obscured from view by his soldiers and swiftly whisked away and out of Nafaryus’ sight.

Lord Nafaryus will not tolerate the adoration and allegiance of his people to anyone other than himself and his jealousy of Gabriel’s power over them as well as his insecurities about the future of The Empire makes him feel the need to demonstrate his superiority. He immediately sees Gabriel as a threat to The Realm. The Emperor very smugly addresses Arhys and the townspeople saying that they can hide and protect Gabriel all they want but that he will not stoop to their level and take part of some sort of foolish cat and mouse game in order to find their ‘Savior’. He ensures them that ‘Gabriel The Astonishing’ will come to him willingly and surrender himself in person to his highness or suffer dire consequences. Nafaryus then declares that Gabriel has three days to give himself up and guarantee the disbanding and surrender of the Rebel Militia and cease all talk of revolution. Staring maliciously at X who is attempting to cower behind his father’s back, he continues to state that if ‘The Savior’ refuses to comply within that time, he will return with his forces, and he will hunt Gabriel down destroying every home one by one and killing every inhabitant until he is captured. And with that terrifying decree, Lord Nafaryus and his entourage depart Ravenskill leaving the stunned villagers to process the gravity of their newfound situation. As they head back to the palace, Princess Faythe is consumed with the vision of Gabriel and their obviously magnetic connection. Still intoxicated by his music, she is obsessed with the overwhelming notion that she must see him again.

**Brother, Can You Hear Me?**

Back in Ravenskill, Gabriel has gone into hiding and is being protected by Arhys’ men. Commander Arhys is convinced that his civilian army, combined with the bordering rebel forces in the region is strong enough to protect the town, and that there should be no talk of Gabriel’s surrender under any circumstances. Gabriel however is severely traumatized by all of this and is questioning the possession of his so called ‘gift’ now, more than ever. His surrender will clearly mark the end of any possible chance of peace and freedom for his people and will also most likely ensure his own demise. How can he abandon all that they’ve worked for, all that they stand for and all they have sacrificed for? On the other hand, how can he be so selfish as to make his own life worth more than all of the innocent inhabitants of his town? In the midst of all of this, he cannot shake the vision of Princess Faythe from his memory. He is completely absorbed with the thought of her and entranced by her inescapable beauty. Gabriel has come to a major crossroads in his life and knows that a turning point is imminent.

 

**A Life Left Behind**

After returning home to the palace, Princess Faythe realizes that her desire to see Gabriel again is not waning and that she is desperate to be with him no matter what the cost. It is simply something that she can most certainly feel yet cannot explain. She knows instinctually that fate has brought them together and that they both have a higher purpose to fulfill by their union, so she makes a plan to return

to Ravenskill the next morning. As to not alert the rebels or alarm the locals who may recognize her and think her a threat, she decides it is best to conceal her true identity while traveling outside of the palace. Empress Arabelle, ever in tune with the princess’ intentions, sees that she is planning this trip and confronts her about it. After seeing the spark of joy and passion in her daughter’s eyes as she talks about her feelings for Gabriel; eyes that have been cold and empty for so long, now ablaze with excitement and hope, she knows that the right thing to do is to let her go. She could not possibly deprive Faythe of pursuing her true love. Always the protective mother, the Empress has Prince Daryus secretly follow his sister in order to ensure her safety. Daryus willingly complies but has evil intentions of his own, which he is all too eager to carry out.

 

**Ravenskill**

Upon arriving in Ravenskill on the morning of the second day, the disguised princess asks if anyone knows where she could find Arhys, knowing that no one will voluntarily offer up Gabriel’s whereabouts and will certainly think of anyone asking as suspicious. Frustrated and exhausted, not really getting anywhere due to high levels of anxiety and vigilance amongst the townspeople, she eventually catches a break. She sees a young boy playing in front of a fountain and recognizes him as Arhys’ son Xander. Faythe’s gentle nature and sensitively alluring eyes win over the boy’s trust almost instantly. She convinces him that she has a way that she can help his father as well as Gabriel if she can just speak to him. Of course, all the while her brother Daryus has been watching her from afar and is now equally equipped with the information required to set his plan in motion.

X innocently leads the princess to the military camp where Arhys is preparing the rebel forces. Faythe takes the Commander aside and very bravely reveals her true identity to him. At first he is immediately tempted to arrest her and hold her as leverage against Nafaryus, but she assures him that her intentions are true and that she has a way to end the conflict and restore peace, but that she will only share it with Gabriel. Reluctantly, Arhys eventually agrees and leads her to where Gabriel is being hidden. Upon seeing each other they embrace and promise never to be separated again. First though, the conflict with Lord Nafaryus needs to be resolved before the three days expire. She tells Gabriel that she is certain she can convince her father to spare him as well as all of Ravenskill, and that she has seen

a gentle and forgiving side of him before that need only be reignited. Although there is not much time left, she is convinced that through their unity her father will see a way to restore peace to the land and give up his preposterous witch-hunt.

 

**Chosen**

The Princess’s words resonate with Gabriel and he remembers how his song in the square temporarily moved Nafaryus the day before. Gabriel is convinced that the absence of art and music and the incessant drivel being spewed out by the NOMACS has caused a sort of emotional hibernation amongst Lord Nafaryus and his supporters, ultimately leading to the deadening of his soul and the lack of any compassion in his heart. If Gabriel could just meet with the Emperor and Empress, he knows that through the power of his magical gift of music, especially with their daughter by his side, he could reawaken their spirits and bring harmony back to The Realm. Nafaryus need only agree to ignore the NOMACS for a moment and just listen. Excited to share this encouraging plan with her father, she returns to the palace to speak to him and convince him to meet with Gabriel.

 

**A Tempting Offer**

Meanwhile, still in Ravenskill, Prince Daryus follows Xander on his way home that evening. As X is about to enter his house, Daryus overpowers him and forces his way inside where the devious prince holds the boy hostage and waits for his father to return. Arhys eventually comes home only to find that Daryus has broken in and is now holding X’s life in his hands. Recognizing his son’s captor to be Prince Daryus and keeping X’s safety in mind, he immediately withdraws any efforts to apprehend the prince and instead asks him what he wants. Daryus makes him an offer that will put Arhys in an extremely complicated and life altering position…If Arhys delivers Gabriel to him, Prince Daryus will in return guarantee the safety, protection and prosperity of Xander for the rest of his life. He will enjoy all of the riches The Empire has to offer, the best education and a privileged life equal to that of Nafaryus’ own son. He will be in want of nothing for the rest of his life. As he sees it, the choice is easy because either way, they will capture Gabriel in the end. This way, he will be his son’s hero. Why is this so important to Daryus? He has lived in the shadow of his father’s outward love and adoration of Faythe his entire life. He has been unfairly pushed aside and expected to just ‘be a man’, ‘suck it up’ and relinquish any need of parental approval or praise. He could never quite measure up to the Emperor’s expectations and is deeply jealous of his father’s favoritism shown towards the princess. Daryus sees the successful capture of Gabriel as his opportunity to win over his father’s respect and gain the admiration he deserves.

 

**Digital Dischord NOMACS Instrumental**

 

**The X Aspect**

Daryus remains in Ravenskill for the evening and gives Arhys the rest of the night to consider his offer, telling him that he expects an answer by morning or the deal

is off. Obviously Arhys has a seemingly insurmountable decision to make. How can he possibly turn his back on his own brother? How can he betray the trust of his soldiers and his fellow people altogether abandoning the plans for revolution they have been working so tirelessly on for years now? Then he remembers the promise he made to Evangeline before she breathed her last breath; to see to the protection and livelihood of their son and to the dedication of his life to X’s eventual freedom. After a mostly sleepless night, he concludes that he has no choice, and with

Xander’s best interests in mind, contacts Prince Daryus agreeing to the terms of his offer. He vows to divulge the time and location to Daryus later that day, where the exchange of Gabriel’s freedom for the sake of X’s future will take place.

 

**A New Beginning**

That morning, Princess Faythe isn’t having quite the same luck convincing her father to meet with Gabriel, and the unwelcome news of her being in love with ‘the enemy’ further compounds his unwillingness to cooperate. Nafaryus finds the notion of a meeting both absurd and fruitless, since by the start of the next day his forces will be bearing down upon Ravenskill with all their wrath and fury if her boyfriend, ‘The Savior’ does not surrender himself as the impostor he truly is. Princess Faythe pleas with him that they only ask for a chance to be listened to without judgment, and if the Emperor is not convinced upon the conclusion of Gabriel’s message, then he will agree to surrender himself fully and with honor as per Nafaryus’ wishes. Perceiving any negotiation as a sign of weakness, however, Nafaryus shows no intention of even considering what he views to be his daughter’s foolish desires. Faythe is frustrated by her father’s ignorance, thick headedness and absence of

compassion for the people of his Empire, as well as his lack of respect for her feelings. It is then that Empress Arabelle expresses that she’s seen enough of this stubbornness between the two of them and enlightens him to the fact that if he doesn’t agree to this meeting, his daughter will never forgive him and that he will lose her forever.

 

*“I remember a time when you too possessed Faythe’s romantic innocence and passion for life’s unexplored mysteries…BUG.” says Arabelle to her husband.*

 

It is then that Faythe realizes that the word “BUG” inscribed on the back of her music player was referring to her father and that it once belonged to him!

It had been given to him as a gift by his own father who shared the same secret affinity for music made by humans as Faythe eventually would. As a very young boy, Nafaryus was always zipping in and out of the palace halls and buzzing around his father’s feet trying to get the busy Emperor’s attention (hence the nickname ‘BUG’). The rare times when he wasn't consumed with balancing the many affairs of The Realm, his father would privately submit to the therapeutic bliss of his own secretly kept digital music player, oftentimes inviting young Nafaryus to indulge in these undisclosed

soul-soothing escapes. His gift of the

music player to his son was his way of letting Nafaryus know that they would always have that special connection no matter how complicated life may eventually get. As time passed, however, Nafaryus grew into adulthood and his father the Emperor grew old and tired. The allure of the imminent passing of the crown to the ambitious prince and all of the power and control associated with it far

out-shadowed the indulgences of some silly music player. In the course of time his father fell ill, eventually passing away and with the rise of the NOMACS drowning out his memory, the music player was discarded by the newly crowned Emperor Nafaryus and ultimately forgotten.

Until…now.

For the first time Princess Faythe reveals the secret music player she’d been both relishing and concealing almost her entire life to the Emperor, saying,

“See father, you also once enjoyed the beauty of real music and not just the garbage of those dreadful NOMACS.”

“Where did you get that, child?” Shouts Nafaryus, to which Faythe responds, “Never mind that.” “I am not a child anymore, father, I am a woman who doesn't want to be told what to do or who I can or cannot see anymore!” “Now please reach inside your soul and show me that you are not just the heartless dictator you have come to be known as.”

Not able to contest the wisdom of neither his wife nor his daughter, Nafaryus concedes, knowing that if he persists, he risks losing the princess forever and so agrees to the meeting. If Gabriel truly is ‘The Chosen One’ and can sway him as his beloved daughter says he can, then he will cease all plans of attack on Ravenskill and award him his freedom. If not, then he will accept Gabriel’s surrender as promised, at which point it will be sure that she will never see him again.

 

 

 

**The Road to Revolution**

Elated, Princess Faythe immediately shares the news with Gabriel, who is still in hiding back at Ravenskill. He tells her that he knows of the perfect neutral location for this summit and that the only way this is ensured to work is if the meeting takes place that evening, under the dance of the stars and the glow of the midnight moon at a once magnificent but since abandoned amphitheater on the edge of town called Heaven’s Cove. It is against the dramatic backdrop of a place where music once poured from the lighted stage where Gabriel will best be able to showcase his miraculous musical gift and is sure that once enlightened, there is no way the Emperor will be able to follow through with his plans. As a symbolic gesture of peace, Faythe agrees to sing together along with Gabriel so that when her father hears the purity and innocence of love and unity in their combined voices, the fate of their future will be sealed. Aware there is always the chance that the outcome of tonight’s events may not turn out as they both desire, Gabriel and

Faythe decide it best to meet at Heaven’s Cove ahead of time in order to relish what may possibly be their final moments alone together and to rehearse for their performance that evening. Faythe shares the location with her father and later that day Nafaryus and Arabelle begin to make their way to the amphitheater at Heaven’s Cove on Endless Isleland; the Emperor outwardly pessimistic and with guards in tow prepared for what he predicts will be Gabriel’s surrender."

I can't believe it......,thomastheplankengine,1i2fep6,2025-01-15 22:06:14,15,1.0,0,https://i.redd.it/wq15kdo7v9de1.jpeg,No-Perspective2580,Nightmare Plank,"So I wish I was dreaming now as my brother and I decided to spin the wheel elimination style to see what show to watch. 

Here are the 12 options plus a fun extra:

Fairy Tale
Transformers G1
Solo Leveling 
Seven Deadly Sins
Every Single Power Ranger Season
Wonderful Precure
Magical Madoka
Every Single Pokémon Season (Including Pokémon Horizons)
Edens Zero
Friends
Seinfeld
Reroll (If last, redo whole elimination roll)

Pretty random, but we had to not think to hard about it.

So my brother gets all Pokémon Seasons plus Pokémon Horizons. I mean it works, he's a Pokémon fan with the games yet hasn't seen the show in years so it'll be fun!!


I got Friends.....


Lets me repeat myself

***I got Friends***


But!! This is definitely a total nightmare where I'm sharing a bed with Hulk Hogan, the Rock, and Ms. Butterworth.


They'll keep me safe......................................


............dear god I'm gonna have to watch Friends aren't I.......

Season of the First Wish - [OC] Seasonal Game Idea,SkyChildrenOfLight,1i1j569,2025-01-14 18:02:28,4,0.83,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyChildrenOfLight/comments/1i1j569/season_of_the_first_wish_oc_seasonal_game_idea/,vk_fox,Discussion,"**Season of the First Wish -** An original season concept developed by u/vk_fox

This was also posted to r/SkyGame on 14/01/25

**BACKSTORY**

While playing in the Village Theater, I became inspired by seasonal quests there and decided to create my own season. I looked at some discussions regarding current game-play for further inspiration. This season, which I’m calling ‘Season of the First Wish’ is an original idea I created for fun. I do not believe this will ever become adapted to the game, but I think it’s fun to speculate on what could potentially happen.

I created this season to expand upon some minor lore details, giving a whole new meaning to the player’s sky kid and what it takes to be a star. Season of the First Wish begins in the fictional area of the Starward Strand, in the sands of the Isle of Dawn, just beyond the tutorial area. I was inspired by other seasons and events such as the elemental trials and decided to play on ancient sky history when drafting this idea.

**INTRODUCTION**

“You are the light, the light is you.” - Starward Strand Opening

The Starward Strand is a depressing colony in the clouds, high above the Isle of Dawn. In what was once a magical village of wishes and dreams, lies now houses in ruins and dying stars. Your sky kid brings a light to the dim village, and along with the seasonal guide, you will reignite the passions of stars and grant wishes to those who need them most. The First Wish guide along with three other seasonal spirits can be found here.

**SEASONAL AREA**

Starward Strand, the seasonal area for this concept, can only be reached by walking forward from the tutorial area (just beyond the butterflies/deep honk tutorial) and sitting in a meditation circle surrounded by dying star shards. There, you sky kid sits and meditates until they fly directly up and into a strip of clouds and islands known as the ‘Starward Strand.’

The strand, shroud in starlight, features three small islands and one larger, central island in a similar fashion to the Prairie Village. Upon entering the strand, the game will direct your player towards the largest central island where you will be introduced to the First Wish Guide.

To your left you will find a smaller island floating slightly above the central area with a broken home, some dying flowers, and the Feeble Florist seasonal spirit. To your right is a slightly larger island with a concave rock-face, and broken lanterns, where you will find Dim-Witted Daydreamer. In the final smaller island just in front of the main strand area is Self-Thinking Stargazer, who lies in a pile of rubble and various items.

**SPIRITS AND COSMETICS**

The First Wish guide takes on a younger, mask-less, and slightly feminine appearance with baggy, ill-fitting clothing. First Wish guide can be seen slouched on a rock on their central island. On their first appearance, the guide appears to be lethargic, barely noticing the player walking towards them. Upon completion of the guide’s friendship tree, First Wish gives the player their old clothes, which fits your character better. The guide’s cape, shoes, seasonal pendant, hairstyle, and wish-prop are all available for purchase via seasonal candles (I’m not doing the math on that, make up your own price values).

Feeble Florist, another spirit, is a more animated yet overly-timid gardener. The Florist is attempting to grow flowers but easily becomes overwhelmed by the amount of flowers they’re trying to grow. They are a bit too protective of their depressive garden and initially shoo-away the player character. Their completed friendship tree includes a flower-planting spell, a cape, an outfit, and hair.

Dim-Witted Daydreamer sits in the hollow cave surrounded by lantern pieces. This spirit takes on a young, masculine appearance, and longs to bring light back into the strand. Their cave also hosts red candles which can be melted for wax. When first greeting Daydreamer, they are much more friendly than the previous two spirits, offering to shake your hand and show you around their cave. Their hairstyle, clothing, shoes, and lantern nest-item are available for purchase.

Self-Thinking Stargazer is the final seasonal spirit you will meet just beyond the main island. Stargazer comes across as a younger, masculine child who is proud of their belongings. Their “home” consists of a pile of items and rubble from a house that once stood in its place. The child is incredibly proud of their belongings, snuggling up to the player character to boast their collection. Their toys are available as home decor and can be purchased using seasonal currency.

**FIRST WISH QUESTS**

**QUEST #1**

The first quest begins when the player approaches and talks to a down-trodden First Wish guide on their central piece of land. The player is introduced via game narration to the concept of granting wishes. The game explains how hopeful beings used to wish on the ascended stars before they fell. The narration also explains that selfish wishes dim the light of stars, rendering them unable to grant true wishes from the heart.

First Wish guide will then continue the story by explaining the history of the Starward Strand. The guide recounts how the strand used to be a beautiful resting spot between the heavens and earths but has now become abandoned due to selfish interests and fallen stars. The guide shows the player the wish-making prop on their back which they state was used to grant wishes until the stars grew dim. The guide gives the player the prop, allowing them to grant the wishes of the beings of Sky as they complete the next four quests (\*upon purchasing as an IGC, the guide’s wish-making prop can be used by the player to give a few pieces of wax to nearby players).

The guide then turns your attention towards the Feeble Florist, who they state is “afraid of their own garden.""

**QUEST #2**

The second quest begins with the player attempting to approach the Feeble Florist in their garden. The Florist, startled, tries to shoo away the player character before you calm them down. Florist spirit explains how their garden is struggling to survive due to the lack of resources, and how they would feel terrible abandoning their flowers.

The game narration directs you towards the Prairie Temple in Daylight Prairie. The camera pans to the exterior, just under the bridge, and the interior, to a seasonal candle, where you are told to collect the “finest of resources” to make the flowers grow (light and water).

Upon collection, the player is instructed to head back to the seasonal area and speak with Feeble Florist to complete the quest. Florist will use the resources collected to bless their flowers, and watch in amazement as they begin to bloom and grow. The Florist then waves a hand across the strand to the Dim-Witted Daydreamer, who can be seen attempting to combine an unlit candle and a rock, and the player’s wish-prop begins to glow a little brighter

**QUEST #3**

To start the third quest, the player is directed towards the Dim-Witted Daydreamer and their cave-like island. The quest begins with Daydreamer describing how they’ve always dreamed of lighting up the village, but isn’t sure how. Daydreamer realizes they are holding a candle and excitedly asks the player to help them collect more.

The game narration pans over to the Valley of Triumph towards the racing area and tasks the player with completing the race to collect red candles. Daydreamer explains they cannot do this because they lack a cape.

After completing the race and speaking with Daydreamer again, the player hands them the collected candles and shows Daydreamer how to light them. Mind-blown, you and Daydreamer set candles around the strand to lighten the place up, then return to Daydreamer’s island. Daydreamer thanks you for your help with a hug and promises to share the gift of light with the others, as they say that your wish-prop grows brighter, and you are directed towards Self-Thinking Stargazer

**QUEST #4**

The fourth quest begins with your sky kid approaching the ruins of Self-Thinking Stargazer’s home. They warmly greet the user with a hug and parade them around their “house.” The game narration remarks “it’s not much but they seem proud,” as Stargazer shows off a collection of items.

The game narration continues with the camera panning over the Vault of Knowledge, tasking the player with journeying to the highest levels to collect the “finest of toys” for the child. While progressing through the vault with Stargazer and a few of their possessions, you come across different obstacles which hinder your journey and can only be solved by asking Stargazer to give away some of his items. Reluctant at first, Stargazer obliges and realizes that giving away some belongings can be just as rewarding as gaining them.

After reaching the uppermost level of the vault, you and Stargazer discover a slightly-battered cape discarded on the floor. Stargazer pipes up, knowing exactly who to give it to, and the game instructs you to head back to the Starward Strand to complete the quest.

Upon completing the quest, Stargazer gives Daydreamer the cape. Your wish-prop glows even brighter which catches the attention of the First Wish guide, who then beckons you toward their island.

**QUEST #5**

The final quest begins with your character speaking to the First Wish guide. They ask you to summon everyone on the Starward Strand to their island. After gathering the seasonal spirits, the guide then asks for their prop back. The spirits listen closely as the guide explains how you have granted the wishes of the stars, and now the stars must return their light to the beings of Sky.

The game then instructs you to grant the final wish \*\*by sacrificing your light for the lights of others. Each spirit gives you encouragement and shows how you have granted their deepest wishes through helping them grow. First Wish guide gives you their prop back and asks you to grant their final wish as the camera pans over the Eden gate.

Upon completion of the quest (re: running Eden), you return to a vibrant community where the First Wish guide has been transformed into a translucent dress, resembling stardust. The spirits thank you for your hard work before they ascend upwards and towards the heavens. You release the wish-prop and your sky kid watches as it too ascends upwards and into the stars.

**NOTES**

I hope you enjoyed reading my concept of a season. I had been thinking about this for the past few days and wanted to turn it into something more concrete than a collection of thoughts. This is my first longer-form Reddit post, so if you spot any technical or grammatical errors please let me know. If you have any suggestions or comments on this also let me know, as I am not sure how well this idea would play out in execution.

\*I wasn’t sure if the prop should ever become an in-game purchase, and if it did, I’m not sure what abilities it would give the player. I wanted to introduce a different perspective on game mechanics while still keeping the spirit of the original game.

\*\*I know having the player run Eden is heavily similar to guide in Aviary, I thought it would be interesting for players who have completed the game at least once to have a season dedicated towards that. I’m not sure if I want to stick with the Eden-run element, but that’s all I have so far."
Season of the First Wish - [OC] Game Idea,SkyGame,1i1ilpd,2025-01-14 17:38:22,6,0.8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1i1ilpd/season_of_the_first_wish_oc_game_idea/,vk_fox,,"**Season of the First Wish -** An original season concept developed by u/vk_fox

**BACKSTORY**

While playing in the Village Theater, I became inspired by seasonal quests there and decided to create my own season. I looked at some discussions regarding current game-play for further inspiration. This season, which I’m calling ‘Season of the First Wish’ is an original idea I created for fun. I do not believe this will ever become adapted to the game, but I think it’s fun to speculate on what could potentially happen.

I created this season to expand upon some minor lore details, giving a whole new meaning to the player’s sky kid and what it takes to be a star. Season of the First Wish begins in the fictional area of the Starward Strand, in the sands of the Isle of Dawn, just beyond the tutorial area. I was inspired by other seasons and events such as the elemental trials and decided to play on ancient sky history when drafting this idea.

**INTRODUCTION**

“You are the light, the light is you.” - Starward Strand Opening

The Starward Strand is a depressing colony in the clouds, high above the Isle of Dawn. In what was once a magical village of wishes and dreams, lies now houses in ruins and dying stars. Your sky kid brings a light to the dim village, and along with the seasonal guide, you will reignite the passions of stars and grant wishes to those who need them most. The First Wish guide along with three other seasonal spirits can be found here.

**SEASONAL AREA**

Favorite beats in EDEN's songs?,eden,1i1fewe,2025-01-14 15:17:55,57,1.0,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/eden/comments/1i1fewe/favorite_beats_in_edens_songs/,CoolingJoker,,"which EDEN's songs do you think have the best beat?

In my case, I have 4 in mind:

1.- Modern Warfare:
This song's beat feels so unique to me and I think it's the perfect beat for the vibes the lyrics give to the song, also the car's windshield wipers going at the same bpm as the beat in the video is a really cool detail

2.- PS1:
Another beat that feels so unique, every time I listen to this song I like to focus on the beat because it has so many layers that feels like a magical experience 

3.- Friday Night Song:
Never heard EDEN having a beat like this and I absolutely love it, probably my favorite song of these last 4 singles

4.- Call Me Back
Don't know how EDEN did to make a sound so deep at the beginning of the song, if the video/song it's about the ""death"" of the girl that's definitely how I imagine it should sound, the beat switchs are really good too"
A dying empire: of death and ceremony.,HFY,1i1esi9,2025-01-14 14:52:18,46,0.93,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i1esi9/a_dying_empire_of_death_and_ceremony/,Feeling_Glovely,OC,"Esten turned and quickly walked out the into the blazing sun of the ruined city. Making his way though the dying sounds of battle untill he reached the Bishop commanding the forces. Perched at the edge of jagged rocks surrounding a crater from a bombarding spear were the few of the White Tree who had survived the battle. There armor stripped from them. The knelt, naked, caked in dirt and blood, their hands behind there heads. Behind each stood a red dawn Marine.

“Inquisitor” Bishop Jarume said as Esten approached. He always hated this part of his duties but understood why it was needed. He glanced at the line kneeling along the edges of the crater, 4 men, 3 women. All but two of them baring the wound of battle. One mans arm hung from his body as tattered hamburger, a womans face half burnt to the bone. One man uninjured cried garish tears, they streamed down his face like rivers between violent sobs he tried to hide, but most looked on and up with pride. 

Esten nodded to the Bishop and walked over to the line. He filled his voice with as much authority as he could muster a spoke. “You failed to find an honorable grave today. You stand accused of treason, surrendering to coalition forces. For this cowardice i strip you of your names.” behind the line a black dawn marine hoisted a heavy pulse hamer and slammed it on the ground, sending a shockwave though the ground that cause all in the line to tremble.

“Marine’s is there any among you who can speak to the effort of these, to the cruelness of lady nighting gale for denying them an honerable passage.” He spoke slowly, holding firm to the ceremony and giving the black dawn marines gathered around giving them a chance to save the bravest among the traitors.

“I can speak.” A corporal stepped forward, Tomass, Esten knew him to be honerable and kind. He also knew the young man hated to watch the ceremony, if he was present then something truly memorable must have happened. He stepped over to stand behind the woman whos skull showed behind the burns on the left half of her face. “This womans face sports a medal of honor. She dove atop a plasma mine the enemy had placed as trap. Saving a squad of six. Lady nightingale refused to take her due to her bravery.”

Esten nodded. “Very well, i name thee shield, rise and join the black dawn to seak an honerable death another day.” he said. The woman rose slowly to her feet, turning and walking behind Tomass to the medical tent.

Another Marine stepped forward. “Lord inquisitor i speak on behalf of these two squires.” Esten glanced over to see the training master flanked by two boys no older than 9. Esten had seen both of them in training, but this was their first real battle.

“Speak Sergeant.” Esten said, his voice as smooth as polished silver.

“They speak on behalf of the man with the tattered arm, he pinned three orcs to a wall to protect them when they had gotten separated, he held them in place until a marine came to end the enemy, enduring countless wounds in the process. Lady Nightingale refuses to claim those who protect the young for far to long.” The sergeant spoke with the same authority and control he always did in training. It almost made Estens hair rise up on his neck, but he always found the man to be reasonable, if terrifying.

“Both squires will repeat battle navigation training.” Esten responded. “And they can start by accompanying you to the north northwest quadrant of the city where a white building stands with a metal door, ½ click past the prison complex, two rights and a left down the alleys.” he rattled of the directions quickly and purposely, both hoping the boys wouldn't get lost, and knowing they would but that they would be better for the experience.

The training master sighed and nodded, turning slightly on his heals, the mag boots grinding in the rough ground before the whir of his armor as he lifted both hands. They came down quickly, roughly striking each boy behind the ear and pointing them to move towards the directions Esten indicated, where they would find the huddled squires of the White Tree Regiment. Waiting in the dark of that building for the guiding light of salvation.

Esten turned to face the line again, the man with the mangled arm before him. “Rise, i name thee care taker.” he spoke calmly and kindly. “May you find an honorable death another day.”

The man nodded, rising to his feet and walking towards the medical tent slowly, as another Black Dawn Marine stepped forward. “I speak on behalf of the woman with the brown hair, though she bears no honorable wounds, she utilized her own field repair kit to save the relics many a marine wore into battle today. Even sacrificing her own armor on her body to transfuse life blood into my own.” 

Esten spun on his heels to face one of only two unwounded of the white tree. “You committed heresy!” He bellowed. “Perhaps a lifetime of service to the college of relics detachment assigned to the black dawn will teach you a respect for the ancients! You will die in your bed! A coward's death!” tears began to carve streams in the dirt that cacked the womans face as she stood. Bowing deeply so her tears fell of her face fat droplets that hit the ground heavily, her body jerking as she kept silent her sobs.

“Thank you lord inquisitor, i shall spend the rest of my life in penance.” She spoke softly though the tears before walking off to the medical tent. He couldn't help but notice many of the marines looking at her shapely figure. He almost laughed aloud, but caught himself clearing his throat. He knew few were actually so devout to the churches teachings that they would rather keep the repurposed mining suits in their original form than survive a battle. Even if they had no idea that much of their armor had not been used by the ancients for battle.

Hell at this point he had basically given her a brand new life, she could marry, earn a wage, bear children, even own property. All things not allowed for a marine. A pretty woman with skill would have no trouble carving herself a good life in the empire.

Esten looked at the four remaining cowards in their line. The one who had been crying now had snot running down his face into his beard. Esten held his breath, waiting a moment to allow another to speak on behalf of any remaining.

“Lord inquisitor.” A mousy and undistorted voice spoke behind him. He spun on his heals to see the youngest of the squires he had saved, Jonanthan, Anedru short behind him running at full pace towards the young boy, with the rest of the squires double timing into the clearing, the training master barking cadence alongside them.

Anedru caught up to the tiny boy, his hand found a full grasp of the boys long dirty hair. Yanking on it quickly, forcing his head into a bow. Trembling with fear, as he bent his own body into a bow so heavy he nearly fell forward.

“Stop your trembling boy, i'm not about to kill a child too young to lace his boots. I'm no orc.” Esten said to both boys drawing a chuckle from the gathered marines. “Let Jonanthan speak Squire Anedru.”

The older boy righted himself slowly, and allowed the young boy to do the same. The boy pointed a tiny emaciated hand at a man with a dark beard sitting just next to the crying man. “Thats Training Master Tagert. He stepped in front of an elven spell to protect us.” the young boy began to cry as he started to recount the tail. “I think their dark magic took his mind from him Lord. Can you please use your power to give it back? Like you did for Anedru?” the boy choked out between tears. “He was a brutal training master, but he always made sure we got our rations and our sleep. Always said punishing a squire by taking those was too much.”

Esten looked at the dark haired man, then back to the boy. The Black Dawn Sergeant walked up behind them then. “Sorry inquisitor, but frankly this boy is three years to young to even start as a squire. I cant punish him even if i'd want to. And frankly sir…” the training master paused and took a deep breath. “From what i've learned this boy wasn't even the youngest of their squires, i'd quite like you to fix their training master myself, if only so i can send him to a dishonorable grave.” the man's voice was a low growl, the rage perceptible even though the distortion of his helmets speakers.

Esten waved a hand, and the marine who carried the pulse hammer hauled the man in question to his feet and walked him over to stand before Esten. Who drew his knife and placed the tip just above the cheekbone where the maxillary branch of the Trigeminal nerve lay below the surface. He drove the tip in, bringing a light bit of blood that flowed down the mans face, stopping only when he felt the hardness of bone beneath his blade. he  ground the blade hard against the bone, turning every bit of the nerve in the mans face to fire, the grinding sound somewhat satisfying.

The mans eyes suddenly took on a light blue color and he screamed. At first Esten thought it simply a howl, before he could make out the words. “Get down boys!” frantic. panicked. The man must have been screaming it when he stepped in front of the spell, Esten withdrew his knife and the man fell to his knees. His calloused hands didnt move to his face but rather to the two young boys standing before him.

“Oh thank every god who's ever been.” the man said as tears began to stream down his face, and he pulled both boys into a tight hug. So tight it was clear the boys could barely breath. But they both beamed gap toothed smiles as their own tears began to pour.

“Training master, i commend him to you. He was not of mind when his regiment surrendered. As such he committed no treason. Find out why the white tree would use squires of such a young age and report back to me.” Esten said calmly before turning back to the three who remained on the edge of the crater. The crying man was sobbing openly now, ragged breaths between pained howls, and yet he bore not a single wound. He glanced at the black dawn marine standing behind them, pulse hammer resting on his shoulder.

“That crying coward is unbecoming of humanity.” Esten said, a heavy grunt from the marine and the hammer came down on the crying man's head, splattering it like jelly just before his body fell into the crater. “Vermin must be eliminated.”

“As for you other two, as no one has spoken on your behalf i must assume your deeds did not rise to a level of honor to show cruelty by lady nightingale, you will be buried here as traitors.” the very instant he finished the words the Marine with the hammer brought it down quickly on the legs of one of the remaining White Tree, kicking him into the crater before moving and raising his hammer at the remaining woman.

“Wait!” She cried out, causing the marine to pause for a moment, hammer just about to behind its heavy arc. “I let every man here use my body freely if only you'd let me live!” she cried. Tears beginning to stream down her face. “I had no choice to become a marine, my local lord pulled me from my home -”

Her words were cut off as Esten waived a hand and the Black Dawn Marine brought the hammer down hard on her legs and kicked her into the crater. “No man of the Black Dawn would take a coward as a whore.” Esten called into the crater before signaling the mortuary officer.

Undertaker Hilda, waved to the Marines and quickly organized a line to drag the corpses of Orcs, Elves, and Dwarves of the coalition to the crater and throw them in. each one leaving a sticky trail of blue, green, or purple blood behind it as it was pulled from Marine to Marine and throne into the mass grave. Esten saw several among the dead whose wounds he recognized as his own doing and smiled softly to himself.

“Inquisitor.” he heard the Bishops voice though his helmet, and turned to see the man in the distance, standing next to an armor he didnt recognize. He began to move to his commanding officer, coming closer and seeing the unknown armored individual didnt wear a suit of any particular detachment, but a sleak black one like his own. It was just the inhabitant stood head and shoulders taller than the heavy mining suits the Black Dawn used as battle armor. On his left pauldrin was emblazoned a mountain in clear red etching.

“Inquisitor this is a hand of the emperor who will be taking over your training.” The Bishop said waving a hand to the mountain of a man. The large mirrored black helmet nodded slightly and the Bishop turned and began to walk away quickly. Esten didnt have to think hard to understand why, the armor was rather off putting. Is that how he looked? Sure quite a bit smaller, but perhaps that made it even more sinister. He was drawn from his thoughts by the mans voice ringing though his speakers.

“Ye get strang jobs her in the blak dawn.” the man said with an accent so think Esten could barely understand the words. “At Red Mountain wer mer about destruction.”

“Ah yes.” Esten responded slowly, thinking though the somewhat hard to understand words. “The Black Dawn has the sacred duty to protect the empire from itself, we respond to places where battles were lost, intelligence may have been taken, or on rare cases when there were those dishonerable enough to be taken prisoner.”

“Aye, and afters du ye watch the helmet cam o each marin and feast?” The mountain of a man asked, glancing around at many marines in the distance. “Is there anythin on yers that may be a problem?”

“No, everything i did is well within my power as inquisitor.” Esten said flatly.

“A strenge role aye? Why they give it to yer?”

“Most of these Marines have been together since childhood, have worked with the other regiments, having an inquisitor whos an outsider means things are more fair… usually.”

“Ah. well like yer mans said ill be handlin yer training fer the next bit. Nams Ber.”

“Bar?” Esten asked confused by the mans accent.

“Nar, Bar!” the man said, his voice sounded irritated, like he had to have this conversation regularly. “The legendary furry thin that lives in the black sea.”

“Oh Bear! Like the animal from mother world!” Esten replied, a smile and understanding crossing his face behind his helmet.

“Bers from mother world? Yer jestin boy, Bers Aint real.” Bear said with a laugh.

“Oh i assure you they are, in fact the college of relics holds their DNA in the Eden kit. Not that they actually know what either of those particular relics are for or what they do.” Esten said with a laugh, he could see from the the mans posture he was suddenly confused and suspicious.

“Then how de ye know what the air?” Bears voice showed that suspicion clearly, Esten wondered just how terrible the man must be at poker.


“Oh the relics blessed me with ancient knowledge. Per the priest at the college of relics im to be the sage.” He said with a slight laugh.

“Oh thats a luck of a blessin, all i get was strength… wait cer ye read?” Bear asked suddenly excited like he had thought of something and opening a compartment in his armor.

“Yes. cant you?” the smaller man replied, as he watched the giant fingers fish something tiny out of the compartment. He held it out gingerly to Esten.

“Berly.” the man said with a hearty laugh at his own joke. “My grandfather had this, i know only haf the words. He said it was special.”

Estin glanced down at what had been placed in his hand, a tattered and word pocket sized book. He had never seen a book so well preserved outside of the college of relics library. It was clear that Bear had cherished it, protected it with his very life. He glanced at the warn words emblazoned on the heavy leather cover. A leather heavy and thick, like halktrauss skin bound into a book, bold flowy letters on the front the read “NEW TESTAMENT.” the familiar flash behind his right eye, but this time somewhat different than normal, he felt the flash open up. Like a super nova being born just behind his optic nerve. Thousands of words scrolled fast behind his vision, each as clear as day as his brain processed them so fast it made hot bile rise and catch in his throat. He paused and breathed, and began to navigate they system. For the first time ever swimming though oceans of information behind his own eye.

“This is a blashempous work. I should kill you just for having it.” he said calmly looking up at Bear. he saw the man stiffen and subtly redying himself for a fight. He laughed heartily. “Nah im kidding. I mean it is, its a religious text from mother world, where now the church is based around actual history from mother world, this was religion on mother world.” He said calmly handing the book back to bear. “I can read it to you sometime if youd like.”

Bear paused turning the book over in his massive hands, before sliding it back into the hidden compartment, speaking slowly and with confusion. “Washington’s hall of White.”

“Oh yeah a real place, well sort of, it was actually called the white house, and was where the president of a particular nation known as the United State of America live. Generally viewed as their seat of power.” Esten Responded non chalantly. Feeling the shock from bear in the sound of his beating heart. In the distance the air began to distort and esten glanced up to see the salvage and security teams coming in on drop ships.

“Come on, ill tell you more on the ship.” He said with a smile gesturing towards the landing ship, men and women in simple red robes flowing out of it like ants from the hill, moving first to strip the armor of the marines who found their graves before they even hit the ground.

"Market trends indicate DEXs have replaced VC markets for token price discovery, while CEXs continue to serve as exit liquidity",Blockmandev,1i0qvq7,2025-01-13 17:41:10,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockmandev/comments/1i0qvq7/market_trends_indicate_dexs_have_replaced_vc/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨 Binance’s latest token listings are hitting speed bumps, underperforming compared to the broader crypto market. Analysts suggest price discovery is now thriving on decentralized exchanges while centralized platforms are being used as exit liquidity. 

Take Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) and ChainGPT ($CGPT) for example—they’ve managed to stay somewhat afloat amidst the storm. As of now, $PENGU trades at $0.028, a 60% drop from its debut at $0.07, while $CGPT is down just 4.7% since its January listing. On the other hand, memecoins like Simon’s Cat ($CAT) and Magic Eden’s ($ME) token have taken a nosedive, losing approximately 70% of their value.

Market expert Ignas sees this as a healthy pivot. Previously, price discovery happened in private VC markets, with centralized exchanges acting as exit liquidity. The trend has shifted—decentralized exchanges are taking over as hubs for price discovery.

The story doesn’t end there. The Velodrome ($VELO) token also illustrates this dynamic, dropping nearly 70% after its Binance listing. It now sits at $0.1154. Traders—particularly those dubbed as “smart money”—are driving this shift by leaning toward decentralized platforms.

Interestingly, on-chain activity is heating up. December saw decentralized exchanges achieve a record-breaking $434.4 billion in spot trading volume. On-chain derivatives markets also marked a new peak with nearly $341 billion in traded volume. As of January, decentralized platforms have handled 16% of the total spot trading volume, with weeks still left to monitor.

Eyes are on decentralized exchanges as they outpace old-school VC markets for price discovery, while centralized players hold their ground as liquid exit ramps.

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins can initially be quite enjoyable, especially during large-scale battles which are a true spectacle but it gets a bit dull the longer you play. Combined with a fairly average visual presentation and a soundtrack that feels out of place it's hard to recommend Dynasty Warriors: Origins to a casual gamer looking for the next great game to play.

-------------

**[Areajugones](https://opencritic.com/outlet/470/areajugones)** - [Joel Isern Rodríguez - Kaym](https://opencritic.com/critic/10930/joel-isern-rodr-guez-kaym) - *Spanish* - [8.5 / 10](https://areajugones.sport.es/videojuegos/analisis-de-dynasty-warriors-origins-cuando-los-origenes-revitalizan-la-formula/)

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins marks the revival of a legendary saga, blending the frenetic action of the musou genre with fresh ideas that bring both depth and innovation. In this installment, large-scale battles reach a new level thanks to the impressive number of enemies on screen and strategic tactics that make every move count. With a more refined narrative, a charismatic protagonist, and an interactive map that ties the Three Kingdoms together, this title delivers an experience that sets a new standard for the franchise. If you're a fan of the series or a lover of epic action, this is a game you can't afford to miss.

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins has the potential to captivate even those unfamiliar with the Musou genre, thanks to its epic battles. With a vast map, plenty to explore, and an extensive storyline, it’s a memorable experience.

-------------

**[Atomix](https://opencritic.com/outlet/458/atomix)** - [Sebastian Quiroz](https://opencritic.com/critic/6511/sebastian-quiroz) - *Spanish* - [90 / 100](https://atomix.vg/review-dynasty-warriors-origins/)

>Koei Tecmo and Omega Force kick off the year in a fantastic fashion. Dynasty Warriors: Origins is the best Dynasty Warriors game yet. A love letter to the series, the perfect entry point for new players, and it makes it clear that the future of the series is something we should all be paying attention to.

-------------

**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Eric Van Allen](https://opencritic.com/critic/480/eric-van-allen) - [8.5 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/01/dynasty-warriors-origins-review/)

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is a brilliant new iteration of a classic formula, with some breathtaking bouts and intense action. It might not be exactly the Dynasty Warriors formula that got me into the series, but it feels like the right step for right now.

-------------

**[CGMagazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/82/cgmagazine)** - [Philip Watson](https://opencritic.com/critic/8529/philip-watson) - [8 / 10](https://www.cgmagonline.com/review/game/dynasty-warriors-origins-ps5/)

>Omega Force has been chasing the ultimate one-versus-1,000 power trip since the release of Dynasty Warriors 2 on the PlayStation 2 in 2000. Nearly 25 years

-------------

**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Mark Steighner](https://opencritic.com/critic/885/mark-steighner) - [80 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/dynasty-warriors-origins-review/)

>By not numbering this latest game, the developers are signaling a rebirth of the series. In many ways that’s true. The action-RPG mechanics and narrative-heavy design bring the franchise in line with other ARPGs. At the same time, Dynasty Warriors: Origins is still a Musou game at heart. The immense battles fans of the genre love are still there. There’s less of a repetitive feeling this time around, and the game should be successful in courting new players coming from other ARPGs.

-------------

**[Capsule Computers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/858/capsule-computers)** - [Travis Bruno](https://opencritic.com/critic/9157/travis-bruno) - [9 / 10](https://www.capsulecomputers.com.au/2025/01/dynasty-warriors-origins-review/)

>Dynasty Warriors is back in a big way. Dynasty Warriors: Origins revamped officer combat makes dominating the battlefield a thrilling challenge while slaying thousands of fodder as satisfying as ever.

-------------

**[Cerealkillerz](https://opencritic.com/outlet/465/cerealkillerz)** - [Nick Erlenhof](https://opencritic.com/critic/8745/nick-erlenhof) - *German* - [8.5 / 10](https://cerealkillerz.org/review-dynasty-warriors-origins-fulminante-rueckkehr-der-serie-in-bestform/)

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins wipes the floor with its predecessors and finally shows how it's done again. Greatly staged mass battles, a story from a new perspective and blunt and fun gameplay. The presentation is lacking here and there, but the Musou game origin is back and is extremely fun

-------------

**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [8 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/review-dynasty-warriors-origins/)

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins contains many significant improvements in gameplay, giving us an excellent return to the series after an extended absence.

-------------

**[Daily Mirror](https://opencritic.com/outlet/561/daily-mirror)** - [Aaron Potter](https://opencritic.com/critic/2776/aaron-potter) - [4 / 5 ](https://www.mirror.co.uk/gaming/dynasty-warriors-origins-review--34455657)

>If you’re in the mood to lay waste to hundreds with a single sword swipe you’ll have a good time, but layered in on top of this simple joy are a countless number of extra reasons to keep on doing so for dozens of hours. Origins leaves me excited for this new dynasty.

-------------

**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [4 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-if-it-aint-broke-dont-fix-it-3028723/)

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins manages to tread that delightful line between nostalgia and a genuinely impressive technical offering. It retains all of the magic that makes the series so immediately recognizable while taking advantage of current-gen tech to blow previous efforts out of the water. As longtime fans will expect, the combat remains the highlight and it’s just as bonkers as ever.

-------------

**[Digital Trends](https://opencritic.com/outlet/124/digital-trends)** - [Giovanni Colantonio](https://opencritic.com/critic/6533/giovanni-colantonio) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-xbox-series-x/)

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is thrilling fun so long as you don't overthink its hollow story.

-------------

**[Digitally Downloaded](https://opencritic.com/outlet/65/digitally-downloaded)** - [Matt Sainsbury](https://opencritic.com/critic/1604/matt-sainsbury) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2025/01/review-dynasty-warriors-origins-sony-playstation-5.html)

>Overall, Dynasty Warriors Origins is a big, explosive, and massively entertaining action game, and true to its title, a conscious effort by Koei Tecmo to get back to the qualities that so many people have enjoyed from the series over the years.

-------------

**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [4 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/36312)

>Dynasty Warriors Origins offers by far the most epic battles I have ever seen in a video game. The scale of the clashes with thousands of warriors fighting each other is breathtaking. My actions as a one-man army feel immensely satisfying thanks to well-designed controls and a fun selection of weapons. The strategic elements spice up the colossal battles with a welcome dash of strategy.
>
>However, the audiovisual presentation outside of the battles is somewhat disappointing. The monotonous mission design can also become somewhat tiring later on in the game - despite the seeming variety provided by the large number of unlockable items and skills. Overall, however, these are minor points of criticism. If you are even vaguely interested in action strategy games, you should not miss out on “Dynasty Warriors Origins”.

-------------

**[Entertainment Geekly](https://opencritic.com/outlet/874/entertainment-geekly)** - [Luis Alvaro](https://opencritic.com/critic/9991/luis-alvaro) - [4 / 5](https://www.entertainmentgeekly.com/2025/01/13/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-a-refreshing-return-to-hack-and-slash-roots/)

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins successfully pushes the reset button on the series post the disappointing Dynasty Warriors 9.

-------------

**[Eurogamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [3 / 5 ](https://www.eurogamer.net/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-top-notch-hack-and-slash-stumbles-off-the-battlefield)

>Omega Force hamstrings its finest Warriors yet by going all-in on its soulless original character.

-------------

**[EvelonGames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/929/evelongames)** - [Concepción Gallego Boza - Connie](https://opencritic.com/critic/10931/concepci-n-gallego-boza-connie) - *Spanish* - [9 / 10](https://evelongames.com/analisis-de-dynasty-warriors-origins/)

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins combines intense combat, deep storytelling, and strategic mechanics to deliver a unique experience within the franchise. While not without its flaws, its strengths far outweigh any shortcomings. This analysis of Dynasty Warriors: Origins highlights that the game is undoubtedly one of the best musou titles in recent years.

-------------

**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Antonello Bello](https://opencritic.com/critic/2994/antonello-bello) - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-dynasty-warriors-origins-spettacolo-non-rivoluzione-65029.html)

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is a less revolutionary title than expected, as most of the ingenious grafts attempted by Omega Force actually come from its most successful licensed musou. That said, the Japanese developer should at least be given credit for having expertly mixed so many devilries without saturating the gameplay of the product.

-------------

**[Final Weapon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/727/final-weapon)** - [Angelus Victor](https://opencritic.com/critic/10166/angelus-victor) - [4 / 5 ](https://finalweapon.net/2025/01/13/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-the-origins-of-the-three-kingdoms/)

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is a great time, acting as an excellent entry point for newcomers and a treat for series verterans as well. There's an interesting story told across five meaty chapters, with plenty of content to see and discover. If you've yet to experience a non-spinoff in the series, Origins is the perfect place to start.

-------------

**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [Fabrice Henz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10462/fabrice-henz) - *German* - [79%](https://www.games.ch/dynasty-warriors-origins/test/review-ljLf/)

>With "" Dynasty Warriors: Origins "" there is a new start, but the battles of epic proportions remain the heart of the game.

-------------

**[Game Rant](https://opencritic.com/outlet/60/game-rant)** - [Nick Rodriguez](https://opencritic.com/critic/9277/nick-rodriguez) - [8 / 10](https://gamerant.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-review/)

>Simple, sleek, and endlessly rewarding, Dynasty Warriors Origins is a huge improvement over previous entries, and the best musuo game of the decade.

-------------

**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [Richard Wakeling](https://opencritic.com/critic/1425/richard-wakeling) - [7 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dynasty-warriors-origins-review/1900-6418327/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins evolves the long-running series, meshing its hack-and-slash core with an action-oriented slant that enhances its extravagant 14th-century warfare.

-------------

**[Gamefa](https://opencritic.com/outlet/498/gamefa)** - [Mostafa Zahedi](https://opencritic.com/critic/5596/mostafa-zahedi) - *Persian* - [7 / 10](https://gamefa.com/1117847/dynasty-warriors-origins-review/)

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is a super entertaining experience that let you unleash madness on the battlefield. That being said some issues, like repetitive side content are noticable. Nonetheless, if you're a fan of Dynasty Series, you're going to have a blast playing Dynasty Warriors Origins

-------------

**[Gamer Escape](https://opencritic.com/outlet/452/gamer-escape)** - [Timothy Hyldahl](https://opencritic.com/critic/4053/timothy-hyldahl) - [9 / 10](https://gamerescape.com/2025/01/13/review-dynasty-warriors-origins/)

>At the end of the day, I have to follow my heart. I absolutely had a blast, even as a fan of the genre who wishes that things had been done differently in a number of areas. Whether you’re a long time fan or new to the series, I have to recommend checking this out.

-------------

**[Gamer Guides](https://opencritic.com/outlet/733/gamer-guides)** - [Nathan Garvin](https://opencritic.com/critic/6763/nathan-garvin) - [62 / 100](https://www.gamerguides.com/dynasty-warriors-origins/review)

>Another attempt to reinvigorate the Dynasty Warriors franchise, but a lackluster protagonist, sidelining of series favorites and tedious dialog distracts from some solid gameplay additions.

-------------

**[Gamer.no](https://opencritic.com/outlet/913/gamer-no)** - [Øystein Furevik](https://opencritic.com/critic/10781/-ystein-furevik) - *Unknown* - [8 / 10](https://www.gamer.no/artikler/storre-og-betre-enn-nokon-sinne/518207)

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is the most ambitious title in the series to date. In addition to actually telling the story it's based on, the game gives us the biggest and most entertaining battles we've seen from Dynasty Warriors.

-------------

**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Johnny Hurricane](https://opencritic.com/critic/6599/johnny-hurricane) - [90 / 100](https://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/dynasty-warriors-origins-is-the-best-in-the-series-review/)

>As a fan of the Dynasty Warrriors series since the PlayStation 2 era, I can confidently say that Dynasty Warriors Origins is the best mainline game in the series. Needless to say, I eagerly anticipate the release of a new Dynasty Warriors: Xtreme Legends.

-------------

**[Gamersky](https://opencritic.com/outlet/597/gamersky)** - *Chinese* - [9 / 10](https://www.gamersky.com/news/202501/1868183.shtml)

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins takes a bold step towards RPG elements while retaining the classic core that has defined this long-running franchise. It breaks new ground for the series, offering a storyline that masterfully balances historical accuracy with dramatic flair. Even if you're well versed in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, this game offers a fresh perspective, evoking new emotions and insights. The combat system retains the franchise's trademark excitement while incorporating modern innovations to deliver the most immersive battlefield atmosphere in the series to date.

>I think Dynasty Warriors: Origins – with its focus on Ziluan as a character, and focused on telling a more complete RPG-like story – does a tremendous job, and focusing on those elements really helps that come to the fore.

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is not only the best entry point for newcomers, but one of the best offerings the series has had in recent memory. The intimate zoomed-in story portrays the Three Kingdoms figures as likeable and complex characters with compelling motives. Combat can be hit or miss, but there's no denying the unmatched scale and spectacle of the 1-v-1000 battles.

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins represents a commendable yet contradictory effort to rejuvenate the series. In balancing familiar elements with new features to create a refreshing experience, it loses sight of what made the originals fun and fails to improve on what made them monotonous.

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is a return to the origins of all that is good about this veteran saga. It could be given a few more nuances regarding its evolution, but within its genre, this game is the best we can find and the best exponent on Xbox Series.

>Dynasty Warriors Origins is a true masterpiece of the action genre that has now established itself as the best title in the entire Dynasty Warriors series. Omega Force and Koei Tecmo Games have exceeded all expectations, but that was to be expected given their experience in developing this legendary series of games. Dynasty Warriors Origins sets new standards and is not only the best Musou game of recent years, but also offers the most gripping and in-depth action combat system of the year, which is unrivalled and raises the bar for future Musou games. Dynasty Warriors Origins not only impresses with its captivating combat system, but also with a masterfully staged story that will keep you enthralled until the very last moment.

>Dynasty Warriors Origins puts the musou genre back on the map, so that those who haven't given it a chance can finally decide to do so. Despite not revolutionizing the scene, as it ends up being somewhat repetitive, the narrative, gameplay and technical innovations of this installment make it worth returning to Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins doesn’t just have the largest amount of enemies the series has thrown on screen at once, it also deepens its combat, improves its storytelling, and provides a healthy amount of replayability.

>The Dynasty Warriors series has a solidly enjoyable gameplay experience, but this paradoxically presents a weakness in its difficulty to innovate. However, Dynasty Warriors Origin is a definitive work that demonstrates how the series can evolve while maintaining its traditional values.

**[Just Play it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/936/just-play-it)** - [Merouane OULED SI BOUZIANE](https://opencritic.com/critic/10991/merouane-ouled-si-bouziane) - *Arabic* - [8 / 10](https://justplayit.info/reviews/dynasty-warriors-origins-review/)

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins stays true to the essence of the series, delivering massive battles and engaging combat mechanics, while placing greater emphasis on storytelling and world-building. However, the game is not without its shortcomings, such as repetitive side missions and visuals that fail to meet current-generation expectations. Despite these flaws, it offers an enjoyable experience, primarily catering to long-time fans of the franchise. New players are encouraged to try the demo first to see if the game aligns with their preferences.

>Dynasty Warriors Origins brought a much-needed revitalization to the franchise without losing sight of the elements that made it famous. With stunning graphics and the best gameplay in the series, Koei Tecmo's new title delivers one of the best — if not the best — Three Kingdoms experiences ever seen in a game.

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is an enjoyable hack-and-slash title that features an exciting story, pleasant characters, and delightfully over-the-top action gameplay. You likely know what to expect with a musou game, but this is certainly one of the better ones, even if it’s best played with some breaks in between sessions.

>Dynasty Warriors Origins breathes new life into the Musou franchise, blending a gripping narrative with refined combat mechanics and expansive exploration. While the game offers engaging storytelling and strategic depth, occasional pacing issues and repetitive side quests may deter newcomers.

>Omega Force has shown that it can still make good musou games that are not licensed or commissioned by someone else. The soft (and probably temporary) reboot of the series did exceptionally well.

>DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS is a respected musou who ranks among the best in the franchise. It maintains the solid foundations we already know, while promoting innovation and opening up space for new directions and styles for a genre that often doesn't tend to innovate much.

**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Robert Ramsey](https://opencritic.com/critic/932/robert-ramsey) - [8 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/dynasty-warriors-origins)

>In many ways, Dynasty Warriors: Origins is the series at its best. The gigantic, jaw-dropping battles, the tense wartime drama, the player-driven power trip - it's a thoroughly impressive return to form for a franchise that came so close to dismantling itself seven years ago. Origins isn't just some water-testing spin-off - this is both an evolution of the formula and a fantastic realisation of what Dynasty Warriors has always strived to be.

**[RPG Fan](https://opencritic.com/outlet/37/rpg-fan)** - [Wes Iliff ](https://opencritic.com/critic/8518/wes-iliff-) - [93%](https://www.rpgfan.com/review/dynasty-warriors-origins/)

>So long as those flaws don’t seem like deal breakers, Dynasty Warriors Origin is the easiest recommendation I’ve had in the mainline series. It’s got a more substantial format, more potent storytelling, and more engaging combat than the series has seen before. While individual elements of other games may stand out, Origins is the most complete package currently, even though it’s not the full Romance of the Three Kingdoms story.

>A largely uninteresting original story and an otherwise bloated word count aside, Dynasty Warriors Origins is a joyous balancing act of tension and spectacle that's completely reignited my interest in the series.

**[Saudi Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/455/saudi-gamer)** - *Arabic* - [8 / 10](https://www.saudigamer.com/review/dynasty-warriors-origins/)

>Dynasty Warriors Origins is heading towards the right path to revitalize the gameplay actions and presentations, but the numerous corners cut in the lore and character roster will sour the experience for long-time fans.

-------------

**[SteamDeckHQ](https://opencritic.com/outlet/920/steamdeckhq)** - [Noah Kupetsky](https://opencritic.com/critic/10844/noah-kupetsky) - [4 / 5 ](https://steamdeckhq.com/game-reviews/dynasty-warriors-origins/)

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins grew on me the more I played it, and it quickly became one of my favorite entries in the series. The focus on a singular character was one I didn't expect to enjoy so much, and Koei Tecmo did a great job with the progression system to keep me playing with the variety of weapons instead of just settling on one. The battles are just as intense as ever, and with the new mechanics and more cinematic angles, I was having a blast.
>
>I also appreciate the overworld map with the smaller Skirmishes and other missions, so I didn't have to battle the larger ones all the time. They are great ways to break up the story moments with some solid rewards. However, I do wish the story revolving around our protagonist's back story was more fleshed out. Some of the mechanics that are locked until you beat the game should really be usable before beating the game, but it does give a good reason to come back and play more.
>
>I was also quite impressed with how well it runs on the Steam Deck. It isn't perfect, but the preset for the settings works quite well, and it doesn't need upscaling, which keeps everything looking sharp. For a game like this, it is essential, and because of the optimization they put in, it's very playable on the go. I love playing this in the palm of my hands, and even with the sacrifices to battery and frame rate, it's still very worthwhile.

**[The Games Machine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/497/the-games-machine)** - [Danilo Dellafrana](https://opencritic.com/critic/3695/danilo-dellafrana) - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://www.thegamesmachine.it/dynasty-warriors-origins/dynasty-warriors-origins-recensione/)

>The rebirth of the Musou dynasty starts with Dynasty Warriors: Origins. A greater emphasis on duels against officers and bosses combines with better management of battlefield resources to give Tecmo Koei's armies a new soul. Not being able to directly impersonate its legendary heroes weighs a bit and the absence of a multiplayer mode almost feels like an affront, but nevertheless this is the restart the series needed.

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is a perfect new approach to a beloved franchise. With highly customizable combat options, epic battles with a lot of variety, and superb storytelling accompanied by excellent character development moments, it is a remarkable game from start to finish.

-------------

**[The Outerhaven Productions](https://opencritic.com/outlet/335/the-outerhaven-productions)** - [Scott Adams](https://opencritic.com/critic/8755/scott-adams) - [4.5 / 5 ](https://www.theouterhaven.net/2025/01/dynasty-warriors-origins-pc-review-welcome-back-destiny-mode/)

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is the series returning to a war simulator that adds a lot of tension with pushing your army closer to the enemy as a focus. The morale system comes back, but you are no longer able to play as any character you want.

-------------

**[TheGamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/731/thegamer)** - [Stacey Henley](https://opencritic.com/critic/7588/stacey-henley) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://www.thegamer.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-review/)

>A mostly bland story and a lack of additional playable characters are the major faults with Dynasty Warriors: Origins. It is the most polished, mechanically rewarding, and technically impressive game in the series so far, and an easy pickup for fans of the franchise, provided they're open to new ideas like the parry system and original, single lead.

-------------

**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Jim Hargreaves](https://opencritic.com/critic/309/jim-hargreaves) - [9 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/13/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-the-best-musuo-game-ever/)

>As someone who has zealously played every entry in the series since its inception more than two decades ago, I'd say Dynasty Warriors: Origins is the best Musou game ever. After years of unsurprising reiteration and plenty of misfires, Omega Force has delivered a smart and super polished reinvention of the Musou franchise that corrects so many of its past shortcomings.

-------------

**[WayTooManyGames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/742/waytoomanygames)** - [Leonardo Faria](https://opencritic.com/critic/6932/leonardo-faria) - [7.5 / 10](https://waytoomany.games/2025/01/13/review-dynasty-warriors-origins/)

>No multiplayer and an underwhelming (and voiceless) protagonist make Dynasty Warriors: Origins feel a bit less content-heavy than its predecessors, but it retains the core aspects that make a Musou game so much fun in the first place. Do I think that some of the new features Omega Force has decided to focus on are pointless? Sure, I personally wouldn’t have tried to make the progression and pacing feel as glacial as one from a JRPG, but I won’t say I didn’t have my fair share of dumb fun with Origins. Unlike its disastrous predecessor, it is a really fun experience, putting the franchise back in the spotlight in a good way.

**[Windows Central](https://opencritic.com/outlet/515/windows-central)** - [Michael Hoglund ](https://opencritic.com/critic/10107/michael-hoglund-) - [4 / 5 ](https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/dynasty-warriors-origins-review)

>While the absence of being able to select from a roster of heroes pains me, the across-the-board gains to other gameplay systems, as a result, pay off. Especially after the disaster that was Dynasty Warriors 9, Origins gets Omega Force back to their roots in a way I didn't know I craved. A must-buy for any fan of the series.

-------------

**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris ""Atom"" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [8 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/1/13/reviews/144723-ps5-review-dynasty-warriors-origins/)

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is a solid addition to the franchise. It's not the newest numbered game in the series, but I enjoyed it more than Dynasty Warriors 9. It has a solid core set of mechanics and some really excellent level design. The only thing holding it back is that the focus on a single character and a relatively smaller number of weapons makes it feel empty compared to the games it will likely be compared to. If you're a fan of the franchise, there is a lot to like in Origins, and it's the ideal starting point for newcomers who want to get into the Romance of the Three Kingdoms part of the Warriors franchise.

>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is a brilliant reboot of the series. Playing as a central character instead of hopping between classic heroes works. It looks damned good most of the time, sounds great, and features an excellent mix of group and single-fighter combat. For those new or returning to the series you’ll find dozens of hours of combative bliss.

Existence itself

( I am Abaddon. God of Chaos. slicer of multiverse. Father of all monsters. Long time ago, existence invaded my empire. My monster children betrayed me. And that women prisoned me in this dimension. )

Abaddon introduces himself ;

Abaddon, known as the God of Chaos, is the archenemy of the entire Hellaverse universe. He is a divine being responsible for the greatest breaking points of creation, including the release of evil, the expulsion of Lucifer from heaven, Cain killing Abel, and the crucifixion of Jesus. He is the author of ( the Book of Monsters ), an encyclopedia of black magic that is considered the bible for modern monsters. The opposite of Asherah, the representative of the order, is the creator of all known and unknown monsters, especially Abaddon Cthulhu, Nyarlathotep Yog Sothoth and Azathoth.

Origin story ;

Abaddon, which suddenly appeared years before the creation of the Hellaverse universe and even before nothingness itself, is the embodiment of chaos and at the same time its source. When he first appeared, Abaddon was a nearly omnipotent being. First he created his greatest masterpiece, the primordial beasts, and made them fight each other. But immediately after her, her opposite, Asherah, the goddess of order, appeared. The two engaged in a great battle. Abaddon gained the upper hand throughout the battle, but Asherah created beings of pure energy called the light beyond the stars to even the odds. With the help of the light beyond the stars, his forced entry into a physical body, and the betrayal of his own creation, Cthulhu, he was defeated and banished to entropy. But this was not the end for him. Even though his physical body was shattered into pieces, a tiny part of his essence still lingered in existence.Later, this part of Abaddon's essence was buried in the Garden of Eden.

Everything turned upside down when Lucifer gave Eve the forbidden apple, and Abaddon managed to spread to every corner of existence. . After Lucifer and Lilith fell from heaven, he manipulated them for years to create Hell and provide him with energy through the sinners who came there. When Adam and Eve came to earth, they first targeted their children, Cain and Abel. He tricked Cain and played a key role in his killing of Abel. Then he turned Cain into an immortal and mindless monster and forced him to commit murder throughout the world.  After Adam and Eve died, He corrupted Eve's soul and made her a new body in hell, turning her into roo the root of all evil. But the biggest blow he dealt to heaven was bringing about the death of Jesus. He made a representative body for himself, disguised himself as Judas, and showed the Romans where Jesus was. He watched Jesus suffer from his throne in entropy while he was being tortured, and then he killed Jesus. For years, he has rained down disasters on humanity and fed on the resulting chaos. He also wrote the book of spells called the book of monsters while in entropy in the years B.C. and sent it to the world through a portal. His book later fell into the hands of an Aztec priest named Kothall, who became his number one follower, and Kothall carried the book to the age of modern monsters. Abaddon Hellaverse was trapped in entropy while all these events were happening. However, thanks to his psychic powers, his ability to bend reality, and his essence spreading to every corner of existence, he was able to directly direct all of these events. Abaddon is worshiped as a god by many pagan sects, especially in South America, Asia, Europe, Africa and Australia. The three largest of these human-based cults that worship Abaddon are ;

Red scribes

Spokesmen of darkness

Children of Abaddon

In addition, the mother of radio demon Alastor is also a member of an African-origin cult that worships Abaddon. Not only are there countless sects around the world worshipping him, he is worshipped as a god and mahdi by both kothall and modern monsters. There are millions of xelutrons within Entropy that it can teleport to the hellaverse at will. Xelutrons are beings that are absolutely obedient to Abaddon, which is divided into different species. And apart from that, there is no information about their relationship with Abaddon. Abaddon is the creator of all the elder gods in the Lovecraft books, primarily Cthulhu, as well as Yog Sothoth, Nyarlathotep, and Azathoth. However, all of the elder gods were destroyed in the big bang, except for Cthulhu, who betrayed him in his battle with Asherah.

Personality : Abaddon is a chaotic pure evil personality. Its sole purpose is to create chaos and disorder. For this purpose, he uses both his psychic powers and his essence that spreads throughout existence to create various wars, famines, epidemics and natural disasters, especially on earth. Abaddon's ultimate goal is to escape entropy and start an apocalypse that encompasses all of existence. He has a plan for this, which he started to devise the moment he was trapped in entropy. Abaddon lacks any moral values and she knows it. Abaddon has an ice-cold mentality. Even in the most disadvantageous situations, he does not get angry and makes various plans to turn the situation to his advantage. He enjoys brutality and destruction. Abaddon has no feelings for the monsters of her own creation, seeing them merely as soldiers to use to create chaos. He feels a silent hatred for Asherah's creations and takes pleasure in the pain he inflicts on them. Abaddon through his representative body, respectively ;

Murder

Rape

Torture

Cannibalism

Genocide

Illegal experiments

Wounding a person

Causing murder

Conspiratorial

Arson

Child abuse

Child murder

Acts of terrorism

Committed countless crimes. It also opened portals from entropy to the hellaverse, physically eating planets with life on them and killing all living things on these planets. But Abaddon, all this aside, is an extremely intelligent and knowledgeable person. He has an immense wealth of knowledge thanks to his ability to see alternate pasts and futures and his essence extending to Earth, Hell and Heaven. Thanks to his telepathic powers, he can enter dreams and uses this to find new allies. He is also a very successful manipulator. He attracts living beings to his side and makes them his allies, both through telepathy and by offering them possibilities they could never have imagined. Abaddon's battle personality, however, is very different from her original personality. Abaddon takes on a cold, calm, calculating and analytical personality in battle. The basic battle strategy is to evade your opponent's attacks and use tactics to lock down your opponent's abilities. Abaddon is like a godlike force of nature in battle. With his physical attributes, his unlimited knowledge of magic, and his divine powers, he creates an effect on his opponent as if he were fighting the embodiment of hell.

Appearance : It is unknown what Abaddon's true form actually looks like. But when trapped in entropy, it has two red eyes visible in the dark and a huge grinning mouth. In his physical form, he is a 2.5-meter-tall man with charcoal-grey skin, burgundy-colored hair, and a pair of eyes with black scleras and red pupils. Since Abaddon can take the form of any creature she wishes, her appearance is constantly changing.
