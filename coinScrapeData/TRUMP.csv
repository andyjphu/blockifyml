Read this if you don't want to get banned - Trumpcoin & off-topic political commentary is not allowed here,Bitcoin,1i9xjs2,2025-01-25 16:28:36,4,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1i9xjs2/read_this_if_you_dont_want_to_get_banned/,longonbtc,,"I'm sure that you've noticed that we've been locking politically related threads in here lately and I'm going to explain why. We've been locking these threads because many of the commenters can't manage to stay on-topic when posting in threads that have anything to do with current politics. Many of the comments in these threads used to be insults, arguing about politics, and off-topic political commentary, and not about Bitcoin. But now after Trump's meme coin was recently released, more of the comments in these threads end up being about his shitcoin. It's typical for half of the comments in Trump related threads to either be about his shitcoin or about politics now, and not about bitcoin. This is why we've been locking these threads lately.

This is the Bitcoin subreddit. This is not the Trumpcoin sub. So stop commenting about Trump related shitcoins in r\/Bitcoin. Everybody in this sub is aware of Trump's shitcoin. You don't need to keep posting about it. If you want to post comments about Trump's shitcoin, then head over to r\/OfficialTrumpCoin and stop spamming about it in r\/Bitcoin. **Anybody that posts about Trump related shitcoins in r\/Bitcoin will be banned from r\/Bitcoin for 1 week.**

This is not a politics subreddit. Stop posting off-topic political commentary in r\/Bitcoin. There are countless political subreddits where you can post about politics unrelated to Bitcoin. This is not one of them. **Anybody that posts political comments that are not about Bitcoin in r\/Bitcoin will be banned from r\/Bitcoin for 1 week.**

Subsequent rule violators will be banned for longer than 1 week if we notice that you're a repeat offender. 

Let's try to keep r\/Bitcoin about Bitcoin, and not about Trumpcoin or off-topic politics. Thank you."

The whole thing Is becoming too big, Much Bitcoin traders sees It like a religion. Countries are putting people Money on cryptocurrencys. People wrongly compare cryptos with Gold, cause they are both speculative assets but gold :
1- is Limitated
2- has other uses than making Money.
3- Is real and you can touch It.
In my opinion cryptos are more like penny-stocks and packets of sub-prime.
I dont know of everyone Is being fooled or i am wrong, but the only way cryptos are not going tò crush Is that they'll become the currency in an hypotetical metaverse or web 3.0. Even if the scenario of us living in a simulation of reality exchanging items wich are not real with Money wich are not real It seems a Little distopic in my opinion. Until this Moment, crypto are only good for buying drugs online. My prevision Is that the whole cryptomarket Will crash nearly before the  Trump's term ends.
Im trying tò figure It out how tò make Money from that, if you know how tell me, if i am wrong on something tell me.

Your coworkers are documented immigrants. They entered the United States legally, thru proper border crossings and given work authorization upon entry. They are not a target for any immigration enforcement. When it comes to undocumented immigrants. They entered the country illegally, their presence inside the United States is unknown. They do not have work authorization. They are the target of the Trump administration.

Illegal migrants chose to enter the country illegally because trying to do so legally wouldn’t have been possible because of past or current legal troubles.

During the Biden administration Amazon absorbed thousands of migrants from around the world and gave them employment and opportunity. This is something that should be applauded of any employer. Amazon associates have nothing to fear. You won’t see any ICE raids in any Amazon facility."

They don't like Hispanic people and Hispanic culture.

The name Gulf of Mexico has so much history behind it. It's a gulf that has been crossed by Spanish speaking people. It was one of the most important bodies of water for the Spanish empire. But I doubt Trump and his followers know about that.

When Trump talks about this, the first thing he mentions is that ""Mexico is run by cartels"".  Yeah, the first thing Trump thinks when he thinks about Mexico is Cartels. He doesn't have a positive view on Mexico or Hispanics. To him Hispanics are all about crime."
Is anyone else here afraid to tell some friends and family members that they are atheist?,atheism,1i9xb9d,2025-01-25 16:18:02,4,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1i9xb9d/is_anyone_else_here_afraid_to_tell_some_friends/,Status-Slip9801,,"For context, I live in the southeastern US, but I'm a first-generation immigrant from a nation with a strong Christian national identity (to the point where everyone is considered to be Christian by default, if they consider themselves to be this ethnicity).

My entire family grew up \*technically\* Christian (we go to church and say the prayers) but my parents didn't make a huge deal about it at home. I have several friends and family members who are quite devout Christians. I don't resent this at all, they are all loving, kind people who are there for me and care for others around them. They do most things ""to the glory of God,"" and when I'm having dinner with them, out somewhere, or at holidays, there is always prayer involved.

I grew up believing the fundamentalist teachings of evangelical Christianity that I was basically indoctrinated into, but I've been atheist for over a decade. I've never told \*any\* of my family members, or any of my close Christian friends, that I do not believe anything about the divinity of Jesus or that anything in the Bible should be taken literally. I have several reasons; I genuinely fear that they would be terrified for my ""eternal soul"" and genuinely waste their mental bandwidth trying to convince me of the error of my ways. I never discuss religion or God with them; if they try to pray I close my eyes and follow along for the hell of it.

I genuinely think that I'm as likely to convince a single one of my friends and family members that everything they've been indoctrinated into their entire lives is a lie, as I am to convince Donald Trump to convert to Islam. So basically, my justification is that I value my relationship with them over their knowing that I don't believe in the religion I was raised in.

So for you all who were raised in religious households or have religious friends, how do you handle these beliefs?"

I don't really know anyone who is in any branch of the military and so I am pretty unconnected from what the culture of the military is at all. I feel its a safe assumption that it probably leans far more right. But I really don't know. 

But I also have been under the assumption that the military is run by people who care about actual competency, as I thought our military was always an extremely effective machine. Considering Trump and MAGA are allergic to competency, are there people in the military who are willing to stand up to do the right thing or has the brainrot already infected those circles? 

Like if worst case scenario Trump genuinely tried to use the military on US Citizens to impose his will, would people willingly go along with it? Or is there enough people who actually have some shred of principles and don't just bow down to daddy Trump involved that it would never get that far?"

Uma adolescente pobre e de várias minorias, sem voz, sem alcance, sem poder de fala. E isso me frustra, claro.

Tem tantas coisas acontecendo apenas nesse primeiro mês que me deixa mal. A eleição de Trump foi um desastre para nós que sabemos o que cada palavra, cada ação dele significa. As coisas que ele apoia são horrendas, ao ponto de infringir os direitos humanos e isso não só enoja a mim como várias pessoas. Elon Musk que é alguém(infelizmente) influente e fazendo um gesto nazi em rede internacional significa muito. Pessoas com dinheiro sempre tiveram mais poder, mandaram no mundo, e ver que duas pessoas abertamente preconceituosas e que podem até ser consideradas nazistas me chateia mundo. Eu sinto que o mundo está andando para trás, e vendo que só com uma eleição de um país fez abrir tantas portas para diminuir, oprimir e odiar qualquer outro ser humano que fuja dos ""padrões da sociedade"" me deixa mal. Eu sinto medo por mim, sinto medo pela minha mãe, minhas primas, avós, tias, e por todas as mulheres do mundo, já que pelo visto nós vamos ser as primeiras as ser silenciadas e oprimidas DE NOVO depois de anos de luta me frustra tanto... Ver mulheres, lgbts, negros, tudo quanto é minoria romantizando o passado, enojando o feminismo pautas sociais extremamente importantes e parando de lutar pelos seus direitos me dá vontade de mandar todos irem estudar, recomendar livros importantes para entender a situação de agora, mas, quem iria me ouvir? Eu sou só uma adolescente. Muitas pessoas são influenciadas desde a infância pela política dos pais, e tem gente que nem faz esforço para entender o outro lado da moeda, de quem realmente sofre com isso, o que vai acontecer futuramente se não lutarmos contra.

Eu queria ser mais pacifista, realmente queria. Eu acredito sim que certas coisas só vão ser ouvidas através da violência, mas acho que poderia ser o último recurso. Porém vendo pessoas se recusando e negando soluções viáveis, pedidos de ajuda, me entristece tanto que ultimamente eu acho que o melhor a se fazer seria começar uma revolução. De novo. Por algo que nós já tínhamos minimamente conquistado e perdemos tudo de novo com um estalar de dedos.

We are utterly devastated that Trump was elected to a second term and terrified for our one and three-year-old boys who will have to go through a completely gutted education system. 

We are seriously considering moving to another country. I have traveled the world extensively when I was younger but I never made it to the Nordic countries. However I was always intrigued because the quality of life has always been so high there. 

My wife and I are going to try and visit Sweden and a couple other Nordic countries this Spring or Summer. 

My question is, if we loved it and decided to move, how welcome do you think we would be? Our political and economic ideals align well with the Nordic countries. We are both educated and very hard-working and believe in a strong educational background for our children and a strong work ethic. 

As you can see by this post, I of course don't speak the language, but it would be something we would be more than happy to learn in order to assimilate into your culture. I know the rest of the world is laughing at Americans now, as they should, because 50% of our country has completely lost their minds. But at this point, I'm more worried for my children and where they'll grow up.

$TRUMP Analysis from  former bank regulator and long-time crypto follower.,OfficialTrumpCoin,1i9x3ox,2025-01-25 16:08:36,6,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OfficialTrumpCoin/comments/1i9x3ox/trump_analysis_from_former_bank_regulator_and/,TrumpDynastyCoin,General,"I want to share my perspective on $TRUMP with you all. I was a risk management bank examiner at the FDIC from 2008 to 2020. I came in after college. 

When Bitcoin started making headlines, I would ask senior examiners what they thought of it and the ambition of the Bitcoin community to ""replace the banking system"" as the community was promising.

Consensus was, since this is not a government backed financial instrument, it is instead a very risky commodity because the government can shut it down (see China for details of a country doing just that).  If there was any threat to the Federal Reserve system or the US's ability to manage inflation, the government would end the currency unless they decided to adopt their own.

Their assessment has been correct thus far. Modern banking is a system of institutions taking deposits and lending them to creditworthy borrowers. None of the crypto coins even touch this function. The only lending going on that I'm aware of in crypto (without fiat conversion) is trustless margin loans.  This means that no one is going to lend to you for your house or your car or your business because they would have to perform trust analysis (credit analysis) that you are good for paying them back.  To this day, crypto is a trustless system. Actual banking is a trustful system, where the repayment capacity of a borrower and the repayment history develops that trust.

Instead, crypto is a highly price-volatile money transfer system. That's it. None of the utility functions or communities create any value (distributable profit) that meaningfully justifies these coins beyond hype pumping. As a result, the crypto that isn't used as a transfer system, are instead casino games where the exchanges are the casinos.

All this being said, I believe that $TRUMP has the power of media in the U.S. and the power of MAGA to force it into government adoption.  I also think that Trump will wisely try to regulatory capture a coin or two, meaning that he will dismiss all other coins and continue to call crypto a fraud, besides the selected coins that he names as legitimate. He has a multi-billion dollar incentive to make his coin one of the regulatory captured cryptocurrencies. Dumping $TRUMP or sitting on the sidelines is a bet that he won't do this.

So far, the senior examiners I worked with have been 100% correct about Bitcoin and crypto. They will still be correct about it if the U.S. government adopts crypto, because that is what they said is lacking to legitimize it as a real currency. For now we are dealing with the equivalent of buying and selling digitized pokemon cards. Trump has the power to change that and he will if it means he and his people stand to make billions (hint, at 80% ownership, it stands to make the Trump dynasty trillions). MMW

So, why do these examiners opinions matter? They have 40+ years evaluating the financial viability of financial institutions. Most people in these subs don't even know that a deposit to a bank is a liability on a bank's balance sheet (a loan from the borrower to the bank). 99% of the crypto community are gamblers but they don't even know what game they are playing. Are you one of them?

Trump can initially bring $TRUMP into the ""digital asset reserves"" and then his family can try to use his crypto-king wealth and MAGA following to copy Elon and appoint future presidents. A line of future presidents can eventually adopt $TRUMP as the U.S. currency. He could also use levers over inflation (such as his tariffs) to destabilize trust in the USD to advance the likelihood of adoption.

The last paragraph is my speculation. It's not a long con. It's Trump saying, ok... congrats Bitcoin, you have proven that crypto is a viable currency. I will take it from here, the first US crypto will have my name and face on it. It is the legitimization of crypto that we have all been anticipating. Place your bets wisely, because all crypto outside of the regulatory captures coins will be devastated."

I know we've all seen the Science article (https://www.science.org/content/article/trump-hits-nih-devastating-freezes-meetings-travel-communications-and-hiring) and many of us have already been affected by the NIH funding changes as they relate to admission to certain graduate programs.

How likely is it that these administrative policies will extend beyond the NIH and affect funding opportunities like the NSF GRFP? Is it possible that the number of students they can award will be reduced this year?

Not trying to be alarmist, but I would appreciate hearing people's perspectives :)"
