Week 42!  Yo forty two let‚Äôs goooo!

As one commenter put it; longer than some seasons of TV shows. (Or two!)
With the holidays behind us it‚Äôs time to get started on your backlog of novels! Here‚Äôs some to go for! 

This series is about coming together to bring attention to novels that need that extra help in the eyes of the community. Whether overlooked or underrated. 

If enough of us found, read, and reviewed a book like Greatest Dragon Rider In The West, Wings over Marseilles, or Thule the fast food barbarian we could make the difference in the authors worlds to motivate them further and bring them, and us, progress/success. No one can say these posts don‚Äôt help when authors themselves see them weekly and comments still come in from the sub.  

TWO VERY IMPORTANT POINTS:

1.  The parameters for submitting a novel are near the end. READ THE RULES. 

2.  The section listing the successes will be in the comments of the post. 

Without further ado, here‚Äôs the current list of novels that could use some love from us here in the sub! Terrible voice impression: Do it! Read them now!

Please if you could help add to this list we can, and have made a difference already. Turn a hidden gem into a bright light. The quality and quantity are out there if we lend a hand to our fellow readers and authors. 

It‚Äôs heartwarming to check these novels each week, watching those numbers rise. It‚Äôs good to see the appreciation and interactions. 


HERE ARE THE NEW RULES for adding fictions to this list as well as a few notes: 

1. Novel must have premiered at least SIX MONTHS PRIOR to the posting of THIS WEEKS list. Keeps the post from overflowing. 


2. I have not and will not exclude any author from suggesting a novel for this post. The entire point of me making these posts is to show love to the novels in our genre that need it. Authors see interactions and they write more. 


3. Novels must have less than 300 reviews. This is the number beside the gold star rating on Amazon specifically. No Goodreads or any other site at this time. 

4. We don‚Äôt use star ratings, authors tell me it‚Äôs terrible. 

5. Omnibus will not be added to the list. Only single novels/within a series. one day I may do a post about omnibus‚Äô exclusively. 

6. TLDR sequels never do as well as premiers but that is the point of what this post can help with/ 
This means that if book 3 of a 5 book series meets all criteria but the others don‚Äôt, it will fit. 

7. I have to moderate how many works from an author can be listed at a time. 

8. I will not remove a novel from the current list as of ( June 23rd) even if some of them will not meet the new rules. It would be cruel to those authors for them to lose the support now. 


After discussion and suggestions with our top fan indigowhyte/others I will be rotating in 1-3 new titles from those lists and others occasionally (meaning every few weeks), This way I‚Äôm keeping fresh titles coming and going. 

these changes are made from direct feedback from the community, including authors and mods. You can never make everyone happy as they say but this post doesnt have ground for complaints since it‚Äôs just about what‚Äôs on the tin, bringing attention to some novels that need it. I‚Äôd like to say right here that I am sorry to all authors that I won‚Äôt be able to show off any new releases, it was the biggest complaint I received. 


As a personal note I will not engage with any accusation that I receive any benefit monetarily or otherwise by adding authors or works. 

Favoritism is not possible when the members of the sub have to comment on the posts for me to consider a novel. I do not add novels myself. Authors themselves have expressed reluctance to suggest more of their own work until it passes above 300 so they don‚Äôt flood things.

The patience you all show is wonderful for both IRL and technical issues. 

Changes will have to happen for this list to survive. I hope you all understand and remember the spirit of what this list is supposed to be. "

Advice for renter with dust and mold allergy,CleaningTips,1i0qyvh,2025-01-13 17:45:00,6,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i0qyvh,InformalStation1014,Bathroom,"***I have not attempted to clean the first 3 pictures***

I moved about 3 months ago and have been attempting to tackle all the dust & mold that is present. I suspect the carpets in the bedrooms and living room, maybe popcorn ceilings could be reasons for dust. I have vacuumed very thoroughly, and that has helped alot. But I have noticed my Reactive Airway Disease (RAD) is still more active than usual. There has been mold in the bathroom and we clean it atleast once a week, i figured because there is no windows it needs a better ventilation. I‚Äôve asked my landlord to send someone to clean the vents and it‚Äôs my responsibility, the kicker is my exposure to cleaning vapors and dust and mold. With that being said, my handy dandy boyfriend with willing to take over after I had an asthma attack after cleaning the bathroom. The third picture is a gas heater that I decided would be fine to unscrew and soak to clean the vent off. 

Question: is this a safe amount to handle without professional help? Leave it be? Or Should I hire a professional?"

Please if you could help add to this list we can, and have made a difference already. Turn a hidden gem into a bright light. The quality and quantity are out there if we lend a hand to our fellow readers and authors. 

It‚Äôs heartwarming to check these novels each week, watching those numbers rise. It‚Äôs good to see the appreciation and interactions. 


HERE ARE THE NEW RULES for adding fictions to this list as well as a few notes: 

1. Novel must have premiered at least SIX MONTHS PRIOR to the posting of THIS WEEKS list. Keeps the post from overflowing. 


2. I have not and will not exclude any author from suggesting a novel for this post. The entire point of me making these posts is to show love to the novels in our genre that need it. Authors see interactions and they write more. 


3. Novels must have less than 300 reviews. This is the number beside the gold star rating on Amazon specifically. No Goodreads or any other site at this time. 

4. We don‚Äôt use star ratings, authors tell me it‚Äôs terrible. 

5. Omnibus will not be added to the list. Only single novels/within a series. one day I may do a post about omnibus‚Äô exclusively. 

6. TLDR sequels never do as well as premiers but that is the point of what this post can help with/ 
This means that if book 3 of a 5 book series meets all criteria but the others don‚Äôt, it will fit. 

7. I have to moderate how many works from an author can be listed at a time. 

8. I will not remove a novel from the current list as of ( June 23rd) even if some of them will not meet the new rules. It would be cruel to those authors for them to lose the support now. 


After discussion and suggestions with our top fan indigowhyte/others I will be rotating in 1-3 new titles from those lists and others occasionally (meaning every few weeks), This way I‚Äôm keeping fresh titles coming and going. 

these changes are made from direct feedback from the community, including authors and mods. You can never make everyone happy as they say but this post doesnt have ground for complaints since it‚Äôs just about what‚Äôs on the tin, bringing attention to some novels that need it. I‚Äôd like to say right here that I am sorry to all authors that I won‚Äôt be able to show off any new releases, it was the biggest complaint I received. 


As a personal note I will not engage with any accusation that I receive any benefit monetarily or otherwise by adding authors or works. 

Favoritism is not possible when the members of the sub have to comment on the posts for me to consider a novel. I do not add novels myself. Authors themselves have expressed reluctance to suggest more of their own work until it passes above 300 so they don‚Äôt flood things.

The patience you all show is wonderful for both IRL and technical issues. 

Changes will have to happen for this list to survive. I hope you all understand and remember the spirit of what this list is supposed to be. "

Week 40

As one commenter put it; longer than some seasons of TV shows. (Or two!)
With the holidays behind us it‚Äôs time to get started on your backlog of novels! Here‚Äôs some to go for! 

This series is about coming together to bring attention to novels that need that extra help in the eyes of the community. Whether overlooked or underrated. 

If enough of us found, read, and reviewed a book like Greatest Dragon Rider In The West, Wings over Marseilles, or Thule the fast food barbarian we could make the difference in the authors worlds to motivate them further and bring them, and us, progress/success. No one can say these posts don‚Äôt help when authors themselves see them weekly and comments still come in from the sub.  

TWO VERY IMPORTANT POINTS:

1.  The parameters for submitting a novel are near the end. READ THE RULES. 

2.  The section listing the successes will be in the comments of the post. 

Without further ado, here‚Äôs the current list of novels that could use some love from us here in the sub!

5. Omnibus will not be added to the list. Only single novels/within a series. one day I may do a post about omnibus‚Äô exclusively. 

6. TLDR sequels never do as well as premiers but that is the point of what this post can help with/ 
This means that if book 3 of a 5 book series meets all criteria but the others don‚Äôt, it will fit. 

7. I have to moderate how many works from an author can be listed at a time. 

8. I will not remove a novel from the current list as of ( June 23rd) even if some of them will not meet the new rules. It would be cruel to those authors for them to lose the support now. 


After discussion and suggestions with our top fan indigowhyte/others I will be rotating in 1-3 new titles from those lists and others occasionally (meaning every few weeks), This way I‚Äôm keeping fresh titles coming and going. 

these changes are made from direct feedback from the community, including authors and mods. You can never make everyone happy as they say but this post doesnt have ground for complaints since it‚Äôs just about what‚Äôs on the tin, bringing attention to some novels that need it. I‚Äôd like to say right here that I am sorry to all authors that I won‚Äôt be able to show off any new releases, it was the biggest complaint I received. 


As a personal note I will not engage with any accusation that I receive any benefit monetarily or otherwise by adding authors or works. 

Favoritism is not possible when the members of the sub have to comment on the posts for me to consider a novel. I do not add novels myself. Authors themselves have expressed reluctance to suggest more of their own work until it passes above 300 so they don‚Äôt flood things.

The patience you all show is wonderful for both IRL and technical issues. 

Changes will have to happen for this list to survive. I hope you all understand and remember the spirit of what this list is supposed to be. "

I hopr this tag is correct, even if technically I'm not asking specifically for mods.

After a *long* time without touching Cities Skylines 1, I've come back to it once more now that I have time for it but found the Steam Workshop even more frustrating than before in the search for good maps to play on, probably because of the decrease in activity. Now, of course I have personal preferences on what I want my maps to be like and can elaborate on it if asked, but I encourage you to list any you enjoy so this post may be useful to more people than just me.

Thanks in advance for any and all suggestions."

Week 39 and the holidays!! The Holidays are here! Right now! Look for deals! Probably just the next week left on some truly sweet prices yall!

As one commenter put it; longer than some seasons of TV shows. (Or two!)

REMEMBER TO BUY THESE BOOKS DURING HOLIDAY DEALS IF YOUVE BEEN TRYING TO SAVE MONEY! It still helps the authors. It always will. 

This series is about coming together to bring attention to novels that need that extra help in the eyes of the community. Whether overlooked or underrated. 

If enough of us found, read, and reviewed a book like Greatest Dragon Rider In The West, Wings over Marseilles, or Thule the fast food barbarian we could make the difference in the authors worlds to motivate them further and bring them, and us, progress/success. 

TWO VERY IMPORTANT POINTS:

1.  The parameters for submitting a novel are near the end. READ THE RULES. 

2.  The section listing the successes will be in the comments of the post. 

Without further ado, here‚Äôs the current list of novels that could use some love from us here in the sub!

Please if you could help add to this list we can, and have made a difference already. Turn a hidden gem into a bright light. The quality and quantity are out there if we lend a hand to our fellow readers and authors. 

It‚Äôs heartwarming to check these novels each week, watching those numbers rise. It‚Äôs good to see the appreciation and interactions. 


HERE ARE THE NEW RULES for adding fictions to this list as well as a few notes: 

1. Novel must have premiered at least SIX MONTHS PRIOR to the posting of THIS WEEKS list. Keeps the post from overflowing. 


2. I have not and will not exclude any author from suggesting a novel for this post. The entire point of me making these posts is to show love to the novels in our genre that need it. Authors see interactions and they write more. 


3. Novels must have less than 300 reviews. This is the number beside the gold star rating on Amazon specifically. No Goodreads or any other site at this time. 

4. We don‚Äôt use star ratings, authors tell me it‚Äôs terrible. 

5. Omnibus will not be added to the list. Only single novels/within a series. one day I may do a post about omnibus‚Äô exclusively. 

6. TLDR sequels never do as well as premiers but that is the point of what this post can help with/ 
This means that if book 3 of a 5 book series meets all criteria but the others don‚Äôt, it will fit. 

7. I have to moderate how many works from an author can be listed at a time. 

8. I will not remove a novel from the current list as of ( June 23rd) even if some of them will not meet the new rules. It would be cruel to those authors for them to lose the support now. 


After discussion and suggestions with our top fan indigowhyte/others I will be rotating in 1-3 new titles from those lists and others occasionally (meaning every few weeks), This way I‚Äôm keeping fresh titles coming and going. 

these changes are made from direct feedback from the community, including authors and mods.

Please if you could help add to this list we can, and have made a difference already. Turn a hidden gem into a bright light. The quality and quantity are out there if we lend a hand to our fellow readers and authors. 

It‚Äôs heartwarming to check these novels each week, watching those numbers rise. It‚Äôs good to see the appreciation and interactions. 


HERE ARE THE NEW RULES for adding fictions to this list as well as a few notes: 

1. Novel must have premiered at least SIX MONTHS PRIOR to the posting of THIS WEEKS list. Keeps the post from overflowing. 


2. I have not and will not exclude any author from suggesting a novel for this post. The entire point of me making these posts is to show love to the novels in our genre that need it. Authors see interactions and they write more. 


3. Novels must have less than 300 reviews. This is the number beside the gold star rating on Amazon specifically. No Goodreads or any other site at this time. 

4. We don‚Äôt use star ratings, authors tell me it‚Äôs terrible. 

5. Omnibus will not be added to the list. Only single novels/within a series. one day I may do a post about omnibus‚Äô exclusively. 

6. TLDR sequels never do as well as premiers but that is the point of what this post can help with/ 
This means that if book 3 of a 5 book series meets all criteria but the others don‚Äôt, it will fit. 

7. I have to moderate how many works from an author can be listed at a time. 

8. I will not remove a novel from the current list as of ( June 23rd) even if some of them will not meet the new rules. It would be cruel to those authors for them to lose the support now. 


After discussion and suggestions with our top fan indigowhyte/others I will be rotating in 1-3 new titles from those lists and others occasionally (meaning every few weeks), This way I‚Äôm keeping fresh titles coming and going. 

these changes are made from direct feedback from the community, including authors and mods. You can never make everyone happy as they say but this post doesnt have ground for complaints since it‚Äôs just about what‚Äôs on the tin, bringing attention to some novels that need it. I‚Äôd like to say right here that I am sorry to all authors that I won‚Äôt be able to show off any new releases, it was the biggest complaint I received. 


As a personal note I will not engage with any accusation that I receive any benefit monetarily or otherwise by adding authors or works. 

Favoritism is not possible when the members of the sub have to comment on the posts for me to consider a novel. I do not add novels myself. Authors themselves have expressed reluctance to suggest more of their own work until it passes above 300 so they don‚Äôt flood things.

The patience you all show is wonderful for both IRL and technical issues. 

Changes will have to happen for this list to survive. I hope you all understand and remember the spirit of what this list is supposed to be. "

Week 37  and the holidays are coming quick! Seriously! Deals are coming!! Like two weeks guys! 

As one commenter put it; longer than some seasons of TV shows. (Or two!)

REMEMBER TO BUY THESE BOOKS DURING HOLIDAY DEALS IF YOUVE BEEN TRYING TO SAVE MONEY! It still helps the authors. It always will. 

This series is about coming together to bring attention to novels that need that extra help in the eyes of the community. Whether overlooked or underrated. 

If enough of us found, read, and reviewed a book like Greatest Dragon Rider In The West, Wings over Marseilles, or Thule the fast food barbarian we could make the difference in the authors worlds to motivate them further and bring them, and us, progress/success. 

TWO VERY IMPORTANT POINTS:

1.  The parameters for submitting a novel are near the end. READ THE RULES. 

2.  The section listing the successes will be in the comments of the post. 

Without further ado, here‚Äôs the current list of novels that could use some love from us here in the sub!

We cannot wait.  I'm going to be bringing a bottle of red for dinner (only 2 of us will drink) and we'll be having martini's before hand.  

Looked in my half assed wine cellar and found a couple of interesting options, would love to know what wine you would pick.  They serve exclusively prime rib at HOPR and it's usually a baked potato side or creamed spinach.   Here is where my mind is at:

1. Paolo Bea Rosso de Veo 2015 - Sagrantino grape.  Never had that grape before, a bit nervous since I want this night to go well.  But this might be a good occasion to try it out.  It's been stored well, I've been aging it for a couple of years now.  

2. Robert Biale Zinfandel - 2021 Aldo's Vineyard.  I've had this one a couple of times, always a crowd pleaser.  

3. Dunn Vineyard Cab 2012.  Solid wine but maybe overkill for this dinner, maybe there's a better occasion for it? Only have 2 left.

4. Something from Paraduxx, maybe their proprietary red and call it a day.

5. I could also do a Pinot from Williams Selyem.

Any thoughts or recommendations?"

Week 36  and the holidays are coming quick! Seriously! Deals are coming!! 

As one commenter put it; longer than some seasons of TV shows. (Or two!)

REMEMBER TO BUY THESE BOOKS DURING HOLIDAY DEALS IF YOUVE BEEN TRYING TO SAVE MONEY! It still helps the authors. It always will. 

This series is about coming together to bring attention to novels that need that extra help in the eyes of the community. Whether overlooked or underrated. 

If enough of us found, read, and reviewed a book like Greatest Dragon Rider In The West, Wings over Marseilles, or Thule the fast food barbarian we could make the difference in the authors worlds to motivate them further and bring them, and us, progress/success. 

TWO VERY IMPORTANT POINTS:

1.  The parameters for submitting a novel are near the end. READ THE RULES. 

2.  The section listing the successes will be in the comments of the post. 

Without further ado, here‚Äôs the current list of novels that could use some love from us here in the sub!

Please if you could help add to this list we can, and have made a difference already. Turn a hidden gem into a bright light. The quality and quantity are out there if we lend a hand to our fellow readers and authors. 

It‚Äôs heartwarming to check these novels each week, watching those numbers rise. It‚Äôs good to see the appreciation and interactions. 


HERE ARE THE NEW RULES for adding fictions to this list as well as a few notes: 

1. Novel must have premiered at least SIX MONTHS PRIOR to the posting of THIS WEEKS list. Keeps the post from overflowing. 


2. I have not and will not exclude any author from suggesting a novel for this post. The entire point of me making these posts is to show love to the novels in our genre that need it. Authors see interactions and they write more. 


3. Novels must have less than 300 reviews. This is the number beside the gold star rating on Amazon specifically. No Goodreads or any other site at this time. 

4. We don‚Äôt use star ratings, authors tell me it‚Äôs terrible. 

5. Omnibus will not be added to the list. Only single novels/within a series. one day I may do a post about omnibus‚Äô exclusively. 

6. TLDR sequels never do as well as premiers but that is the point of what this post can help with/ 
This means that if book 3 of a 5 book series meets all criteria but the others don‚Äôt, it will fit. 

7. I have to moderate how many works from an author can be listed at a time. 

8. I will not remove a novel from the current list as of ( June 23rd) even if some of them will not meet the new rules. It would be cruel to those authors for them to lose the support now. 


After discussion and suggestions with our top fan indigowhyte/others I will be rotating in 1-3 new titles from those lists and others occasionally (meaning every few weeks), This way I‚Äôm keeping fresh titles coming and going. 

these changes are made from direct feedback from the community, including authors and mods. You can never make everyone happy as they say but this post doesnt have ground for complaints since it‚Äôs just about what‚Äôs on the tin, bringing attention to some novels that need it. I‚Äôd like to say right here that I am sorry to all authors that I won‚Äôt be able to show off any new releases, it was the biggest complaint I received. 


As a personal note I will not engage with any accusation that I receive any benefit monetarily or otherwise by adding authors or works. 

Favoritism is not possible when the members of the sub have to comment on the posts for me to consider a novel. I do not add novels myself. Authors themselves have expressed reluctance to suggest more of their own work until it passes above 300 so they don‚Äôt flood things.

The patience you all show is wonderful for both IRL and technical issues. 

Changes will have to happen for this list to survive. I hope you all understand and remember the spirit of what this list is supposed to be. "

Week 36  and the holidays are coming quick!

As one commenter put it; longer than some seasons of TV shows.

REMEMBER TO BUY THESE BOOKS DURING HOLIDAY DEALS IF YOUVE BEEN TRYING TO SAVE MONEY!

LAST WEEK WAS THE FIRST ‚ÄúCYCLE‚Äù
I‚Äôve mentioned this and it was suggested by mods/authors/readers. New books are cycled in and some out every few months to keep the list fresh and not something weekly readers just skim over. The novels cycled out WILL CYCLE BACK IN. Just because a book was moved this week does not mean it is gone. I would not remove support like that. (Add‚Äôl note for authors in comments) 

This series is about coming together to bring attention to novels that need that extra help in the eyes of the community. Whether overlooked or underrated. 

If enough of us found, read, and reviewed a book like Greatest Dragon Rider In The West, Wings over Marseilles, or Thule the fast food barbarian we could make the difference in the authors worlds to motivate them further and bring them, and us, progress/success. 

TWO VERY IMPORTANT POINTS:

1.  The parameters for submitting a novel are near the end. READ THE RULES. 

2.  The section listing the successes will be in the comments of the post.

Please if you could help add to this list we can, and have made a difference already. Turn a hidden gem into a bright light. The quality and quantity are out there if we lend a hand to our fellow readers and authors. 

It‚Äôs heartwarming to check these novels each week, watching those numbers rise. It‚Äôs good to see the appreciation and interactions. 


HERE ARE THE NEW RULES for adding fictions to this list as well as a few notes: 

1. Novel must have premiered at least SIX MONTHS PRIOR to the posting of THIS WEEKS list. Keeps the post from overflowing. 


2. I have not and will not exclude any author from suggesting a novel for this post. The entire point of me making these posts is to show love to the novels in our genre that need it. Authors see interactions and they write more. 


3. Novels must have less than 300 reviews. This is the number beside the gold star rating on Amazon specifically. No Goodreads or any other site at this time. 

4. We don‚Äôt use star ratings, authors tell me it‚Äôs terrible. 

5. Omnibus will not be added to the list. Only single novels/within a series. one day I may do a post about omnibus‚Äô exclusively. 

6. TLDR sequels never do as well as premiers but that is the point of what this post can help with/ 
This means that if book 3 of a 5 book series meets all criteria but the others don‚Äôt, it will fit. 

7. I have to moderate how many works from an author can be listed at a time. 

8. I will not remove a novel from the current list as of ( June 23rd) even if some of them will not meet the new rules. It would be cruel to those authors for them to lose the support now. 


After discussion and suggestions with our top fan indigowhyte/others I will be rotating in 1-3 new titles from those lists and others occasionally (meaning every few weeks), This way I‚Äôm keeping fresh titles coming and going. 

these changes are made from direct feedback from the community, including authors and mods. You can never make everyone happy as they say but this post doesnt have ground for complaints since it‚Äôs just about what‚Äôs on the tin, bringing attention to some novels that need it. I‚Äôd like to say right here that I am sorry to all authors that I won‚Äôt be able to show off any new releases, it was the biggest complaint I received. 


As a personal note I will not engage with any accusation that I receive any benefit monetarily or otherwise by adding authors or works. 

Favoritism is not possible when the members of the sub have to comment on the posts for me to consider a novel. I do not add novels myself. Authors themselves have expressed reluctance to suggest more of their own work until it passes above 300 so they don‚Äôt flood things.

The patience you all show is wonderful for both IRL and technical issues. 

Changes will have to happen for this list to survive. I hope you all understand and remember the spirit of what this list is supposed to be. "

Maybe the meme community should focus on memeing some projects with possible future Web 3.0 capabilities like HOPR.  HOPR will soon facilitate a Web 3.0 VPN and can ultimately act as a privacy layer for Web 3.0. If it gets meme‚Äôd the real utility will only make it here faster. Use memes on tokens with possible utility to faster bring Web 3.0 functionality.   Pepe ~$9B so with this logic of utility + meme, HOPR should = >>>$9B market cap"

Week 34  and the holidays are coming quick!

A note for authors will be in the comments. 


REMEMBER TO BUY THESE BOOKS DURING HOLIDAY DEALS IF YOUVE BEEN TRYING TO SAVE MONEY!

As one commenter put it; longer than some seasons of TV shows. 



So, AFTER THIS WEEK I‚Äôll be rearranging the list quite a lot. There‚Äôs so many novels that need attention and I stated months ago that I would cycle through them. I have to keep the list moving and fresh or this will just become a post people will glaze over. Nature of advertising. (Shuffle will happen November 24th)

This series is about coming together to bring attention to novels that need that extra help in the eyes of the community. Whether overlooked or underrated. 

If enough of us found, read, and reviewed a book like Greatest Dragon Rider In The West, Wings over Marseilles, or Thule the fast food barbarian we could make the difference in the authors worlds to motivate them further and bring them, and us, progress/success. 

TWO VERY IMPORTANT POINTS:

1.  The parameters for submitting a novel are near the end. READ THE RULES. 

2.  The section listing the successes will be in the comments of the post. 

Without further ado, here‚Äôs the current list of novels that could use some love from us here in the sub!

[Solar dragons need love too 7  Virgil Knightley](https://www.amazon.com/Solar-Dragons-Need-Love-Too-ebook/dp/B0CYCQV12F) (audio)

Wow it seems like a lot of movement this last week!

Please if you could help add to this list we can, and have made a difference already. Turn a hidden gem into a bright light. The quality and quantity are out there if we lend a hand to our fellow readers and authors. 

It‚Äôs heartwarming to check these novels each week, watching those numbers rise. It‚Äôs good to see the appreciation and interactions. 


HERE ARE THE NEW RULES for adding fictions to this list as well as a few notes: 

1. Novel must have premiered at least SIX MONTHS PRIOR to the posting of THIS WEEKS list. Keeps the post from overflowing. 


2. I have not and will not exclude any author from suggesting a novel for this post. The entire point of me making these posts is to show love to the novels in our genre that need it. Authors see interactions and they write more. 


3. Novels must have less than 300 reviews. This is the number beside the gold star rating on Amazon specifically. No Goodreads or any other site at this time. 

4. We don‚Äôt use star ratings, authors tell me it‚Äôs terrible. 

5. Omnibus will not be added to the list. Only single novels/within a series. one day I may do a post about omnibus‚Äô exclusively. 

6. TLDR sequels never do as well as premiers but that is the point of what this post can help with/ 
This means that if book 3 of a 5 book series meets all criteria but the others don‚Äôt, it will fit. 

7. I have to moderate how many works from an author can be listed at a time. 

8. I will not remove a novel from the current list as of ( June 23rd) even if some of them will not meet the new rules. It would be cruel to those authors for them to lose the support now. 


After discussion and suggestions with our top fan indigowhyte/others I will be rotating in 1-3 new titles from those lists and others occasionally (meaning every few weeks), This way I‚Äôm keeping fresh titles coming and going. 

these changes are made from direct feedback from the community, including authors and mods. You can never make everyone happy as they say but this post doesnt have ground for complaints since it‚Äôs just about what‚Äôs on the tin, bringing attention to some novels that need it. I‚Äôd like to say right here that I am sorry to all authors that I won‚Äôt be able to show off any new releases, it was the biggest complaint I received. 


As a personal note I will not engage with any accusation that I receive any benefit monetarily or otherwise by adding authors or works. 

Favoritism is not possible when the members of the sub have to comment on the posts for me to consider a novel. I do not add novels myself. Authors themselves have expressed reluctance to suggest more of their own work until it passes above 300 so they don‚Äôt flood things.

The patience you all show is wonderful for both IRL and technical issues. 

Changes will have to happen for this list to survive. I hope you all understand and remember the spirit of what this list is supposed to be. "
To be completely honest,CoSRants,1gt6fme,2024-11-17 00:16:02,48,0.95,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoSRants/comments/1gt6fme/to_be_completely_honest/,MechaShock_666,,"To the people that invite others to their packs then proceed to kill/back stab/turn on them you really suck and I genuinely hopr the worst for you because what in your fucking mind thinks that's a complete ok/sane thing to do?

YOU invited that person then turn on them for no reason what so ever is such a cowardly bitch ass move


Context: i had joined this person as a hellion warden because they invited me that specific group consisted of two baruws and a nesting cavo mind you im a console player so nothing bad was said between us I was chilling then cavo started attacking me then the baruw joined in. I tried to descalate the attack by leaving because why would I stay to keep getting attacked? Well apparently they just wanted ne dead at that point because both followed me trying to gang attack me cavo stopped after realizing i was the faster creature but the Baruch so kept following me trying to kill me so i just left the server after that because the Baruw wasn't going to quit targeting me.

Shit like this is why I rarely ever join packs in the first place even if I am a much larger stronger creature because it just goes to show not even your own pack or a pack you join can be trusted

Seriously to the ones that do this bs if you create a pack invite people to it then attack your own pack mates just shows you can't be trusted what so ever"

I looked around trying to find guides on how to troubleshoot after a Benchy print, but after looking at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_7EMnQ6Rlc) and [this post](https://www.simplify3d.com/resources/print-quality-troubleshooting/), I'm coming up short as to what to fix.

Could you help me with figuring out what went wrong and what I can change in the print settings to alleviate those issues? At the moment I'm thinking there are retraction issues (zits on layer changes) and bridging issues, with maybe some overheating. Before sharing the pictures, here are the parameters for the print:

* Printer: Snapmaker A350
* Extruder/Nozzle: In Awful Shape
* Filament: [Sunlu PLA in Grey](https://www.amazon.com/Printer-Filament-SUNLU-Dimensional-Accuracy/dp/B07ZNHTZ2T/)
* Print Settings: Default normal print (0.16 mm layer height, 50 mm/s)
* Material Settings: Temp 205¬∞C (205¬∞C initial layer), build plate 50¬∞C (60¬∞C initial layer)
* Retraction Settings: Distance 5 mm, Prime and Retract Speeds 60 mm/s, Retraction Extra Prime 0 mm¬≥, Z Hopr When Retracted disabled

All the pictures are below. Thanks for your help!

Week 33 what a time that is! 


As one commenter put it; longer than some seasons of TV shows. 

So, AFTER THIS WEEK I‚Äôll be rearranging the list quite a lot. There‚Äôs so many novels that need attention and I stated months ago that I would cycle through them. I have to keep the list moving and fresh or this will just become a post people will glaze over. Nature of advertising. 

This series is about coming together to bring attention to novels that need that extra help in the eyes of the community. Whether overlooked or underrated. 

If enough of us found, read, and reviewed a book like Greatest Dragon Rider In The West, Wings over Marseilles, or Thule the fast food barbarian we could make the difference in the authors worlds to motivate them further and bring them, and us, progress/success. 

TWO VERY IMPORTANT POINTS:

1.  The parameters for submitting a novel are near the end. READ THE RULES. 

2.  The section listing the successes will be in the comments of the post. 

Without further ado, here‚Äôs the current list of novels that could use some love from us here in the sub!

[Solar dragons need love too 7  Virgil Knightley](https://www.amazon.com/Solar-Dragons-Need-Love-Too-ebook/dp/B0CYCQV12F) (audio)

Wow it seems like a lot of movement this last week!

Please if you could help add to this list we can, and have made a difference already. Turn a hidden gem into a bright light. The quality and quantity are out there if we lend a hand to our fellow readers and authors. 

It‚Äôs heartwarming to check these novels each week, watching those numbers rise. It‚Äôs good to see the appreciation and interactions. 


HERE ARE THE NEW RULES for adding fictions to this list as well as a few notes: 

1. Novel must have premiered at least SIX MONTHS PRIOR to the posting of THIS WEEKS list. Keeps the post from overflowing. 


2. I have not and will not exclude any author from suggesting a novel for this post. The entire point of me making these posts is to show love to the novels in our genre that need it. Authors see interactions and they write more. 


3. Novels must have less than 300 reviews. This is the number beside the gold star rating on Amazon specifically. No Goodreads or any other site at this time. 

4. We don‚Äôt use star ratings, authors tell me it‚Äôs terrible. 

5. Omnibus will not be added to the list. Only single novels/within a series. one day I may do a post about omnibus‚Äô exclusively. 

6. TLDR sequels never do as well as premiers but that is the point of what this post can help with/ 
This means that if book 3 of a 5 book series meets all criteria but the others don‚Äôt, it will fit. 

7. I have to moderate how many works from an author can be listed at a time. 

8. I will not remove a novel from the current list as of ( June 23rd) even if some of them will not meet the new rules. It would be cruel to those authors for them to lose the support now. 


After discussion and suggestions with our top fan indigowhyte/others I will be rotating in 1-3 new titles from those lists and others occasionally (meaning every few weeks), This way I‚Äôm keeping fresh titles coming and going. 

these changes are made from direct feedback from the community, including authors and mods. You can never make everyone happy as they say but this post doesnt have ground for complaints since it‚Äôs just about what‚Äôs on the tin, bringing attention to some novels that need it. I‚Äôd like to say right here that I am sorry to all authors that I won‚Äôt be able to show off any new releases, it was the biggest complaint I received. 


As a personal note I will not engage with any accusation that I receive any benefit monetarily or otherwise by adding authors or works. 

Favoritism is not possible when the members of the sub have to comment on the posts for me to consider a novel. I do not add novels myself. Authors themselves have expressed reluctance to suggest more of their own work until it passes above 300 so they don‚Äôt flood things.

The patience you all show is wonderful for both IRL and technical issues. 

Changes will have to happen for this list to survive. I hope you all understand and remember the spirit of what this list is supposed to be. "

Week 32


As one commenter put it; longer than some seasons of TV shows. 

I‚Äôm sick as heck so please show some patients if I screw up some numbers etc


This series is about coming together to bring attention to novels that need that extra help in the eyes of the community. Whether overlooked or underrated. 

If enough of us found, read, and reviewed a book like Greatest Dragon Rider In The West, Wings over Marseilles, or Thule the fast food barbarian we could make the difference in the authors worlds to motivate them further and bring them, and us, progress/success. 

TWO VERY IMPORTANT POINTS:

1.  The parameters for submitting a novel are near the end. READ THE RULES. 

2.  The section listing the successes will be in the comments of the post.

[Solar dragons need love too 7  Virgil Knightley](https://www.amazon.com/Solar-Dragons-Need-Love-Too-ebook/dp/B0CYCQV12F) (audio)

Wow it seems like a lot of movement this last week!

Please if you could help add to this list we can, and have made a difference already. Turn a hidden gem into a bright light. The quality and quantity are out there if we lend a hand to our fellow readers and authors. 

It‚Äôs heartwarming to check these novels each week, watching those numbers rise. It‚Äôs good to see the appreciation and interactions. 


HERE ARE THE NEW RULES for adding fictions to this list as well as a few notes: 

1. Novel must have premiered at least SIX MONTHS PRIOR to the posting of THIS WEEKS list. Keeps the post from overflowing. 


2. I have not and will not exclude any author from suggesting a novel for this post. The entire point of me making these posts is to show love to the novels in our genre that need it. Authors see interactions and they write more. 


3. Novels must have less than 300 reviews. This is the number beside the gold star rating on Amazon specifically. No Goodreads or any other site at this time. 

4. We don‚Äôt use star ratings, authors tell me it‚Äôs terrible. 

5. Omnibus will not be added to the list. Only single novels/within a series. one day I may do a post about omnibus‚Äô exclusively. 

6. TLDR sequels never do as well as premiers but that is the point of what this post can help with/ 
This means that if book 3 of a 5 book series meets all criteria but the others don‚Äôt, it will fit. 

7. I have to moderate how many works from an author can be listed at a time. 

8. I will not remove a novel from the current list as of ( June 23rd) even if some of them will not meet the new rules. It would be cruel to those authors for them to lose the support now. 


After discussion and suggestions with our top fan indigowhyte/others I will be rotating in 1-3 new titles from those lists and others occasionally (meaning every few weeks), This way I‚Äôm keeping fresh titles coming and going. 

these changes are made from direct feedback from the community, including authors and mods. You can never make everyone happy as they say but this post doesnt have ground for complaints since it‚Äôs just about what‚Äôs on the tin, bringing attention to some novels that need it. I‚Äôd like to say right here that I am sorry to all authors that I won‚Äôt be able to show off any new releases, it was the biggest complaint I received. 


As a personal note I will not engage with any accusation that I receive any benefit monetarily or otherwise by adding authors or works. 

Favoritism is not possible when the members of the sub have to comment on the posts for me to consider a novel. I do not add novels myself. Authors themselves have expressed reluctance to suggest more of their own work until it passes above 300 so they don‚Äôt flood things.

The patience you all show is wonderful for both IRL and technical issues. 

Changes will have to happen for this list to survive. I hope you all understand and remember the spirit of what this list is supposed to be. "

Section IV.M.2.a.xv: HOPR DAO (HOPR)  
  
Decoding Privacy & Decentralization: A Deep Dive into HOPR DAO's Cryptocurrency Journey  
  
Abstract  
  
This analysis explores the operational, technological, and market dynamics of HOPR DAO (HOPR), a project dedicated to enhancing privacy in the blockchain ecosystem through its innovative mixnet technology. Through a meticulous case study approach, we dissect HOPR's mechanisms for ensuring metadata privacy, examine its governance model as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), and evaluate its market performance trends. We delve into the tokenomics, scalability, and security aspects of HOPR, providing insights into its competitive positioning within the privacy-focused cryptocurrency sector. The study also assesses legal and regulatory challenges faced by HOPR, offering a perspective on how these factors influence its development and adoption. By analyzing community engagement and future technological roadmaps, this work aims to provide a holistic view of HOPR DAO's potential impact on Web3 privacy solutions, offering recommendations for stakeholders interested in the intersection of privacy, decentralization, and cryptocurrency investment.

Now fast forward to today i get home from work and i go to the bathroom and it hurt sooo much to poop and when i wiped i noticed a bit of red on the paper and now im kinda scared. I hope i just strained myself or something. Or it might be that i didnt prep well enough? Or maybe not enough lube since we started with just spit and i suggested lube cause it was hurting a little.

Week 31!


As one commenter put it; longer than some seasons of TV shows. 

This series is about coming together to bring attention to novels that need that extra help in the eyes of the community. Whether overlooked or underrated. 

If enough of us found, read, and reviewed a book like Greatest Dragon Rider In The West, Wings over Marseilles, or Thule the fast food barbarian we could make the difference in the authors worlds to motivate them further and bring them, and us, progress/success. 

TWO VERY IMPORTANT POINTS:

1.  The parameters for submitting a novel are near the end. READ THE RULES. 

2.  The section listing the successes will be in the comments of the post.

[Solar dragons need love too 7  Virgil Knightley](https://www.amazon.com/Solar-Dragons-Need-Love-Too-ebook/dp/B0CYCQV12F) (audio)

Wow it seems like a lot of movement this last week!

Please if you could help add to this list we can, and have made a difference already. Turn a hidden gem into a bright light. The quality and quantity are out there if we lend a hand to our fellow readers and authors. 

It‚Äôs heartwarming to check these novels each week, watching those numbers rise. It‚Äôs good to see the appreciation and interactions. 


HERE ARE THE NEW RULES for adding fictions to this list as well as a few notes: 

1. Novel must have premiered at least SIX MONTHS PRIOR to the posting of THIS WEEKS list. Keeps the post from overflowing. 


2. I have not and will not exclude any author from suggesting a novel for this post. The entire point of me making these posts is to show love to the novels in our genre that need it. Authors see interactions and they write more. 


3. Novels must have less than 300 reviews. This is the number beside the gold star rating on Amazon specifically. No Goodreads or any other site at this time. 

4. We don‚Äôt use star ratings, authors tell me it‚Äôs terrible. 

5. Omnibus will not be added to the list. Only single novels/within a series. one day I may do a post about omnibus‚Äô exclusively. 

6. TLDR sequels never do as well as premiers but that is the point of what this post can help with/ 
This means that if book 3 of a 5 book series meets all criteria but the others don‚Äôt, it will fit. 

7. I have to moderate how many works from an author can be listed at a time. 

8. I will not remove a novel from the current list as of ( June 23rd) even if some of them will not meet the new rules. It would be cruel to those authors for them to lose the support now. 


After discussion and suggestions with our top fan indigowhyte/others I will be rotating in 1-3 new titles from those lists and others occasionally (meaning every few weeks), This way I‚Äôm keeping fresh titles coming and going. 

these changes are made from direct feedback from the community, including authors and mods. You can never make everyone happy as they say but this post doesnt have ground for complaints since it‚Äôs just about what‚Äôs on the tin, bringing attention to some novels that need it. I‚Äôd like to say right here that I am sorry to all authors that I won‚Äôt be able to show off any new releases, it was the biggest complaint I received. 


As a personal note I will not engage with any accusation that I receive any benefit monetarily or otherwise by adding authors or works. 

Favoritism is not possible when the members of the sub have to comment on the posts for me to consider a novel. I do not add novels myself. Authors themselves have expressed reluctance to suggest more of their own work until it passes above 300 so they don‚Äôt flood things.

The patience you all show is wonderful for both IRL and technical issues. 

Changes will have to happen for this list to survive. I hope you all understand and remember the spirit of what this list is supposed to be. "

But then I thought that some books are definitely worth buying even if I read them later. Yes I know there are all non-fiction... self-help type but I think it depends on your taste. You can recommend some short fictional books.

Week 30!

I‚Äôm back! A huge thank you again to our IndygoWhite who filled in for me while I was across the country doing wild things.

As one commenter put it; longer than some seasons of TV shows. 

This series is about coming together to bring attention to novels that need that extra help in the eyes of the community. Whether overlooked or underrated. 

If enough of us found, read, and reviewed a book like Greatest Dragon Rider In The West, Wings over Marseilles, or Thule the fast food barbarian we could make the difference in the authors worlds to motivate them further and bring them, and us, progress/success. 

TWO VERY IMPORTANT POINTS:

1.  The parameters for submitting a novel are near the end. READ THE RULES. 

2.  The section listing the successes will be in the comments of the post. 

Without further ado, here‚Äôs the current list of novels that could use some love from us here in the sub!

Please if you could help add to this list we can, and have made a difference already. Turn a hidden gem into a bright light. The quality and quantity are out there if we lend a hand to our fellow readers and authors. 

It‚Äôs heartwarming to check these novels each week, watching those numbers rise. It‚Äôs good to see the appreciation and interactions. 


HERE ARE THE NEW RULES for adding fictions to this list as well as a few notes: 

1. Novel must have premiered at least SIX MONTHS PRIOR to the posting of THIS WEEKS list. Keeps the post from overflowing. 


2. I have not and will not exclude any author from suggesting a novel for this post. The entire point of me making these posts is to show love to the novels in our genre that need it. Authors see interactions and they write more. 


3. Novels must have less than 300 reviews. This is the number beside the gold star rating on Amazon specifically. No Goodreads or any other site at this time. 

4. We don‚Äôt use star ratings, authors tell me it‚Äôs terrible. 

5. Omnibus will not be added to the list. Only single novels/within a series. one day I may do a post about omnibus‚Äô exclusively. 

6. TLDR sequels never do as well as premiers but that is the point of what this post can help with/ 
This means that if book 3 of a 5 book series meets all criteria but the others don‚Äôt, it will fit. 

7. I have to moderate how many works from an author can be listed at a time. 

8. I will not remove a novel from the current list as of ( June 23rd) even if some of them will not meet the new rules. It would be cruel to those authors for them to lose the support now. 


After discussion and suggestions with our top fan indigowhyte/others I will be rotating in 1-3 new titles from those lists and others occasionally (meaning every few weeks), This way I‚Äôm keeping fresh titles coming and going. 

these changes are made from direct feedback from the community, including authors and mods. You can never make everyone happy as they say but this post doesnt have ground for complaints since it‚Äôs just about what‚Äôs on the tin, bringing attention to some novels that need it. I‚Äôd like to say right here that I am sorry to all authors that I won‚Äôt be able to show off any new releases, it was the biggest complaint I received. 


As a personal note I will not engage with any accusation that I receive any benefit monetarily or otherwise by adding authors or works. 

Favoritism is not possible when the members of the sub have to comment on the posts for me to consider a novel. I do not add novels myself. Authors themselves have expressed reluctance to suggest more of their own work until it passes above 300 so they don‚Äôt flood things.

The patience you all show is wonderful for both IRL and technical issues. 

Changes will have to happen for this list to survive. I hope you all understand and remember the spirit of what this list is supposed to be. "

Week 29!

As one commenter put it; longer than some seasons of TV shows. Few changes this week

This series is about coming together to bring attention to novels that need that extra help in the eyes of the community. Whether overlooked or underrated. 

If enough of us found, read, and reviewed a book like Greatest Dragon Rider In The West, Wings over Marseilles, or Thule the fast food barbarian we could make the difference in the authors worlds to motivate them further and bring them, and us, progress/success. 

TWO VERY IMPORTANT POINTS:

1.  The parameters for submitting a novel are near the end. READ THE RULES. 

2.  The section listing the successes will be in the comments of the post. 

Without further ado, here‚Äôs the current list of novels that could use some love from us here in the sub!

[Solar dragons need love too 7  Virgil Knightley](https://www.amazon.com/Solar-Dragons-Need-Love-Too-ebook/dp/B0CYCQV12F) (audio)


Please if you could help add to this list we can, and have made a difference already. Turn a hidden gem into a bright light. The quality and quantity are out there if we lend a hand to our fellow readers and authors. 

It‚Äôs heartwarming to check these novels each week, watching those numbers rise. It‚Äôs good to see the appreciation and interactions. 


HERE ARE THE NEW RULES for adding fictions to this list as well as a few notes: 

1. Novel must have premiered at least SIX MONTHS PRIOR to the posting of THIS WEEKS list. Keeps the post from overflowing. 


2. I have not and will not exclude any author from suggesting a novel for this post. The entire point of me making these posts is to show love to the novels in our genre that need it. Authors see interactions and they write more. 


3. Novels must have less than 300 reviews. This is the number beside the gold star rating on Amazon specifically. No Goodreads or any other site at this time. 

4. We don‚Äôt use star ratings, authors tell me it‚Äôs terrible. 

5. Omnibus will not be added to the list. Only single novels/within a series. one day I may do a post about omnibus‚Äô exclusively. 

6. TLDR sequels never do as well as premiers but that is the point of what this post can help with/ 
This means that if book 3 of a 5 book series meets all criteria but the others don‚Äôt, it will fit. 

7. I have to moderate how many works from an author can be listed at a time. 

8. I will not remove a novel from the current list as of ( June 23rd) even if some of them will not meet the new rules. It would be cruel to those authors for them to lose the support now. 


After discussion and suggestions with our top fan indigowhyte/others I will be rotating in 1-3 new titles from those lists and others occasionally (meaning every few weeks), This way I‚Äôm keeping fresh titles coming and going. 

these changes are made from direct feedback from the community, including authors and mods. You can never make everyone happy as they say but this post doesnt have ground for complaints since it‚Äôs just about what‚Äôs on the tin, bringing attention to some novels that need it. I‚Äôd like to say right here that I am sorry to all authors that I won‚Äôt be able to show off any new releases, it was the biggest complaint I received. 


As a personal note I will not engage with any accusation that I receive any benefit monetarily or otherwise by adding authors or works. 

Favoritism is not possible when the members of the sub have to comment on the posts for me to consider a novel. I do not add novels myself. Authors themselves have expressed reluctance to suggest more of their own work until it passes above 300 so they don‚Äôt flood things.

The patience you all show is wonderful for both IRL and technical issues. 

Changes will have to happen for this list to survive. I hope you all understand and remember the spirit of what this list is supposed to be. "

So here it is thankfully only a day late. I‚Äôm sorry folks. 




Week 28
As one commenter put it; longer than some seasons of TV shows

This series is about coming together to bring attention to novels that need that extra help in the eyes of the community. Whether overlooked or underrated. 

If enough of us found, read, and reviewed a book like Greatest Dragon Rider In The West, Wings over Marseilles, or Thule the fast food barbarian we could make the difference in the authors worlds to motivate them further and bring them, and us, progress/success. 

TWO VERY IMPORTANT POINTS:

1.  The parameters for submitting a novel are near the end. READ THE RULES. 

2.  The section listing the successes will be in the comments of the post. 

Without further ado, here‚Äôs the current list of novels that could use some love from us here in the sub!

Please if you could help add to this list we can, and have made a difference already. Turn a hidden gem into a bright light. The quality and quantity are out there if we lend a hand to our fellow readers and authors. 

It‚Äôs heartwarming to check these novels each week, watching those numbers rise. It‚Äôs good to see the appreciation and interactions. 


HERE ARE THE NEW RULES for adding fictions to this list as well as a few notes: 

1. Novel must have premiered at least SIX MONTHS PRIOR to the posting of THIS WEEKS list. Keeps the post from overflowing. 


2. I have not and will not exclude any author from suggesting a novel for this post. The entire point of me making these posts is to show love to the novels in our genre that need it. Authors see interactions and they write more. 


3. Novels must have less than 300 reviews. This is the number beside the gold star rating on Amazon specifically. No Goodreads or any other site at this time. 

4. We don‚Äôt use star ratings, authors tell me it‚Äôs terrible. 

5. Omnibus will not be added to the list. Only single novels/within a series. one day I may do a post about omnibus‚Äô exclusively. 

6. TLDR sequels never do as well as premiers but that is the point of what this post can help with/ 
This means that if book 3 of a 5 book series meets all criteria but the others don‚Äôt, it will fit. 

7. I have to moderate how many works from an author can be listed at a time. 

8. I will not remove a novel from the current list as of ( June 23rd) even if some of them will not meet the new rules. It would be cruel to those authors for them to lose the support now. 


After discussion and suggestions with our top fan indigowhyte/others I will be rotating in 1-3 new titles from those lists and others occasionally (meaning every few weeks), This way I‚Äôm keeping fresh titles coming and going. 

these changes are made from direct feedback from the community, including authors and mods. You can never make everyone happy as they say but this post doesnt have ground for complaints since it‚Äôs just about what‚Äôs on the tin, bringing attention to some novels that need it. I‚Äôd like to say right here that I am sorry to all authors that I won‚Äôt be able to show off any new releases, it was the biggest complaint I received. 


As a personal note I will not engage with any accusation that I receive any benefit monetarily or otherwise by adding authors or works. 

Favoritism is not possible when the members of the sub have to comment on the posts for me to consider a novel. I do not add novels myself. Authors themselves have expressed reluctance to suggest more of their own work until it passes above 300 so they don‚Äôt flood things.

The patience you all show is wonderful for both IRL and technical issues. 

Changes will have to happen for this list to survive. I hope you all understand and remember the spirit of what this list is supposed to be. "

Week 27
As one commenter put it; longer than some seasons of TV shows

This series is about coming together to bring attention to novels that need that extra help in the eyes of the community. Whether overlooked or underrated. 

If enough of us found, read, and reviewed a book like Greatest Dragon Rider In The West, Wings over Marseilles, or Thule the fast food barbarian we could make the difference in the authors worlds to motivate them further and bring them, and us, progress/success. 

TWO VERY IMPORTANT POINTS:

1.  The parameters for submitting a novel are near the end. READ THE RULES. 

2.  The section listing the successes will be in the comments of the post. 

Without further ado, here‚Äôs the current list of novels that could use some love from us here in the sub!

Please if you could help add to this list we can, and have made a difference already. Turn a hidden gem into a bright light. The quality and quantity are out there if we lend a hand to our fellow readers and authors. 

It‚Äôs heartwarming to check these novels each week, watching those numbers rise. It‚Äôs good to see the appreciation and interactions. 


HERE ARE THE NEW RULES for adding fictions to this list as well as a few notes: 

1. Novel must have premiered at least SIX MONTHS PRIOR to the posting of THIS WEEKS list. Keeps the post from overflowing. 


2. I have not and will not exclude any author from suggesting a novel for this post. The entire point of me making these posts is to show love to the novels in our genre that need it. Authors see interactions and they write more. 


3. Novels must have less than 300 reviews. This is the number beside the gold star rating on Amazon specifically. No Goodreads or any other site at this time. 

4. We don‚Äôt use star ratings, authors tell me it‚Äôs terrible. 

5. Omnibus will not be added to the list. Only single novels/within a series. one day I may do a post about omnibus‚Äô exclusively. 

6. TLDR sequels never do as well as premiers but that is the point of what this post can help with/ 
This means that if book 3 of a 5 book series meets all criteria but the others don‚Äôt, it will fit. 

7. I have to moderate how many works from an author can be listed at a time. 

8. I will not remove a novel from the current list as of ( June 23rd) even if some of them will not meet the new rules. It would be cruel to those authors for them to lose the support now. 


After discussion and suggestions with our top fan indigowhyte/others I will be rotating in 1-3 new titles from those lists and others occasionally (meaning every few weeks), This way I‚Äôm keeping fresh titles coming and going. 

these changes are made from direct feedback from the community, including authors and mods. You can never make everyone happy as they say but this post doesnt have ground for complaints since it‚Äôs just about what‚Äôs on the tin, bringing attention to some novels that need it. I‚Äôd like to say right here that I am sorry to all authors that I won‚Äôt be able to show off any new releases, it was the biggest complaint I received. 


As a personal note I will not engage with any accusation that I receive any benefit monetarily or otherwise by adding authors or works. 

Favoritism is not possible when the members of the sub have to comment on the posts for me to consider a novel. I do not add novels myself. Authors themselves have expressed reluctance to suggest more of their own work until it passes above 300 so they don‚Äôt flood things.

The patience you all show is wonderful for both IRL and technical issues. 

Changes will have to happen for this list to survive. I hope you all understand and remember the spirit of what this list is supposed to be. "
