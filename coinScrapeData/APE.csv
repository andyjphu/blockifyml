Is This The Next Big NFT Craze? Animecoin & the Rise of Anime-Inspired Crypto,altcoin,1i9sbq8,2025-01-25 12:39:57,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1i9sbq8/is_this_the_next_big_nft_craze_animecoin_the_rise/,uthred03,,"The world of NFTs is once again back on its and impacting the entire crypto industry. For the year 2024, a staggering growth of interest is being observed even at the moment, with total NFT sales in a few months crossing $1 billion. This newly found excitement is not limited to collectors alone; many brands and even industries are getting involved and are adopting NFTs into their business strategies. Such adoption is opening up new horizons of investment opportunities and innovation, making NFTs one of the most essential asset classes in crypto.

One of the top projects that gained prominence in the NFT world is the Bored Ape Yacht Club due to its lavish collection & exclusive community. Azuki has also earned a lot of followers 'cos of its anime styled art. Moreover, the World of Women project is supporting women creators, which reflects the level of diversity and inclusivity the NFT market offers. These projects are not just successful; they are regarded as the forerunners of the next stage in collectible digital assets by investors and collectors.

Welcome Animecoin, ANIME, a cryptocurrency that captures the essence of the anime culture in its digital assets. With the strength of community at its core, it seeks to give power to the artists and creators by enabling direct monetization of their work. This is a revolutionary concept in the neo-crypto landscape & its token is already trading on Bitget & some other top rated CEXs.

Just Bought RETIRE 🚀 – The Last Play Before Retirement! Who’s Joining Me? 🤑💸,memecoins,1i97050,2025-01-24 16:49:50,3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/memecoins/comments/1i97050/just_bought_retire_the_last_play_before/,High-Voltage-,,"Alright, folks, let me set the scene. I just dove headfirst into the meme coin game with a coin called RETIRE—yes, RETIRE! Because honestly, who doesn’t want to call it quits early and live the dream life funded by moonshot plays? 🌝

Here’s the lowdown:

💰 Market Cap: $3.9 MILLION (still early!)
🪙 Circulation Supply: 999 MILLION (lucky nines, anyone?)
📈 Got in via Moonshot—because where else would you find the next golden ticket to an early retirement?


I mean, the tagline alone sold me: “The last play before retire.” If that’s not manifesting my financial freedom, IDK what is. Now here’s where I need the collective ape wisdom:


1️⃣ Float Locked: Anyone know how much of the float is locked up? (Are the devs diamond hands or is someone secretly feeding their Lambo fund?)


2️⃣ Prediction Time: When’s this bad boy gonna send me packing to the beach with umbrella drinks and zero responsibilities?


3️⃣ HODL Gang Assemble: Who’s in on this play? Whether you’re bullish or just here for the memes, I want to hear from you!


If you’re reading this and thinking, “Wtf is this coin, and why does it sound like the life choice I didn’t know I needed?”… well, do your research, apes, and join the RETIRE army before this thing leaves the stratosphere. 🛫


So let’s hear it, y’all—price predictions, meme ideas, FOMO hype, and exit strategies. Or just throw some love my way for jumping in.


It’s meme coin szn. RETIRE or bust, baby.

Should I upgrade my Yellow for a Purple?,runescape,1i8wjcv,2025-01-24 09:25:13,0,0.28,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1i8wjcv/should_i_upgrade_my_yellow_for_a_purple/,Lennoxville_RS,Question,"https://preview.redd.it/qzevm53kbyee1.png?width=1002&format=png&auto=webp&s=42ce5430d9368331f66ea1bd206117b1ba93d7bd

I don't have any friends to ask to let me borrow a purple quickly to see how it looks or even ask what I should do.

I finally have enough extra in pure gold coins to upgrade from the Yellow I have now to a Purple instead but I am wondering if it's worth tying up nearly all the billions in actual coins that I have. I know that the Purple is worth more overall so maybe from that point owning a Purple shows more wealth....

but I already have some master apes that go really well with the Yellow such as the reversed herblore master cape!

I just don't know what the decision I should make. If anyone has a Purple they wouldn't mind lending me for an hour or some small time through the lent items interface please let me known.

I think that Wilder World is redefining metaverse and p2e gaming in the space or is this just my thoughts? 🤔,Crypto_General,1i8vze8,2025-01-24 08:58:59,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crypto_General/comments/1i8vze8/i_think_that_wilder_world_is_redefining_metaverse/,iamjide91,Daily Discussion,"Wilder World has gained a lot of attention in the last year, becoming a top player in Web3 gaming and the Metaverse. Their recent gameplay trailer received over 150M impressions, 2M views, and trended worldwide for over 24 hours—showing how popular this project is.  



Once not well-known, Wilder World is now the 11th most anticipated game globally on the Epic Games Store and the third largest Metaverse by market cap (after SAND, MANA, and APE), moving up over 200 spots on CoinMarketCap.  



Wilder World is an immersive Metaverse where everything—avatars, cars, land, and buildings—are NFTs. These items are not just collectibles; you can use them to race, play games, or earn rewards.  



The city of Wiami, a futuristic version of Miami, is Wilder World’s first virtual city. Players can own land, gather resources, and help shape the economy using the $WILD token.  



Partnerships with big names like NVIDIA, Samsung, and Polygon strengthen Wilder World’s potential, and a community of 3D artists creates a visually impressive experience.  



With blockchain technology providing true ownership and many opportunities for socializing, gaming, and working, Wilder World is becoming a key player in the Metaverse.

Trump Coin: You literally can’t lose 🚀 Here’s why!,OfficialTrumpCoin,1i8tku6,2025-01-24 06:46:58,46,0.83,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/OfficialTrumpCoin/comments/1i8tku6/trump_coin_you_literally_cant_lose_heres_why/,dedao4,General,"Alright folks, let’s get real for a second. The Trump Coin ($TRUMP) is NOT just another meme coin. This is bigger. This is legacy-level stuff. Let me break it down for you:

1. The Trump Family HAS to Stay Relevant

We’re talking about one of the most media-savvy families in modern history. Whether it’s politics, business, or just pure drama, the Trump name is built to stick around. The coin isn’t just about Donald J. Trump it’s about the entire family empire.

Ivanka, Don Jr., Eric, and even Barron are all set to carry the torch. The Trump brand will always be in the headlines, and $TRUMP will ride that wave.

2. Failure Isn’t an Option

Here’s the kicker: if the coin struggles, you KNOW the media (CNN) is going to be all over it. The first question in any interview or press conference will be:

“Mr. Trump, how could you let your coin fail?”

Do you really think Trump would let that happen? His ego, his brand, his legacy, it’s all tied to the success of this coin. Whether through tweets, rallies, or direct involvement, the man (and his family) have every reason to keep this coin alive and thriving.

And let’s face it, if there’s one thing Trump knows how to do, it’s win.

3. The Media LOVES a Comeback Story

Even if there’s a dip or the coin faces criticism, that only fuels the narrative. Trump and his family thrive on controversy. A rough patch for $TRUMP just sets the stage for a “Trump saves the day” storyline.

Imagine this: Trump announces a partnership with a major blockchain project or integrates the coin into his next campaign. Instant pump.


4. Upside is Huge, Downside is Small

If the coin pumps? You win.

If the coin dips? Trump and his family step in to keep it afloat.

Either way, you’re backed by a brand that can’t afford to lose.


$TRUMP isn’t just a coin; it’s a symbol of the Trump legacy. It HAS to succeed because failure isn’t an option for a family that thrives on staying in the spotlight. Whether you love or hate Trump, you can’t deny that he and his family will keep the hype alive.

Just what i think, so i bought based on this logic (for me) more. But hey who am i.

Disclaimer: Not financial advice. Just some logical ape-level thinking.

But here I am. The chart looks awful. My other coin I'm in has real strong holders. Maybe we get this spirit here, too.

I have another Idea. While every little coin community is fighting each other, just for a little fame and fortune, two groups should work hand in hand. Imagine the 3 biggest frog coins would do that.

But for what: advertisment, pushing rankings, votings. There are many possibilities. Learn from the movie: apes together strong. 

Just my 2 cents. Now let me just enjoy being part of Anarchy. Glad to be Here."

Make sure you’re ready for the ride. DYOR.

"News Just In, $Hege beats Elon to the Mars!",CryptoMarsShots,1i8erq4,2025-01-23 16:36:24,19,0.81,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarsShots/comments/1i8erq4/news_just_in_hege_beats_elon_to_the_mars/,ToShibariumandBeyond,ALTCOIN,"So why did I choose HEGE?

Well, it all started as a classic Wall Street Bets story.

Over the last few years, I'd traded penny stocks and built up a 70k profit. After holding one stock, my portfolio dropped to a 40% loss with no sign of recovery.

I then sold out and entered crypto, where I learned of Kendu Inu. This was great timing, and I rode a quick run up turning my 40k into 100k over 5 weeks.

Excited for what could come next, I found a promising token called ape and sold my Kendu to go all in. Hooked by the fast crypto gains…

About a week later, after growing my bag to 120k, in the span of a 3-hour window on a Wednesday night, whilst sleeping, the dev rugged hard.

What I was left with when I woke up, was the realisation of my wallet showing $2000 left.

Devastated, I rotated this back into Kendu, hopeful to turn it around, but it was stuck in a downtrend and continued down.

Panicked, with what was now left, I had to think. Where do I start again?

I’d be taken on a rollercoaster of emotions, with these tokens, I tried trading on BullX, watching day trader YouTube videos and kept on losing.

I then heard of a new launch from the same Kendu dev and jumped into that, hopeful it would pump. Well… it turned out to be a farming project, where my 2k ended up dwindling to $250 after about 2 months.

Feeling lost, I remembered when shilling across Reddit and X, I always saw two projects apart from Kendu.

Powsche and Hege.

Now don’t get me wrong, I’m a car guy, but I prefer my AMGs, sorry Powsche!

So, I started to investigate Hege, and what I found was very promising.

On first look, the memes were fire, with proper artists unlike the spam AI images meme coins have today, which was cool.

The stats were fire also, with no security issues, 9 months old, so clearly not a 1-week pump and dump, and even now, at a market cap of only $22M, the LP has 1.8M, 100% locked.



So, then I joined the TG.



The first thing I got was like 5 members being like oh hey! “Welcome, what doing” etc, which was a breath of fresh air.

I spoke with Chris (absolute Chad), who offered to jump on a VC and spent a good hour chatting, filling me in on the background of Hege, telling me about the plans, where I found out that Hege comes from its storybook, with chapters unlocked at certain market caps.

The story follows four characters **Hege, Hegena, Hendrix** and **Helena.**

I won’t give any more away here but go check it out for a read! - https://www.hegecoin.com/#story

For the next few weeks, I interacted with the TG and on X, saw more of the artwork, read through the unlocked chapters, and saw just the absolute legends in the TG, all while DCA’ing my way in.

I then found out about the Hegends NFTs. Hegends was an NFT launch, which not only offered something unique (again seeming to show that everything this community does is unique) as the Hegend NFTs pay out dividends to holders but also spurred holders to change their PFP to their Hegends, which is a cool way to show profile pictures across the TG and X.

So naturally I picked one up myself, and it’s pretty sick if you ask me!

I had just finished watching an NFL game, so when I saw only 1 in the whole collection listed with an NFL jersey, I knew I had to grab that one.

Since being around the TG, I’ve seen numerous competitions running, further providing value back to the holders and community. Raid and Shill competitions, artist competitions, writing competitions and more, where real-world holders are getting paid more Hege. How good!

We also had a massive announcement today, with future CEX listings and marketing in the works at a large scale, with a marketing budget now of $400,000. Yes, you read that correctly **$400,000!**



So, what does all this mean?



It means, that I now have faith again in holding my crypto bag. I have found a project where I enjoy being part of the Hege community and working for my bag. I trust the dev and the team and see daily, the hard work every holder puts in and see the future of running Hege to billions.

As always, DYOR, but for me, $HEGE is a strong contender for one of the top coins to run in 2025, and my eyes are set on that 1B MC and Beyond!

$Hege is taking me all the way!,CryptoMoon,1i8eq7s,2025-01-23 16:34:43,28,0.94,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoon/comments/1i8eq7s/hege_is_taking_me_all_the_way/,ToShibariumandBeyond,MEMECOIN,"So why did I choose HEGE?

Well, it all started as a classic Wall Street Bets story.

Over the last few years, I'd traded penny stocks and built up a 70k profit. After holding one stock, my portfolio dropped to a 40% loss with no sign of recovery.

I then sold out and entered crypto, where I learned of Kendu Inu. This was great timing, and I rode a quick run up turning my 40k into 100k over 5 weeks.

Excited for what could come next, I found a promising token called ape and sold my Kendu to go all in. Hooked by the fast crypto gains…

About a week later, after growing my bag to 120k, in the span of a 3-hour window on a Wednesday night, whilst sleeping, the dev rugged hard.

What I was left with when I woke up, was the realisation of my wallet showing $2000 left.

Devastated, I rotated this back into Kendu, hopeful to turn it around, but it was stuck in a downtrend and continued down.

Panicked, with what was now left, I had to think. Where do I start again?

I’d be taken on a rollercoaster of emotions, with these tokens, I tried trading on BullX, watching day trader YouTube videos and kept on losing.

I then heard of a new launch from the same Kendu dev and jumped into that, hopeful it would pump. Well… it turned out to be a farming project, where my 2k ended up dwindling to $250 after about 2 months.

Feeling lost, I remembered when shilling across Reddit and X, I always saw two projects apart from Kendu.

Powsche and Hege.

Now don’t get me wrong, I’m a car guy, but I prefer my AMGs, sorry Powsche!

So, I started to investigate Hege, and what I found was very promising.

On first look, the memes were fire, with proper artists unlike the spam AI images meme coins have today, which was cool.

The stats were fire also, with no security issues, 9 months old, so clearly not a 1-week pump and dump, and even now, at a market cap of only $22M, the LP has 1.8M, 100% locked.



So, then I joined the TG.



The first thing I got was like 5 members being like oh hey! “Welcome, what doing” etc, which was a breath of fresh air.

I spoke with Chris (absolute Chad), who offered to jump on a VC and spent a good hour chatting, filling me in on the background of Hege, telling me about the plans, where I found out that Hege comes from its storybook, with chapters unlocked at certain market caps.

The story follows four characters **Hege, Hegena, Hendrix** and **Helena.**

I won’t give any more away here but go check it out for a read! - [https://www.hegecoin.com/#story](https://www.hegecoin.com/#story)

For the next few weeks, I interacted with the TG and on X, saw more of the artwork, read through the unlocked chapters, and saw just the absolute legends in the TG, all while DCA’ing my way in.

I then found out about the Hegends NFTs.

ANIME Token Launches on Ethereum & Arbitrum with Azuki Backing,AltcoinAdvisor,1i8blkx,2025-01-23 14:24:29,1,0.67,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AltcoinAdvisor/comments/1i8blkx/anime_token_launches_on_ethereum_arbitrum_with/,PureClass247,DISCUSSION,"Hey guys,  
  
as someone who is into anime like  naruto, bleach, one-piece i was recently stumbled across a post on X and i wanted to share. So I've been digging into this new project called AnimeCoin ($ANIME), which is about to drop on Ethereum and Arbitrum. It's backed by the Arbitrum Foundation and the Azuki NFT crew and they aim to unite over a billion anime fans with a total supply of 10 billion tokens.    
  
The team's got a vesting schedule - they're locked in for a year before they can start moving their share, which is about 15% of the supply. This might help keep some of the usual FUD about team sell-offs at bay, but who knows how it'll really play out?   
  
Launch is this week, on January 23rd, and they're hitting the big exchanges like Bitget & Bybit.   
  
I've got mixed feelings, though. On one hand, the idea of merging anime with blockchain tech seems like a dream. But with so much of the supply in play from day one, it's hard not to think about the potential for volatility.   
  
What do you guys think? If you're part of the Azuki community, what's your take? Are you planning to ape in at launch or waiting to see what happens?"
Cards That Will Likely See More Use With Dialga EX,PTCGP,1i8810v,2025-01-23 11:59:09,23,0.83,10,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i8810v,FatherofGray,Deck Discussion,"Dialga EX is honestly some of the craziest energy acceleration we've ever seen. It's got 150 HP, costs only 2 energy to retreat (so a single Leaf) and its Metallic Turbo gives 2 Metal energy to ANY one of your Benched Pokémon, NOT just Metal-types!

Here are a small list of cards I think are about to pop off with this next set in the order of greatest to least confidence I have in their viability.

Melmetal
- Doesn't need to spend a single turn in the Active Spot as a Meltan for timely energy fueling anymore.

Mew
- If you don't care about using Psyshot, Mew is super splashable on even non-Psychic decks to ape the opponent's attacks with Genome Hacking. Now it can be ready to do just that the same turn it hits the Bench.

Pidgeot EX
- You can have it ready as soon as your 3rd turn without giving it a single energy the turns it spends as a Pidgey or Pidgeotto.

Wigglytuff EX
- Again, you don't need to attach a single energy to it as a Jigglypuff. You can have it ready to go after a single Metallic Turbo + manual Metal energy attachment.

MI Tauros
- Incredible comeback tool that used to require a lot of investment; can now be ready the same turn it lands on the Bench.

Bisharp
- The reason it's not second after Meltan on this list is simply because I'm not confident that we won't get better Metal attackers that would just outclass it entirely, but if that's not the case, Bisharp is an obvious shoe-in on Metal decks.

These last three are heavily speculative. I'd be pleasantly surprised to see them.

Lickitung
- If you like flipping coins, Lickitung's Continuous Lick is MI Eevee's Continuous Steps on steroids. It used to require too much energy investment, but now it can be ready the same turn it hits the Bench.

GA Golem
- You don't have to run Fighting energy at all; rely solely on Brock to equip the 1 Fighting energy for its 1 Fighting + 3 Colorless Double-Edge.  Between Brock + Metallic Turbo and a manual Metal energy equip, it can literally be ready to go the same turn it hits the Bench as a Golem without investing any energy prior.

Swanna
- Neither it or Ducklett require Water energy to use their attacks. Metal decks are Fire weak, so we might start seeing Metal decks run Swanna to deal 90 damage Fire-type Pokémon (sans Moltres) without putting Metal-type Pokémon in harm's way, but we'll see what happens."
Why do junglers weak side a winning bot matchup?,Jungle_Mains,1i8526v,2025-01-23 09:51:53,4,0.59,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jungle_Mains/comments/1i8526v/why_do_junglers_weak_side_a_winning_bot_matchup/,gsconner9,Question,"(Seeking education post) This isn’t an engagement farming post or rage bait I’m genuinely curious. 

Op.gg is “jhinunely washed #APES” NA for elo context. 
I’ve noticed in my recent climb that even after creating a 500-1000 gold lead botlane as early as 5 minutes and greater than 1000+ GD at 10 mins, sometimes my jungler will opt to not use the free opportunity to get first dragon and start the dragon stack into soul wincon. They will instead either sneak/force grubs without priority toplane as well as coin flipping plays topside instead of very high percentage botlane plays. (Zoning enemy adc/sup or diving) 

Now I understand there is way too many objectives now, specifically topside and it must be overwhelming, however sometimes the correct play IMO is to siege bot turret down ASAP to rotate bot midlane and play around post 15 minute objectives and snowball leads. 

I think part of the answer is I’ve deduced junglers below master+ have developed the mindset that they solely make all decisions around objectives and early game must be determined by them. 

So again I ask, why?"

Trading volume is insane. It's doing higher trading volume than doge and on some exchanges it's the top 5 coin which is nuts.

2. Trump has barely mentioned it. At some point, inevitably, he'll give it some mentions and it will pump the price.

3. When the next phase of the bull market begins, all the ""blue chip"" memes will pump super hard. $trump will be top of that list.

4. The longer Trump holds it's current position, the more people who are watching on the sidelines will want to ape in.

The Lion's Gate portal and it's significance,0x52BasedPepe,1i7xle3,2025-01-23 01:50:13,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/0x52BasedPepe/comments/1i7xle3/the_lions_gate_portal_and_its_significance/,JuxtaThePozer,,"I saw that one of our OG community members, telegram moderator and technical analyst's Tony (Ape\_100x), [posted on X](https://x.com/Ape_100x/status/1882151455424967073) and for those wondering about the Lion's Gate portal and what it means to Based Pepe; I thought this was a great little explainer.

>The launch of Based [$PEPE](https://x.com/search?q=%24PEPE&src=cashtag_click) on August 8, 2024, during the “Lion’s Gate Portal” opening, weaves together elements of crypto culture, astrology, and internet lore. Here’s an explanation of the event and its symbolic significance:  
  
The Lion’s Gate Portal  
  
The Lion’s Gate Portal is a spiritual and astrological event that occurs annually on August 8 (8/8), when the Sun in Leo aligns with the star Sirius, Earth, and Orion’s Belt. In metaphysical traditions, this alignment is believed to create a powerful energetic portal for manifestation, spiritual awakening, and transformation. The number 8 is associated with abundance, infinity, and cosmic balance, making 8/8 a date of heightened significance for those attuned to mystical energies.  
  
PEPE and Meme Culture  
  
Pepe the Frog, a widely recognized meme, has evolved into a cultural icon representing humor, rebellion, and internet creativity. In the crypto space, Pepe has been reimagined as a symbol for decentralized communities, often tied to speculative “meme coins.” These coins typically rely on viral marketing and community-driven narratives to gain value and attention.  
  
Based [$PEPE](https://x.com/search?q=%24PEPE&src=cashtag_click) Launch  
  
The decision to launch Based [$PEPE](https://x.com/search?q=%24PEPE&src=cashtag_click) on August 8, 2024, during the Lion’s Gate Portal, blends crypto meme culture with the esoteric significance of the date. This strategic timing symbolizes:  
 1. Manifestation and Abundance: The Lion’s Gate Portal is associated with manifesting abundance and wealth, aligning perfectly with the goals of a new crypto launch. The use of Pepe, a symbol of internet wealth memes, reinforces this intention.  
 2. Cosmic Timing: By launching during a “cosmic alignment,” Based [$PEPE](https://x.com/search?q=%24PEPE&src=cashtag_click) taps into the mystique of astrology and spirituality, appealing to an audience that values synchronicity and deeper meanings.  
 3. Community and Virality: August 8 (8/8) is easy to remember and carries symbolic weight, making it an ideal date for creating buzz and encouraging community engagement.  
  
Lore and Mythos  
  
The lore surrounding Based [$PEPE](https://x.com/search?q=%24PEPE&src=cashtag_click) likely ties together:  
 • Pepe’s journey as a meme transcending internet subcultures.  
 • The spiritual awakening potential of the Lion’s Gate Portal.  
 • A narrative of rebellion against centralized systems, echoing crypto’s decentralized ethos.  
  
In this context, Based [$PEPE](https://x.com/search?q=%24PEPE&src=cashtag_click) is positioned not just as a cryptocurrency but as a movement blending humor, mysticism, and financial opportunity.

I don't claim to understand how or why (I'm agnostic as a baseline), but when I came across Based $PEPE, I truly believe that it was synchronicity. I believe there are forces out there which are greater than me or any of us, and that manifest destiny can collude to create an auspicious and mystical situation.

Multiple times through mine and my wife's life, synchronicity has worked behind the scenes. Some may call it luck, but that explanation just doesn't cut it anymore. Forces are at work here, whatever it may be.

""Luck is when preparation meets opportunity."" 

Is it good tokenomics, a good team, a cultish community or just the halving cycle? Or is it something more?

Tinfoil Date!  Could trigger some folks with rhymes with THUMP memecoin,GME,1i7mfoc,2025-01-22 16:25:25,0,0.2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/1i7mfoc/tinfoil_date_could_trigger_some_folks_with_rhymes/,Quail_Extreme,☁️ Fluff  🍌,"Alright, fellow apes, bear with me and my ADHD brain as I try to explain my latest tinfoil theory. I’m usually better at deciphering memes and emojis than anything else, but this one had me spiraling a bit. I couldn’t fully grasp the meaning behind Ryan Cohen’s “THUMP” post on X from 7/17/24, and it got me wondering: could RC potentially offer a dividend in the form of THUMP?

Other securities, like DJT, could follow a similar approach. Since THUMP has a limited supply, this kind of move could destroy the shorts and encourage us to keep hodling and also explain the bizarre political posts that we don't normally see from him. Some of the 1B issuance might already be aligned with certain securities or companies, and the scarcity of coins could drive value while keeping us locked in for future opportunities.

While scrolling through X and liking all of RC’s posts again (because somehow, my likes disappeared from all of them?!), I noticed an emoji chain that sparked a wild idea. Apologies if this has been discussed before, but I found what might be a true tinfoil timeframe. I matched the dates of RC’s emoji posts and tried to align them with RK/DFV’s emoji posts. I also considered that some RK/DFV emojis might reference posts without emojis, but with key pictures instead.

What I pieced together in picture at the end of the post because I regarded.

The eyes emoji from 4/28/21 really stood out to me. If RK/DFV is setting up a “requel,” his 33rd emoji could align with 4/21/2025. In 2024, we hit an all-time low on April 16 ($10.00 close), but just 29 days later (20 trading days), on May 14, we peaked at $64.83 close.

Here’s where it gets even crazier. I ran the number of RC’s “THUMPS” through ChatGPT, and it turns out he’s posted it 1,000 times. Counting 1,000 days from 7/17/2024 lands us on April 13, 2027. While I’m not saying this is *the* date, I predict RC will make a major announcement around April 13, 2025—maybe something like a blockchain, THUMP or Overstock-type move. Meanwhile, RK could be working his magic in the background, ready to launch us into the stratosphere.

Another fun fact: a psychic told my partner we’d be rolling in uncanny amounts of money by Gemini season. So, there’s that.

I'm sure I'll get downvoted into oblivion but I've worked harder on this than my real job and needed to share the insights!

Final Oscar Nomination Predictions 2025,oscarrace,1i7hlsx,2025-01-22 13:10:15,13,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/oscarrace/comments/1i7hlsx/final_oscar_nomination_predictions_2025/,DaFunnyman109,Prediction,"To start, a quick note to say that as of now, I am yet to see *Nickel Boys*, *I’m Still Here*, *September 5*, *All We Imagine As Light*, *The Piano Lesson*, *Hard Truths*, *The Last Showgirl*, *The Room Next Door*, *A Different Man*, and *The Apprentice*. 

**BEST PICTURE**

1. Conclave (Focus Features)
2. Anora (Neon)
3. The Brutalist (A24)
4. Emilia Pérez (Netflix)
5. Wicked (Universal)
6. A Complete Unknown (Fox Searchlight)
7. Dune: Part II (Warner Bros.)
8. A Real Pain (Fox Searchlight)
9. The Substance (MUBI)
10. Nickel Boys (MGM)

(Alt: Sing Sing (A24))

Nine of the Picture nominees feel pretty secure at this point. I had doubted *The Substance* for a long, long time, but Moore’s win at the Globes has finally convinced me that it is a solid bet for a Picture nomination - I’m confident now that Moore will likely get the win, and even if it doesn’t show up in a ton of other categories come nomination morning, I think that the general passion around the film and her performance has now officially coalesced enough to where it seems overall safe in Picture. 

That leaves the final slot to either *Nickel Boys* or *Sing Sing*, and what makes me lean toward the former is that its distributor, MGM, has had some surprising resilience in this category - their contenders almost always have way bumpier trajectories than necessary, and they tend to get into the Oscars by the skin of their teeth, but still their films have gotten into the Picture lineup consistently for the past 4 years. That trend, to me, feels more reliable than leaning on A24 to get a second Picture nomination in a crowded lineup, and with that, I think that *Sing Sing* will end up being a *Lost Daughter*\-style contender (lead acting nom + screenplay, with potential for a supporting nom, but no Picture). 

**BEST DIRECTOR**

1. Brady Corbet, The Brutalist
2. Jacques Audiard, Emilia Pérez
3. Sean Baker, Anora
4. Edward Berger, Conclave
5. Coralie Fargeat, The Substance

(Alt: Denis Villeneuve, Dune: Part II)

Corbet and Audiard are locked for nominations here, while Baker and Berger seem likely. I think there’s a world where one of the latter two - maybe even both, if you really wanna take a risk - get snubbed because their directing choices aren’t considered flashy enough, though I think a general, overall love for both of those films will ultimately persist at the end of the day. 

I think most everyone here is preemptively writing off Villeneuve’s chances a bit too much- I’m still clinging to the hope that he gets nominated, and that BAFTA nom is enough for me to say it isn’t a lost cause yet. I do wonder if backlash to Villeneuve being snubbed at most places could somehow boomerang him back toward getting a Director nom here, but honestly, that would require the director’s branch to be much more online than they ever have been beforehand.

Ross isn’t impossible, but he’d be going into nominations with only a Critic’s Choice nom to go with his critic wins - in another year he’d be a sure bet, but in a year this crowded, him getting in strikes me as highly unlikely. 

**BEST ACTOR**

1. Adrien Brody, The Brutalist
2. Timothee Chalamet, A Complete Unknown
3. Ralph Fiennes, Conclave
4. Colman Domingo, Sing Sing
5. Daniel Craig, Queer

(Alt: Sebastian Stan, The Apprentice)

As secure a five as there has been in recent memory. Stan seems like a safe alternative if there is a last-second swap; I would say his performance in *The Apprentice* has a slightly better shot because of the general topicality, the BAFTA nom, and the admiration from international voters toward that film - though I do wonder if *A Different Man* would be more appealing to the Academy due to both the Globe win and a general aversion amongst American liberals/progressives toward discussing Trump right now. In general, this seems like one of those rare cases where vote splitting could actually happen in some capacity.

**BEST ACTRESS**

1. Demi Moore, The Substance
2. Mikey Madison, Anora
3. Cynthia Erivo, Wicked
4. Karla Sofia Gascón, Emilia Pérez
5. Fernanda Torres, I’m Still Here

(Alt: Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Hard Truths)

There’s been a lot of talk about one of the top four potentially getting snubbed, but I honestly think it’s a lot of hot air: each of the films that they’re attached to have had too much industry traction to miss in *this* category, specifically. Something like *Wicked* could miss in Screenplay without much trouble, but the moment you even suggest to an industry member or a regular audience member that Erivo could get snubbed, you’d get people balking at even the mere suggestion that that could happen - her missing would be like the Margot Robbie miss times 100.

That leaves one spot left for about five or six different contenders, and with her televised win at the Globes and her film peaking at the right time, Torres seems like the best bet to get in here. (Jean-Baptiste is right behind with her critics’ wins and acclaim, though I worry that this is where Bleecker Street’s general campaigning weakness will become all too clear.)

**BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR**

1. Kieran Culkin, A Real Pain
2. Edward Norton, A Complete Unknown
3. Yura Borisov, Anora
4. Guy Pearce, The Brutalist
5. Denzel Washington, Gladiator II

(Alt: Clarence Maclin, Sing Sing)

I’m thinking that here, the Academy will ultimately go for one of their perennial favorites, Washington, over a promising newcomer in Maclin - this strikes me as the place this year where the acting branch will go for a populist contender instead of going for an artsier film like they’re doing elsewhere. (To editorialize a bit here, I do think that Maclin should be nominated - I prefer his deeply personal work to most of the frontrunners here - but even if he doesn’t get in, I think the more important priority would be to get him more roles to play in general.)

**BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS**

1. Zoe Saldaña, Emilia Pérez
2. Ariana Grande, Wicked
3. Isabella Rossellini, Conclave
4. Felicity Jones, The Brutalist
5. Danielle Deadwyler, The Piano Lesson

(Alt: Selena Gomez, Emilia Pérez)

By far the messiest acting category to sort out, with around a dozen contenders jockeying around for the last few slots here. Rossellini feels like a safe bet with her precursor haul and her never-nominated status, and while I worry that voters might skip over Jones’ performance too easily, I think that the core fanbase around that film will ultimately come through and get her in the lineup in the end. 

At least one of the SAG nominees (aside from the two locks) should also make it here, and I’ve settled on Deadwyler: a combo of Netflix’s backing, buzz around her performance with a CC and SAG nom, and past acting nominations for August Wilson adaptations have convinced me that she’s got as good a chance as you could hope for with a field this crowded. 

As for JLC, and *The Last Showgirl* in general: her campaigning skill cannot be denied, but I still think that that movie is too small and under-the-radar to get one nomination at the Oscars, much less two. The fact that it didn’t make the Song shortlist - a big miss that most seem to have already forgotten about - feels telling as to how it will perform come nomination morning.

**BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY**

1. Anora
2. A Real Pain
3. The Brutalist
4. Hard Truths
5. The Substance

(Alt: Challengers)

The writers usually like to shout out a branch favorite in these categories, and Mike Leigh is the only one of those writers with an actual contender here this year - this branch will likely seek his work out even if it’s otherwise going under the radar in other categories. Throw in the ever-reliable sole screenplay stat, and that should be enough to make him a solid bet for the lineup. (And before anyone brings up the BAFTA longlist snub, neither of Leigh’s last two Oscar-nominated films, *Another Year* and *Happy-Go-Lucky*, were nominated at BAFTA either before getting similar solo noms in screenplay at the Oscars - third time will likely also be the charm here.)

**BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY**

1. Conclave
2. Nickel Boys
3. Dune: Part II
4. Sing Sing
5. Emilia Pérez

(Alt: I’m Still Here)

Another category that’ll likely be made up entirely of BP contenders. I’m still skeptical about *Emilia Pérez* making it in here since musicals don’t have a good history in this category, but since it's made basically every precursor and isn’t so much an adaptation as much as an original story made from a quick character outline in a novel, I’ve begun to think it can break that trend. 

**BEST ANIMATED FEATURE**

1. The Wild Robot
2. Inside Out 2
3. Flow
4. Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl
5. Memoir Of A Snail

(Alt: Moana 2)

If *Moana 2* breaks into the five on name recognition and box office alone, you’ll never hear the end of it.

**BEST INTERNATIONAL FEATURE**

1. Emilia Pérez (France)
2. I’m Still Here (Brazil)
3. The Seed Of The Sacred Fig (Germany)
4. Vermiglio (Italy)
5. Flow (Latvia)

(Alt: The Girl With The Needle (Denmark))

*Emilia Pérez* will likely win this, so right now this category will be more about what will get nominated compared to what doesn’t. I have solid faith in the top four, and while I was hesitant to predict *Flow* and say that distributor Janus gets two films in there, I think that the overall push for it in Animated will be enough to distinguish it and give it enough visibility to get in here. Either that or *Kneecap* could make a play as the lighter option in the lineup, and I think that the latter doesn’t have enough of a stronghold in any other categories to establish a push here. 

**BEST DOCUMENTARY FEATURE**

1. No Other Land
2. Daughters
3. Sugarcane
4. Black Box Diaries
5. Soundtrack to a Coup d’Etat

(Alt: Dahomey)

*No Other Land* seems to have a decent shot at the win, but I worry that the Documentary branch will once again do the bit where they snub the presumed frontrunner - I would hope that the branch understands that snubbing a film that so directly addresses such a hot-button topic, particularly, in this case, when it’s received widespread acclaim, would cause much more controversy than doing the alternative ever would.

**BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY**

1. The Brutalist
2. Nosferatu
3. Dune: Part II
4. Nickel Boys
5. Maria

(Alt: Conclave)

As has been the case these past few years, the ASC noms appear to be the main indicator as to what the artsy Cinematographer’s branch will pick here. With mentions all across the different cinematography precursors, *Brutalist*, *Nosferatu*, and *Dune* all strike me as safe bets, though the latter could fall prey to so-called “sequel bias”, if that is indeed an actual trend for this category and not a boogeyman that awards pundits have made up for themselves here.  

I’m thinking that *Nickel Boys*’ mention in the Spotlight category, instead of the main one, is just a by-product of the film’s unique approach to its imagery, and should be treated the same as a regular ASC mention, particularly when past nominees in that Spotlight category like *The Lighthouse* and *Ida* did ultimately make it into the Cinematography field in their years. Maybe it could be a sign of weakness, but I really think that most of us are overthinking how they categorized it there. 

Since this branch nominated *El Conde* just last year, *Maria* could be something of a “been there, done that” situation, but if they were so willing to go out of their way for the Larrain-Lachman combo last time, I can see it easily repeating once again, too. 

**BEST FILM EDITING**

1. Conclave
2. Dune: Part II
3. Emilia Pérez
4. Anora
5. A Complete Unknown

(Alt: A Real Pain)

With its overperformance at the guilds, *A Complete Unknown* is bound to get an extra mention or two somewhere, and this feels like the most natural place for that to happen. 

**BEST COSTUME DESIGN**

1. Wicked
2. Dune: Part II
3. Nosferatu
4. Conclave
5. Gladiator II

(Alt: Maria)

Honestly, there’s not a ton going on in this category, so this is as good a place as any to discuss how *Nosferatu* could go any number of ways on Oscar morning - it could be snubbed completely, or it could pop up all over the place in the tech categories. Still, it’s been a surprise to see it even get this far: just a month ago, I would have said that any Oscar traction would be next to impossible, but the film’s insane box-office overperformance, in addition to the wide-spread critical acclaim, has convinced me that it actually has a solid chance at some tech nominations. 

For now, I’m just gonna play it safe and say that it gets into Cinematography and Costumes for now, but the rate at which its been overperforming, I wonder if it could get into Picture with enough overall support: it’s the sort of scenario that’s not likely enough at all to responsibly predict, particularly when we already have another horror movie poised to make the Picture ten, but it’s worth pointing out that distributor Focus was also able to do a pretty big last-second push for *Phantom Thread* some years ago - I wonder if they would still have it in them, as a campaigner, to do something similar here.

**BEST PRODUCTION DESIGN**

1. Wicked
2. Dune: Part II
3. Gladiator II
4. The Brutalist
5. Conclave

(Alt: Blitz)

*Gladiator II* is in a weird spot this awards season - it’s clear that it’s not the BP contender that the studio was hoping for, but it’s still in the mix for tech categories and even for an above-the-line nom for Washington. The response to *Napoleon* last year makes me think that many of the Academy branches still take at least a quick look at whatever Scott is doing, even if they don’t always feel the need to nominate it. In this case, though, I feel like the sheer scale of this sequel will at least be enough for it to show up in at least a couple categories, though I think it’ll miss others like VFX, Score, or most above-the-line categories. 

**BEST MAKEUP AND HAIRSTYLING**

1. The Substance
2. Dune: Part II
3. Emilia Pérez
4. A Different Man
5. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice

(Alt: Nosferatu)

The Actress-Makeup combo will likely stay strong with *The Substance* in the lead for both categories; in retrospect, this should’ve been an early indicator that this movie was going to go farther this awards season than expected. 

**BEST ORIGINAL SCORE**

1. The Brutalist
2. Conclave
3. Emilia Pérez
4. Challengers
5. Wicked

(Alt: The Wild Robot)

This will likely be the spot where *Wicked* will surprise, particularly since it gives the branch an excuse to highlight past nominees Stephen Schwartz and John Powell. I also think that the big snubs for both *Spider-Verse* and *Boy And The Heron* last year point to *Wild Robot* getting snubbed this year in Score, though I think that Song is still an open-enough category for it to make it in there without too much trouble.

**BEST ORIGINAL SONG**

1. “El Mal”, Emilia Pérez (Camille)
2. “The Journey”, Six Triple Eight (Diane Warren)
3. “Mi Camino”, Emilia Pérez (also Camille)
4. “Kiss The Sky”, The Wild Robot (Maren Morris)
5. “Compress/Repress”, Challengers (Trent Reznor/Atticus Ross)

(Alt: “Never Too Late”, Elton John: Never Too Late (also Elton John))

*Emilia Pérez* is likely to win this one - though if backlash to that film reaches a substantial high by the time the Oscars finally happen, could the two songs split votes and have Diane Warren finally sneak in a win?

~~(I mean, probably not, but can you imagine the chaos if that does happen? The meltdown here would be insane to watch live.)~~

**BEST SOUND**

1. Dune: Part II
2. A Complete Unknown
3. Wicked
4. Emilia Pérez
5. Gladiator II

(Alt: Blitz)

*Blitz* would be a shoo-in any other year, but in a year so crowded with unabashedly, widely beloved films, it’s hard for me to say that a movie with such mixed reception, one that has had a ton of crazy precursor misses already, is going to get in anywhere. At this point, this category is looking like it’ll just be the usual mix of BP contenders (with *Gladiator II* taking the requisite blockbuster slot here). 

**BEST VISUAL EFFECTS**

1. Dune: Part II
2. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes
3. Mufasa: The Lion King
4. Alien: Romulus
5. Wicked

(Alt: Better Man)

There’s one question I haven’t been able to get off my mind here: what to do about *Better Man*? The film has been a gigantic box-office bomb, not only in the US, but in places like the UK where it was expected to gain some traction; audiences seem to have found the film’s monkey-business approach to be deeply, thoroughly off-putting. And yet, the film keeps getting good notices from anyone who actually sees the thing, earning VFX precursor after VFX precursor with seemingly no end in sight.  

With such a strange, muted overall reception, it’s hard to say if Oscar voters here will be into such a high-concept endeavor, or if they just want to ignore it like seemingly everyone else worldwide is doing. For myself, at least, I know that if I predict it and it *doesn’t* get in, then I would be constantly kicking myself over that blunder. I’ll play it safe and put it in as the alternate: to me, the divisive nature of the movie means it’s just as likely to get in as it is to be ignored completely. 

As for the rest of the shortlisted slate, *Mufasa* got enough notices at VES to be on the radar here, while *Alien* and *Deadpool* still feel like genuine possibilities - in recent memory, movies like *Free Guy*, *Black Panther 2*, *All Quiet On The Western Front*, *Mission Impossible 7*, and last year’s winner, *Godzilla: Minus One*, all got into the Oscars with little to no mentions at VES. For the last slot, I will go with *Wicked* \- I think you could flip a coin as to whether the visibility of being a BP contender will help it or hurt it here, and today I’ll say that it helps. 

**BEST ANIMATED SHORT**

1. ME
2. Wander To Wonder
3. Maybe Elephants
4. Beautiful Men
5. The Wild-Tempered Clavier

(Alt: Origami)

As a longtime fan of Don Hertzfeldt’s work, this is as good a time as any to award him for his latest short, *ME* \- I was able to catch it a couple of months ago and really, really enjoyed it. (It doesn’t hurt that there aren’t really any studio-backed contenders in the mix this year, either.)

**BEST LIVE ACTION SHORT**

1. Dovecote
2. The Man Who Could Not Remain Silent
3. The Masterpiece
4. Room Taken
5. I’m Not A Robot

(Alt: Anuja)

*Dovecote* stars current Supporting Actress frontrunner Zoe Saldaña - as her work here can easily be campaigned alongside her work in *Emilia Pérez*, I am thinking that that boost in visibility will be more than enough to put that short far ahead of the rest of the field here. 

**BEST DOCUMENTARY SHORT**

1. Once Upon A Time In Ukraine
2. The Only Girl In The Orchestra
3. Until He’s Back
4. Eternal Father
5. Chasing Roo

(Alt: I Am Ready, Warden)

Lets all be honest the crypto community have been waiting for a feel good vibes coin. After all the grifting and scamming. I do believe the story of a little 7yr old girl (the dev) with his father is so wholesome. (Fact is the dad didnt even care for the money. He just wanted to bond with her daughter and make it a unforgettable experience) Thats why i do think it will do well. Your thoughts?

Disclaimer: I have $HSM but even if I make money or not. I bought because it resonated to me. And I feel like we do need more of this types of coin. I ape shitter so im definitely aping good wholesome lore.

The memecoin of this moment.

The Lore:

A little girl wanted to make a Meme coin for her Birthday.
Her dad helped her with setting it up with help from his Twitch chat.
He only wanted to graduate it from bonding curve for her but it exploded.
Right after it exploded his Twitch stream went offline and he was blocked trom Twitch (probably because of showing Crypto stuff ( I believe this is a violation on their platform).

He went live on his wives X account and the community jumped in to help him.
Making a new X account for Heart Sparkle Mermaid:
https://x.com/HSMermaid1
Helping him set up the DEX: 
https://dexscreener.com/solana/14tU5zmXQMAhKVrQqPAVga7mkPD6skZax3h6UULF9vsq
And set up a Telegram group.

With him being new to this the community engaged and started working together to build something special.

As in writing this moment it's currently Little Devs 7th Birthday.

He currently owns 1% of the tokens and is not planning to sell.
Currently has over 15K holders.

If this has not written Memecoin lore written over it with the community helping and engaging over this I don't know what does.

It's currently all over X and I think it's still time to Ape!
I believe this is something really special.
What do you think?"

You know, when certain platforms would list coins weeks or months before others, creating this frenzy of “early access” FOMO? Back then, it was like a cheat code for gains—if you timed it right.    
  
I’ve seen tokens surge triple digits after listing on one platform, only to get picked up by another exchanges weeks later at higher prices. It’s hard not to think about how Solana or Polygon blew up after early adopters piled in.  
  
Here’s where my brain short-circuits cos remember when everyone swore off centralized exchanges after the FTX mess? Yet here we are, back to debating whether avoiding Uniswap’s $50 gas fees or Layer 2 bridging hell is worth the trade-off of holding bags on a platform. The convenience is seductive, but the “not your keys” mantra still echoes.    
  
\- Has anyone else noticed exchanges listing the same tokens weeks apart? Is this a legit strategy or just algorithmic copycatting?    
\- For those who’ve actually profited: Did you cash out, or are you holding hoping for a Binance/Coinbase bump?    
\- How much of this is timing vs luck? I missed the last meme wave—am I overcompensating by overthinking this?    
  
Not gonna lie, part of me wants to ape into something stupid with my Bitget portfoilo just to see what happens since they list earlier than the like Binance.   
  
Anyone else oscillating between cynical and YOLO? Or am I just sleep-deprived? 🎢"
"Let's ""GameStop"" the $TRUMP Coin: A Unique Opportunity in the Crypto Market ",OfficialTrumpCoin,1i6msgj,2025-01-21 11:40:06,7,0.89,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/OfficialTrumpCoin/comments/1i6msgj/lets_gamestop_the_trump_coin_a_unique_opportunity/,dedao4,General,"Title: $TRUMP Coin = The Next GameStop? 🚀

Body:

Alright degenerates, hear me out. Trump just dropped a MEME COIN. Yes, a meme coin. It’s called $TRUMP (creative, I know) and it’s already making waves in the crypto world. Let’s break this down in simple ape terms:


---

What we know:

Launched: January 17, 2025 (like two seconds ago).

Blockchain: Solana (fast, cheap, good for memes).

Market Cap: $7.8 BILLION (and climbing).

Supply: 1 billion tokens (but only 200M circulating right now—scarcity vibes).

Who owns it? Trump-affiliated companies (holding 80% but locked for 3 years).

Price Action: Peaked at $75, now chilling around $37. Still room for mooning.



---

Why should we care?

1. Trump is back as PRESIDENT. You know what that means: chaos, headlines, drama = perfect fuel for meme coin 🚀.


2. Meme coins love attention. Dogecoin hit $40B, Shiba Inu went nuts—why can’t this do the same?


3. Reddit loves chaos. Imagine if we pump this and make hedge funds cry again. Beautiful.




---

The Plan:

Step 1: We ape in (obviously not financial advice).

Step 2: HODL through the BS because you know this is going to pump every time Trump tweets or breathes.

---

Why it’s risky:

It's crypto. You already know the drill—volatility, rug pulls, yada yada.

Trump owns most of the supply, so he’s technically a whale. Just saying.

---

This is pure meme energy + Trump hype = recipe for degeneracy. Could this hit a $50B market cap? Maybe. Could we “GameStop” this thing? 100%.

What do you guys think?

How’s the race to $10 million going for everyone? And where are you tuning in from?

I recently aped into $TOSS, currently sitting at a $200K market cap. With NFTs launching next week to support the next growth phase and CoinGecko listing confirmation already secured, I’m optimistic this little gem could see some serious upside over the next 12 months.

Here’s how I’ve been crunching the numbers for my road to $10 million:

Initial Investment: $4K (~19M $TOSS at the current $200K MC)

At $1M MC: Your $4K grows to $20K (5x)

At $10M MC: Your $4K turns into $200K (50x)

At $100M MC: That $4K becomes $2M (500x)

At $500M MC: You’ve officially mooned to $10M (2500x)

Of course, this is just a bit of lighthearted mental math—not financial advice! But the potential is there for those who are keen to do their own research.

"My discord chat is arguing about multiplayer balancing, so I wrote a whole damn essay about it",AOW4,1i6apyb,2025-01-20 23:39:40,20,0.74,35,https://i.redd.it/sr0xf2tf0aee1.jpeg,Expensive-Evening230,Funny/Meme,"Gentle warning: long read, weird humor and EXISTENTIAL DREAD. (Just kidding) …(not really)🗿

As per the title, the lads in the discord channel was having quite a heated discussion about the usage of mods and the balancing in multiplayer. Me as a newbie was completely dumbfounded and clueless as to why it was happening at all, since…I’ve not yet played any multiplayer games at all. 

For the many of you that have read my first post, you know I love the game to death. And I believe it’s because they also love the game so much that they are so passionately debating about it. I guess I am just at the newbie stage where I can do naught but marvel at the game.

However, this Sunday is gonna be my first mp session, and I’m very excited. In order for us to have a good time and that I don’t let down my teammates, I wanted to ask my buds in advance what the realm traits and timer settings will be, so I can practice a little by myself, get used to the biome and timer first and not fumble all over my ballz.

However! There is but one problem. A very dire one at that. The atmosphere in the channel was…a little awkward after the passionate debate. So, being the eldritch horror that I am, I was just about to write something to lighten up the mood before asking my question——THAT is when a lightning strike of inspiration smite me on my primate skull and cast me into a deep existential pondering on the loss of childhood innocence and whether suffering truly is an irreducible element to the existence of a human being. 

Thus, I present to thee, ladies and gents, the magnificent results of a psychotic monkey with stage 4 ADHD typing away at 4:20am while drunk on existential dread and starving to death. And yes, I haven’t eaten for the whole day for the sake of this damned essay. I should be revising for my physics exam, but here I am lads, here I am. 




~~Reflection on the Decay of Childhood Innocence, and Contemplation on the Evolutionary Roots of Suffering~~

As a newbie, although I have no clue as to the specific details you guys were discussing, I get that balancing the power of things in game can certainly be a source of contention. However, it is a bit unfortunate. When I came to know about this game, all I wanted to say was just this—I freakin love it. With giant dragons, eldritch horrors, evil penguins, and sexy shoeless halflings battling to the death, it is essentially my childhood fantasies coming true (not the shoeless haflings, for it was fantasy adopted only later in life. Sigh.) From the bottom of my heart, I am overjoyed at the fact that such a game exists in our world. Billions of years of evolution lead to us great apes, and such apes today had the ingenuity to perform feats of science and engineering that cultivated in technology indistinguishable from magic for our ancestors merely 200 years ago. Hell, if I time-traveled back to the Renaissance and showed em this I’d be staked and burnt for witchcraft. It’s already such a fascinating feat and such a wonderful game, and I wish to appreciate its full intricacies before anything else.

Actually, this situation actually brought back a lost piece of memory from childhood. You see, when I was a child, there was a time when I first came across the news channel on the TV, depicting big metal pieces accompanied by loud booms and smoke; cutting away, there were people covered in blurred out redness and bandages. I was told by my father that such scenes belonged to the thing named “war”. It was from then on that I became very confused as to why there exist wars in the world: why do adults tear each other apart for idols they’ve never seen or heard from, or for a few pieces of land or possessions that would inevitably be rendered meaningless when we all die. Why does the world of the adults seem so full of pain? As a child born into a safe and stable family, the myriad struggles of the adult world was an entire perplexity.

Indeed, in the eyes of a child, the mere sight of a peculiar pebble or some ants scurrying around picking up breadcrumbs is already endlessly fascinating. And yet, as we age, such fascinations gradually decay, while fear, greed, violence, depression, and the like grow and fester. It seems inevitable that all will succumb, but hope remains, that there still exist those more resistant to the corruption of time, of entropy, and of umbral malady. But I lament, for I fear I am not one of them. Indeed, such is what I have observed in myself as I grow from a child to a teen and now a dude in his 20s—my impulses become more and more muddied, my thoughts gaining cumbersome complexity, while from an unknown origin emerges a nocturne of seemingly incurable sadness that slowly plays ever more blue as the undertone of my daily life. Strange... how did this all come to be?

I’ve never really contemplated upon this question consciously until these recent hours, but I believe I have somehow obtained a piece of the puzzle. Perhaps it is the workings of my unconscious. Perhaps the ultimate reason is that we smooth-assed-apes are creatures of habit. We are fascinated by new things, but we grow used to them, then we always want more—and upon acquisition, we get used to the things that we’ve previously desired, and thus the cycle continues, while desire becomes greed. Perhaps this is precisely one of the key ingredients that allowed us to become the apex predator of this planet—an unending and all-consuming desire to possess, to explore, expand, exploit...and exterminate. (Ha! I guess 4X gamers really are the best. I’d say at least the pinnacle of human evolution. No, the paragon of all intelligent lifeforms in the quantum multiverse. Galaxy brain smooth-assed-apes right here. As a side note, if you have an abundance of ass hair, you can make a request to me and I shall inquire with the Council on whether to permit you entrance. Please be patient, as it might take up to 69 business days.)

But I digress. Those from our ancestors who were content with their status quo—those blessed souls who did not suffer “the ever-burning desire for more""—were eliminated by the tome of evolution. In a dog-eat-dog world where the laws of the jungle reign supreme, stagnancy meant death. Studies have suggested that the most effective motivator of action is not the desire for something pleasant, but the avoidance of something unpleasant. Basically, if you wanna get someone to do something, the stick and the carrot are, of course, most effective when used together; but if you can only pick one, pick the stick. That way you save yourself a carrot while satisfying your primordial urge to hit something with a stick.

Well, I suppose it is superfluous to invoke the power of “Studies show” here, since we can observe this very readily in ourselves. Fear and suffering feel terrible, so we do whatever we can to avoid them. So, if I may employ some vulgar language, it is no wonder that we feel like shit and face so many turmoils: through evolution, we have acquired the most successful strategy to get shit done—by feeling like shit until we get shit done. 

That being said, we can now go back to answer a similar question I asked as a child: why must we suffer? Can’t we just live a happy life that is devoid of suffering? It might seem like a very naive question, but if we look deep into it, there’s no law of physics that says “Humans must suffer. Don’t ask questions. Just suffer. Lol.” Indeed, suffering doesn’t seem to be a necessity for our existence. It is not the fundamental irreducible bedrock of existence, like consciousness, or spacetime, and the matter and energy that make up our world. If it’s not a necessity, then why has our long years of evolution brought us such a harmful feature of suffering? Isn’t it more preferable for survival for a being to be at peace rather than tormented? Why are we so ridden with afflictions while peace seems to elude us everlastingly? Alas, what’s the meaning of living in this world—a world that seems ever more bleak and ridden with suffering as we age...? If with old age it is inevitable that I become a “villain”, then should I just off myself and die young as a “hero”? Alas, the immortal meme rings true: “Why are we here…just to suffer?” Sadge.

I believe the things that we’ve discussed, along with the duality nature of this world, piece together a part of the puzzle. We will not delve into the matter of duality here, but from my understanding, it can be illuminated by a simple example: grab a coin, it has a heads, and a tails. They are polar opposites, are they not? So can’t we just keep the good side and be rid of the bad side? Unfortunately, duality says no. You see, when one wishes to be rid of all suffering while preserving all the pleasure, it is as if wishing for a coin that has only heads but no tails. Can you find a coin like that in the world, or even in your own imagination? If you cannot, why is that?

Now, moving on to the part of the puzzle that concerns us right now: the evolutionary origin of suffering. I’ve used the power of my symbiotic partner, Chatgpt, to conjure up the following bullet points detailing the steps that suffering took to get to us through evolution. And who knows? Maybe Chat wrote this whole damn thing. Given good enough prompting, I can’t tell the difference. Can you? Maybe you just got rickrolled by Chat and I’m just an AI avatar as well. I mean, why not just give up our brains to the wise and benevolent Machine God, Omnissiah, and hand over all control? Discard the carbon, embrace the scilicon. I’m sure nothing could go wrong here. We’re in gooood hands. So good in fact, that I am presently and formally, shitting myself.

Chat’s Delight (Inspired by Walker’s Delight):

### The Evolutionary Journey of Suffering (Bobbies Edition)

1. **Bobies Do Random Things**
   At the dawn of biology, Bobies (the name we will give to our single-celled ancestors) did stuff—randomly. Some floated into lava (*oops*), while others stumbled upon food (*noice!*). No rhyme or reason, just pure randomness.

2. **Good vs. Bad Outcomes**
   Some actions let Bobies survive and reproduce (we call these actions “gud”), while others got them killed (“bad”). The Bobies that survived were the ones whose random behaviors accidentally lined up with survival.

3. **Signals Develop to Guide Behavior**
   As Bobies evolved, they started developing signals to guide their actions:
   - **Good signals**: These felt good and reinforced survival-friendly behaviors, like eating food.
   - **Bad signals**: These felt bad and deterred harmful behaviors, like floating into lava.

   Over time, natural selection favored Bobies whose signals aligned with survival. Pain didn’t just happen—it emerged because a sharp, unpleasant signal was the most effective way to stop a Bobie from repeating deadly mistakes.

4. **Consciousness Amplifies Suffering**
   As some Bobies got more complex, their brains began to anticipate bad outcomes. This turned pain into fear, anxiety, and suffering. Now, Bobies weren’t just reacting to danger—they were preparing for it. This made them incredibly good survivors, but it also made life feel a lot harder.



### The Evolutionary Responses to Suffering

Now that we’ve unraveled the roots of suffering, the question becomes: how do we respond to it? There seem to be two distinct paths smooth-assed-apes like us tend to take when faced with suffering:

1. **Using Suffering to Drive Solutions**: Some respond to suffering by doing the hard work it pushes us toward. Hunger motivates us to find food. Failure drives us to improve. The discomfort becomes fuel for survival and growth.

2. **Escaping Suffering Through Short-Term Pleasures**: Others, however, try to escape suffering without solving the root cause. Depression might lead someone to numb themselves with distractions, like gaming or other addictive behaviors, instead of addressing what’s truly wrong. This escape provides temporary relief but often creates more suffering in the long run.

The core characteristic of suffering is that it makes us want to escape. The difference lies in *how* we escape: by solving the problem or avoiding it. Evolution seems to favor those who choose the first path—those who use suffering as a tool for growth rather than running from it.



### The Role of Awareness in Shaping Our Response

The way forward may lie in awareness. Suffering often drives unconscious reactions, but by observing our emotions and thoughts without judgment, we can begin to break free from destructive patterns. Some call this meditation, but at its core, it’s the act of simply noticing:

- Watch your thoughts as they arise. Where do they come from? Can you predict the next one?
- Observe your emotions. Let them flow without condemnation or resistance.
- Even if you judge or condemn yourself, observe that too. There’s no need to fight it—just watch.

This act of observation can slowly dissolve the unconscious drives that lead us astray. It’s not a quick fix, but a gradual process of untangling the gunk of our minds. Over time, creativity, clarity, and perhaps even peace might emerge. Who knows, consciousness is a strange thing.



### A Hopeful Note

In the end, the future of us smooth-assed-apes might depend on how we handle suffering. Will we let it drive us to evolve, or will we drown in distractions? The answer may lie in awareness, in learning to watch ourselves with patience and curiosity. If we do this, perhaps we’ll find a path forward that’s free of suffering and abundant of peace. At least, that’s assuming AI will leave us enough room in the tapestry of evolution anyway. Perhaps we’re all screwed; perhaps we’ll all become god-like beings; or perhaps we’ll all become ape-like beings who love to get screwed. Oh wait, that’s us right now.



P.s. I’ll probably make a video on this in the future. But I’ll probably procrastinate till I’m 69 when I’m a cloud of consciousness floating about on the left hand of the Omnissiah with 72 anime girls giving me sensual massage in a giga quantum computer. Well, when I do get to making it, it will be hilarious. 

I have been sitting at my desk for too long. It has been couple of hours since the meat I’ve prepared for dinner that very couple of hours ago is lying bare, naked, and raw on my kitchen top, eagerly awaiting my pampering. It did not expect the fact that I would be sucked into a philosophical and casually scientific inquiry into the nature of suffering when in the first place I was just trying to wash away the awkward vibes of a past argument in a Discord chat to later ask for which realm trait we’ll be playing with in this Sunday’s multiplayer game so I can practice it on my own so that won’t be a letdown to my teammates since it’ll be my first-ever multiplayer game of AoW4. I hope my meat has not been corrupted by time and rendered inedible. My gf would be sad. Wait what? I am probably wasting more time here typing this out. I slap myself to get myself to wake up from this idiosyncratic simulation. I’m weird and I should stop before I give in to more of my intrusive thoughts to type things my mind just blurts out.

Alright lads, that about cleaned things up. Now when you enter the channel you will see the results of a psychotic monkey typing away at his keyboard while starving to death at 4am instead of a heated discussion on balancing AoW4.

~~End~~



Now, I refuse to believe any of you have read the entire thing. If you have, you can comment that, I won’t believe you. Like mate, it’s longer than my pp, which isn’t saying much, but still. 

On a more serious note, if you have read through the entire thing, know that I genuinely appreciate you. It’s just something I picked up to write today, but it does contain the culmination of many of the thoughts and sentiments of my past. I hope you had a good laugh. And of course, thanks to the lads in the channel, for smiting me with this electrifying inspiration.

Lessons learned from Trump Coin (Even after I 2xed my investment),OfficialTrumpCoin,1i69v0a,2025-01-20 22:52:16,31,0.87,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/OfficialTrumpCoin/comments/1i69v0a/lessons_learned_from_trump_coin_even_after_i_2xed/,CommanderJMoney,General,"Yeah I lucked out and 2xed my initial ape like investment into trump coin at an average of $16. 

Bought at $9 (like 3 hours after his tweet) & then at $20. At the peak of $70 I was sitting on $150k but I didn't sell. 

(If you're curious how I was able to buy so early, I had to transfer SOL to a phantom wallet and exchange it on Jupiter since Moonshot didn't work for me)

I didn't sell because like many of you i thought the same things...  


1. The market cap is only 10B, this could easily get to 50B and then I'll be sitting on 500k (or whatever amount you did the math for)

2. Donald Trump will definetly not let this fail by pulling funds so soon or in such large amounts, it would hurt his reputation.

3. Everyone and their moms will be trying to buy Trump coin so the price has to reach at least a 50B market cap, especially since you can technically buy with a credit card. 

4. Moonshot is having technical issues but when it's listed on Coinbase and the platforms it will definetly go up since its easier to buy without limits. 

  
What I learned is...

1. Trump pulled funds and invested over $100 Million into other cryptos. He doesn't even believe in his own coin. It's just to transfer wealth.

2. His team of insiders started selling keeping prices dropping. It's all an insider game to fleece you.

3. His whole family is in on the meme coin fad and are trying to make a quick buck. All of his families coins pumped and dumped. Don't trust any celebrity meme coins. 

4. If you've made a 2x, don't be greedy and not take profit. I got greedy and waited at a 3x for it to drop. Next time if I happen to get very lucky, i'll take more profit off the table the higher it goes. Incremental profit gain.

  
Some more lessons in general.

1. Don't invest at an all time high.

2. Don't invest in something that is controlled by insiders.

  
What other lessons did you learn?"

We're not ready for post-disclosure,UFOs_Archives,1i67bvc,2025-01-20 20:42:05,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs_Archives/comments/1i67bvc/were_not_ready_for_postdisclosure/,SaltyAdminBot,,"We have a hundred years of witness testimony, photos, film, video, radar data, airline and military pilot statements, documents declassified or leaked from the US government, and transparency from several other countries about what their experience with UFOs / UAPs has been. Even our astronauts have come back with stories. The problem is that ‘proof’ is never going to be enough to convert the professionally skeptical. And still they want ‘proof’, they point and giggle.

Do you know who else refuses to acknowledge ‘proof’ when it is presented to them? The Flat Earth Society, whose members cling to their beliefs in the face of absolute science. No amount of proof is enough for either group. 

While others debate, point fingers and pore over enlarged photos with magnifying glasses, I’m far more interested now in what this critical time in Earth’s history really means. How do we move forward? 

Homo Sapiens as a species is truly a mess. We have no planetary capital, no planetary monetary system, no planetary oversight to make sure individual nations keep their treaties and promises. On a planet-wide basis, we have weak rule of law that mostly amounts to gentlemen’s agreements called ‘treaties’ or ‘accords’. 

True, there are 193 countries in the UN. Even the UN tires of dealing with 193 sets of law, so why would the ETs want to deal with 193 sets of laws to communicate with us? Veto power in the Security Council is the most perfect means to make sure nothing gets accomplished, that has yet been invented.  The United Nations is not the answer. Do you really think that the cousins of  Prime Ministers have enough sand to deal with these issues? Nah, I didn’t think so.

Our species has the ability to navigate the seas and sky. We’ve been to the moon, and we’ve sent probes far into space. All of this is the lowest possible bar that we could have achieved by now. We’ve been to the moon, but that was 50 years ago and we’ve not been back since. Why? We’ve been squabbling about technology, money, what to do when we get there - how to survive. I don’t think we have time to debate in order to arrive at a consensus on each and every detail of every possible matching bit of data, and then toss coins on whether it’s a real phenomena or not. Besides, the deep dark recesses of the USAPs, the boys are pumping out misinformation at a steady rate. They don’t have answers either - all they can do is point and giggle. 

Hell, we’ve even logged over 5,800 exoplanets using nothing more than shiny bits and radios. Do you think older more advanced civilizations are not going to see us? We literally have nowhere to hide because this earth has been a beacon of water, gold, iron, oxygen, radioactive elements and everything else for billions of years.

Instead, I believe it is time that Homo Sapiens comes to terms with what is going on, and start making planet-wide species-driven decisions on how to move forward, and nobody is driving that conversation. I want to drive discussion on how we can finally reach adulthood as a species. The questions are too big to ignore, and the time may be short before we need to have some kind of plan before everything dissolves into endless discussions, incompatibilities, or worse.

We’ve had plenty of time to get our house in order over the past hundred years, but we’ve squandered that time with secrecy, stalling, and military/corporate obfuscation so that their pet (profitable!) projects keep cranking out more problems for our next generation to resolve. We need to start thinking in terms of how to keep Democracy when the forces of Fascism want to run things. How do we silence the conflict zones, and how we want to represent ourselves to the rest of the galaxy? Whether we can come out and play with our neighbors is in the balance, and secrecy is never in the public interest. 

I don’t believe we are staring Armageddon in the face. Instead, think of it as a huge coming-out party for Homo Sapiens! It’s time to join the rest of the cosmos - if we can drag ourselves across the last low bar and unite as a species. We’re being introduced to the galactic family, perhaps as the Apes instead of the Birdlike Men, the Lizard People, the Light Beings, the Grays, the Pleiadeians, or somebody from Andromeda. That’s our heritage - either embrace it or try to ignore it, but we’re the Apes. Our galactic cousins, no doubt, look peculiar to us, and they think we look a little weird, too. 

So who is with me?"
We're not ready for post-disclosure,UFOs,1i677xj,2025-01-20 20:36:43,0,0.39,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1i677xj/were_not_ready_for_postdisclosure/,TJPontz,Government,"We have a hundred years of witness testimony, photos, film, video, radar data, airline and military pilot statements, documents declassified or leaked from the US government, and transparency from several other countries about what their experience with UFOs / UAPs has been. Even our astronauts have come back with stories. The problem is that ‘proof’ is never going to be enough to convert the professionally skeptical. And still they want ‘proof’, they point and giggle.

Do you know who else refuses to acknowledge ‘proof’ when it is presented to them? The Flat Earth Society, whose members cling to their beliefs in the face of absolute science. No amount of proof is enough for either group. 

While others debate, point fingers and pore over enlarged photos with magnifying glasses, I’m far more interested now in what this critical time in Earth’s history really means. How do we move forward? 

Homo Sapiens as a species is truly a mess. We have no planetary capital, no planetary monetary system, no planetary oversight to make sure individual nations keep their treaties and promises. On a planet-wide basis, we have weak rule of law that mostly amounts to gentlemen’s agreements called ‘treaties’ or ‘accords’. 

True, there are 193 countries in the UN. Even the UN tires of dealing with 193 sets of law, so why would the ETs want to deal with 193 sets of laws to communicate with us? Veto power in the Security Council is the most perfect means to make sure nothing gets accomplished, that has yet been invented.  The United Nations is not the answer.

[**$TRUMP**](https://x.com/search?q=%24TRUMP&src=cashtag_click)

Let’s talk about why memecoins exist, their insane rise, and the risks most people ignore

**What are memecoins?**

Memecoins are cryptos driven by hype, memes, and internet vibes, thriving on social buzz with little utility. Dogecoin started it all as a joke but became a massive success. Shiba Inu followed, skyrocketing from $0 to a multi-billion-dollar market cap faster than you could say “rug.” Now, $TRUMP coin has entered the scene, adding another layer to the unpredictable world of memecoins.

**Why memecoins explode:**

1️⃣ Hype drives everything

2️⃣ A viral tweet or celeb endorsement =

3️⃣FOMO: Everyone wants 100x overnight

But here’s the catch: most memecoins have *zero utility*. [$TRUMP](https://x.com/search?q=%24TRUMP&src=cashtag_click) is a great example of this. Its name alone pulls in:

👉Political junkies

👉Meme enthusiasts

👉Speculators

**But does it do anything? Nope. Its value lives or dies by attention. No memes? No moon.**

**So, why do people buy memecoins?**

🔹 Quick flips: Many jump in early hoping to sell before the hype dies

🔹 Hope: The dream of turning $100 into $10,000

🔹 Fun: Gambling on memes can entertaining



**But here’s what they won’t tell you…**

🔹The dark side of memecoins:

🔹Rug pulls: Developers can vanish with your money

🔹No liquidity: Can't sell when you're up

**Memecoins = gambling**. Don’t bet more than you can lose.

Emotional rollercoasters: Watching your $1k become $10k, then $0, in minutes

Memecoins are fun, but they’re all hype and no substance.

**That’s why it's important to focus on projects that have real utility. Here at** [**Permission.io**](http://permission.io/) **we reward users for their data. We're compliant-first—built for trust, not speculation. 🤝**

PSA: Solana Chain is a Casino,CryptoCurrency,1i5luke,2025-01-20 03:40:21,105,0.85,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1i5luke/psa_solana_chain_is_a_casino/,Zaitobu,ADVICE,"Friendly reminder for whoever needs to hear it: projects (and I use that term loosely) on Solana DO NOT USUALLY GO WELL! This weekend is clearly the first taste of Solana launches for many on this sub. It is not an exaggeration to say that 99.99% of new coins will result in heavy or even total losses for all but a few insiders.

Be careful what you ape out there. You can and will lose everything if you get reckless. By the time you've heard about it, it's probably too late in most cases. The channel that you heard it from is filled with paid shills who are in on the grift and can and will dump hard on their followers.

Never gamble more than you would be willing to lose completely. This is true for every crypto but especially for anonymous hypecoins shilled on X and launched on DeFi chains like Solana.

EDIT:

I should add, I enjoy a bit of degen gambling as much as the next person and I've been doing it for years. But the point is, it is gambling and I treat it as such. I use small amounts and and spread myself over many projects. One takes off and I get out with a 2x or a 5x have a little more to play with and a nice dopamine hit. All the while the other 20 tokens I speculated on that day turn to dust. Maybe one day one of them goes nuts while I sleep and I put down a deposit on a house. But I am not gambling the money I need to live.

All I am saying is don't get swept up in the hype because the game is very heavily rigged against you. I am reading in the daily about people setting up Phantom wallets and asking which coin to drop thousands of dollars into. This is a recipe for disaster."

That’s Miharu, and it’s now a meme coin you don’t want to ignore. Here’s the scoop on why $MIHARU is capturing hearts:

**Origins:**  
Launched on the PumpFun platform, Miharu rocketed after its viral “dead eye happy smiling dolphin” meme took off on social media.

**Community Take Over (CTO):**  
After hitting a market cap of $20M, the original devs exited. Now, no insider manipulation, all tokens were bought on the open market.

**Fair Distribution:**  
No secret dev group. Top holders are everyday buyers who aped in like the rest of us.

**Active & Engaged Community:**  
2,500+ members strong on Discord. They hold raids, share memes, and code new tools—truly a community-led meme phenomenon. Stability & Accessibility:

Survived the initial pump, formed a stable floor, and landed a MEXC listing. The “Smiling Dolphin” is showing no signs of stopping.

**Why It’s Different:**  
It symbolizes joy, collaboration, and innovation, just a fun project with serious viral potential. Let’s see how high this smiling dolphin can swim!

Apes melting down over PPpants purchase of and bragging about Trump coin.,gme_meltdown,1i51gmx,2025-01-19 10:51:31,164,0.98,66,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i51gmx,folteroy,Gourmet Melty Goodness 🧀,
Made My First Successful Meme Coin Trade – Over $30K on One Trade!🥳,SolanaMemeCoins,1i51g5b,2025-01-19 10:50:54,3,1.0,10,https://i.redd.it/p5ysjmmc2zde1.jpeg,Head_Soil_9925,,"Hey everyone,

I just wanted to share an experience that still feels surreal to me: I made my first truly successful trade with a meme coin and walked away with over $30,000 in profit on a single trade. Honestly, I’m still in shock as I type this. I’ve seen so many success stories on here, but I never thought I’d be writing my own.

My Journey So Far

Like many of you, I’ve been in the crypto space for a while, dabbling here and there, trying to learn the ropes, and definitely taking my fair share of losses. If I’m being completely honest, my crypto journey has been full of trial and error (mostly error). Whether it was getting in too late, panic selling, or just chasing hype without any strategy, I’ve done it all.

But despite all of that, I’ve been dedicated to learning. Reading posts here, watching YouTube videos, studying charts, and, most importantly, controlling my emotions has made a massive difference. I wouldn’t be here without the guidance and insights I’ve gained from this community.

So here’s what happened:

I’d been keeping an eye on this particular meme coin for a while. As usual with meme coins, there was a lot of hype, memes, and chatter about it on social media. Normally, I stay away from these plays because they’re so high-risk, but something about this one felt different.

I spent time researching (as much as you can with a meme coin), looking at the community, the roadmap (if you can call it that), and tracking the liquidity and wallet movements. I realized that this was a coin with potential for a big move – not guaranteed, but enough to justify a small, calculated risk.

I didn’t ape in; instead, I put in an amount I was comfortable losing. I set clear rules for myself before even buying in:
	
1.	Don’t get greedy.
	
2.	Stick to my exit plan.
	
3.	Don’t let FOMO or emotions take over.

I got in at a great entry point, and sure enough, the coin started taking off. It was insane watching it pump – I’m talking 10x, 20x, and even higher within a few days. At one point, the adrenaline was so high that I had to literally walk away from my computer to stay calm.

When it hit my target, I didn’t hesitate – I sold. Yes, I probably left money on the table, but I’m okay with that because my goal was never to time the exact top. I locked in my profits and walked away with just over $30,000.


Now that I’ve had this success, I’m not planning on going all-in on meme coins or chasing the next big thing. My plan is to be smart about my profits – diversify, reinvest in safer assets, and continue learning. I don’t want to get reckless just because this trade worked out.

Thanks for reading my story, and I hope it inspires or helps someone out there. Let me know if you’ve had similar experiences or any advice on what I should do moving forward. I appreciate you all!

Let me know if you’d like to tweak anything!"

Snake Wif Hat Why Are People Not Seeing What’s Going On?,SolanaMemeCoins,1i4ttnr,2025-01-19 03:13:59,5,0.57,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolanaMemeCoins/comments/1i4ttnr/snake_wif_hat_why_are_people_not_seeing_whats/,OilOld2977,,"Trump dropped his memecoin a little over 24 hours ago, and yeah, the market dipped most projects are down 7-10%. That’s normal when something big like this happens. But Snake Wif Hat? They didn’t just dip, they straight-up tanked from $4.7 million to $2.5 million in less than a day. That’s over a 20% freefall. So, why has no one put two and two together?

Most decent projects took the Trump hit on the chin and are already stabilizing. But Snake? Nah, this isn’t just about Trump. This is the devs milking their exit liquidity, plain and simple. They’ve been pulling this slow rug game for months, and Trump’s coin just sped up the timeline for a final pump. It’s honestly insane that people aren’t calling this out for what it is.

Snake pumped to $4.7 million a few days ago, and it looked like they were trying to flex about how they were “on the way back up.” But instead of holding steady, the devs decided to cash out even more. Trump’s coin caused some sell-offs, sure, but the devs saw the chaos and thought, “Let’s grab what we can before it’s too late.”

Why has Snake dropped so much compared to other projects? Simple, the dev team. They’ve been doing this for months—dumping on every pump while blaming everything else. Solana price? Convenient excuse. Market conditions? Another convenient excuse. Meanwhile, wallets tied to them have been moving huge amounts, and that balancing bot they’re running can’t hide the cracks anymore.

Seriously, why are people still defending this? If you even try to ask questions in the Telegram chat, you get accused of “spreading FUD” or told to “buy the dip.”

And where are the devs? Nowhere to be seen, as usual. They only pop in to hype things up or throw excuses around. The few loyal community members left are just holding on to false hope while the devs quietly drain the project dry. How is no one seeing this?

Let’s call it what it is, the devs were hoping for one last pump to cash out, but Trump’s coin forced them to move faster. They took advantage of the chaos to grab more liquidity, and now the chart’s freefalling. This wasn’t just a dip, it was a deliberate cash grab disguised as “market conditions.”

Wake Up, People

The writing’s been on the wall for weeks, even months. Wallet transactions don’t lie. The dev team doesn’t care about this project, they’re focused on their exit strategy and new projects. Max cares more about Ape Club and COPEX CTO now as he has more coins and fresh new communities to manipulate.

Trump’s coin just made it harder for them to hide what they’re doing. They should be down 7-10% like the others, not 20%! 

If you’re still holding, ask yourself why. Is it loyalty, or is it just blind hope?

This isn’t me trying to spread hate. It’s just the reality of what’s happening. The chart doesn’t lie, the wallets don’t lie, and the lack of dev involvement doesn’t lie. At some point, you’ve got to stop buying the excuses and see things for what they are.

If you’re still holding, I genuinely hope you get out before it’s too late. The devs are making bank while the community gets left with scraps. Don’t be exit liquidity."

Why? Because it is fully community driven and organic, and it the only coin on Solana that uses the Bitcoin model of 21M total circulation. It's around 50K MC right now with plenty of liquidity. Once it hits 21M MC, that's $1 a coin and  scarce. If you haven't noticed, there is a tsunami of enthusiasm for many of the narrative threads USAcoin intersects:

Bitcoin lore. USA lore. Trump lore. Elon Musk lore. Peter Schiff lore. Solana lore.

"Moonshot Monday: Buckle Up, Crypto Crusaders!",CryptoApeing,1i3dfqf,2025-01-17 05:27:57,1,1.0,0,https://i.redd.it/i4tm5ejx6jde1.jpeg,MaybeBebra,,"Moonshot Monday: Buckle Up, Crypto Crusaders!

  The charts are green, the FOMO is real, and the whispers of a bull run are getting louder than a Chad hodling a diamond-encrusted Lambo. Buckle up, crypto comrades, because this **uptrend** is taking us on a ride to the moon!

**Here's why you should be bullish AF:**

* **Bitcoin** is back above $50k, flirting with its pre-bear market glory. Remember that spicy hopium from late 2021? It's back, baby!
* **Altcoins** are exploding like confetti at a Satoshi convention. Ethereum's breaking records, BNB is on fire, and even Doge is wagging its tail with excitement.
* **Adoption is booming**. From Starbucks accepting crypto to the SEC finally warming up, mainstream acceptance is knocking on the door (and it wants to buy some NFTs).
* **Institutional FOMO is real**. Wall Street whales are diving in, bringing their big bucks and even bigger hype. Remember, their tears taste like sweet, sweet gains.

**But before you ape into every memecoin with a rocket emoji, remember:**

* **Volatility is still our middle name**. This uptrend might be a marathon, not a sprint. Be prepared for dips and don't panic sell at the first sign of a red candle.
* **DYOR is your mantra**. Don't just follow the hype, do your research and understand the projects you're investing in. Not every coin is a moon rocket.
* **DCA is your BFF**. Don't go all-in at once. Dollar-cost averaging helps you weather the storms and build your portfolio gradually.

**So, what are you waiting for?** This uptrend is an invitation to explore, learn, and potentially profit. But remember, crypto is a wild ride, so grab your helmet, hodl tight, and enjoy the journey!

**P.S.** What are your hottest picks for this bull run? Share your moon-shot predictions in the comments below!

**Disclaimer:** This is not financial advice. Please do your own research before making any investment decisions.

Bitcoin is not suitable for small buyers,CryptoIndia,1i3ai8r,2025-01-17 01:43:04,14,0.95,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoIndia/comments/1i3ai8r/bitcoin_is_not_suitable_for_small_buyers/,Archiver_test4,,"i hate to say this but i dont think someone can do SIP/DCA and keep buying bitcoin outside of CEXes because of fees.

  
lets say i want to invest 1000 inr or even 10k inr, the fees is totally prohibitive. 

coindcx charges 0.0004 for BTC withdrawl which currently comes to Rs. 3726.00. 

  
now, we can keep using coindcx and all but then you have to keep trusting their platform and like wazirx has proven, no one is safe.



bitbns is charging 0.0005 which comes to like Rs. 4650.00 so, even if their platform works, you cant really offramp using bitcoin.

[onramp.money](http://onramp.money) is supposed to be ape-shit so not going their either.



what do we do? 

not sure about going dex route also. you have to buy alt-coin from somewhere. then pay fees for sending, (withdrawal first) then swap fees, then withdrawal fees again

if you have a crore rupees at hand, it wont matter but what about small users?

# 7. Finding Coins to Trade

Thousands of new coins launch everyday, so identifying the cookers (coins that will run) should be your main focus.

The majority of coins that launch, will run to zero - so it's super important that you study the market and successful traders to identify what works.

*Before aping into ANY coin, there are several checks you should make to mitigate your risk.*

**1. Is the coin referencing new meta, narrative or hype in the media?**

You want to keep your eyes peeled for new meta on social media. Is there a trending news story about a cute animal? Did Elon Musk just tweet something funny? A new AI agent released?

You need to watch X, TikTok, Reddit for popular themes and stories that will attract mass appeal. Once narratives attract a lot of attention, coins launch and they can cook hard.

You can really only learn this by spending a lot of time studying the market.

The best trader use an X/Twitter crypto tracker. This is is bot that shows in real time tweets from the most influential people: Trump, Elon Musk, Vitalik etc

**2. Has the coin been done before? ... Is it an OG coin?**

You typically make decent profits by jumping into a coin that has not been done before. Originality is a key factor here.

You want to trade into the OG coin (original release) and not the inevitable 20 copycat that follow.

**3. Is the coin bundled?**

In the context of new coins, “bundling” refers to a practice where multiple transactions or tokens are grouped together and distributed in a coordinated manner, often with the intent of manipulating market perception or liquidity.

Usually, a developer or team will buy lots of the tokens from different wallets at the start - wait for other people to get in and then they dump their tokens and crash the chart.

**4. Are successful traders aping in?**

You want to constantly monitor and watch which coins the best traders are aping into.

Find the top meme coin trader wallets and add them to a wallet tracker bot.

Every time they jump into a coin - you will get an alert of when they buy or sell. This is super important because usually these traders have early alpha and know what's gona cook.

# 8. Advanced Tools

To **take your trading game to the next level**, there are several tools the big guys rely on.

........Best advice is to **study study study**

# 9. Welcome to the Trenches

In crypto, *the trenches* refers to the high stakes daily grind chasing the next 1000X meme coin.

*Trenchers* spending their days sitting in Telegram chats, Discord servers and scouring X for alpha.

The term depicts the chaotic, unpredictable nature of the meme coin space, often compared to a battlefield because of the extreme volatility, pump and dumps and rapid innovation that characterizes it.

1. **High Risk and Reward**: Being ""in the trenches"" involves navigating the extreme swings in markets where one's fortune could be made or lost in pretty short order. It requires a lot of vigilance and resilience.
2. **Active Participation**: This includes activities such as trading, developing projects on blockchains, or participating in meme-driven campaigns to pump tokens. It often demands deep understanding of the market. 3. **Social and Psychological Impact:** The trenches can be draining because of FOMO, peer pressure, and managing the stress of putting money in volatile investments. 4. **War at a Community Level:** In particular in meme coin ecosystems, ""trenches"" also mean social media wars with memes and narratives to flip public sentiment and token value.

**Disclaimer:**

Always *#DYOR* and only trade with a small amount of money you can afford to lose. Trading meme coins and AI coins is very risky. Yes, you can make incredible profits but it takes a lot of effort to get good. You should plan to allocate a few months learning and studying the market, in order to become knowledgeable and become profitable. Be prepared to lose money at the start. This is inevitable. Even experienced successful traders lose money trading crypto - the goal is to have more wins than losses over a week or monthly period.

There has never been a better time to enjoy **HUGE GAINS** in crypto - if you dedicate yourself.

**Get BullX. Get studying & Get Profits.**

Good luck! LFG

Tales from the Trenches Part 9,AnarchyOnSol,1i2o3cw,2025-01-16 07:45:30,30,0.97,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnarchyOnSol/comments/1i2o3cw/tales_from_the_trenches_part_9/,Cassius23,,"This is an ongoing series designed to teach people about crypto safety using stories.

These stories have been changed to protect the identity of the victim but are very much based in real world scenarios and describe an instance where a crypto asset owner got their wallet drained due to a hostile actors.

Underneath is what the user could have done to avoid the hack.  

The goal is to learn from other people's mistakes.

If you have any ideas for future stories, let me know in the comments.

Let's continue.

Victim: 21 year old woman

Scenario: Linda had a rough day.  She got into an argument with her boyfriend over crypto, there was drama in the Telegram, and she got a warning at work for checking her wallet.

But this wasn't the time to think about that because $HONEYBAGER had dipped to $.10(it had an ATH of $1) so she raced to CryptoFort, got her Moonla and sent it to her wallet to do the swap. She then typed in ""honey"", found her token, and went all in.  $10k.

She started to be confused when her token started to crash within 10 minutes of when she had it.

Upon further examination she didn't get $HONEYBADGER, she got $HONEYBADGEZ, a coin that looked almost identical to the token she wanted.  

She immediately aped out and lost $8k total.

How to avoid:  The most important thing is to never trade if you are distracted or upset.  Unless you are calm and focused you are a victim waiting to happen.  

In this case Linda fell to the fake coin scam.  Scammers will see a coin that looks identical to the coin they want and get that instead of the coin they want.

The way to avoid this is to use the contract address or ""CA"" when trading for any asset.  If you can't find the CA, you shouldn't trade for the asset.

Stay vigilant.

Other chaos commanders I've been looking at are just cascade, which is alright, but not super practical online. The closest thing I can find that close to the amount of enjoyment is \[\[Brallin, Skyshark Rider\]\] and \[\[Shabraz, the Skyshark\]\], which is alright I guess.

On one hand, I fully embrace a nihilistic perspective. I know that nothing really matters in the grand scheme of things. We’re just evolved apes on a spinning rock in the middle of the universe. One day I’ll die, and all my achievements, goals, and efforts will dissolve into nothingness. Logically, this should make everything I do seem pointless.  
  
And yet, I’ve discovered that I feel deeply fulfilled and much happier when I’m working hard toward goals, improving myself, building discipline, and being productive. Ironically, pursuing these “meaningless” achievements gives my life meaning, even though I know they are ultimately futile.  
  
It’s a strange paradox: I consciously know that none of it truly matters, but acting as if it does makes me feel alive. In fact, I feel far worse when I lean into laziness or escapism, even though, rationally, the end result is the same.  
  
I’d love to hear your perspective on this paradox. How do we reconcile these two truths: that life has no inherent meaning, yet we thrive when we create and pursue meaning for ourselves? Is it just a psychological hack our brains play on us to keep us going, or is there something deeper at work?"

Reflections on Leagues V,2007scape,1i1jspr,2025-01-14 18:32:57,0,0.33,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/1i1jspr/reflections_on_leagues_v/,JohnnyJoeJack,:leagues-badge: Leagues,"Now that Leagues has one week left, I wanted to reflect on some of the highs, lows, and some improvements that I think could be made to both the main game and the next iteration of leagues. 

Let me first say that this definitely felt like the best League yet, especially with the separation of Combat Masteries, the new echo bosses, and echo items. I had tons of fun Jagex, thank you for yet again another amazing experience. 

Disclaimer: I'm basing my comments on two account that I played with varied relics between the two. 

1st Account 6/3/0 Kandarin/Kourend/Tirawnwn

Animal Wrangler, Dodgy Deals, Clue Compass, Reloaded Corner Cutter, Slayer Master, Bankers Note, Overgrown, Guardian 


2nd Account 6/2/0 Varlamore/Morytania/Kourend
Power Miner, Forager, Clue Compass, Golden God, Slayer Master, Bankers Note, Grimoire, Last Stand

**Combat Related** 

- I loved Nature's Reprisal so much. I took that thing with me everywhere, amazing in the Fight Caves, at CoX, at Zulrah. My only concern was that melee didn't work for Dawn at regular Grotesque Guardians and at the Kraken. It doesn't make sense that I can attack Aviansies (elite clues) and not Dawn. It would do damage on hit at Cave Kraken and Boss but would never auto attack - I had to click the enemies after every attack and the chat box was spammed with messages stating my melee attack wouldn't work. (One of many problems with Kandarin...)

- Speaking of Zulrah, It would be awesome if we could melee Zulrah in the main game. 

- Prayer penetration is what got me through CG and Tormented Demons handily, was the best passive along with the the passive that saved ammo/runes/charges. However, it was a problem at Demonic Gorillas; every time they changed prayer, my character would stop auto attacking. This wouldn't happen at TDs when they changed prayers, so I imagine the gorillas are wonky. (Kandarin L yet again)

- The dry protection on echo items was a fantastic idea, and the numbers seemed pretty fair for most echo bosses. However, with items like Gloves of the Damned and Crystal Blessing that depended on other drops, I think we should have been afforded some dry protection or dupe protection on the items they depend on. The crystal blessing was not as bad as armor seeds are pretty common, but I never got to use Guthans or Karils because I couldn't finish their set. I instead got three duplicate complete sets of Ahrims...

 If not dupe protection like at Moons, maybe we could have traded a duplicate piece to the old man in exchange for the piece we wanted, or even another random piece, kinda like extra crates at Wintertodt. 

**Relic Related** 

- Corner Cutter was my biggest relic regret. 

 It wasn't completely dysfunctional, so to be fair I will mention ***where it helped***: 
  1.  I trained agility passively throughout almost the whole account life and mostly did courses for their secondary benefits like amylase, cash, and lap count tasks. 
  2.  It cut the lap count tasks in half, and always gave 16 vouchers at Brimhaven which gave me Pirate hook in half the time. 

 ***Where it could have been improved:***
   
1.  Despite having worn the greaves the whole time playing, even in PVM, I still only got around level 97 Agility after three weeks of solid consistent play.  I supplemented with underwater thieving at the end to get me over the hump to 99 along with filling out the museum. Dodgy deals wins again. Given that most other relics that boosted a specific skill got you to 50M XP very easily, I think the xp could have been buffed significantly. 
1. It didn't double the lap count on the ape atoll course, where there were two tasks based on the monkey backpacks (Huge L for Kandarin  yet again).
1. The money it generated was too little too late. By the time you got the 8x multiplier, you likely already had DD, GG, or another gp solve in place. I think if it upped the spawn rate to a mark of grace every other lap, it could have added a bit of incentive to this relic against the other stellar choices in tier 2 or as a compelling reloaded choice in tier 4. 

- Overgrown was still the best pick in tier 7 imo, but the main issue I had were all the little bugs associated with it. Patches not being ultracomposted unless you added it when planting the first seed was annoying. It didn't work when you had both seeds and saplings of the same type of tree in the vault. Also, it only worked for farming contracts that needed to be harvested to complete -  herbs, flowers, and allotments. Anything that needed to be ""checked"" would not complete the contract. 

- I had planned on taking Guardian specifically because I wanted to see how it would act in the gauntlet, but where it really shined on my first playthrough was the multi hit - with T6 melee and no scythe, I was wrecking multiple mobs at a time with the AoE attack from my bestie. 

- Slayer master was so good that I picked it twice (more on that below), but only because I felt I had to since picking Mory in the second playthrough. I think the thing that would have really propelled it would have been if it automatically gave you a slayer helm, but maybe that would have been overpowered. 

- I really wanted equilibrium to be good this time around but it was too hard not to pick what it was up against. Crazy idea: if equilibirum also guaranteed you got a drop on rate, I would pick it in a heartbeat. 

- Forager was a great pick if you didn't go for overgrown, and I didn't realize how amazing the passive herblore xp was.  The secondary save was also incredible especially paired with goggles from Varlamore. Even with the Mixology minigame, I still hated making potions. If you don't have Desert, Kourend, or Grimoire you'll have to clean all those herbs yourself.  Not to mention making the unfinished potions. My initial thoughts were that we should have received clean herbs in place of grimy ones in the bag, or that we should have been able to convert them into unf potions somehow. Recently I realized this also sucks in the main game, so I came up with a few ideas... 
Another npc or two that cleans herbs or makes unfinished potions / processes secondaries. Could be in Taverly and/or Varlamore, near the alchemists. 
 
 Maybe another device we could buy from the mastering mixology minigame that processes a full inventory in some way, whether it be a mini hopper addition to the reagent pouch that takes a full inventory of secondaries and grinds them. Or potentially an herb grinder that takes a full inventory of herbs and turns them into a stackable paste that you can then fill vials of water with. Something akin to the hopper in the minigame, would also be amazing to put grimy herbs in the hopper there too. 

 Or maybe you could just add all herblore services to the sage in Lumby. 

- Lastly, on Treasure Arbiter (you guessed it... Kandarin Bad). I took clue compass and originally planned on taking Treasure Arbiter as well due to the synergy. Ardy diaries eventually had me at 250 coin pouches without having to open them. I was afking paladins in Ardy Castle  and stacking chaos runes (for tokkul), cash, and hard clues. Gnomes for medium clues, heros for elites. However I had so many clues that the equipment requirements didn't really matter and I could just drop the clues I couldn't do and go get more. What sucked was having to do all those puzzles over and over again.  Once I saw people getting Sherlock steps that were impossible to complete due to area locks, I switched over to slayer master. 

I want to reiterate that I had an amazing time this Leagues and I can't wait for next year, or to run it back in Zanaris Servers if those come out sooner. 

P.P.S Even though everyone (including myself in this post) crapped on Kandarin, I still enjoyed my time there. Just not at Echo Thermy. Once I got my Combat Mastery there I didn't even bother with the echo drop and GTFO."

Lessons from the Trenches: Hard Truths Every New Trader Should Know about pump.fun and solana,planktoncash,1i148wi,2025-01-14 06:44:10,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/planktoncash/comments/1i148wi/lessons_from_the_trenches_hard_truths_every_new/,kank1n,,"Welcome to Solana’s meme-coin trenches, where everyone hopes to flip a few SOL into huge profits. Reality check: without the right mindset, tools, and strategy, most end up as someone else’s exit liquidity. **Read on if you want to survive.**

**Hard Truths for Every Trader**

**1.** **You Start as Exit Liquidity**  
When you’re new, you’re basically funding the insiders. They move the market, and they’ll dump before you even blink. Your mission is to learn fast and stop being the exit.

**2. No Copy-Trading Will Save You**  
Don’t think you can just follow wallet trackers or insider calls. Even the best-performing groups don’t win every trade. On *very good* days, they might hit 45% of their calls—usually it’s 20–30%. If you rely on blind trust, your bag will evaporate.

**3.** **It’s All About Risk Management**  
Nothing is guaranteed. Control how much you put in and how you plan to get out. If you go all-in, you’re gambling, not trading.

**4. Profits Come from Staying in the Game**  
Spread your trades so you always have another chance. Going all-in on a single coin is a quick way to lose everything. The real edge comes from learning day by day.

**Mistakes That Kill Newbies**

**1. Apeing Too Big, Too Soon**  
Don’t drop 50% of your entire bag on one play. Try 1–5% per trade so you get multiple shots at finding a winner.

**2. No Exit Plan**  
Holding for “the next big pump” is the fastest way to end up with zero. Take your initial SOL out around 2x, then trim profits gradually.

**3. Trading on Emotions**  
FOMO leads to bad decisions. If you’re stressed, step away. Calm, rational thinking prevents blowups.

4. **Ignoring Warning Signs**  
Watch who’s selling. If main holders dump or the Telegram chat dies, it’s usually over. Check volume and recent trades before you buy or sell.

**Practical Advice for New Traders**

**1. Start Small**  
Experiment with \~0.25–0.3 SOL (around $50). You’ll learn the ropes without risking your entire bag.

**2. Always Take Profits**  
At 2x, pull out your initial. From there, trim 10% at each price jump. New trades appear all the time—don’t marry your bags.

**3. Manage Your Risk**  
Don’t ape the top; wait for corrections. If you’re comfortable with a –20% dip, act fast if it hits that. Quick decisions matter here.

**4. Reset After Big Wins or Losses**  
Step away from the charts. Overconfidence or chasing losses both lead to disaster. Cool off, then come back fresh.

**Tools You Need**

**1. Phanes Bot (@Phanes\_bot)**  
Paste the contract address (CA) and use commands throught / (e.g. /th CA) to see who holds the coin. If a few wallets hold most of the supply, watch out.

**2. Bundle Scanner (@TrenchScannerBot)**  
Shows how bundled the supply is. Heavy concentration in a few wallets is a major red flag.

**3. Plankton Trading Bot (@planktontrade\_bot)**  
Low-fee, straightforward bot for buying and selling quickly. Supports multi-wallet functions for advanced tactics.

**Scams and Red Flags**

**1. Insiders Are Not Your Friends**  
Influencers hype coins to profit from your ignorance. Don’t rely on them for honest calls.

**2. Weak Projects**  
If Telegram chats are dead and volume is low, the coin is likely going nowhere.

**3. No “Honest Ideas”**  
Coins pump because of attention, not trustworthiness. Look for active communities, unique angles, and steady volume.

**Final Rule:** ***Stick to Your Strategy***

**Always follow your plan.** Most traders blow up because they ignore their own rules. Set boundaries for entries, profit-taking, and exits. Then honor them—no excuses.

**Share Your Stories**

**Start Small**

The Truth About Snake Wif Hat. Time to Wake Up and Cut Your Losses,SolanaMemeCoins,1i1413a,2025-01-14 06:28:45,0,0.36,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolanaMemeCoins/comments/1i1413a/the_truth_about_snake_wif_hat_time_to_wake_up_and/,Beginning-Minute7654,,"Alright guys, I’m usually not one to post, but after watching this trainwreck for way too long and calling it out in comments, it’s time to call it like it is. If you’re still holding Snake Wif Hat, this is your wake-up call.

I was a holder from early days, aped in, thought this thing had potential, but after seeing everything unravel, I cashed out a while ago. And let me tell you, I’m glad I did. The red flags were there all along; I just didn’t want to see them at first. But now? The writing’s on the wall, and if you’re still in, you need to start asking yourself why.

The Wallet Shenanigans

Let’s start with the wallet drama. People on Reddit have been exposing wallet addresses tied to the dev team, showing massive transfers of 80M-120M tokens being split across 10-15 wallets before bonding even happened. Come on, you don’t need to be a genius to figure out what’s going on here. That’s insider behavior 101.

This wasn’t some random whale action; this is the dev team or their little clique lining their pockets while everyone else is left holding the bag. If you think they’ve got your back, think again.

The Mods Pulled Out for a Reason

I wasn’t super active in their Tele, but I watched enough to know what went down. In the early days, two mods and basically carried the community. They kept the chat alive, hyped the project, and were big reasons why people stuck around.

But guess what? They’re gone now. They said they were in it for the long haul, but actions speak louder than words. They cashed out and went silent. My guess? They caught wind of what the dev team was really doing and decided they couldn’t be a part of it anymore. And honestly? I respect them for that.

The Toxic Community

The Telegram chat is a joke. I was lurking yesterday, and someone asked a genuine question about how long they should hold, given how bad the chart looks. Fair question, right? Nope. Sabrina and VJ accused the guy of spreading FUD and told everyone to just “buy more” and “stop selling on red candles.”

Are you kidding me? The chart’s been in freefall for weeks, and people are just trying to figure out how to minimize their losses. Instead of addressing concerns, they’re gaslighting the community and doubling down on this “diamond hands” nonsense. It’s disgusting, honestly.

Last night, things took an even uglier turn in the Telegram chat. VJ, one of the moderators, started going off on some guy (can’t even remember his name) and straight-up said he’d “shit in his mouth” if he ever saw him. Seriously, this is the kind of toxic behavior that’s supposed to be leading the community? It’s beyond unprofessional it’s a red flag you can’t ignore.

The Swiss Cabal

Let’s talk about the dev team. They call themselves the Swiss Cabal apparently. If you’ve been in crypto long enough, you know what that means: they’re farming the community. They let the community do all the work, while they milk the token for everything it’s worth.

They’ve barely shown up in the chat lately, and when they do, it’s all empty promises about Marketing. Meanwhile, they’ve already moved on to another project, Ape Club, where I’m pretty sure they’re running the same playbook.

The Balancing Bot

Here’s the kicker: they’ve been running a balancing bot for weeks to make the chart look stable. But even that bot couldn’t keep up with the dumps. When the chart dipped to $1.3M-$1.4M yesterday, it was obvious the whole thing was falling apart. If you’re holding right now, you’re literally just waiting to get wrecked.

Excuses, Excuses

The devs keep blaming Solana’s price for the chart tanking, saying that’s why they won’t spend money on Marketing. Are you serious? Every project is dealing with Solana’s volatility, but good devs find solutions. These guys just use it as an excuse to avoid spending a dime while they cash out.

It’s Time to Get Out

Look, I’m not here to sugarcoat it: this project is done. The devs are cashing out, the mods are gaslighting anyone with concerns, and the community is full of people too blind or stubborn to see what’s happening.

If you’re still holding, now’s the time to cut your losses. Forget about “diamond hands” or “waiting for the turnaround.” There’s no turnaround coming. The evidence is right in front of you... wallet dumps, a dead community, and a dev team that’s already moved on to their next rug.

I think im done with meme coins that rely on “community” because this is what happens: the community does all the work, and the devs reap the rewards. I’ll stick to short trading shy coins from now on, at least with those, I know what I’m getting into and know it's a rug from the beginning.

For those still holding Snake Wif Hat, good luck. But don’t say you weren’t warned."

It's like they've all forgotten it was pretty much dead around here before last September. Before BOB the cycle burn rate on the whole eco was about 13,000,000,000 - yes I was checking it everyday 😂

We've seen Burn, ICPS and other knock-offs come and go and BOB by itself still has more trading volume than the whole of Kongswap on a good day.

Must be killing these guys that they've been holding onto their ""meme"" coins waiting for investors to come along and when they do they've bypassed their shit coins and aped in on BOB.

Personally I try to like and support anything ICP related but it's getting hard to look past the same ""influencers"" being behind most projects on ICP - it's starting to leave a sour taste when at first they didn't give BOB it's dues in their metrics posts (cycle burn rate/daily revenue etc). Anyone here before BOB knows not a lot was going on in the eco - now they want it dead so you invest in their shit projects. My opinion of a lot of these people on X has really gone down.

A guide to not going broke ,SolCoins,1i0c2fw,2025-01-13 06:39:09,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolCoins/comments/1i0c2fw/a_guide_to_not_going_broke/,PsychologicalTie5284,,"My investment guide for not going broke with SOLANA memes.

These are personal opinions from 6 months in the trenches following the pumpfun evolution.

1. Never buy until you can fully verify dev and bundles are gone.  If you do you are just gambling and this thread is about finding long term projects. Kindly move along and brag about your degen moves elsewhere.

2.  Find the right ticker.  It has to be a funny or unique ticker with a potential narrative that people will follow.  Stay away from duplicates or things that are too derivative.

3.  Watch the CTO as it forms.  Watch out for if the CTO seems like it’s already set up.  This is likely the dev and his cabal continuing the scam and are farming you.  Stay away.  Watch if the CTO starts a VC to “vibe” or just play music.  They are farming, unserious, or both.  Stay Away.

Your CTO creators need three things:  experience, connections, and startup capital for important early expenses.  If they don’t have at least two of the three, stay away.  This can be difficult to determine, but that’s ok cause you haven’t invested yet.  You have joined their telegram and watching…researching.

***There is an opportunity to make short term money in the right situation here.  Risky but potentially rewarding.  If they dev left a huge boost and is gone, there is real energy from the community (real people not bots) and legit people take over, you could buy the chart on the bottom and make multiple x’s in anywhere from 2-18 hours.  Very risky and not investing…more like calculated degen gambling.  If you do this, DO NOT HOLD! You will round trip your bag if you do.

4. This is where it gets fun, and is the most important step.  After the initial pump under the CTO leadership(this pump could last from a few hours up to a day in my experience), the coin will lose momentum and experience an 80-90% retracement from that high. It happens to every one of them.  A matter of when, not if.  This is when you watch for important things:

A. Is the community still growing and the holder count remaining steady?
B. Do the mods have control of the chat and keeping everything positive?
C.  Is the community properly raiding and working for their coin, or are they panicking and fudding?
D.  Is the lead steady and following through with their plan?  No knee jerk reactions to price action?
E.  Do you still believe this is a good ticker with a narrative to grow?

If all of those are positive signs, calmly start to DCA when the coin is down 80%-85% from the height of the pump.

5. Remember that you are investing.  Never full port.  Never ape in.  Once the coin finds its bottom, it will tap and retest there several times likely. If the community is still there and positive, you might just have a winner on your hands, with minimal risk compared to most other strategies.

Remember that 99.9% of memes go to zero.  By following this strategy, you are finding coins that have a better chance at survival, but it’s still not a sure thing.  The good news?  When one hits, you are positioned to get a 100x return.  So if even a small percentage of your plays hit you will make serious money.

I don’t want to get this post removed by mentioning tickers, but the most recent coin I investigated that followed this trajectory hit 3.5 million on the cto pump, retraced to under 400k, and then ran to 140 million.  Think about that.


The current coin I’m watching pumped to 2.5-3 million, retraced to under 300k, and has since bounced and is consolidating between 1 and 1.5 million. If you are into the female anatomy you can check it out and research it yourself.

It checks all the boxes you are looking for, and I’m optimistic it flies beyond ATH soon."

How to Easily Spot Bundled Memecoins on Pump.Fun and Avoid Getting Rugged,MemecoinSeason,1hzdai4,2025-01-11 22:06:07,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MemecoinSeason/comments/1hzdai4/how_to_easily_spot_bundled_memecoins_on_pumpfun/,BullishTBH,,"Been seeing lots of confusion about bundled coins on Pump.Fun lately, so here's a quick guide on what they are and how to spot them before you ape in.

**TLDR:** Bundled coins = one buyer controlling multiple wallets to hide large holdings. Here's how to spot them instantly using [BullX](https://t.me/BullxNeoBot?start=access_TH6NGZJRQTJ) (free tool).

**🚀Get BullX Access:** [https://t.me/BullxNeoBot?start=access\_TH6NGZJRQTJ](https://t.me/BullxNeoBot?start=access_TH6NGZJRQTJ)

[This guide will show you how to find and avoid obvious rugs and scams!](https://preview.redd.it/8yj6ti2fbhce1.png?width=693&format=png&auto=webp&s=d68fb7f89bb1c8dd8a72aec0f8310fdcc6a4d735)

# What Are Bundled Memecoins? (The Simple Version)

Bundled memecoins are tokens where one person (usually the developer) controls a large portion of the supply across multiple wallets. They do this to make the token look more legitimate by hiding their large holdings. Instead of showing up as one wallet holding 50% of tokens, it might look like 10 different wallets each holding 5%.

**Why Should You Care?**

The biggest risk with bundled coins is that one person can dump all their holdings at once, even though it looks like the supply is spread across many holders. This is a common rugpull technique that's burned many traders.

# How to Spot Bundled Coins (The Easy Way)

I've found that using [BullX](https://t.me/BullxNeoBot?start=access_TH6NGZJRQTJ) (it's free!) makes spotting bundled coins super straightforward. Here's what to look for:

**1. The Basic Indicators**

When you check any token on BullX's Neo Vision, pay attention to these key metrics:

* **Top 10 Holding**: If it's over 20% (marked in red), proceed with caution. This means a small group controls too much supply.
* **Dev Holding**: Anything over 5% is a red flag. Smart developers distribute their holdings to avoid scaring off buyers.

https://preview.redd.it/youb9676bhce1.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&s=086d89df09d464ec9658a53f191907c54a50ffa3

**2. The Advanced Warning Signs**

These are the real bundle-spotting tools:

* **Insider Holding** (the rat icon): This shows tokens that were ""gifted"" or transferred between wallets rather than purchased. High insider holding often means one person is distributing tokens across multiple wallets.
* **Sniper Count**: This is your best friend for spotting bundles. Snipers are wallets that bought within 20 seconds of launch. A high sniper count often means someone's trying to quickly grab supply across multiple wallets before regular traders can buy in.

[Low dev holding might make you think this is a \\""safe\\"" play but the dev is holding most of the supply across multiple wallets.](https://preview.redd.it/gfdz5bhhahce1.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=887de901caa03244794a2a47f1821bf072ae5f69)

# Pro Tip: Using the Advanced Sniper View

Click the Snipers button on any token's BullX page to see:

* Which snipers have sold
* Which have sold partially
* Which are still holding

Once most snipers have sold, the risk level typically drops significantly.

[BullX's sniper checker shows that snipers still hold 40&#37; of token supply even after dumping on everyone from many wallets.](https://preview.redd.it/nppw9uqrahce1.png?width=549&format=png&auto=webp&s=f93ab1ab81b9f3166f832d54a15279606d4dd3e1)

**Important Context: Not All Bundles Are Bad**

Here's something many guides won't tell you: Even legitimate projects that launch on Pump.Fun sometimes bundle supply at launch. They do this to control supply for future growth. The key is looking at the whole picture:

* Is the team doxxed?
* Are there active social accounts?
* Is there a clear roadmap?

# TL;DR:

* Use [BullX](https://t.me/BullxNeoBot?start=access_TH6NGZJRQTJ)'s free tools to check for bundles
* Watch for high insider holdings and sniper counts
* Remember that context matters - look at the whole project
* Don't ape in without checking these indicators first
