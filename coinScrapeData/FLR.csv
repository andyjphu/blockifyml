still can't get metamask to work,FlareNetworks,1i9jbb3,2025-01-25 04:22:13,3,1.0,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlareNetworks/comments/1i9jbb3/still_cant_get_metamask_to_work/,pez86,:Question-Post: Question,"Could really use some help. The metamask ledger address I have been using to delegate will no longer allow me to do any transactions. I can't stake unstake, claim or do anything with flare. Other people had similar issues and were able to resolve by using the flare network on ledger or using a different browser etc. I have tried both. My ledger address for flare is not the same one as the ledger address in my metamask. I've read that maybe I need to send the flr associated with my MM ledger address to the ""flare network ledger"" address. However, if I cannot unstake my flr or do any kind of transaction with my MetaMask ledger address, then what can I do? 

Help would be appreciated. Also odd that not that many people are having this issue... "

This is an investment speculation since XRP is on the rise and Flr seems to be under the radar for a lot, people are not aware how $flr tech can potentially make XRP/DOGE/BTC way more usable for a lot of applications, which in turn makes me really bullish for this token.

Does anyone else has this sentiment or am I crazy to think it's ridiculous that this thing hasn't taken off yet?(Yet it seems it has great growth the past days, probably due to the songbird changes)."
Is it worth the time to claim Flare?,FlareNetworks,1hwy8d0,2025-01-08 18:22:59,2,0.57,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlareNetworks/comments/1hwy8d0/is_it_worth_the_time_to_claim_flare/,RayMetz100,:Question-Post: Question,"At today's market cap of 1.2B, I would like to own $36 of FLR.  That is $30 for every $1B of market cap.  If we were talking BTC market cap, that would be over $50K.

Years ago, I made an entry on the XRP blockchain that might have resulted in some Flare tokens to claim.  I don't know what my unclaimed Flare tokens are worth, but it cant be too much more than $36.  An hour of my time is worth more than $36.  I already own $30 FLR on Coinbase.  I think it makes sense to never claim my FLR and buy more from Coinbase if I really want FLR.  Am I missing anything here?"

It's very simple.

First you'll need metamask (link with ledger preferably)

Add Flare Mainnet Network to Metamask by adding a custom network.

RPC URL: https://flare-api.flare.network/ext/bc/C/rpc

Chain ID: 14

Token Symbol: FLR

Explore Block URL: https://flare-explorer.flare.network

Buy Flare from a exchange and send it to your ledger linked with metamask.

Connect your metamask to the Flare Portal, wrap your Flare and set your Delegator. I use Bifrost at 100%.

Then go to flareoracle.io and set up an automatic claiming plan with metamask so you don't have to visit the Flare Portal every month. You can also wrap it from this website.

If you aren't using a ledger just make sure Flare Network is the selected network on your Metamask receive address. Always do minimum required test transactions first try to mitigate risk."
FlareDrops Are Now Available to Claim - Airdrop Information & Discussion Thread (Jan 05 2025),FlareNetworks,1hueb81,2025-01-05 14:00:48,20,0.96,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlareNetworks/comments/1hueb81/flaredrops_are_now_available_to_claim_airdrop/,AutoModerator,,"# FlareDrops Are Now Available to Claim - Airdrop Information & Discussion Thread

The monthly FlareDrop is now available to claim for eligible participants!

Use this thread to discuss and ask questions related to FlareDrops. Please feel free to help others who are looking for help publicly on this discussion thread. **Do not reply to private messages from users offering help, as these messages are highly likely attempts to scam you.**

# What are FlareDrops?

* FlareDrops are a series of 36 airdrops of the Flare Network's native token, Flare ($FLR). Airdrops occur every 30 days to eligible participants and will total 24.2 billion $FLR.

# FlareDrops Eligibility

* To be eligible to claim a portion of that month's FlareDrop, a wallet must have held Wrapped FLR (WFLR) for the 23 days before each claim day. These 23 days constitute the ""Holdings calculation period.""
* Three random blocks are chosen during those 23 days to calculate the average holdings of all wallets. The [technical documentation](https://docs.flare.network/tech/the-flaredrop/) provides more detail on this process.
* Your allocation of FlareDrop tokens will be proportional to its relative share of all WFLR in circulation.
* The number of FlareDrop tokens that a wallet can claim in any month is based on its relative share of all WFLR in circulation.
* No Flare-related entity, employee, or founder may use their token allocation to claim a portion of the FlareDrops.
* Any FLR stake which has been delegated to validators on the P-Chain is also eligible for FlareDrops. FlareDrop allocations each month are now based on the combined total of WFLR held and FLR staked on the P-Chain during the three random blocks.

# Claiming FlareDrops

* FlareDrops can be claimed using the [Flare Portal](https://portal.flare.network/) by connecting a wallet that held WFLR during the Holdings calculation period.
* [Bifrost Wallet](https://bifrostwallet.com/) offers native functionality for claiming FlareDrops, which is similar to the existing functionality for claiming FTSO Delegation Rewards.
* There is also the option to [set up autoclaiming](https://flare.network/autoclaiming-available-on-flare/), which will ensure FlareDrop tokens are automatically and immediately claimed in return for a fee. This will maximize compounding, save time, and avoid unnecessary exposure of a cold wallet.
* Advanced users can also claim by interacting directly with the smart contracts.
* Unclaimed airdrop tokens will be burned 67 days after each distribution, 90 days from the start of the holdings calculation period.

PSA: For everyone saying the tokenomics of Flare inflation sucks.,FlareNetworks,1hp94su,2024-12-29 18:33:04,5,0.78,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlareNetworks/comments/1hp94su/psa_for_everyone_saying_the_tokenomics_of_flare/,redditreader1234567,:Education-Post: Education,"The *tokenomics* of Flare's inflation often gets misunderstood. I frequently hear people saying, ""Flare's inflation sucks,"" which shows they don't fully understand how it works.

Firstly, Flare's inflation is set at only **5%**, capped at a maximum of 5 billion tokens per year. However, this 5% applies to the *available circulating supply*, not the *total circulating supply*. Tokens that are staked are not considered part of the available supply because they are locked up in staking.

Secondly, once XRP f-assets are live, minting f-assets will require collateral amounting to **1.5 times the value** of the f-asset being minted. This collateral will consist of stablecoins and FLR tokens. For example, when f-assets for BTC go live, the high price of BTC (e.g., $94,000) will necessitate a significant amount of FLR for collateral. This will create a supply shock, driving an upward force on the price and more than offsetting the 5% inflation rate.

(Also, keep in mind that the inflation rate can be adjusted—up or down—through a governance vote if needed.)

Furthermore, it's important to note that most of the 5% inflation rewards will primarily go to Flare whales. Rewards and airdrops are proportional to the amount of FLR tokens held. Since these Flare whales likely believe in the project, they are probably not selling their tokens in the short term. Ideally, they're putting their money where their mouth is, heavily investing in Flare with a long-term view of generating passive income. For instance, early investors in Flare may eventually benefit from a steady income stream if FLR tokens reach $4 each.

Also keep in mind in order for FLR holders to get rewards from staking and delegating they must pull their FLR tokens off of exchanges further reducing supply that can be sold.

The total supply of Flare will be 200 billion, but 100 billion of that comes from the **5% inflation**, capped at a maximum of 5 billion tokens per year. This inflation is distributed at **5% per year** for the next 20 years.

Currently, Flare's circulating supply is comparable to Tron or XRP or Cardano or Stellar. For context, Tron rose from $0.02 to $0.45 in just over four years. Similarly, XRP climbed from $0.005 in 2016 to a peak of $2.75.

Now, imagine XRP holders minting f-assets on Flare. It’s a win-win for XRP holders because they received FLR tokens for free during the airdrop snapshot. By minting f-assets, they can increase the value of their free FLR tokens while earning incentives and gaining access to smart contract functionality, while still holding their exposure to XRP price movements in a trustless and decentralized way. While Flare's smart contract ecosystem is still in its early stages, more dApps are likely to emerge over time.

If **10% of XRP holders** mint f-assets, with XRP’s current market cap of $120 billion, Flare's market cap could exceed $12 billion—likely closer to $18 billion, considering the 1.5x FLR collateral requirement.

Now, think bigger. Imagine **10% of BTC holders** minting f-assets (FBTC) on Flare over the next four years. What’s 10% of a few trillion-dollar BTC market cap? The potential for Flare’s growth becomes staggering when you factor in the demand for FLR as collateral.

What if the market cap of BTC goes to 50 trillion over the next 20 years?

In summary, the early adopters and long-term believers in Flare will likely reap the rewards of this system, positioning themselves for passive income in the future."

Welcome to the megalist of all known online money making opportunities, also known as beermoney! It will contain various options for earning money in your spare time, such as mobile applications, ""Get-Paid-To"" websites, passive methods, cryptocurrency platforms, and much more. These where were tried out in Europe but should work worldwide. It is highly recommended to combine various websites in order to maximize earnings. Be aware that most of these websites require verified **PayPal** in order to process withdrawals, so make sure you have that sorted out.


One thing I should mention here right away is that **these will not really replace a real job**. Please use these methods platforms to supplement your already existing income instead.

We have launched a dedicated beermoney blog, [BeermoneyGuides](https://beermoneyguides.com/)! It will feature more in-depth guides and reviews for beermoney methodsthat are being featured in this thread.

As the title suggests, ""Get-Paid-To"" websites pay you to do certain tasks. Now there might not be too many surveys available that work, but offers can be well worth doing in my opinion. Take some time to browse around to see what is available (for example, mobile game offers) and compare different rates between different GPT websites.

FLR Price Prediction for 2025 ?,FlareNetworks,1hcxta6,2024-12-12 17:53:45,22,0.93,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlareNetworks/comments/1hcxta6/flr_price_prediction_for_2025/,MoonbaseADA,:Discussion-Post: Discussion,"OK folks, I'm putting this post out here to get your honest and realistic feedback... 

What is your best guess for Flare's alll-time-high price in 2025?

With the recent big Bitcoin price moves, the major surge in alt coin prices, incoming Trump crypto deregulation, and Flare's unique utility... I see FLR going to $0.25 in 2025. (Essentialy a 10x to 15x from current price)

Curious to know what your thoughts  are on where FLR price could go in this upcoming bull market.

Thanks in advance for your feedback.

Why Run Your Own Node on Flare Instead of Simply Delegating or Staking?,FlareNetworks,1hbfwkm,2024-12-10 18:45:54,15,0.94,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlareNetworks/comments/1hbfwkm/why_run_your_own_node_on_flare_instead_of_simply/,Banknotez,:Question-Post: Question,"Hi everyone,

As a software developer, I’m curious about the financial incentives for running your own validator node on Flare. From what I understand, delegating or staking FLR seems much simpler, with fewer risks and responsibilities, while still offering competitive rewards.

What motivates people to go through the hassle of running and maintaining a node? Are there significant advantages—financial or otherwise—that make it worthwhile compared to just delegating?

I’d love to hear your thoughts, especially from those running nodes.

Thanks!"

The monthly FlareDrop is now available to claim for eligible participants!

Use this thread to discuss and ask questions related to FlareDrops. Please feel free to help others who are looking for help publicly on this discussion thread. **Do not reply to private messages from users offering help, as these messages are highly likely attempts to scam you.**

# What are FlareDrops?

* FlareDrops are a series of 36 airdrops of the Flare Network's native token, Flare ($FLR). Airdrops occur every 30 days to eligible participants and will total 24.2 billion $FLR.

# FlareDrops Eligibility

* To be eligible to claim a portion of that month's FlareDrop, a wallet must have held Wrapped FLR (WFLR) for the 23 days before each claim day. These 23 days constitute the ""Holdings calculation period.""
* Three random blocks are chosen during those 23 days to calculate the average holdings of all wallets. The [technical documentation](https://docs.flare.network/tech/the-flaredrop/) provides more detail on this process.
* Your allocation of FlareDrop tokens will be proportional to its relative share of all WFLR in circulation.
* The number of FlareDrop tokens that a wallet can claim in any month is based on its relative share of all WFLR in circulation.
* No Flare-related entity, employee, or founder may use their token allocation to claim a portion of the FlareDrops.
* Any FLR stake which has been delegated to validators on the P-Chain is also eligible for FlareDrops. FlareDrop allocations each month are now based on the combined total of WFLR held and FLR staked on the P-Chain during the three random blocks.

# Claiming FlareDrops

* FlareDrops can be claimed using the [Flare Portal](https://portal.flare.network/) by connecting a wallet that held WFLR during the Holdings calculation period.
* [Bifrost Wallet](https://bifrostwallet.com/) offers native functionality for claiming FlareDrops, which is similar to the existing functionality for claiming FTSO Delegation Rewards.
* There is also the option to [set up autoclaiming](https://flare.network/autoclaiming-available-on-flare/), which will ensure FlareDrop tokens are automatically and immediately claimed in return for a fee. This will maximize compounding, save time, and avoid unnecessary exposure of a cold wallet.
* Advanced users can also claim by interacting directly with the smart contracts.
* Unclaimed airdrop tokens will be burned 67 days after each distribution, 90 days from the start of the holdings calculation period.
* Read: [Claiming the FlareDrop](https://docs.flare.network/user/claiming-the-flaredrop/)

**Get-Paid-To (GPT)** 

As the title suggests, ""Get-Paid-To"" websites pay you to do certain tasks. Now there might not be too many surveys available that work, but offers can be well worth doing in my opinion. Take some time to browse around to see what is available (for example, mobile game offers) and compare different rates between different GPT websites.

The monthly FlareDrop is now available to claim for eligible participants!

Use this thread to discuss and ask questions related to FlareDrops. Please feel free to help others who are looking for help publicly on this discussion thread. **Do not reply to private messages from users offering help, as these messages are highly likely attempts to scam you.**

# What are FlareDrops?

* FlareDrops are a series of 36 airdrops of the Flare Network's native token, Flare ($FLR). Airdrops occur every 30 days to eligible participants and will total 24.2 billion $FLR.

# FlareDrops Eligibility

* To be eligible to claim a portion of that month's FlareDrop, a wallet must have held Wrapped FLR (WFLR) for the 23 days before each claim day. These 23 days constitute the ""Holdings calculation period.""
* Three random blocks are chosen during those 23 days to calculate the average holdings of all wallets. The [technical documentation](https://docs.flare.network/tech/the-flaredrop/) provides more detail on this process.
* Your allocation of FlareDrop tokens will be proportional to its relative share of all WFLR in circulation.
* The number of FlareDrop tokens that a wallet can claim in any month is based on its relative share of all WFLR in circulation.
* No Flare-related entity, employee, or founder may use their token allocation to claim a portion of the FlareDrops.
* Any FLR stake which has been delegated to validators on the P-Chain is also eligible for FlareDrops. FlareDrop allocations each month are now based on the combined total of WFLR held and FLR staked on the P-Chain during the three random blocks.

# Claiming FlareDrops

* FlareDrops can be claimed using the [Flare Portal](https://portal.flare.network/) by connecting a wallet that held WFLR during the Holdings calculation period.
* [Bifrost Wallet](https://bifrostwallet.com/) offers native functionality for claiming FlareDrops, which is similar to the existing functionality for claiming FTSO Delegation Rewards.
* There is also the option to [set up autoclaiming](https://flare.network/autoclaiming-available-on-flare/), which will ensure FlareDrop tokens are automatically and immediately claimed in return for a fee. This will maximize compounding, save time, and avoid unnecessary exposure of a cold wallet.
* Advanced users can also claim by interacting directly with the smart contracts.
* Unclaimed airdrop tokens will be burned 67 days after each distribution, 90 days from the start of the holdings calculation period.
* Read: [Claiming the FlareDrop](https://docs.flare.network/user/claiming-the-flaredrop/)

As the title suggests, ""Get-Paid-To"" websites pay you to do certain tasks. Now there might not be too many surveys available that work, but offers can be well worth doing in my opinion. Take some time to browse around to see what is available (for example, mobile game offers) and compare different rates between different GPT websites.

FlareDrops Are Now Available to Claim - Airdrop Information & Discussion Thread (Oct 07 2024),FlareNetworks,1fye57k,2024-10-07 14:00:57,9,0.85,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlareNetworks/comments/1fye57k/flaredrops_are_now_available_to_claim_airdrop/,AutoModerator,,"# FlareDrops Are Now Available to Claim - Airdrop Information & Discussion Thread

The monthly FlareDrop is now available to claim for eligible participants!

Use this thread to discuss and ask questions related to FlareDrops. Please feel free to help others who are looking for help publicly on this discussion thread. **Do not reply to private messages from users offering help, as these messages are highly likely attempts to scam you.**

# What are FlareDrops?

* FlareDrops are a series of 36 airdrops of the Flare Network's native token, Flare ($FLR). Airdrops occur every 30 days to eligible participants and will total 24.2 billion $FLR.

# FlareDrops Eligibility

* To be eligible to claim a portion of that month's FlareDrop, a wallet must have held Wrapped FLR (WFLR) for the 23 days before each claim day. These 23 days constitute the ""Holdings calculation period.""
* Three random blocks are chosen during those 23 days to calculate the average holdings of all wallets. The [technical documentation](https://docs.flare.network/tech/the-flaredrop/) provides more detail on this process.
* Your allocation of FlareDrop tokens will be proportional to its relative share of all WFLR in circulation.
* The number of FlareDrop tokens that a wallet can claim in any month is based on its relative share of all WFLR in circulation.
* No Flare-related entity, employee, or founder may use their token allocation to claim a portion of the FlareDrops.
* Any FLR stake which has been delegated to validators on the P-Chain is also eligible for FlareDrops. FlareDrop allocations each month are now based on the combined total of WFLR held and FLR staked on the P-Chain during the three random blocks.

# Claiming FlareDrops

* FlareDrops can be claimed using the [Flare Portal](https://portal.flare.network/) by connecting a wallet that held WFLR during the Holdings calculation period.
* [Bifrost Wallet](https://bifrostwallet.com/) offers native functionality for claiming FlareDrops, which is similar to the existing functionality for claiming FTSO Delegation Rewards.
* There is also the option to [set up autoclaiming](https://flare.network/autoclaiming-available-on-flare/), which will ensure FlareDrop tokens are automatically and immediately claimed in return for a fee. This will maximize compounding, save time, and avoid unnecessary exposure of a cold wallet.
* Advanced users can also claim by interacting directly with the smart contracts.
* Unclaimed airdrop tokens will be burned 67 days after each distribution, 90 days from the start of the holdings calculation period.
* Read: [Claiming the FlareDrop](https://docs.flare.network/user/claiming-the-flaredrop/)

Welcome to the megalist of all known online money making opportunities, also known as beermoney! It will contain various options for earning money in your spare time, such as mobile applications, ""Get-Paid-To"" websites, passive methods, cryptocurrency platforms, and much more. These where were tried out in Europe but should work worldwide. It is highly recommended to combine various websites in order to maximize earnings. Be aware that most of these websites require verified **PayPal** in order to process withdrawals, so make sure you have that sorted out.

One thing I should mention here right away is that **these will not really replace a real job**. Please use these methods platforms to supplement your already existing income instead.

We have launched a dedicated beermoney blog, [BeermoneyGuides](https://beermoneyguides.com/)! It will feature more in-depth guides and reviews for beermoney methodsthat are being featured in this thread.

**Get-Paid-To (GPT)** 

As the title suggests, ""Get-Paid-To"" websites pay you to do certain tasks. Now there might not be too many surveys available that work, but offers can be well worth doing in my opinion. Take some time to browse around to see what is available (for example, mobile game offers) and compare different rates between different GPT websites.

But they are so hard to deploy fast, especially in battle. So I propose the Ministry of Science builds a hand cannon, in which one pre-armed stratagem can be placed as ammo (reloaded while stratagem is armed, press R while holding the weapon as active). Maximum range of about 70 meters, can load any stratagem, but only one, fire time of 0.5 seconds as balancing (if you die while firing, it will still go off as a delayed action trigger, like a revolver), and a reload/fill speed of 3 seconds (max three shots before fuel for firing runs out), along with it being a support. Have one teammate carry it while the others hold enemies off with other supports. Or maybe have it be a pistol in a new warbond, and have 2 shots instead of 3. Maybe up firing time. Think of the Helldivers it would save, having a quick reinforce or guard dog. Any other suggestions/changes to this welcome!"

Should I still be on PPI? ,GERD,1fj8i47,2024-09-17 15:34:10,2,1.0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1fj8i47/should_i_still_be_on_ppi/,steekyreeky,💊 Advice on Prescription Meds,"4 cm hiatal hernia. Been in lansoprazole flr a year now 30 mg in the morning. 

I still get flare ups. I still can’t really eat anything good. If the PPIS are so bad for me and j still have symptoms should I just say the hell with the PPIS try a h2 blocker and diet? 

The only thing that helps is when I eat bland. It pretty much goes away completely until I fuck up again and eat something. 

Should just stay in the PPI and take a multivitamin. I’m getting frustrated. My GI just says stay on the PPI until month with no symptoms then 1 pill for a week then stop. But I can never reach that point.

Any advice here? 

Thank you. "

I’ve been around since Flare Finance > FLR Finance > Enosys. I haven’t heard much about the team lately.

I was wondering how many developers are there for Enosys?
How many people does the team consist of total?
What are the current projects underway?

I support Enosys, but I’d like to have more information to support my belief rather than just hoping things are all fine and dandy when I could simply just come to the subreddit and ask.

How Western left-of-center public perception of the Israel-Palestine conflict became so anti-Israel,IsraelPalestine,1f49sx5,2024-08-29 14:31:14,110,0.79,570,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1f49sx5/how_western_leftofcenter_public_perception_of_the/,stockywocket,Discussion,"I, like a lot of people, have wondered at how suddenly it has become a dominant position in certain circles to be extremely anti-Israel. Twenty-five years ago, almost no one I knew in the West had any real opinion on Israel or the conflict unless they had a personal connection to it. Now, the vast majority of my acquaintance express strong anti-Israel sentiment (up to and including that Israel is a fundamentally evil entity and should be “disbanded”) and default to believing dubious claims about the conflict without any apparent awareness of their dubiousness. How did we get to the point where the default position in left-of-center circles is largely anti-Israel? Here are my thoughts. I would love to hear what people agree or disagree with, and what other developments people think should be included.

**My Arbitrary Starting Point**

Prior to Sep. 11, 2001, the Israel-Palestine conflict was a thing that was in the news, but unless you had some personal connection to it, hardly anyone in the western public knew anything about it other than that it was a conflict in the Middle East and occasionally there were flare-ups and people died, and that peace deals kept being attempted and failing. I’m going to take this as my starting point, and identify the following as major subsequent developments.

**2001: 9/11**

Then 9/11 happened. In the aftermath, there was overzealousness in the “war on terror” and there was rising Islamophobia in the US, including [attacks on Arabs and Muslims](https://abcnews.go.com/US/20-years-911-islamophobia-continues-haunt-muslims/story?id=79732049), and unjustified racial profiling by Western police forces. This moved Muslims in the West into the status of a victimized class that needed progressives to [stand up for them](https://www.cfr.org/article/us-muslims-and-turbulent-post-911-world). It also led to the belief that most concerns about Islamic terrorism are invented or overblown (thanks to Bush II and Blair especially for that), and that [even discussing Islamic terrorism was suspect ](https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5437&context=flr)as [relying on racist stereotypes](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/moving-target-is-homeland-still-racist/). And it led to a view of the US and the West generally as terrorizers of innocent muslims and middle-easterners. It had the effect of making being concerned about islamic terrorism basically a right-wing/conservative/anti-progressive value.

**2016: Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders**

For many of us who travel in left-leaning circles, there was a sudden moment where the number of people we knew who identified as socialists or Marxists or various permutations of similar political identities [jumped](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/29/why-are-there-suddenly-millions-of-socialists-in-america) from maybe a handful to an actual majority of our acquaintance. It was [recognizably a trend/bandwagon](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/03/socialism-and-young-socialists.html), rather than people individually just happening to evolve toward that politics. Capitalism became a dirty word. “Oppressor” became a part of ordinary people’s vocabulary. Imperialist and neocon became common insults to anyone insufficiently critical of the military in general and Western influence in the larger world. Discussion of the harms of colonialism and “Western imperialism” led to a surface understanding in the less educated that more Western generally means more ‘bad.’ Wealth makes you most likely a bad person and an oppressor, poverty makes you generally virtuous and oppressed. Marxism also has a complicated relationship and history with both anti-zionism and antisemitism.

**2018: TikTok and the YouTube algorithm**

TikTok and other social media developments fundamentally changed the way people, especially younger people, receive news and information. Ideas that can be conveyed simply and quickly carry the day. Understandings that require a lot of reading and context get sidelined. The TikTok and YouTube (and other social media) [algorithms](https://podcastreview.org/review/rabbit-hole/) are feeding people certain types of stories, leading to increased polarization and one-sided understandings of issues. The resulting increased marginalization of newspapers and professional news organizations means brief, contextless video clips and talking heads with no qualifications or professional obligations of accuracy become the main source of news and information for many people.

**2020: Black Lives Matter (BLM)**

BLM turned everyone left of center into an activist. Celebrities and even ordinary people we knew were blasted for not speaking up—[silence was complicity](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-silence-on-social-media-why-not-saying-anything-is-actually-saying-a-lot/). Not being informed or politically active was not accepted as an excuse. If you’re not speaking up against it, you’re part of the problem. [If you ""have power,"" you have an obligation to use it](https://icma.org/articles/pm-magazine/silence-complicity-can-white-america-demonstrate-black-lives-matter). There are good guys and bad guys. If you want to be considered one of the good guys, you can’t be complacent. This movement also of course led to a view of police, and eventually the military too, as fundamentally bad guys. This time period also saw a rise in [young people](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220803-gen-z-how-young-people-are-changing-activism) expressing an interest in being professional activists when they grow up, entering university programs majoring in anti-oppression and social justice, etc., creating a pool of activists in search of a cause.

**2020: COVID and lockdowns**

COVID lockdowns led to increased isolation, increased terminally online-ness, and an increase in people seeking community and forms of participation online. [People got even more of their information through online networks, and people's consumption of news and information skyrocketed](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/07/technology/coronavirus-internet-use.html).

**2021: Mainstreaming of Critical Race Theory (CRT)**

The BLM movement also mainstreamed [critical race theory](https://www.britannica.com/topic/critical-race-theory). CRT became an important topic as people tried to understand the sometimes subtle effects of racism in modern society. Suddenly everyone was talking about it—but mostly getting it totally wrong. What people came away from it with was a belief that power structures are everything, or at least by far the most important thing. A default assumption developed that by identifying the more powerful party in a relationship or interaction, you could also identify who was in the wrong. A more powerful party is a default abuser of power. A less powerful party is by default a victim, not at fault. An example of this is that racism itself came to be redefined by many as “prejudice + power,” such that it is literally impossible for, say, a Black person to be racist, because as a group they “don’t have the power” to be so (yes—for such individuals a Black person attacking an Asian person and spewing racist epithets at them is no longer an example of racism). (There is a subtle distinction between prejudice and racism that can render this definition less ridiculous sounding, but, because this is the general public we are talking about, that distinction gets lost). The [political right seized on this development as a culture war tool](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-inquiry/how-a-conservative-activist-invented-the-conflict-over-critical-race-theory&ved=2ahUKEwjD5qmm5pqIAxWPhYkEHfjrICcQFnoECBwQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3xfGXy5HG1UH3pxofghHKN), increasing its spread and its polarization power.

**2021: Sheikh Jarrah evictions**

A [very successful online campaign](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/middle-east/how-east-jerusalem-flashpoint-sheikh-jarrah-got-its-own-hashtag-idUSKCN2CY17W/) brought the [Sheikh Jarrah evictions](https://mondoweiss.net/2021/04/it-is-a-nakba-campaign-to-save-sheikh-jarrah-builds-momentum-as-forced-displacement-looms/?utm_source=mailpoet&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=mondoweiss-wire-submissions) to mainstream attention, while doing little to provide the complicated context around them. For people primed to see a villain and a victim, and getting their news from social media video clips, this is what they saw. This brought the view of Israel as a colonial project that is literally kicking indigenous people out of their homes into the mainstream. 

**Ongoing: NGO and IGO increased bias**

I wrote [a post about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/182urc7/ngohuman_rights_groups_and_apparent_bias/) a few months ago. [Human Rights Watch](https://www.timesofisrael.com/outgoing-human-rights-watch-senior-editor-blasts-groups-infected-work-on-israel/) and [Amnesty International](https://www.thetimes.com/article/amnesty-directors-links-to-global-network-of-islamists-m0wggtnzcgc) are the worst offenders. Both these organizations have a wide reach and strong reputation as defenders of human rights. Unfortunately over the years they have both become recognizably anti-Israel, devoting far more time to discussions of Israel's wrongdoing than the many much worse HR offenders in the world, such as North Korea or Iran. The UN bodies whose positions are taken based on politics and bloc/coalition votes also lend an air of legitimacy to what are fundamentally political statements, and their [bias](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/FA/FA06/20230622/116138/HHRG-118-FA06-Wstate-NeuerH-20230622.pdf) is also [apparent](https://www.timesofisrael.com/un-condemned-israel-more-than-all-other-countries-combined-in-2022-monitor/).

**Lead-up to 10/7**

So now we have the following dichotomy in place:

Israel:

* Western in nature and culture
* Partner of the US and the West in imperialist and neoconservative aims in the region
* Supposedly white (at least relatively)
* Powerful
* Wealthy
* Military/police state
* Colonial/non-indigenous

 Palestine:

* non-Western in nature and culture
* Muslim/protected victim class
* POC
* Victim of imperialism
* Impoverished
* Less powerful
* Indigenous

And with this dichotomy, we have a group of people primed to fall into simplistic good guy/bad guy views of the world, both by nuance-flattening superficial CRT understandings and TikTok/YouTube information patterns, and a generation of people who have committed themselves to social justice looking for a cause they can stand up for. So what do they conclude? Israel is an oppressor that must be stood up against. Palestine is a victim that must be stood up for. Whatever else there might be to it is secondary, and being wishy-washy about what’s right and wrong here is just a way of allowing the wrong to persist. Any ways in which Israel is a victim can be ignored, because they are more powerful (and anyway, Islamic terrorism is barely a real thing anyway and talking about probably means you are racist). Any ways in which Palestine might be at fault or responsible must be excused or explainable, because they are oppressed. 

For people who now are culturally required to take a position on social issues like these, but do not have a deep education (or a willingness to get one) on these issues, a simple narrative easily carries the day. It is clear which position you should hold if you want to be viewed as standing up for the right things. Taking a position like “it’s complicated” makes you at best suspect, and at worst complicit. Antisemitism, that age-old thumb on the scale, makes it even easier for people to place a nation of Jews into the villain category and to believe the worst claims about them no matter how thin the evidence.

**10/7**

This was an interesting moment/litmus test for the left. Would they be able to maintain their simplistic support for Palestinians and condemnation of Israel in the face of such an attack? The answer was yes. Some [immediately praised the attack](https://www.adl.org/resources/blog/anti-israel-activists-celebrate-hamas-attacks-have-killed-hundreds-israelis) as an example of anti-colonial resistance. Others excused it as at least understandable. Some remained silent about it (‘silence is complicity’ apparently didn’t apply in this direction) until Israel responded, at which point they felt free to now simply focus on Israel’s response and basically forget all about 10/7 or the risk of another 10/7.

**Today**

And that brings us to today. The fact that this is likely the most complex and intractable conflict in  existence, if not in history, has been lost. People think it is simple. When you point out that this is an entire field of study, with countless doctoral theses written about its complexities, you just get blank looks in response. People really do think this is easy, and that tells you definitively how little they actually know."

Did I do this correctly? I am getting a biweekly income of approximately $11 twice a week delegating my Flare tokens. In addition I get approximately $500 in one single monthly airdrop. This is all calculated at today’s FLR token price. 

These figures come out to a 43% return on investment per year. That is not too shabby if I did that correctly and this is after the significant cut in rewards just a few months ago. 

Exactly what is Flare outlook, as the price has dropped significantly in last year along most other crypto. Is there anything to look out for as a holder here?

But here is the Resxia(placeholder name though if you get why it's named that you get a cookie)
Anyway I'm bad at map making so I had used cartographer to make this region. And well cartographer was abandoned by its maker though if there is someone in this subreddit who also wants to take up and update/ improve it so that it can do more than it currently can I will gladly beta test it.

Now flr yhe part that I need help with.
You see Resxia is my third fan made regions and my second cartographer region.

But while the first two are extremely difficult for a apprentice level user of rpgmaker to build this one really shouldn't be.

If it weren't for what this game is.
Resxia is the region of my pokemon Project alsytr orange.
Or it would be better known by the name it will have when the game is completed.

So you want to lead an evil team?

Yes this game is based on this gym of mine but with the twist that the game is a whole region to play with as normal with starters and regional variants regional evos and convergent evos.

But you the player are the boss of a evil team that you make just like how you choose what type to specialize in in this gym of mine. And what your gym trainers are and things like that.

Of course one of your two rivals is in fact the player character if you were to play this game as a normal pokemon game and as such due to how this works I might have to code in a way to let you choose what they start with.

But for now I just need help with a few things 
Character customization -ie just changing into different outfits
The whole type thing like how this gym of mine does it's type thing
And well a way to make it so you can plan out big evil team stuff like other regions evil teams do but a bit more customization so that each playthrough is different.

The monthly FlareDrop is now available to claim for eligible participants!

Use this thread to discuss and ask questions related to FlareDrops. Please feel free to help others who are looking for help publicly on this discussion thread. **Do not reply to private messages from users offering help, as these messages are highly likely attempts to scam you.**

# What are FlareDrops?

* FlareDrops are a series of 36 airdrops of the Flare Network's native token, Flare ($FLR). Airdrops occur every 30 days to eligible participants and will total 24.2 billion $FLR.

# FlareDrops Eligibility

* To be eligible to claim a portion of that month's FlareDrop, a wallet must have held Wrapped FLR (WFLR) for the 23 days before each claim day. These 23 days constitute the ""Holdings calculation period.""
* Three random blocks are chosen during those 23 days to calculate the average holdings of all wallets. The [technical documentation](https://docs.flare.network/tech/the-flaredrop/) provides more detail on this process.
* Your allocation of FlareDrop tokens will be proportional to its relative share of all WFLR in circulation.
* The number of FlareDrop tokens that a wallet can claim in any month is based on its relative share of all WFLR in circulation.
* No Flare-related entity, employee, or founder may use their token allocation to claim a portion of the FlareDrops.
* Any FLR stake which has been delegated to validators on the P-Chain is also eligible for FlareDrops. FlareDrop allocations each month are now based on the combined total of WFLR held and FLR staked on the P-Chain during the three random blocks.

# Claiming FlareDrops

* FlareDrops can be claimed using the [Flare Portal](https://portal.flare.network/) by connecting a wallet that held WFLR during the Holdings calculation period.
* [Bifrost Wallet](https://bifrostwallet.com/) offers native functionality for claiming FlareDrops, which is similar to the existing functionality for claiming FTSO Delegation Rewards.
* There is also the option to [set up autoclaiming](https://flare.network/autoclaiming-available-on-flare/), which will ensure FlareDrop tokens are automatically and immediately claimed in return for a fee. This will maximize compounding, save time, and avoid unnecessary exposure of a cold wallet.
* Advanced users can also claim by interacting directly with the smart contracts.
* Unclaimed airdrop tokens will be burned 67 days after each distribution, 90 days from the start of the holdings calculation period.

**Get-Paid-To (GPT)** 

As the title suggests, ""Get-Paid-To"" websites pay you to do certain tasks. Now there might not be too many surveys available that work, but offers can be well worth doing in my opinion.

Flare X is a Flare Network game where we mine FX coins.

Coins (FX) are in-game rewards that can later be exchanged for something really cool.

The game launched on June 20 .

In the future, the Flare Network token FLR/USDT traded on Bybit will be added to the game.

What to do in the game?
🔹 We go in every 3 hours and collect coins.
🔹 We do tasks to discover new planets.

To increase the level of the planet, you need to complete tasks of the current level and pay a fee in coins.

After increasing the level of each planet to 6th, you can open the next one. All planets mine FX at the same time.

There are rumors that this project will undergo rapid development and partnerships with large projects.

I don’t know if this is true yet, but in 1 day the project has already gained more than 20,000 subscribers on the telegram channel and even more in the game.

➡️ You can enter the project using this link➡️https://t.me/flarexgamebot?start=667a8fa67679f0d8835a6301"

All Coinbase needs to do is add a recovery tool like they already have for other tokens. They don’t need to list another token. There would be no demand for it on their platform.

* Three random blocks are chosen during those 23 days to calculate the average holdings of all wallets. The [technical documentation](https://docs.flare.network/tech/the-flaredrop/) provides more detail on this process.
* Your allocation of FlareDrop tokens will be proportional to its relative share of all WFLR in circulation.
* The number of FlareDrop tokens that a wallet can claim in any month is based on its relative share of all WFLR in circulation.
* No Flare-related entity, employee, or founder may use their token allocation to claim a portion of the FlareDrops.
* Any FLR stake which has been delegated to validators on the P-Chain is also eligible for FlareDrops. FlareDrop allocations each month are now based on the combined total of WFLR held and FLR staked on the P-Chain during the three random blocks.

# Claiming FlareDrops

* FlareDrops can be claimed using the [Flare Portal](https://portal.flare.network/) by connecting a wallet that held WFLR during the Holdings calculation period.
* [Bifrost Wallet](https://bifrostwallet.com/) offers native functionality for claiming FlareDrops, which is similar to the existing functionality for claiming FTSO Delegation Rewards.
* There is also the option to [set up autoclaiming](https://flare.network/autoclaiming-available-on-flare/), which will ensure FlareDrop tokens are automatically and immediately claimed in return for a fee. This will maximize compounding, save time, and avoid unnecessary exposure of a cold wallet.
* Advanced users can also claim by interacting directly with the smart contracts.
* Unclaimed airdrop tokens will be burned 67 days after each distribution, 90 days from the start of the holdings calculation period.
* Read: [Claiming the FlareDrop](https://docs.flare.network/user/claiming-the-flaredrop/)

**Get-Paid-To (GPT)** 

As the title suggests, ""Get-Paid-To"" websites pay you to do certain tasks. Now there might not be too many surveys available that work, but offers can be well worth doing in my opinion.

Telling my mom (75) I'm poly this weekend... any advice?,polyamory,1csmpm1,2024-05-15 10:50:45,0,0.4,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1csmpm1/telling_my_mom_75_im_poly_this_weekend_any_advice/,OpportunityOdd4399,Advice,"First-time poster, but I've been learning a lot from this community and hope to learn more.

I (42F) have been with my husband (48M) 22 years, married 17. Our partnership is rock-solid, loving, good sex, great communication, with a kid. Over the past three years, we've been doing some sexual exploring that has led us to a co-create a mono-poly FLR partnership that roots in his deep love of loyalty and suffering and my deep love of novelty and excitement. What started as just hookups has evolved into me having my husband as anchor, two other slow-growing (parallel) partnerships, and occasional hookups. We've gotten increasingly open with friends about this, and I've told my sister (she's poly and is a great friend in this), but not yet our parents nor our kid.

The obvious first parent to tell is my mom. My sister and I grew up with our single mom, and over the past four years, we've been caregiving for her as she works through a serious illness. We're super-close, talk daily, and I spend about a week a month living with and helping her. She's healthy and stable right now, but it can flare up anytime.

My mom HATES lying (she was cheated on a few times and it was awful for her), and I don't want to lie to her. For the first two years, when I was just hooking up, I rationalized not telling her bc it would stress her out, it was just sex, and who knows if I would continue exploring in this way. But now I'm starting to  identify as poly, and I have these deepening new relationships, and I hate not sharing this big part of my life with her. It also feels super-awkward (and a bit unsafe) for me to sometimes go hookup with someone when I'm staying with her and lie about what I'm doing.

This weekend, when we're together (w my sister too), I want to tell her. My mom knows her daughters do all kinds of things she wouldn't do, so I'm not super-worried about some aspects of this, but I do think she'll be very concerned about what this ""means"" for my marriage, for the stability of my home and parenting, etc. I often find that the mono-poly part is even more confusing for people than the poly part--people just don't believe that my husband is loving this as much as I am.

Any tips from your experience in how you've framed this conversation with someone you love who really cares about you, maybe worries about you, and has some past trauma around cheating and marriage?"
FlareDrops Are Now Available to Claim - Airdrop Information & Discussion Thread (May 10 2024),FlareNetworks,1covukq,2024-05-10 14:01:18,9,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlareNetworks/comments/1covukq/flaredrops_are_now_available_to_claim_airdrop/,AutoModerator,,"# FlareDrops Are Now Available to Claim - Airdrop Information & Discussion Thread

The monthly FlareDrop is now available to claim for eligible participants!

Use this thread to discuss and ask questions related to FlareDrops. Please feel free to help others who are looking for help publicly on this discussion thread. **Do not reply to private messages from users offering help, as these messages are highly likely attempts to scam you.**

# What are FlareDrops?

* FlareDrops are a series of 36 airdrops of the Flare Network's native token, Flare ($FLR). Airdrops occur every 30 days to eligible participants and will total 24.2 billion $FLR.

# FlareDrops Eligibility

* To be eligible to claim a portion of that month's FlareDrop, a wallet must have held Wrapped FLR (WFLR) for the 23 days before each claim day. These 23 days constitute the ""Holdings calculation period.""
* Three random blocks are chosen during those 23 days to calculate the average holdings of all wallets. The [technical documentation](https://docs.flare.network/tech/the-flaredrop/) provides more detail on this process.
* Your allocation of FlareDrop tokens will be proportional to its relative share of all WFLR in circulation.
* The number of FlareDrop tokens that a wallet can claim in any month is based on its relative share of all WFLR in circulation.
* No Flare-related entity, employee, or founder may use their token allocation to claim a portion of the FlareDrops.
* Any FLR stake which has been delegated to validators on the P-Chain is also eligible for FlareDrops. FlareDrop allocations each month are now based on the combined total of WFLR held and FLR staked on the P-Chain during the three random blocks.

# Claiming FlareDrops

* FlareDrops can be claimed using the [Flare Portal](https://portal.flare.network/) by connecting a wallet that held WFLR during the Holdings calculation period.
* [Bifrost Wallet](https://bifrostwallet.com/) offers native functionality for claiming FlareDrops, which is similar to the existing functionality for claiming FTSO Delegation Rewards.
* There is also the option to [set up autoclaiming](https://flare.network/autoclaiming-available-on-flare/), which will ensure FlareDrop tokens are automatically and immediately claimed in return for a fee. This will maximize compounding, save time, and avoid unnecessary exposure of a cold wallet.
* Advanced users can also claim by interacting directly with the smart contracts.
* Unclaimed airdrop tokens will be burned 67 days after each distribution, 90 days from the start of the holdings calculation period.

Look at the profit USDT makes each year with 100 staff compared to JPM and you have to wonder why those big guys don't take the opportunity with both hands? 

In case there is nobody ready to do the job, is there a way for #FlrHolders and small investors to set up an entity to issue such a stable coin?  "

The monthly FlareDrop is now available to claim for eligible participants!

Use this thread to discuss and ask questions related to FlareDrops. Please feel free to help others who are looking for help publicly on this discussion thread. **Do not reply to private messages from users offering help, as these messages are highly likely attempts to scam you.**

# What are FlareDrops?

* FlareDrops are a series of 36 airdrops of the Flare Network's native token, Flare ($FLR). Airdrops occur every 30 days to eligible participants and will total 24.2 billion $FLR.

# FlareDrops Eligibility

* To be eligible to claim a portion of that month's FlareDrop, a wallet must have held Wrapped FLR (WFLR) for the 23 days before each claim day. These 23 days constitute the ""Holdings calculation period.""
* Three random blocks are chosen during those 23 days to calculate the average holdings of all wallets. The [technical documentation](https://docs.flare.network/tech/the-flaredrop/) provides more detail on this process.
* Your allocation of FlareDrop tokens will be proportional to its relative share of all WFLR in circulation.
* The number of FlareDrop tokens that a wallet can claim in any month is based on its relative share of all WFLR in circulation.
* No Flare-related entity, employee, or founder may use their token allocation to claim a portion of the FlareDrops.
* Any FLR stake which has been delegated to validators on the P-Chain is also eligible for FlareDrops. FlareDrop allocations each month are now based on the combined total of WFLR held and FLR staked on the P-Chain during the three random blocks.

# Claiming FlareDrops

* FlareDrops can be claimed using the [Flare Portal](https://portal.flare.network/) by connecting a wallet that held WFLR during the Holdings calculation period.
* [Bifrost Wallet](https://bifrostwallet.com/) offers native functionality for claiming FlareDrops, which is similar to the existing functionality for claiming FTSO Delegation Rewards.
* There is also the option to [set up autoclaiming](https://flare.network/autoclaiming-available-on-flare/), which will ensure FlareDrop tokens are automatically and immediately claimed in return for a fee. This will maximize compounding, save time, and avoid unnecessary exposure of a cold wallet.
* Advanced users can also claim by interacting directly with the smart contracts.
* Unclaimed airdrop tokens will be burned 67 days after each distribution, 90 days from the start of the holdings calculation period.

"Coming up on a golden cross, 4h chart",FlareNetworks,1bw9odr,2024-04-05 00:59:55,16,0.84,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlareNetworks/comments/1bw9odr/coming_up_on_a_golden_cross_4h_chart/,BigSchool,:Speculation-Post: Speculation,"\*\*\* Update 041324 \*\*\*

FLR currently in bearish pattern on 1D chart. Next support level around .02746 however if this breaks with confirmation to the downside (2 to 3 days of price below this level) we could see retracement lower. 

&#x200B;

[FLRUSD 041324 update](https://preview.redd.it/9r6mofe74auc1.png?width=2818&format=png&auto=webp&s=39fee1b27935519ed499ad350d93eaa5a7099eb4)

&#x200B;

\*\*\* Update 040624 \*\*\*

If you got in sub .04 congrats but watch your longs, candles on the 1d chart have been having longer wicks than I'm comfortable with. Candles with long wicks could indicate a reversal/lack of conviction, need to see more bullish support (longer bodies) on these one day candles if we're going to retest/break through the recent high of .056. A retracement to the fibonnaci .5 (.032) .618 (.02645) is still possible. If we continue to the upside, resistance levels at recent high of .056 and the trend based fib extension drawn from the mid Oct 2023 low to the recent high at .056 of .05763 (.618 extension) levels could provide the first area of resistance. After would be the (1) extension at .07589, then the 1.618 at .10544. What makes trying to find upper resistance on FLR tricky is there being no real consensus of where the ATH is. If one looks at the FLR/Tether pair on Bitrue you'll see an ATH at $2.25 on May 1, 2021, this was before the FLR network was live so using this as an actual ATH doesn't seem like an accurate assessment. On July 14, 2022, the network started centralized, with only 21 validators, run by the Flare Foundation. To be fair going forward I'll calculate my analysis of FLR based on dates after the network was live and will use the FLR/USD pair (Coinbase), FLR/USD pairs could be a better gauge of present interest or lack thereof.

The following are ATH levels for FLR/USD pairs and their respective exchanges:

Kraken: 0.15 and sold down to .02210 on the first day the pair was available on Jan 10, 2023

Bitfinex: .08 and sold down to .00000100 on the first day the pair was available on Jan 10, 2023

Coinbase: First available data of trading on Coinbase is April 14, 2023. That day saw the price high of .03620 and a day low of .03400

&#x200B;

\*\*\* Update 040524 with support levels, see below original post. Please take this information with a grain of salt and do your own research prior to investing/speculating. This is for entertainment/speculation purposes. I'm wrong alot!!! \*\*\*

&#x200B;

\*\*\* Please do not use this solely to make financial decisions, I'm wrong often. Please do your own research before investing. This is for entertainment/speculative purposes only \*\*\*Very close to golden cross on 4h chart. Golden cross is when the 50 moving average (yellow line) crosses the 200 (red line). When it crosses from underneath going upward it could indicate a bullish move after the crossing. The inverse happens when the 50 moving average crosses below the 200 (see example of the red arrow for death cross). The longer the time frame the stronger the move, see below 4h chart for the 1D chart example. Why I take note of the 4h chart is because it could mean a shorter term (next 2 - 3 weeks) of bullish momentum. It's not foolproof and the price could defy it but a golden/death cross is something I like to watch out for along with other indicators.

"Mar 31, 2024 FLR USD Price Analysis",FlareNetworks,1bsk5id,2024-03-31 16:33:40,35,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlareNetworks/comments/1bsk5id/mar_31_2024_flr_usd_price_analysis/,BigSchool,:Speculation-Post: Speculation,"\*\*\* Update \*\*\*

Apr 2, 2024: Today saw the price pullback to a low of .03381, coming just under .00019 of the .034 price I mentioned as a possible buy on Mar 31st! If you had bought @ .034 you'd be in the money. I would not buy again if the price retraced to the .034 level another time, in fact I'd have a stop just above in case the price retraces again. I would now consider my analysis from Mar 31, 2024 now invalid, to be clear the .034 is no longer a level I would buy at because the price has already retraced to that level and has rallied. I would consider another retrace to the .034 as a potential for further downside.

The following was written Mar 31, 2024

First the disclaimers and caveats, I’m wrong often and technical analysis can also be wrong even when done correctly, it’s not meant to be a crystal ball, there’s a reason successful traders use stop loss orders. The purpose of technical analysis is to provide an edge and to put those who use it in an advantageous position. Please don’t use this analysis solely to base any financial decisions, do your own research and analysis. This is for entertainment/speculative purposes, be careful and don’t invest more than you can lose! Lastly, I'm just a hobbyist with technical analysis, I'm far from an expert. That said here we go.

Why am I doing this? Because it’s fun and I like FLR. I think it has great potential to offer truly useful and unique capabilities within the crypto space, still it also has yet to prove itself so it is speculative. I’ve seen many bright shining hopeful projects in crypto fall and become nothing over the years, FLR could do the same.

From a technical standpoint today has seen the price surge and is currently correcting. We are above the moving averages on the 1d chart and the direction seems bullish, at least for the moment. My ideas are based on a 1d chart and won’t be valid for shorter term day trades, I don’t have an exact time frame for the validity of my ideas but I’d estimate somewhere between 4 to 8 weeks.

Looking at the price action in terms of resistance areas or possible areas to take profits. The first is the .056 (ATH, all time high)/0.618 (.05763) zone, both of these areas are close enough for me to consider this area as a confluence level. Confluence is when two or more indicators come together at a certain price reinforcing conviction that the level in question is valid. Keep in mind confluence works both for bullish and bearish ideas. The more indicators that align at certain levels the stronger the confluence. If the 0.618 (.05763) level was exactly at the .056 ATH level I’d like that better but they seem pretty close as an area of interest. The next level would be the .07589 level, followed by the 1.618 level at .10544. To be clear these are areas that I think the price could reach and then pullback from. It’s very possible that after pulling back from these areas the price could retest and go even higher after some time has passed.

Looking at the price action in terms of support areas or areas to possibly go long. I like .34 and .0259. If I had $100 to invest/speculate I might like to do something like go 1/3 ($33) at .34 and then the other 2/3’s ($66) at .0259. It’s possible that price won’t retrace to those levels and just continue on an uptrend however those are levels I’d be comfortable adding to my position at.

The monthly FlareDrop is now available to claim for eligible participants!

# What are FlareDrops?

* FlareDrops are a series of 36 airdrops of the Flare Network's native token, Flare ($FLR). Airdrops occur every 30 days to eligible participants and will total 24.2 billion $FLR.

# FlareDrops Eligibility

* To be eligible to claim a portion of that month's FlareDrop, a wallet must have held Wrapped FLR (WFLR) for the 23 days before each claim day. These 23 days constitute the ""Holdings calculation period.""
* Three random blocks are chosen during those 23 days to calculate the average holdings of all wallets. The [technical documentation](https://docs.flare.network/tech/the-flaredrop/) provides more detail on this process.
* Your allocation of FlareDrop tokens will be proportional to its relative share of all WFLR in circulation.
* The number of FlareDrop tokens that a wallet can claim in any month is based on its relative share of all WFLR in circulation.
* No Flare-related entity, employee, or founder may use their token allocation to claim a portion of the FlareDrops.
* Any FLR stake which has been delegated to validators on the P-Chain is also eligible for FlareDrops. FlareDrop allocations each month are now based on the combined total of WFLR held and FLR staked on the P-Chain during the three random blocks.

# Claiming FlareDrops

* FlareDrops can be claimed using the [Flare Portal](https://portal.flare.network/) by connecting a wallet that held WFLR during the Holdings calculation period.
* [Bifrost Wallet](https://bifrostwallet.com/) offers native functionality for claiming FlareDrops, which is similar to the existing functionality for claiming FTSO Delegation Rewards.
* There is also the option to [set up autoclaiming](https://flare.network/autoclaiming-available-on-flare/), which will ensure FlareDrop tokens are automatically and immediately claimed in return for a fee. This will maximize compounding, save time, and avoid unnecessary exposure of a cold wallet.
* Advanced users can also claim by interacting directly with the smart contracts.
* Unclaimed airdrop tokens will be burned 67 days after each distribution, 90 days from the start of the holdings calculation period.

Claiming Flare Via Ledger Seed Phrase + My Ether Wallet,FlareNetworks,1b5l6d0,2024-03-03 11:28:23,5,0.86,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlareNetworks/comments/1b5l6d0/claiming_flare_via_ledger_seed_phrase_my_ether/,PunkIsBunk,:Question-Post: Question,"I'm wondering if it's possible to use my Ledger seed phrase to access my Flare as mentioned [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FlareNetworks/comments/prawdv/flr_sgb_seed_phrase_via_ledger_claim/) if I originally connected Ledger to MEW to claim.
