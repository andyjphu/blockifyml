Gosto quadrinhos alternativos, filmes asiáticos e músicas melancólicas dos anos 90. Também escuto indie, grunge, hardcore e até mesmo uns death/black metal pesadão. 
Gosto desde conversas profundas e significativas a conversas bobas com piadas de humor duvidoso. Quando me empolgo falo bastante.

Sou um apaixonado por cinema asiático, e quando falo disso, não me refiro apenas ao Japão ou à Coreia do Sul, mas tambem os filmes do Sudeste Asiático."

Im staying with my friends who live near USC, and im just curious what notable things i should be on the lookout for to plan /do.

We have a car and are all able bodied, so walking around is an option for us too.

Id love to go thrifting/shopping a bit in general, probably mostly for clothes, what are the best places that aren’t too far away? I dont have a crazy budget btw.

Id also like to do some typical LA things like take some food and “picnic” on the beach somewhere, ive never been to the pacific ocean so i really want to get that experience. I was thinking id love to go to Malibu but is it accessible at the moment?

I think we are planning on going to knotts berry farm at some point, but if universal or disney is truly better im open to pivoting to those.

Im used to driving in city traffic but i want to avoid it as much as possible on this trip so if you all have any tips regarding that please let me know.

What are the best places to eat in west/central LA area? Id love to do a food crawl/tour one day and i like to plan that type of thing ahead of time.

I think those are all my questions i wanted to address 🤣. I’ve been scouring social media looking at the “viral” LA food places but if there are any that i need to stay away from do let me know!

Please recommend some good tea places as well, like boba, areas to stay away from, good chinese food, Korean food (raw marinated crab?), mens clothing

I don’t really care about super touristy areas like Hollywood that much at all.

Id like to go on a hike maybe? But idk if that is a good idea at the moment yall just lmk!

Thanks! "

Here are all titles I read recently in that vein and my rambling about them. (I found some cozy sci-fi gems as well)

Demon World Boba Shop by R.C Joshua

Thank you kind stranger for recommending this to me in my previous post. It was exactly what I needed to read! 

The MC is hasn’t lived his life fully and is motivated to change it given a second chance in the demon world. Following his self discovery journey and the bonds he built with the characters is chefs kiss and I was sent into deep thought after finishing the series. I hate corporate, what can I do to have a job that gives to the community? Etc

Quarter Share by Nathan Lowell and the rest of the books in the series

I became a fan of this author after picking up the Wizard’s butler and decided to give his other books a shot. I connected with the MC drive to keep progressing his career in fear of nothing to fall back on. Then, the series touched onto a question of what do you do when you achieved your goals and importance of slowing down and the psychological strain of always pushing forward. No sugar coating, real life scenarios and just a guy trying to figure it out.

Monk and Robot by Becky Chambers

I’m currently exploring my gender identify and am working on becoming true to myself. If you are having similar dilemmas, you will love this series. Becky Chambers created a non binary MC skillfully and showed readers a world without prejudice. These books made me consider to not be too hard on myself and that simply existing and pursuing my interests is enough.

(Becky Chambers Long Way Home was a fun read too but it didn’t make it to my formative literature list here)

We are Legion (We are Bob) by Dennis E. Taylor 

A human woke up as an AI in the future. The author explores the meaning of self and what it means to be a human. The story takes readers to explore the galaxy along with the MC figuring out his situation as he goes. I hung onto the massage about the value of normalcy and the need for purpose of our achievements to feel fulfillment.

The Engineer’s Mechanic by L.K Wintur 

Not a formative read to me personally but wanted to give it a shout out. It has a skilled mechanic, robots and a dystopian society, fun read.

The Murderbot Diaries by Martha Wells

Amazing work of art. I really saw myself in the MC and felt like following his journey allowed me to make progress in self discovery. When humans make progress it’s expected and some, like me, struggling feel not good enough. Seeing a robot without any expectations for personal development succeed made me feel like I can do it too.

Thank you for reading. I hope some of these books sound like a good fit and will bring you as much joy as me!

Reason I want to baby wear right now is because as helpful as my husband has been he hasn’t helped with the housework and neither did his parents when they came to visit. I want my parents to enjoy spending time with their grandson just like his parents got but my mom won’t be able to sit still because of how disastrous it is. "

Weequays were a sentient species from the planet Sriluur common throughout the galaxy. They possessed tough, leathery skin resistant to desert environments and blaster fire. Many Weequay were mercenaries, pirates, and bodyguards for the Hutt Clan. Notable Weequays included Hondo Ohnaka, who led the Ohnaka Gang, and the Jedi Sora Bulq.

We met through my older cousin, who hosts weekly game nights primarily for Dungeons and Dragons but occasionally includes other board games. I've been attending these game nights for several weeks and have had the chance to work with him and my 32 M cousin. I've had a crush on him for at least a few months, but my cousin has noticed and is encouraging me to pursue his best friend. 

The guy and I have a lot in common, but I worry that his recent divorce after 20 years of marriage might affect his ability to start a new relationship. I also feel that the age gap could be a concern, and our friendship is still relatively new. However, I tend to overthink things, as I usually do. I invited him to get boba later this week, and he accepted. However, I feel like he may not be aware of my intentions. Throughout the day, we frequently text each other outside the game group and have had heart-to-heart conversations. Some of the conversations were about what we would look for in romantic relationships and our past romantic relationships. Is this okay? We've been friends for 9 or 10 months now. "
Descobri coisas que me decepcionaram.,relacionamentos,1i9py9b,2025-01-25 10:57:07,1,0.67,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relacionamentos/comments/1i9py9b/descobri_coisas_que_me_decepcionaram/,Thebigdoushbag,Desabafo,"Começo o post com a frase: “Que bom que vc me decepcionou a ponto de destruir a visão que eu tinha de vc, porque eu nunca teria conseguido parar de olhar para vc com amor”.

E é exatamente isso. Eu M(26) e meu ex H(28) terminamos o namoro de 5 anos à 3 meses. Ele disse que não sabia se queria algo mais serio e que eu tinha certezas. 

Uma semana depois descubro uma traição. Sempre achei que ele era fiel e a gente sempre conversou muito um com o outro. A confiança importava pra mim. Ele me chamou pra conversar sobre e contar, contou mais uma traição e disse que foi isso, o tempo todo tentando se justificar e dizendo que na época não significou nada.

A boba aqui ainda gostava dele nesse ponto, tinha esperança de um retorno. Até que as coisas desandaram e eu descobri mais e mais e mais coisas. Dezenas de traições, mentiras, falsidade, coisas que nunca imaginei que ele tivesse a capacidade de fazer comigo. Não sei como nunca percebi nada (ou não queria ver). 

Todo o respeito que tinha por ele como pessoa foi para o ralo, pois uma pessoa capaz de fazer tudo o que ele fez e mentir como ele mentiu, por 5 ano, enquanto eu estava presa em um relacionamento que nem sabia não ter futuro, é coisa de gente má, sem coração nem alma, o tipo de gente que dá a facada nas costas.

Mas, como tudo acontece por um motivo, acho que eu precisava disso pra finalizar de vez o ciclo. Agora, me sinto livre, sinto que mereço algo muito melhor e que ele nunca valeu a pena. Estou saindo com alguém, e agora finalmente posso me dar a chance de tentar de novo.

WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU DO THIS TO ME i cannot stop CRYING,BreakUps,1i9ofvu,2025-01-25 09:46:36,4,0.83,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1i9ofvu/why_the_fuck_would_you_do_this_to_me_i_cannot/,ThenContribution1438,,"i (16) F was with with my boyfriend (17) M for a year. it felt so perfect, it was a genuine spiritual connection. we officially started dating last april and i felt like his #1 girl and he loved me unconditionally and i loved him back in that same way. he always reassured me that we’d be forever and i deeply believed that. it felt like he was the male version of me but lately we’ve been getting into small arguments. he was upset that i was constantly venting about my depression and he said it made him overwhelmed so i began to comfort him and apologized to him for burdening him. various small things like that happened for 3 months but we were still amazing. i never developed such a connection with anybody in my life before. it felt like him and i against the world as cheesy as it sounds. i collected so many memories from him such as photobooth pictures from our first date, to my birthday, after our first time. he was my first real relationship and we were eachothers firsts and i still feel such a deep connection to him, he was my best friend and the only person i could be 100% myself around and still feel loved. i could send the ugliest photo of my face and he would still point out everything he genuinely loved about it. the way he talks is so clear and handsome and just everything about him as a person. i lost my dog, a lot of friends, my childhood home, and he was someone who still stuck by my side until yesterday.

for the past week i could tell he seemed a little less interested in me, and when we would text, he took a lot longer to respond. but i just assumed he was busy because when i asked about it, he got defensive and turned it on me, saying i couldnt go an hour without texting him, (when i knew that was unusual of him to do constantly because he doesnt do anything outside of his school but play on his pc). i just assumed that i wasnt that interesting to him and he denied it. when i was spiraling from my depression, i even begged him to not leave me, and he promised he wouldn’t 

yesterday, we went to get boba and it was so fun. he did seem easily irritated by me which threw me off and made me nervous. other than that, he still consistently said i love you and he paid for my drink but it seemed like he was laughing at himself more than he was laughing with me. i was so confused?? i used to feel like the best girl for him and now i felt like a chore. his whole vibe just shifted but he still said he loved me.

when both of us got home, i noticed he wasnt texting me first anymore. i tried to have a conversation with him but he seemed even less interested. i told him i was going to nap and he said “awww sleep well i love you, ttyl!”

super loving right?

FIVE MINUTES LATER HE SENDS THE BREAKUP TEXTS

apparently hes been plotting this since december and he said he had a gut feeling we wouldnt last and he just wasnt happy with me anymore. i was in such shock, he literally just said ttyl and i love you. i was so heartbroken. im even more heartbroken now to have to see him around school and not be his baby or best friend anymore, he didnt even wanna stay friends because it would hurt him. hes going to college this upcoming fall so im never going to see him again. i was so desperate i reached out again and started begging for answers, he was dry but just kept reiterating that he didnt feel happy with me anymore and knew we wouldnt last so he didnt want to lead me on. it hurts so bad. the wound is so fresh. yesterday he was my boyfriend and best friend and now we’re strangers, he deleted all photos of me that we collected over the year, i feel so alone and i feel like i lost the man who loved me the most and saw me at my lowest and highest

but then i think what a fucking asshole from him to dump me AFTER A DATE AND SAYING I LOVE YOU??? HELLO??? i know for a fact hes been thinking it for a while too because even his friend told me. my ex also said that he didnt realize that he was sure in his decision ti break up with me until he acrually did it. MY HEART IS RIPPED IN PIECES. he was my ONLY close friend and now inhave nobody and i literally lost someone who used to care so much about me snd he didnt elaborate why he wasnt happy, he said he just wasnt. i finally sent the goodbye text and it felt so weird and i was devastated and i still cant stop crying. how did you go from loving me so much and talking about my valentines day gift and saying how u were excited for us to move out together a few days before just for you to dump me and never wanting to talk to me again because itll hurt you??

he said he still loves and misses me, he just doesnt feel the same way and happiness that he used to and hes not happy at all and he knows its for the best for the both of us. he made it clear he did not want to get back with me. even his friend told me that theres no way he would

he said he wished things were different and i asked him why? youre literally the one who dumped me, it was your choice for it to be this way? he said “no, you don’t understand.” i connected the dots and asked “you wish you still loved me enough to stay?” and he said “yes”

i am in so much pain and i do not wanna live life with another man, or without him in my life, i dont wanna see him fully move on and lise feelings and forget about me. i wanted us to be together i was so sure that we’d be together wnd move out together and now thats all gone and now i have to see him in the hallways and now our life360 is empty and i had to throw away the stuffed animal he gave me that ive been sleeping with every single night that i grew extreme attachment to for months. now i cant wake up to his texts and he wont send me reels. now i cant see his beautigul face and curved nose and his cute beauty mark and his smile that always melts me. no more loving kisses, no more hugs from him. i cant see his face close up. i never got the chance to give him the love letters i wrote to him

im losing my mind i dont hsve the appetitie ir drive to do anything. i feel so dead and i lost all my will. i was already depressed and he left me at my lowest and i cant believe hes gone. i cant believe we’re not even friends and we’ll eventually fade from eachothers memories . this feels like a nifhtmare i want it to end i fuckingn hate this so much the pain is unbearable. im so alone. he even said we were soulmates a few months ago and wrote paragraphs about how much he loved me. but now we’re nothing. we’re strangers again and with hard feelings"

I’m thinking about the likes of Bib Fortuna, Nien Numb or Wedge Antilles, or even Boba Fett himself, who is, in my memory, only mentioned as “the bounty hunter” in ESB and ROTJ.  I mean, I only knew Max Rebo’s name because when I was a kid I found a sticker in a magazine and put it on my cupboard, otherwise he’d have just been “the blue guy who played that piano-ish thing in Jabba’s palace”. And there’s many, many more. 

Are the name of these characters actually mentioned on screen? And if not, how did we learn their names, especially the in pre-internet and social media era?"

The pictured stash was made after one free roam session 😭 she even fought off a cookie from my poor Bean to add to her collection and raided the stash of another. Even during feeding time, she took the food from my hands and ran out of the cage to hide it 😭 She has mastered the parkour to get up there quickly and I'm impressed. I was thinking of closing off this part of my shelf because they are probably peeing and chewing on my books, sometimes even knocking some smaller ones down which could potentially be dangerous if it falls on another rat. But she just loves this place so much and has made it into her small little nest I don't want to take away from her 🙄 but I have to find a way to salvage my books.

However my boyfriend started boasting about 'chatting to my friend almost every day and how 'she wanted' him. This is his sense of humour so i brushed it off. But then I found out he added her on tiktok and she sent him a few very interesting ones. One of them was basically a guy offering his girlfriend boba tea and she insited that she wanted 'something else'. Another tiktok she sent had the caption 'POV : your overly sensitive girlfriend is watching a movie with you'. The other tiktoks were about your boyfriend gaming. When I told him this isn't OK he told me I was crazy and that my perception of things is very wrong and that these tiktoks aren't suggestive. The other thing is that my girl friend sends me tiktoks like three times a month and she did not send me the videos she sent to my bf. When I confronted her she said that 'If it wasnt OK with me she would stop'. 
So do you think I'm overreacting?"

My parents are moving to Powder Springs and I'm here to ask where the best place is for somebody like me. I'm excited to move from here but I know life will be very different from AK. So I'm anxious as well. 

I'm wondering where is the safest to live for someone like me! Any places/areas that are LGBT friendly and things like that would make me feel comfortable. If it matters at all, I have family in Florida, Indiana and Georgia! I don't talk to them much but we're on very good terms. The drama from the ones in Florida makes me stay away.

Any tips are welcome too this will be me moving out and my first time moving in general. Any help is very much appreciated. Thank you so much! (Also, should I rent a house or an apartment? My range would probably be $1000-$1500 a month. I might live with my brother but he's not the cleanest and I really hate bugs. They terrify me! Any tips on renting?)"

AITAH For buying chestnut milk tea?,AITAH,1i9fpkk,2025-01-25 00:07:49,2,0.75,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i9fpkk/aitah_for_buying_chestnut_milk_tea/,Just-Tangerine3592,,"AITAH For buying chestnut milk tea?

Me (30F) and my girlfriend (29F) have been together for 5 years. She has been struggling with stomach issues since childhood and we recently discovered she’s allergic to a certain sugar in some foods. This means that there are a lot of things she can’t eat like pistachio, mango, gluten, apples, onion, garlic and the list goes on… Nothing serious happens if she eats any of those foods, a stomachache and bloating at worst.

We were driving around town and were talking about this new boba shop that opened nearby and how good their Thai tea and strawberry milk tea was. We decided to get one drink to share tonight. When we arrived there I wanted my gf to go in and order with me because I know she knows her allergens best. I try my best to remember all the food she’s allergic to so I won’t cook food that she can’t eat. My gf wanted to wait for me in the car because she has social anxiety (I do too but I try to accommodate her more). I said fine and asked her if she is okay with whatever I order. She said yes and even a milk tea is fine. I saw that they had chestnut milk tea on their menu and thought that seemed pretty interesting and ordered it. I told my gf what I ordered and she asked why I ordered such a random ass drink? She googled chestnuts and in large amounts they do contain that sugar she is allergic to. She was upset at me for not asking her beforehand. I immediately apologized and said I should have asked her but I wasn’t thinking because I was feeling socially anxious. I offered to buy her her own drink of choice but she refused and argued with me the whole drive home. I kept apologizing and took responsibility for what happened and asked that for future moments where she wants me to order food for her I would like her to remind me of her allergy. That pissed her off more and said I was trying to blame this situation on her. I dropped her off at home and I decided to continue driving around town take some space and cool down.

**1. So here is a quick TLDR about myself:**

* 33 Year old
* Single
* Asian (Indian)
* 5'7"" / 170.18 cm
* Located in Southern California
* Interests tend toward nerdy and artistic hobbies, but I like trying new things and learning the process
* I need to always be doing or trying something new
* No Sense of Smell
* Nonjudgmental; You enjoy what you like, and as long as it doesn't hurt others then it is not my place to make any comments on YOUR preferences.
* I like Diet Coke TOO MUCH
* Not an amazing chef but I can cook well enough (I have an AMAZING croquette recipe I've been working on for years!)
* I'm a die hard Lakers fan, that means that I hate the Celtics and I may not like Lebron but I gotta admit hes a good player

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**2. Hobbies**

* **Skateboarding**, I recently fixed up my cruiser board and getting back into riding around. Nothing fancy, mostly want to just ride around for fun or when I don't want to walk.
* **Badminton:** I love it, I played it all throughout high school and college. I'm not professional, just know the game well enough to casually play. I would love to find myself people who play, either singles or duos are cool with me!
* **Arts and crafts**, grew up doing almost every ceramics class I could in school and electives, drawing and drafting classes and no digital drawings(nothing fancy but I'm more than down to share if you'd like to see), working on random crafts projects(Thinking of trying a gold-leafed motorcycle helmet next).
* **Video Games**, I love and grew up playing games. I could talk about all the games I do play, what I like or dislike about them, and the stories or games I've played. I normally lean towards action games, puzzle games, gotcha games, RPGs, and FPS games with friends online. Right now I'm really into Genshin and I play Marvel Rivals (**I hard pick support roles normally**).
* **Music**: I normally listen to Hip hop, house and most electronic genres outside of trance, funk, rock/pop punk, and some occasional pop. I will share songs I listened to left and right or hear recommendations, I want to grow and share my music collection.
* **Movies**: I like action, comedy, and even horror. I will get scared easily, but I like to get shocked in a movie every once in a while. I also enjoy watching movies and talking through them and making comments, that guy who says something in the theater would probably be me.- My team growing up was the Lakers, I know they're not good right now but I gotta rep em. BUT the Nets had the best retro jerseys and Steve Nash leaving the Suns for the Lakers got robbed of his last year with that injury, he deserved better than what happened there... - I love comics, I don't pick between Marel or DC when it comes to the comics but both have good stories. The cartoons are done better by DC, and Marvel has better overall live-action movies. Arrow was the best DC live-action show, and I really hope the new DC movies will be decent or even watchable. Also, this will probably upset people but here are my two hot comic takes: 1) Batman was the worst part of the Nolan Batman movies, everything else was good but Bale's portrayal of Batman and Bruce was very weak, while everything else there was done really well. 2) Tobey in the same way was not a good Peter or Spiderman when he originally showed up. He plays both as if he's a veteran hero whose had years of experience when he just got his powers, and his jokes were not as good as Garfield's Spiderman. I'm going through my IMDB and adding it to letterboxd currently
* **Anime** I love anime, I grew up watching it and have a passion for it. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**3. Background and Misc info**

*  So I grew up in Southern California, I moved around cities but know a good portion of SoCal itself. Without going into details (can discuss in private), I've lived both by the ocean and inland, all across but I will say that I know tons of good Asian food spots as a result of it. 
*  I loved STEM and arts, I think you need a balance of both so you don't end up a emotionless evil scientist. I did mostly arts in my free time(still do) while perusing engineering degrees. I could spend hours looking into space and the science of spatial bodies or go to an art supply store and try to figure out a new project to work on. 
*  I also grew up VERY diabetic, and now that I'm grown and have the abilities to control it all on my phone and not need to go find a place to take insulin with a syringe I'm trying to try more foods I wasn't able to. 
* I spent most of my time indoors, and I have no stamina but I can run fast so I'm like sonic fast for 0.00045 seconds and then I'm trying to inhale air at an excessive rate so I'm trying to build up more stamina and also I have no flexibility so trying to work on that. 
* I have no sense of smell, I didn't lose it or anything I was just born without it so I cannot relate to anything related to smell.
* I've always buzzed my hair growing up, within the last 2 years I decided that I want to grow it out, I've been growing it out to my shoulders so hair and plan to keep going. Still learning how to use claw clips and how to do a proper bun. ALSO I know understand how hair gets EVERYWHERE.
* I recently got a new car after having a car so old it didn't even have Bluetooth so having a nice and comfortable ride so I want to take more drives, BUT I HATE DRIVING IN TRAFFIC.. 😭
* I have an uncomfortable amount of dad jokes ready to go.

**4. Beliefs and Values** 

  
So I would have to say I'm pretty left leaning in my beliefs, I feel that people should aim to make the general situation of everyone around themselves better and that doing harm to others for your own self gain is something I think makes you a bad person. Generally I don't mind what you think or believe, as long as it doesn't hurt others. And to follow that up I'm not religious but I like the mythology of them. I won't convert or start believing in anything, but along the lines of what I said earlier, if you aren't trying to convert people or your beliefs don't hurt people then its not my place to say anything about what you think. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**5. Favorites** 

*  **Sports:** Basketball or Badminton 
* **Music**: Hip Hop, House, Jpop/rock, Kpop
* **Food**: Indian food and Vietnamese; In-N-Out (my order is an Animal Style Double Double with extra toast, chopped chilies and Well Done Animal Style Fries); and my favorite dish of all time is either Aloo Mutter or Dahi Bahalle with Chana
* **Drink:** Teas. I love milk tea but I dislike boba, Chai, and Diet Coke. If a drink has mango in it I WILL DRINK IT
* **Snack:** Apple slices or those Ritz Cracker and Cheese snacks
* **Day:** Saturday cus you don't have a fake weekend like Sunday where you spend a portion of it getting ready for the week
* **Fruit**: Durian or Mango
* **Clothing Style:** I would say streetwear is my favorite or normal style
* **Water temp:** Room temp water is THE BEST 
* **Form of communication** Some form of text messaging, I love to talk to people but sometimes I'm doing something so I can't talk so being able to just type something up is my preference, 
* **Fabric:** Polyester 
* **Color:** Blue or green depending on the day

**6. The kind of people I'm looking for**

  
I'd like to find people who like talking about themselves and their days, are interested enough in my hobbies and interests to want to hear about them, and who can respond back in reasonable time. I'm a good texter and I will respond back to you pretty quick if I'm not busy, I'd like to chat with someone who can do the same reasonably, If you're busy or have plans then go ahead and take care of that, but ideally I would like to chat with someone who I don't have to wonder if I'll get a reply that day or weeks later. Other than that someone who has their own thing going on and down to share about it. "
Hello Kitty Ramen Pinhole?,miniverse_makeitmini,1i9daw6,2025-01-24 21:51:04,9,0.91,11,https://i.redd.it/ogyxmw4p02fe1.jpeg,iLikeMineMini,,"I haven’t had any luck finding HK balls with pinholes at Walmart or Target yet, but while I was out at Walgreens today searching for spring balls, I noticed they had a display of Hello Kitty with the EU codes and extra warning sticker on the outside. 

I totally forgot to check for pinholes at the store. 

I went back to the guide to save it for my next trip, but there doesn’t appear to be a pinhole for the ramen? The guide hasn’t been updated since October. 

I’m reluctant to go by weight since the ramen is only a gram apart from several others. I’ve been burned too many times lol. 

Does anyone have pinhole info for the ramen? I would so very much appreciate it! 🙏"
AITAH For telling my sister that I am likely not able to attend her wedding,AITAH,1i9d9oh,2025-01-24 21:49:09,2,0.67,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i9d9oh/aitah_for_telling_my_sister_that_i_am_likely_not/,Elvendoom12,,"My sister (19) messaged my wife (22) this afternoon telling her that her wedding was to be June 7th, 2025. When we got home later in the night I (21) messaged her telling her I did not think we would be able to make it to her wedding as we had a trip planned later that month and had already made the necessary plans for it back in August. This trip also revolves around my best friend's wedding which I am best man. I told her I could only take a few days off of work and she stated that that wasn't her problem and to ""figure it out"". After this, I got mad as she had always believed that everything should revolve around her. I told her that we would not be able to make it once again and she got pissed off. Telling me that I'm a jerk and that I never put any effort into our relationship and when I told her that we had tried to accommodate her this next week for a visit after she specifically told me she wanted to visit. My wife moved a very important doctor's appointment just so she could be here and then she said she wasn't coming because it was too far, she said that had nothing to do with the wedding at all. I told her she had stated I didn't put any effort into the relationship when I had tried to accommodate her on multiple occasions. Especially last year when she was at our campsite for several hours per day while my wife was extremely sick we tried to make an effort for her to be able to spend time with me. My wife pointed out last summer that she thought my sister was a little bit possessive of me. I did not think this at that time but now I believe she is after seeing how she has treated my wife the last few times we have been all together. 

She excludes my wife and if my wife plans something and she is invited she will take over the entire thing and make it entirely about herself and how she never gets to see me or spend time with me. I especially noticed this when we were at a well-known mall and my wife, who has several medical issues including blood sugar problems, got hungry after being sick that morning and asked if my sister knew where the food court was. She would not tell her and instead wanted to get boba tea. My wife needed actual food at that moment but didn't want to upset my sister so she fell back to me walking behind her with my cousin and explained the situation, I went and told my sister that we were going to get real food so that my wife did not have a medical emergency in the middle of the mall. She commented on how we were ""supposed"" to spend time together and that us going to get a burger while she and her friend were at boba was not spending time together. This was a trip that my wife organized and that we were paying for. Yet my sister made it all about herself. When I told my sister that I would try to figure out a way to be at the wedding she went and said ""Yeah make sure you add it to your chore list."" Visiting her is never a chore. We see her every time we are in town. We live 8 hours from her. 

I guess my question is am I the AH for not moving my entire vacation for my sister's wedding?"

I'm not sure what I can do to do so though, I'm not too keen on dressing him up, i have him wear the emotional support bear shirt to protect his print on (his pouch belt has seen better days) so dress up is outta the question (cuz it's armor) 

I wanna upgrade him in some way, he already has a heart beat and a coconut scent. Maybe his blaster? Idk >m<

Best option for housework?,babywearing,1i99gcr,2025-01-24 18:38:24,1,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/babywearing/comments/1i99gcr/best_option_for_housework/,Electronic-Ride9,,"Hi everyone, I have a 12 week old who doesn't like baby wearing much. I'm a FTM and struggle with getting her in her carriers. It feels like a 50-50 where half the time she is ok, and the other half she squirms, cries, screams etc and I end up abandoning my efforts. So I only do baby wearing for short walks outside (10-15 min).

However I'd like to baby wear more so I'm not nap trapped and can get more done around the house like cooking/laundry etc.

Currently I have a boba wrap and an ergo baby embrace carrier. 

The boba wrap seems impractical around the house because if I tie it wrongly, I have to take it all off and do it from scratch. Also she can't see much (view obstructed) so gets more fussy.

And my baby only likes the Ergobaby embrace when she is in a thick/fluffy jacket... Otherwise she seems very uncomfortable and cries in pain so I wonder if she doesn't like the feel of the straps directly on her body. 

Anyway, any suggestions for what wrap/carrier to use for around the house? Looking for something that's easy to take on/off, can be worn for 30 min stretches at least and is comfier for baby than the two options I already have. 

If you think using one of my current options is better and I just need to get better at fitting them on that would be helpful to know too!

Edit: wanted to add another question. She is now 13 lbs. How long can she be using the Boba Wrap and Ergobaby Embrace for before I need to get something bigger?"

It’s an Absolute Shame that we don’t have a single Dutch Bros. over here. 🫠

I first tried it at ChainFest 2024 (& absolutely LOVED it) so I was extremely excited when I saw it up north. I was even able to recreate the same drink from the festival, *AfterShock Rebel - NO Lime, ADD Strawberry Boba*..  I would 1,000% get that drink once a day if it were even near LA.
…& the Birthday Cake shake?!?! 🤪

Dutch Bros. absolutely blows a place like Starbucks out of the water.. It isn’t even funny. 
Energy drinks, shakes, coffee based drinks… they really do have Absolutely Everything. 🤌🏼

w/ not even 5 visits under my belt, I still think it’s Extremely Safe for me to put Dutch in the same category as a ShakeShack, Raising Cane’s, etc.

I get Dutch Bros. isn’t exactly food, but I’d still Most Definitely include them on a 'Fast Food' themed list.

As crazy as it sounds, I think brands like Coca-Cola & PepsiCo have to now stay Extremely Alert of brands like Dutch Bros. I quit soda a few years back, & I feel like Dutch is the alternative I’ve been looking for forever now. The worst part about soda is, when you get too deep, you start to replace water w/ soda. But w/ Dutch, it’s somewhat high caffeine/sugar - (2 things I like in moderation) -  but at the same time it’s $5+. There’s no way in hell I’d buy more than one of these a day, because I feel like at that point it’s just too much, but one of these, once a day (if you can afford it) is the Absolute Sweet-Spot.

I also plan to start consistently making plays on $BROS. This brand will be an Absolute Powerhouse in 10 years from now.. it’s Insane just thinking about it. 📈 🚀"

Why should Kylo Ren be called a man-child having temper tantrums when he had to kill his father in an attempt to prove himself to his mentor only to be told 1) that he failed his mission anyway 2) that this sacrifice wasn't good enough.
