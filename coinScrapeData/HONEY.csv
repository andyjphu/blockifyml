Where is DEPIN in our lives?,DAOLabs,1foo60o,2024-09-24 17:38:59,11,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DAOLabs/comments/1foo60o/where_is_depin_in_our_lives/,tarangogu,Reddit Tasks,"https://preview.redd.it/surcpavsttqd1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=86d422ee6d3b153f0b3d2b29581e4634fffd228c

We have been hearing about DePIN frequently in the cryptocurrency and blockchain field recently. It has almost never left the market agenda since the beginning of this year.

Any protocol with decentralized physical network infrastructures can be called DePin. DePin, which is frequently used in the cryptocurrency sector, means that blockchain networks are connected to a physical infrastructure.

DePin initiatives in the field are generally concentrated in business lines such as telecom infrastructure, power plants, cloud solutions, data storage areas. Recently, initiatives for electric vehicles and charging stations have also been seen. These areas are sectors where large companies have a say because they require large infrastructure investments.

The cryptocurrency sector has turned to meet its high capital needs with tokenization. Tokenization increases the competitiveness of strong communities by spreading the need to the base. The capital requirement required by DePin initiatives is also tried to be solved by spreading the service offered to the base in a similar way.

Since DePin protocols work with physical devices, they work with token incentives for participants to purchase these devices. Participants who contribute to the network by purchasing the device aim to earn income by regularly earning tokens. The protocol has a more decentralized and powerful infrastructure as it has more participants from different locations.

DePin protocols that can provide decentralization have the opportunity to compete with other companies by having a lower and distributed risk structure compared to large companies.

If we touch on the leading DePin projects, these are;

Helium (HNT): Helium offers a global wireless network consisting of decentralized nodes called hotspots. This network is used to connect internet access and internet of things (IoT) devices.

Filecoin (FIL): It offers decentralized file storage and sharing service. Many different files can be stored on the blockchain in Filecoin.

Render (RNDR): It offers the render service in a decentralized way. Participants offer GPU power that they can rent to designers and are rewarded with RNDR in return.

Hivemapper (HONEY): It offers a decentralized mapping service. Participants provide real-time data such as GPS location and street view, allowing a world map to be created on the blockchain.

I would like to talk about IoTeX (IOTX), a remarkable depin project of recent times.

It is dedicated to developing the Internet of Things (IoT) sector by developing decentralized hardware that increases security and privacy. IoTeX focuses on providing DePIN infrastructure solutions. In addition to various developer tools and go-to-market support, they encourage the growth of decentralized network initiatives by providing centralized services such as W3bstream.

Using IoTeX's decentralized devices significantly increases user security and privacy. Moreover, users have the opportunity to earn IOTX tokens by interacting with the platform.

DePIN projects have already entered our daily lives and are promising for the future in the sector with new developments. It is obvious that we will hear their names more in 2025

I want to discuss my frustrations with this project… I spent all of 2023 pushing this project everywhere I could… ,hivemappernetwork,1fel24s,2024-09-11 17:01:32,10,1.0,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/hivemappernetwork/comments/1fel24s/i_want_to_discuss_my_frustrations_with_this/,Helium-godfather,,"We need better leadership at the top! Hivemapper is hands down the best crypto idea out there at the moment… ** I could easily see millions of drivers joining in the coming months & years. Hivemapper could be many people’s first crypto experience, as it’s straightforward and a simple concept to grasp, unlike many other crypto projects… If we got millions of people mapping, that would quickly legitimize our Honey token… *** Nothing is more important than our token. The token makes the fly wheel spin… Who here would still map if they stopped rewards this week? Not many! The founders don’t get this concept. The stronger the token becomes the more people join and the more the project grows and fly wheel will keep spinning! Many of us worked hard to get this project to where it’s at today! The founders could not of done this without us & the honey token… The more adaption we get with the honey token,  the more people join, & the more people drive… It’s that simple… I have grown tired of hearing
 “This is a mapping project first” “No, it’s a crypto project first, without crypto the network would have less than 50 people mapping worldwide. Who knows, maybe we could even find future uses for our pics that people never anticipated. I had hopes that by 2026 or 2028 We would see 360 roof mount cameras for sale that would rival google street view images. Would people buy these Roof mount cameras. All depends on what Honey is doing! Nothing else would really matter. "
Drive-to-Earn Projects: NATIX and Hivemapper,uberdrivers,1fah1w1,2024-09-06 10:49:29,3,1.0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/1fah1w1/drivetoearn_projects_natix_and_hivemapper/,oracleifi,,"In the growing ""drive-to-earn"" sector, projects like NATIX and Hivemapper are paving the way for new ways to monetize everyday driving activities. While both projects offer unique value propositions, there are distinct differences that set them apart in the market. Here's a simple comparison between the two:

  
**Hivemapper: The Established Player**

  
Hivemapper has positioned itself as a major player in the drive-to-earn space by leveraging the power of decentralized mapping. The project incentivizes drivers to contribute to its global map-building efforts by earning HONEY tokens. This decentralized mapping approach is often compared to the well-established Google Maps but with a blockchain twist, where drivers can earn crypto for their contributions.

  
**Key Features:** Decentralized Mapping: Users contribute to the creation of a global, user-generated map.

Token Burn Mechanism: HONEY tokens earned by drivers are partially burned, reducing the overall supply and potentially increasing token value.

Strong Network Effect: With a growing community of contributors, Hivemapper benefits from an established network that enhances the quality and coverage of its mapping data.

  
**NATIX: The Underdog with a Unique Angle**

NATIX is emerging as a promising underdog in the drive-to-earn space, aiming to differentiate itself with a more comprehensive set of features tailored for occupational drivers and tech enthusiasts. While it also focuses on decentralized mapping, NATIX is setting itself apart with additional functionalities such as navigation, parking assistance, and other driver-assistant features that are currently in development.

**Key Features:** Navigation and Driver Assistance: Unlike Hivemapper, NATIX is integrating navigation features, with plans to include parking assistance and other driver-supportive functionalities soon. These features are particularly beneficial for occupational drivers who rely on efficient routing and parking information.

Focus on Driver Utility: By emphasizing real-time navigation and practical driving assistance, NATIX aims to offer more immediate and tangible benefits for drivers beyond just earning tokens.

Community-Centric Growth: NATIX is building its ecosystem with a focus on user feedback and community-driven improvements, making it agile and responsive to market needs.

While Hivemapper is currently the more established project, NATIX is carving out its niche by focusing on additional driver assistance features. This positions NATIX to cater more specifically to occupational drivers and those interested in innovative, driving-related technology.

For users, choosing between NATIX and Hivemapper may come down to their specific needs—whether they prioritize contributing to decentralized mapping and earning crypto, or if they are more interested in practical, tech-driven navigation and driving support."

Even if the token goes up in the future the amount of honey I was earning per week on my HDC has dropped significantly. From approximately $200 per week down to $20. From my stance this would be more difficult to keep fleet drivers entertained due to the low profitability in my market.

I will continue to map with my camera just decided to no longer have a fleet. I hope that this project is beneficial for everyone in the community.

Praying for the long term economic viability of hivemapper. 

No problems with the shipping timeline as I was an OG cam order.

I look forward to seeing what hivemapper does but the risk to me at this time is not worth it. Probably something I will regret but I had to move forward with this decision based on risk assessment for the growth of my business.

This token is destined to fail. Mappers can’t make enough money to pay for the gasoline in their autos. As more people map, rewards drop. As more honey is minted the price of honey drops. Drivers ratings are being lowered and receiving less honey. Seems like the founders of Hivemapper built in diminishing returns to get to a point where mappers provide a free service to the company. I feel bad for fleet operators that spent thousands of dollars to only see rapidly diminishing returns. They talk about emissions driving honey token higher. Plenty of crypto companies have tried burns with hopes of cutting down how many pieces of the pie are available. Promising your piece will be more valuable. If the pie is only valued at a dollar. Doesn’t matter how big your piece is…it’s only worth pennies. Run for the hills on this one before the rug is pulled. "

# Weekly Recap

Another great week in the books! I had a blast this past week, using and farming my usual **DePIN Stack**. As always, I encourage you to read last weeks post, you can find it [**here**](https://medium.com/coinmonks/depin-diaries-1-a1c20c58a937). However, there is no need to read last week’s post to enjoy this weeks! This week really felt like a huge [**Silencio**](https://www.silencio.network/) grind to be honest. I am really getting addicted to that leaderboard mechanic….

These projects really know what they’re doing with gamification. Almost every DePIN project I am using feels like a little game I am playing throughout the day. It doesn’t help that in most of these projects I accumulate “points”. So addicting! The presence of a global leaderboard in apps like [**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/) and [**Silencio**](https://www.silencio.network/) really bring out my competitive side! I dream to one day be with the greats, like **gheorghita50**. I am pretty sure the #1 currently is a hacker.

# Weekly Highlights

I feel like a beast! I had to drive 2 hours this past week to get my laptop screen repaired, stupid cat! This bumped up my [**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/) leaderboard position quite a lot. I spoke last week about [**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/)’s leaderboard becoming too competitive. I used the brand-new **NITRO** feature and boosted my earnings 4x! I went from around **#1300** on the leaderboard to **#239**. What a jump! I also was able to move up the [**Silencio**](https://www.silencio.network/) leaderboard to the low **#1300**’s. Trying to break **#1000** soon.

# Lowlights

I have my first complaint about Helium Mobile. My coverage got pretty bad during my two hour drive to repair my laptop. Not horrendous, but definitely noticeable. Another complaint I’ve got is with [**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/). My phone being up on my dash while I drive causes it to overheat so much. This is a huge pain, because if the phone overheats, it logs out of [**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/) and I lose my earnings. This can also potentially damage my phone. [**AIOZ**](https://aioz.network/) **Node** also not producing much.

Helium Hotspot Map

Still super bummed that I can’t earn [**PowerPod Tokens**](https://pulse.powerpod.pro/) yet. I have spoken with a mod about potential community airdrop. I am really hoping that this happens. I am a huge supporter of their community and create a fair bit of content for them! Currently #1 in [**PowerPod**](https://pulse.powerpod.pro/) [**Discord**](https://communities.wonderverse.xyz/referral?referralCode=2V0YUXCH4&referralCampaignExternalId=dFjXB3SMobNyato) too. If you are interested in checking out [**PowerPod**](https://pulse.powerpod.pro/), here is a link to the [**Discord**](https://communities.wonderverse.xyz/referral?referralCode=2V0YUXCH4&referralCampaignExternalId=dFjXB3SMobNyato). Kinda bummed I can’t interact in their ecosystem yet, but I guess we will just wait and see!

# New Addition

# PINGPONG

I teased this project at the end of last weeks blog. [**PINGPONG**](https://www.pingpong.build/) is awesome! It is an all in one **DePIN aggregator** of sorts. It allows users to farm different protocols all in one client. Currently you are able to earn **AIOZ**, **GOLEM**, **TITAN**, **MASQ,** and **PPP (PINGPONG POINTS)!** To begin earning, go to [**PINGPONG.build**](https://www.pingpong.build/) and download the **light node**!

I really like [**PINGPONG’**](https://www.pingpong.build/)s design, user friendly display, and features. This is by far the easiest way to farm multiple protocols in DePIN.

# Thoughts

Another great week! It seems like I am chipping away at the red by around $18 a week. Rest in peace! Gosh it will only take 47 more weeks to see green! That is awful! Buying that [**Hivemapper Bee**](https://hivemapper.com/explorer) really did some damage. On a more positive note, my [**Helium Mobile**](https://my.hellohelium.com/ref/J5FN7HM) phone plan almost pays for itself! I will only have used it for 3 weeks during the month of April, so I feel that in May I will be able to cover the cost completely.

I am still really banking on these pre-TGE projects to cover my losses. [**Silencio**](https://www.silencio.network/) and [**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/) are having their TGE pretty soon. It was planned to happen in Q3 of 2024. I hope this is the case and they can dig me out of the decentralized grave I am rotting in. However I am worried, I feel like apps like [**Silencio**](https://www.silencio.network/) and [**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/) have quickly turned from focusing on Software and use cases to game theory and gamification techniques. I guess only time will tell if my fears were warranted.

I had a massive week in [**Grass**](https://app.getgrass.io/register?referralCode=cMivSQvuNuYRrzW). Referral bonuses hit! I was able to gain **140,000 points**! That is massive. I am extremely bullish on [**Grass**](https://app.getgrass.io/register?referralCode=cMivSQvuNuYRrzW). If you aren’t farming [**Grass**](https://app.getgrass.io/register?referralCode=cMivSQvuNuYRrzW) yet you should hop on the train. They have almost **2 million** active users, no reason not to feel the WAGMI.

I am very bullish on PINGPONG, I like what they are aiming to do. They want to create a secondary market like [**Whales Market**](https://whales.market/), to seel the points and native tokens of DePIN projects. This would create an extremely active derivative trading platform for speculation on DePIN projects. I see this as an exciting avenue to explore. **I would greatly appreciate you taking a second to use my referral links, it keeps me doing what I love, DePIN!**

# Weekly Recap

Another great week in the books! I had a blast this past week, using and farming my usual **DePIN Stack**. As always, I encourage you to read last weeks post, you can find it [**here**](https://medium.com/coinmonks/depin-diaries-1-a1c20c58a937). However, there is no need to read last week’s post to enjoy this weeks! This week really felt like a huge [**Silencio**](https://www.silencio.network/) grind to be honest. I am really getting addicted to that leaderboard mechanic….

These projects really know what they’re doing with gamification. Almost every DePIN project I am using feels like a little game I am playing throughout the day. It doesn’t help that in most of these projects I accumulate “points”. So addicting! The presence of a global leaderboard in apps like [**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/) and [**Silencio**](https://www.silencio.network/) really bring out my competitive side! I dream to one day be with the greats, like **gheorghita50**. I am pretty sure the #1 currently is a hacker.

# Weekly Highlights

I feel like a beast! I had to drive 2 hours this past week to get my laptop screen repaired, stupid cat! This bumped up my [**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/) leaderboard position quite a lot. I spoke last week about [**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/)’s leaderboard becoming too competitive. I used the brand-new **NITRO** feature and boosted my earnings 4x! I went from around **#1300** on the leaderboard to **#239**. What a jump! I also was able to move up the [**Silencio**](https://www.silencio.network/) leaderboard to the low **#1300**’s. Trying to break **#1000** soon.

# Lowlights

I have my first complaint about Helium Mobile. My coverage got pretty bad during my two hour drive to repair my laptop. Not horrendous, but definitely noticeable. Another complaint I’ve got is with [**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/). My phone being up on my dash while I drive causes it to overheat so much. This is a huge pain, because if the phone overheats, it logs out of [**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/) and I lose my earnings. This can also potentially damage my phone. [**AIOZ**](https://aioz.network/) **Node** also not producing much."

# Thoughts

Another great week! It seems like I am chipping away at the red by around $18 a week. Rest in peace! Gosh it will only take 47 more weeks to see green! That is awful! Buying that [**Hivemapper Bee**](https://hivemapper.com/explorer) really did some damage. On a more positive note, my [**Helium Mobile**](https://my.hellohelium.com/ref/J5FN7HM) phone plan almost pays for itself! I will only have used it for 3 weeks during the month of April, so I feel that in May I will be able to cover the cost completely.

I am still really banking on these pre-TGE projects to cover my losses. [**Silencio**](https://www.silencio.network/) and [**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/) are having their TGE pretty soon. It was planned to happen in Q3 of 2024. I hope this is the case and they can dig me out of the decentralized grave I am rotting in. However I am worried, I feel like apps like [**Silencio**](https://www.silencio.network/) and [**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/) have quickly turned from focusing on Software and use cases to game theory and gamification techniques. I guess only time will tell if my fears were warranted.

I had a massive week in [**Grass**](https://app.getgrass.io/register?referralCode=cMivSQvuNuYRrzW). Referral bonuses hit! I was able to gain **140,000 points**! That is massive. I am extremely bullish on [**Grass**](https://app.getgrass.io/register?referralCode=cMivSQvuNuYRrzW). If you aren’t farming [**Grass**](https://app.getgrass.io/register?referralCode=cMivSQvuNuYRrzW) yet you should hop on the train. They have almost **2 million** active users, no reason not to feel the WAGMI.

I am very bullish on PINGPONG, I like what they are aiming to do. They want to create a secondary market like [**Whales Market**](https://whales.market/), to seel the points and native tokens of DePIN projects. This would create an extremely active derivative trading platform for speculation on DePIN projects. I see this as an exciting avenue to explore. **I would greatly appreciate you taking a second to use my referral links, it keeps me doing what I love, DePIN!**

# Weekly Recap

Another great week in the books! I had a blast this past week, using and farming my usual **DePIN Stack**. As always, I encourage you to read last weeks post, you can find it [**here**](https://medium.com/coinmonks/depin-diaries-1-a1c20c58a937). However, there is no need to read last week’s post to enjoy this weeks! This week really felt like a huge [**Silencio**](https://www.silencio.network/) grind to be honest. I am really getting addicted to that leaderboard mechanic….

These projects really know what they’re doing with gamification. Almost every DePIN project I am using feels like a little game I am playing throughout the day. It doesn’t help that in most of these projects I accumulate “points”. So addicting! The presence of a global leaderboard in apps like [**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/) and [**Silencio**](https://www.silencio.network/) really bring out my competitive side! I dream to one day be with the greats, like **gheorghita50**. I am pretty sure the #1 currently is a hacker.

# Weekly Highlights

I feel like a beast! I had to drive 2 hours this past week to get my laptop screen repaired, stupid cat! This bumped up my [**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/) leaderboard position quite a lot. I spoke last week about [**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/)’s leaderboard becoming too competitive. I used the brand-new **NITRO** feature and boosted my earnings 4x! I went from around **#1300** on the leaderboard to **#239**. What a jump! I also was able to move up the [**Silencio**](https://www.silencio.network/) leaderboard to the low **#1300**’s. Trying to break **#1000** soon.

# Lowlights

I have my first complaint about Helium Mobile. My coverage got pretty bad during my two hour drive to repair my laptop. Not horrendous, but definitely noticeable. Another complaint I’ve got is with [**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/). My phone being up on my dash while I drive causes it to overheat so much. This is a huge pain, because if the phone overheats, it logs out of [**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/) and I lose my earnings. This can also potentially damage my phone. [**AIOZ**](https://aioz.network/) **Node** also not producing much."

Welcome back to the **DePIN Diaries**. If you haven’t read last week’s post, I encourage you to do so [**here**](https://medium.com/coinmonks/depin-diaries-1-a1c20c58a937). However, there is no need to read last week’s post to enjoy this weeks. This week was eventful! I felt very motivated to use the DePIN projects that I had been using. I realized that I am pretty much participating in somme form of DePIN at all times! I did a great deal of research during the week about DePIN projects to potentially include in my stack. I also have gotten connected in these projects Discords to stay in the loop.

I set up a [**Raspberry Pi**](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) to run [**Grass**](https://app.getgrass.io/register?referralCode=cMivSQvuNuYRrzW) 24/7. The setup was quite easy, I was able to get a [**Raspberry Pi**](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) for free, that meaning I have unlimited upside! If you have any more profitable ideas for this Pi let me know! [**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/) introduced a new HODL Bonus for in app **$NATIX**, so my **104,000** **$NATIX** is being put to work! I have a 33 day streak bonus in [**Silencio**](https://www.silencio.network/), granting me a **82.5% bonus!** I only have 1 referral for [**Grass**](https://app.getgrass.io/register?referralCode=cMivSQvuNuYRrzW), so I would greatly appreciate anyone who uses my referral link! That’s enough statistics, let’s get into the highlights!

## Highlights

I have loved using [**Silencio**](https://www.silencio.network/) while I go on walks, [**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/) when I drive, and passively selling bandwidth while I work. This optimization of my entire day is extremely addicting. I am eager to learn about more projects, but very reluctant to add them to my stack. [**Helium Mobile**](https://my.hellohelium.com/ref/J5FN7HM) using was a brand new addition I made the day I wrote the last diary. It took a few days to get running, but the service is amazing! For only $21 a month, it is a must have for Web3 lovers! Check it out [**here**](https://my.hellohelium.com/ref/J5FN7HM). Just wait to see how much I earned using [**Helium Mobile**](https://my.hellohelium.com/ref/J5FN7HM) for just 4 days.

## Lowlights

My [**AIOZ**](https://aioz.network/) **Node** has not been producing much. It did not produce anything for the first 4 days of being installed. I am not giving up just yet, but I am skeptical about the earning potential with it. I may have to Pivot into another bandwidth monetization project. Another side note, [**Silencio**](https://www.silencio.network/) has entered a 24 hr migration period, this meaning no earnings until April 17th.

I am still eagerly waiting my [**Bee**](https://bee.hivemapper.com/?utm_source=salebutton&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=salebutton&utm_id=1212023) **Dash Camera,** this will not arrive until **Q3** so I have a few months left to wait. The $569 sunk cost is going to take awhile to recoup. [**PowerPod**](https://www.powerpod.pro/) released the [**Pulse 1**](https://pulse.powerpod.pro/), the world’s first **EV charger and crypto miner**. This thing is seriously gonna pump out some dollars, it sucks I don’t have an EV. I even got a $100 off coupon for being an early adopter. Just you wait, I am scheming to find some way to partake in **$PPD**’s explosive growth.

# New Additions

## UpRock

[**UpRock**](https://link.uprock.com/i/0ff824cd) is another bandwidth sharing DePIN that runs in the background. I originally wanted to run [**UpRock**](https://link.uprock.com/i/0ff824cd) because I heard that you could make use of [**BlueStacks**](https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html) and run multiple instances without being banned. Sadly, [**BlueStacks**](https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html) is incompatible with my MacOs. If anyone has any advice to get [**BlueStacks**](https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html) up and running on a MacBook Air I would greatly appreciate it!

[**UpRock**](https://link.uprock.com/i/0ff824cd) functions almost the same ass [**Grass**](https://app.getgrass.io/register?referralCode=cMivSQvuNuYRrzW) does. Runs in the background and I can’t even notice it. This project however is much closer to **Token Generation Event**. Basically, you run the [**UpRock**](https://link.uprock.com/i/0ff824cd) client in the background and you earn **$UPT**. **$UPT** is built on the Solana blockchain which I am now very bullish on. I downloaded this last night, so it has not been running for long.

# Thoughts

I had a lot of fun this last week, that’s all that matters. I am just kidding, sadly, fun will not pay the bills. I am still bleeding, but most of the damage comes from the **Hivemapper** [**Bee**](https://bee.hivemapper.com/?utm_source=salebutton&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=salebutton&utm_id=1212023) I ordered. That should pay for itself ten fold. I am really hoping that a few of these bandwidth application pay off. I am more bullish on [**UpRock**](https://link.uprock.com/i/0ff824cd) than [**Grass**](https://app.getgrass.io/register?referralCode=cMivSQvuNuYRrzW) and that is saying something. [**UpRock**](https://link.uprock.com/i/0ff824cd) should have the TGE at the end of the month. [**AIOZ**](https://aioz.network/) only began producing **$AIOZ** the last 2 days, leaving my over optimistic self to blindly allow it to use my computer. That being said, if [**AIOZ**](https://aioz.network/) does not increase rewards, I will uninstall and pivot to another bandwidth project.

I am extremely satisfied with my results from [**Helium Mobile**](https://hellohelium.com/). I have earned almost $5 in 4 days. The plan monthly costs $21, so I will try to cover that cost each month and pocket the rest. [**Dimo**](https://dimo.zone/) is always a pleasant start to the week, receiving my $10-$25 in **$DIMO** always puts a smile on my face.

[**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/) and [**Silencio**](https://www.silencio.network/) are nearing their TGE. This will be a turning point for whether I keep using the products or not. I am really enjoying [**Silencio**](https://www.silencio.network/)’s leaderboard. Extremely competitive and I love to climb it. [**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/) on the other hand is seeminly a little too saturated. The leaderboard is becoming much more competitive. I will not waste gas driving around for cryptocurrency, sorry I wont.

I am going to begin looking into [**PINGPONG**](https://www.pingpong.build/) this is another DePIN project that has to do with bandwidth. This project involves running a “light node”. I will do research on it this week and test it out. I appreciate you reading until the end. If you are new to DePIN, I encourage you to try out some of the projects I use, super user friendly and most are free!

I also have gotten connected in these projects Discords to stay in the loop.

I set up a [**Raspberry Pi**](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) to run [**Grass**](https://app.getgrass.io/register?referralCode=cMivSQvuNuYRrzW) 24/7. The setup was quite easy, I was able to get a [**Raspberry Pi**](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) for free, that meaning I have unlimited upside! If you have any more profitable ideas for this Pi let me know! [**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/) introduced a new HODL Bonus for in app **$NATIX**, so my **104,000** **$NATIX** is being put to work! I have a 33 day streak bonus in [**Silencio**](https://www.silencio.network/), granting me a **82.5% bonus!** I only have 1 referral for [**Grass**](https://app.getgrass.io/register?referralCode=cMivSQvuNuYRrzW), so I would greatly appreciate anyone who uses my referral link! That’s enough statistics, let’s get into the highlights!

## Highlights

I have loved using [**Silencio**](https://www.silencio.network/) while I go on walks, [**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/) when I drive, and passively selling bandwidth while I work. This optimization of my entire day is extremely addicting. I am eager to learn about more projects, but very reluctant to add them to my stack. [**Helium Mobile**](https://my.hellohelium.com/ref/J5FN7HM) using was a brand new addition I made the day I wrote the last diary. It took a few days to get running, but the service is amazing! For only $21 a month, it is a must have for Web3 lovers! Check it out [**here**](https://my.hellohelium.com/ref/J5FN7HM). Just wait to see how much I earned using [**Helium Mobile**](https://my.hellohelium.com/ref/J5FN7HM) for just 4 days.

## Lowlights

My [**AIOZ**](https://aioz.network/) **Node** has not been producing much. It did not produce anything for the first 4 days of being installed. I am not giving up just yet, but I am skeptical about the earning potential with it. I may have to Pivot into another bandwidth monetization project. Another side note, [**Silencio**](https://www.silencio.network/) has entered a 24 hr migration period, this meaning no earnings until April 17th.

I am still eagerly waiting my [**Bee**](https://bee.hivemapper.com/?utm_source=salebutton&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=salebutton&utm_id=1212023) **Dash Camera,** this will not arrive until **Q3** so I have a few months left to wait. The $569 sunk cost is going to take awhile to recoup. [**PowerPod**](https://www.powerpod.pro/) released the [**Pulse 1**](https://pulse.powerpod.pro/), the world’s first **EV charger and crypto miner**. This thing is seriously gonna pump out some dollars, it sucks I don’t have an EV. I even got a $100 off coupon for being an early adopter. Just you wait, I am scheming to find some way to partake in **$PPD**’s explosive growth.

# New Additions

## UpRock

[**UpRock**](https://link.uprock.com/i/0ff824cd) is another bandwidth sharing DePIN that runs in the background. I originally wanted to run [**UpRock**](https://link.uprock.com/i/0ff824cd) because I heard that you could make use of [**BlueStacks**](https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html) and run multiple instances without being banned. Sadly, [**BlueStacks**](https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html) is incompatible with my MacOs. If anyone has any advice to get [**BlueStacks**](https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html) up and running on a MacBook Air I would greatly appreciate it!

[**UpRock**](https://link.uprock.com/i/0ff824cd) functions almost the same ass [**Grass**](https://app.getgrass.io/register?referralCode=cMivSQvuNuYRrzW) does. Runs in the background and I can’t even notice it. This project however is much closer to **Token Generation Event**. Basically, you run the [**UpRock**](https://link.uprock.com/i/0ff824cd) client in the background and you earn **$UPT**. **$UPT** is built on the Solana blockchain which I am now very bullish on. I downloaded this last night, so it has not been running for long.

# Thoughts

I had a lot of fun this last week, that’s all that matters. I am just kidding, sadly, fun will not pay the bills. I am still bleeding, but most of the damage comes from the **Hivemapper** [**Bee**](https://bee.hivemapper.com/?utm_source=salebutton&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=salebutton&utm_id=1212023) I ordered. That should pay for itself ten fold. I am really hoping that a few of these bandwidth application pay off. I am more bullish on [**UpRock**](https://link.uprock.com/i/0ff824cd) than [**Grass**](https://app.getgrass.io/register?referralCode=cMivSQvuNuYRrzW) and that is saying something. [**UpRock**](https://link.uprock.com/i/0ff824cd) should have the TGE at the end of the month. [**AIOZ**](https://aioz.network/) only began producing **$AIOZ** the last 2 days, leaving my over optimistic self to blindly allow it to use my computer. That being said, if [**AIOZ**](https://aioz.network/) does not increase rewards, I will uninstall and pivot to another bandwidth project.

I am extremely satisfied with my results from [**Helium Mobile**](https://hellohelium.com/). I have earned almost $5 in 4 days. The plan monthly costs $21, so I will try to cover that cost each month and pocket the rest. [**Dimo**](https://dimo.zone/) is always a pleasant start to the week, receiving my $10-$25 in **$DIMO** always puts a smile on my face.

[**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/) and [**Silencio**](https://www.silencio.network/) are nearing their TGE. This will be a turning point for whether I keep using the products or not. I am really enjoying [**Silencio**](https://www.silencio.network/)’s leaderboard. Extremely competitive and I love to climb it. [**Natix**](https://www.natix.network/) on the other hand is seeminly a little too saturated. The leaderboard is becoming much more competitive. I will not waste gas driving around for cryptocurrency, sorry I wont.

I am going to begin looking into [**PINGPONG**](https://www.pingpong.build/) this is another DePIN project that has to do with bandwidth. This project involves running a “light node”. I will do research on it this week and test it out. I appreciate you reading until the end. If you are new to DePIN, I encourage you to try out some of the projects I use, super user friendly and most are free! I have links to all projects below, and they include referral codes. **I would greatly appreciate you taking a second to use my referral links, it keeps me doing what I love, DePIN!**

My HDC-S is dead,hivemappernetwork,1c5i59i,2024-04-16 10:55:52,8,0.83,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/hivemappernetwork/comments/1c5i59i/my_hdcs_is_dead/,Modi_Elnadi,,"HDC-S is dead and WiFi is invisible. The Hivemapper idea is good, but it is way underdeveloped. Since day one, there have been many hardware issues, which culminated in a firmware that bricked hundreds of cameras. 

Customer support has not responded or resolved issues in a timely manner for few weeks now. This is an extremely disappointing approach to dealing with loyal customers. With this attitude of taking for granted users who paid money, you have a lot of potential, but not with this attitude. 

If I am hivemapper I would first try to focus on core early adopters and establishing the right level of support before scaling like crazy and gaining negative reviews. 🤷🏻‍♂️

5 Ways to Make Passive Income using DePIN as a student 2024,DePIN_Projects,1bnm5oo,2024-03-25 15:15:41,3,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DePIN_Projects/comments/1bnm5oo/5_ways_to_make_passive_income_using_depin_as_a/,Raftus_Asf,,"Being an accounting student at the University of Arkansas myself, I feel like I can relate to the majority of students. School is busy and it is frustrating just how broke you can be. I am studying accounting with a minor in blockchain technology. This combination opened up my eyes to all the different possibilities/ side hustles that are available to anyone with an internet connection.

I am going to cover 5 ways to earn some passive income using [Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN)](https://medium.com/@mttucker/what-is-depin-decentralized-physical-infrastructure-explained-4d44a50dc705) ← If you do not know what DePIN is I encourage you to give this a read \^.

DIMO

[DIMO](https://dimo.zone/) is building a world where technology serves people first. DIMO makes use of devices called the AutoPi and Macaroon that plug into car’s diagnostic port. These devices track your vehicle’s overall health. Vehicle manufacturers already sell customer data. DIMO gives driver’s the power over their data. There are 3 ways to connect: Using your car’s app is completely free and I would reccomend to students. Use code: BIQ00L for a bonus of 50 $DIMO (=roughly $20 as of today’s posting). The app rewards better the longer the car has been connected. Also, upgrading to the Macaron or the DIMO AutoPI increases your rewards respectively. I could not reccomend this more! Free Money. Your car already collects your data, you should atleast profit off of it! Don’t believe me? Read [this](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/its-official-cars-are-the-worst-product-category-we-have-ever-reviewed-for-privacy/).

Hivemapper

[Hivemapper ](https://bee.hivemapper.com/)is building a global map. Users purchase dash cameras and begin collecting data. The camera is collecting imagery and location data using the [Solana](https://solana.com/) Blockchain. Users are rewarded equitably for their contribution to the global map. Hivemapper users AI trainers to improve the collectability of the data received by the cameras.

This is a little more pricey, but the next avenue is similar and completely free. However you can purchase the BEE dash camera and earn 2000 bonus $HONEY which is around $260 as of today’s posting. The camera retails at $469 but with $260 promotion you are looking at roughly $210 cost. This can easily be earned back by just mapping your every day commute.

NATIX NETWORK

[Natix](http://natix.network/) first AI-powered dynamic map supercharged by the DePIN and driver community. Natix Network aims to build a dynamic map consisting of hyper-local data provided by drivers around the world. This is not a small feat. Natix positioned itself to be the free-to-use mapping web3 service. Hivemapper, the DePIN Goliath, makes use of devices users purchase to contribute to the network. Natix Network mapes use of the Drive& app, which is free to download in the IOS Appstore and Google Play store.

Natix Network is rewarded users in their natix token $NATIX. I use this on my every day commute and I have been able to earn 90,000 in their native utility token. This is a free alternative to Hivemapper. That being said, the rewards are less and their is much more competition to earn the rewards. Still very early to the project, there has not even been a presale for the $NATIX token yet. If you are interested in Natix Network, here are some invite codes for a 35,000 point sign up bonus!

Helium

[Helium Miners ](https://www.helium.com/mine#hotspots)provide wireless connectivity and mine helium tokens. Mining helium tokens (IOT and MOBILE) is done by installing a simple device on your home or office window. This is a little pricey compared to other instances, but in DePIN the more upfront cost, the less people who will mine, which in turn leads to more rewards. Helium hotspots provide miles of wireless network coverage for millions of devices and you are rewarded in Helium tokens for doing this. LoRaWAN Hotspots are incredibly energy efficient using only 5W of energy. This can easily be done. If you do not want to front the cost, [Mycelium Networks](https://medium.com/@mttucker/what-is-mycelium-networks-c0cee3c761d6) will pay you 25 USD a month if you host a hotspot for them. Only works in Northwest Arkansas, but I had to shout them out!

Mining helium tokens (IOT and MOBILE) is done by installing a simple device on your home or office window. This is a little pricey compared to other instances, but in DePIN the more upfront cost, the less people who will mine, which in turn leads to more rewards. Helium hotspots provide miles of wireless network coverage for millions of devices and you are rewarded in Helium tokens for doing this. LoRaWAN Hotspots are incredibly energy efficient using only 5W of energy. This can easily be done. If you do not want to front the cost, [Mycelium Networks](https://medium.com/@mttucker/what-is-mycelium-networks-c0cee3c761d6) will pay you 25 USD a month if you host a hotspot for them. Only works in Northwest Arkansas, but I had to shout them out!

As the demand for map credits (and therefore HONEY) increases, the velocity at which HONEY is burned and re-minted will also increase, and the value of HONEY will become tightly linked to the utility that the Hivemapper Network provides.” So one question would be how could someone track Hivemapper’s current utility to their customers. Another question would be, how does this model reflect the current honey price action? If the price drops, is that due to a lack of customers buying mapping data, and vice versa? Love the project and would appreciate any feedback."

Is there something easy I'm missing, or even a difficult workaround that anyone has found?

DePIN: Revolutionizing Blockchain with Decentralized Infrastructure Solutions,defi,17aq2sn,2023-10-18 08:52:48,32,0.91,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/17aq2sn/depin_revolutionizing_blockchain_with/,tsurutatdk,:discuss: Discussion,"Let's explore DePIN, often referred to as the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network, which many consider to be the future of blockchain technology.


We're all eager to uncover DePIN's potential to establish a truly decentralized infrastructure that no single entity controls.
In blockchain, a big problem is the need for reliable, decentralized infrastructure. DePIN steps in to fix this by creating a network of physical nodes that anyone can own and run. By using DePIN, blockchain apps become stronger, more secure, and scalable.


DePIN introduces a significant aspect - token incentives. Individuals contributing physical infrastructure nodes to the network have the opportunity to earn tokens, providing a compelling reason for more people to engage and support the network.

Here are a few DePIN projects you might find interesting:

- Helium operates a wireless network where setting up hotspots allows you to earn HNT tokens, contributing to the expansion of IoT and 5G coverage. With over 900,000 hotspots, it's a significant player in the field.

- Hivemapper Network is like a decentralized Google Maps. People use dashcams to map streets and get rewarded in HONEY tokens for their contributions.


- 2blox employs AI-powered cameras and rewards people with crypto for sharing local traffic data. This not only improves data accuracy but also gets the community involved in data collection on the Peaq network.


- Another project building on Peaq, Silencio, employs 35,000 smartphones as noise sensors across 176 countries in the fight against global noise pollution. Their aim is to expand to one million devices by 2024.

- DIMO Network lets users connect their cars to earn rewards from sharing mobility data, benefiting various industries like automotive finance and insurance. Users receive DIMO tokens as rewards.


While I can't mention every DePIN project, it's clear that DePIN has the potential to change how we store and transfer data. It's decentralized, eliminating the need for middlemen and ensuring secure transactions. Token incentives create a self-sustaining ecosystem for growth and adaptation.

As blockchain technology advances, DePIN will become pivotal in driving the widespread adoption of decentralized technologies. It establishes a secure and transparent foundation for blockchain infrastructure, unlocking its full potential and fostering a fairer world for all."

We’re excited to announce the extension of Open Road Season 1: Trailblazers until we reach our 6 million unique km goal! We appreciate your dedication to mapping the world’s roads, and we’re equally dedicated to ensuring a seamless journey.  Here’s what you need to know: 

1. Season Extension: We recognize that achieving 6 million unique km by the end of September was especially challenging due to slow upload speeds and some reliability issues with the latest firmware releases. Therefore, we decided to extend Open Road Season 1: Trailblazers until we reach the milestone.
2. Making It Right: The issue with slow uploads in the app was addressed in the latest update. Expect forthcoming app and firmware improvements to further enhance the mapping experience.
3. The Sweet Reward: Once we hit 6 million unique km, the Hivemapper Foundation will unlock a special airdrop of 6 MILLION HONEY. You’ll receive 3 HONEY per km of roads that were mapped for the first time this season. Plus, don’t forget to participate in the #openroad1 photo contests and raffles, which will continue until the season’s end.
4. Closing the Gap: We’re only 730,000 unique km away from our target, giving you an excellent opportunity to earn additional HONEY rewards and other prizes. Let’s map the uncharted routes together!
5. Ongoing Support: Our team is always ready to help. Your feedback is invaluable, and we’re working every day to facilitate our collective goal. If you need any assistance, you can find us here or email us at hi@hivemapper.com.

Together, as trailblazers, we can make this season a monumental success. Keep hitting the road, keep exploring, and let’s achieve 6 million unique km!"

I also went to their website and read through their docs about the system, the HONEY tokens, the ""mining,"" and the ecosystem. But I am very skeptical of things like this that seem too slick.

That said, they seem to have their T's crossed, and I's dotted. What I am looking for is real information,  real data, and people with real experience being a mapping miner. Also, i have browsed the previous posts about Hivemapper in this group,  but it was all investigating, and no one with real first-person experience of using the camera technology and driving around trying to make HONEY coins with it.

If you have any first-hand experience, can you please reply here. I'd be interested in knowing things like:

- are you paid per image?
- the cameras appear to take pictures, not roll video, is that true?
- do you have access to the video you submit as well?
- how much money do you make say per normal week ?
- how many cameras does it take to make money?
- can this make enough money to pay for your gas?"

what is the actual utility of the Honey token?,hivemappernetwork,z70r9j,2022-11-28 11:22:07,3,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/hivemappernetwork/comments/z70r9j/what_is_the_actual_utility_of_the_honey_token/,panoreddit,,"i.e. HNT can be used to buy data credits for use of the Helium network (if I'm not mistaken.)

All it says on the Hivemapper site is that Honey value is directly tied to the utility of the map itself.  Okay... Is there any actual use case for the token?  Silly question in crypto, I know, but-
