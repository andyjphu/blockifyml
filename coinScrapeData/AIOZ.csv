AIOZ Network's W3AI is doing a good job of changing the way we interact with AI by allowing users to run AI locally, earn rewards for their contributions, and engage in a dynamic AI marketplace. With lightning-fast performance and user-friendly development tools, W3AI is setting new standards for Web3 innovation.

The W3AI marketplace seamlessly integrates AI innovation with decentralization. Users can access advanced AI models while contributing data in exchange for AIOZ rewards.

Through DePIN infrastructure, W3AI empowers the creation, monetization, and sharing of AI assets. This collaborative environment stimulates creativity and technological advancement, paving the way for a decentralized and intelligent future.

AIOZ Network has recently formed significant partnerships to boost exposure for its ecosystem:

* Brawl AI Layer Partnership: Brawl AI Layer is an AI-powered Layer 3 offering advanced generative AI infrastructure and tools for building AI Agents and AI-powered dApps. Integrating W3S will enhance storage scalability and streamline data management on the platform.
* NVIDIA Partnership: AIOZ Network has been featured as the first DePIN project in the NVIDIA Accelerated Application Catalog.

Why institutional moves keep me bullish?,AllCryptoBets,1i1f6r7,2025-01-14 15:08:23,6,0.88,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllCryptoBets/comments/1i1f6r7/why_institutional_moves_keep_me_bullish/,stormingaround10,DISCUSSION,"Despite yesterday's dip within the crypto market, institutional adoption is surging. Intesa Sanpaolo became the first major Italian bank to purchase 11 BTC, signaling a bold move into digital assets. MicroStrategy bought 2,530 BTC for $243 million. Their total holdings now stand at 2,321 BTC, worth approximately $191.9 million. The growing interest among financial giants highlights increasing confidence in crypto’s long-term potential.

I’ve noticed many people sell during moments of fear, often at a loss. Personally, I will never understand this move, selling at a loss is by far the worst thing one can do. 

I have decided to stick to my DCA strategy. This week, my top picks were WILD and AIOZ.

* WILD: I didn't hesitate to grab it at $0.50.
* AIOZ: I started buying when it was $0.014 and still DCA into it. Its current price is around $0.80, with the potential to do 20x.

The development around AIOZ is particularly encouraging. The recent integration of Axlflops with AIOZ ensures that Axlflops users can quickly and reliably access the latest program files, enabling efficient use of its GPU computing network. Additionally, AIOZ Network has become the first DePIN company listed on the Nvidia Accelerated Applications Catalog.

These partnerships reflect long-term development and innovation. They will have an impact on the price over time.

What was your move this week? Have you increased your positions? Have you found any encouraging developments within the crypto space?"

What is DePIN?,DePIN_Pulse,1hy0eza,2025-01-10 04:05:48,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DePIN_Pulse/comments/1hy0eza/what_is_depin/,Strong-Leg-3531,,"An Introduction to Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks

# Introduction

If you’ve been following Web3 trends, you might have come across the term “DePIN,” short for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network. DePIN projects focus on building real-world infrastructure—like IoT networks, energy grids, and telecom towers—using decentralized blockchain principles. It’s about creating and managing physical systems collaboratively, without relying on centralized entities.

Why does this matter? DePIN changes how we finance, operate, and maintain critical infrastructure. By distributing control among participants, it makes systems cheaper, more accessible, and resilient.

# What is DePIN?

* **Decentralized:** Instead of being controlled by one company, infrastructure is operated by a network of independent participants.
* **Physical Infrastructure:** This includes real-world hardware like devices, networks, and utilities.
* **Network:** A system of nodes (people, machines, or organizations) working together via blockchain-based protocols.

# How does it connect to Web3?

* **Blockchain & Tokens:** Blockchain records ownership and transactions, while tokens incentivize participants to contribute resources like bandwidth or energy.
* **Smart Contracts:** Automated rules manage rewards and ensure trustless interactions.
* **Decentralization:** Instead of trusting a single entity, participants rely on the network’s code, reducing risks like a single point of failure.

DePIN brings decentralization into physical systems, offering efficient, transparent alternatives to traditional centralized models.

# Examples of DePIN Projects

https://preview.redd.it/wkumge8ut4ce1.jpg?width=2142&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d92ec205a87869dd028ce655fdebce3ede6a7f0

**AI and Computing**

* [Render Network](https://rendernetwork.com/): A decentralized network that provides GPU power for rendering tasks, used by AI and 3D artists. Contributors earn tokens by sharing unused computing power.
* [Golem](https://www.golem.network/): A global, decentralized marketplace for computing power. Participants can rent out unused CPU or GPU resources to run AI models, simulations, or other workloads.

**IoT Networks**

* [Helium](https://www.helium.com/): Participants install “Hotspots” to create a decentralized wireless network for IoT devices. In return, they earn tokens for providing coverage.

**Automotive Data**

* [DIMO](https://dimo.org/): Drivers connect their cars to a network, sharing driving data and earning tokens while gaining insights into their vehicles.

**Mapping**

* [Hivemapper](https://beemaps.com/): A global map built using footage from dashcams, with contributors earning tokens.

**Weather Monitoring**

* [WeatherXM](https://weatherxm.com/): A decentralized network where weather station owners share real-time data and earn tokens.

**Energy Grids**

* [Energy Web](https://www.energyweb.org/): Supports peer-to-peer energy trading and green energy solutions.

# Benefits of DePIN

* **Transparency:** All transactions are logged on a public, tamper-proof ledger.
* **Resilience:** No single point of failure—if one node goes down, others keep the system running.
* **Cost Savings:** Community-run infrastructure reduces operating costs.
* **Community Ownership:** Participants earn rewards and have a say in the network’s future.

# Challenges

* **Scalability:** Handling large volumes of real-world data is demanding.
* **Regulation:** Governments may resist decentralized models due to licensing and oversight issues.
* **Technical Complexity:** Setting up nodes or managing tokens can be difficult for new users.
* **Adoption:** Convincing businesses and communities to switch to decentralized models takes time and proven success stories.

# Conclusion

DePIN is bringing decentralization into the physical world, offering a new way to build and manage infrastructure. From IoT networks to AI computing to energy grids, it has the potential to make systems more efficient, resilient, and community-driven.

What do you think? Are DePINs the future of Web3, or just a passing trend? Let’s discuss in the comments!"

AIOZ is an underrated crypto gem fr,AltStreetBets,1hxfajp,2025-01-09 10:29:54,6,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AltStreetBets/comments/1hxfajp/aioz_is_an_underrated_crypto_gem_fr/,iamjide91,DD,"I've used the past couple of days to go indept on AIOZ (AI gem). And while everyone is talking about the near protocol, render, and graph, which I don't doubt to be great projects as well tho, AIOZ network deserves way more attention than it is getting right now IMO. 



I prolly should go over some things I've said in the past about the project, but its to bring to light what I'm trying to say for sure.



🔍 What is AIOZ Network?



Remember that AIOZ is a decentralized CDN and AI platform that uses the blockchain stream videos and also distribute AI workloads efficiently. Unlike web2 options like YouTube, AWS, and Netflix’s backend, AIOZ leverages thousands of individual nodes worldwide (these numbers are spedily running into 250K nodes soon enough), bringing efficiency at the same time reducing cost. 🎥⚡



Key Features:

✅ Decentralized CDN (Content Delivery Network)

✅ AI-powered video transcoding & streaming

✅ Edge computing & AI inference capabilities

✅ Tokenized rewards for node operators

✅ Potential for staking & passive income



💰 AIOZ as an Investment: Hidden Potential?



AIOZ currently boasts a market cap exceeding $1 billion and has seen significant price jumps in the past week. Early adopters are running nodes and getting rewarded in AIOZ tokens, with potential long-term value as adoption grows.



Many early node operators report earnings from transcoding and storage, though factors like bandwidth, hardware, and location impact rewards. Some have seen solid returns, while others are still testing profitability.



🔹 Early adoption advantage: Just like Bitcoin miners in the early days, the first nodes might be the most profitable before mass adoption kicks in.

🔹 Potential risks: High node count could reduce payouts per user, data costs need to be considered, and the AI-video market is still developing.

🔹 Speculative growth: If AIOZ becomes a mainstream decentralized video & AI platform, we could see explosive value increases.



🏗 Running an AIOZ Node: Worth It?



For those wondering how to set up and profit from an AIOZ node, here are some key takeaways from real users:



💡 Does it auto-run? Yes, once set up, the node operates automatically—no start button required.

💡 How much can you earn? Earnings vary based on bandwidth, storage, and computational power—some users have made 2 AIOZ in 2.5 days, while others report long-term fluctuations.

💡 Will bandwidth affect costs? If your ISP charges for excess data, you need to calculate whether node rewards outweigh additional internet fees.

💡 Is it too late to start? No! With around 200,000 nodes currently running, we’re still in the early adoption phase, meaning higher potential rewards before mass adoption slows earnings.



🔮 Future Predictions & Final Thoughts



AIOZ has serious potential if decentralized AI-powered video streaming and content delivery take off. Here’s where I see it going:

✅ Mass adoption = major price surges 🚀

✅ More partnerships = increased demand for nodes 🔗

✅ Early stakers & node operators could see major returns 💎

✅ Competition from centralized giants could pose challenges ⚠️



I'm kinda bullish on AIOZ, but I also understand the risk in it, especially at this point of the market cycle. Lemme know if you are running a node or investing, lemme know what your experience has been so far. If you think it's not a good option, let me know too.

Crypto Screener and Portfolio Tracker Spreadsheet,Hedera,1hvigtg,2025-01-06 22:40:13,9,0.8,1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hvigtg,Sebastian_DRS,Discussion,"I’ve spent an incredible amount of time working on this spreadsheet, and I’m excited to finally share it with you. It’s designed to make managing your crypto portfolio easier while giving you full control. The spreadsheet connects to the Coingecko API to automatically update historical price data in the transactions tab and pulls live prices, token icons, and supply details for the portfolio tab. It even auto-refreshes with triggers to keep your portfolio page up-to-date without you lifting a finger!

For transactions, everything is done manually—just input your trades, including liquidity pools, right into the sheet. I chose not to integrate wallets because I wanted to keep things simple and secure.

It’s easy to use—just make a copy, authorize it, and you’re all set! If you notice any bugs or something that doesn’t add up, let me know. One thing I’m still figuring out is how to get the graphs to show historical data when the numbers are spread across columns. The sparklines work fine, but I had to call them separately through the API. A heads-up: if you delete anything in the transactions tab, you’ll need to recopy the chart data lines for the graphs to work again.

The liquidity pools and NFT sections are flexible and functional, but they’re still a work in progress. You’ll need to manually input API details for NFTs based on your exchange, but I tried to make it as adaptable as possible.

Here’s how I use it: I run a React app in VS Code and embed the spreadsheet using an iframe. It’s displayed on a second monitor all day. The spreadsheet auto-refreshes four times daily (to avoid rate limits), and I use a browser extension to refresh my React app every 30 minutes. This setup lets me monitor all my assets in one place—nothing else I found does this as well.

I’m slowly turning this spreadsheet into a full application, but it’s a long process. I feel like most portfolio tools approach this backwards, rushing to integrate wallets before nailing the basics. I wanted to build something manual, flexible, and reliable first.

If you find this useful, I’d love your feedback. Whether it’s something you like or something that could be improved, let me know! This is my first major project, and I’m always looking to learn and improve.

Here’s a mini list of all the features :

Real-Time Price Updates: Automatically pulls live price data, token icons, and supply info from Coingecko—keeping everything fresh.

Track Transactions & Liquidity Pools: Easily record buys, sells, and liquidity pool actions, with historical price data for better tracking.

Customizable for Any Asset: Whether you’re tracking regular crypto, NFTs, or liquidity pools, it adapts to your needs.

Interactive Portfolio Dashboard: A sleek dashboard that shows your portfolio’s performance in real-time, with sparklines to track price movement over time.

Manual, No Wallet Integrations (Yet): Keep it simple with manual data entry—perfect for those who prefer full control over their data. Automation is on the way!

Simple to Use: No subscriptions or hidden fees—just make a copy and start tracking your investments today.

Historical Data Tracking: Track your portfolio's growth over time with accurate historical price data.

User-Friendly Setup: Easy to set up and start using, even for beginners—no advanced spreadsheet skills required.

Completely Flexible: Can handle multiple tokens, exchanges, and asset types, making it ideal for all crypto investors.

Despite this, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is still delivering a 117% appreciation in 2024.

While Bitcoin posted solid gains driven by factors such as the approval of spot ETFs and growing institutional adoption, other tokens achieved even more remarkable returns.

Narratives such as memecoins, exchange tokens, layer 1s, and DePIN assets were some of the projects that achieved percentage increases that far outpaced BTC's performance. Below is a list of the five cryptocurrencies that appreciated the most so far this year (YTD):

* **Baby (BABY)** : 1.318%
* **dogwifhat (WIF)**: 1.047%
* **Bitget Token (BGB)**: 895%
* **On (SUI)** : 404%

Four of these five cryptocurrencies also renewed their all-time highs in 2024. PEPE hit $0.00002803 on Dec. 9, WIF recorded $4.83 on Mar. 31, BGB hit $8.45 on Dec. 27, and SUI marked its all-time high price of $4.91 on Dec. 16.

# Cryptocurrencies that appreciated the most in 2024

It is important to note that none of these cryptocurrencies are part of the Top 10 (the 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization). The largest of them, in terms of market value, is PEPE, which occupies only the 25th position in the CoinGecko ranking.

If we consider the top 10 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins like USDT and USDC and the synthetic ETH), the one that delivered the largest annual appreciation (so far) is also a memecoin: **Dogecoin (DOGE)** with an annual increase of 250%. In second place is **XRP** with an increase of 233%. The following cryptocurrencies are:

* **Toncoin (TON)** : 145%
* **TRON (TRX)**: 138%
* **BNB (BNB)** : 125%
* **Bitcoin (BTC)**: 117%
* **Solana (SOL)** : 79.4%
* **Ethereum (ETH)**: 45,7%
* **Cardano (ADA)** : 39%

The only crypto asset in the Top 10 to record losses in 2024 (-12%) was **Avalanche (AVAX)**, according to data from the [Blockchain Center](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/en/) platform.

Bitcoin also hit its 2024 all-time high, reaching $108,135 on Dec. 17. Similarly, BNB hit its ATH of $788 on Dec. 4, SOL hit $263 on Nov. 23, TRON hit $0.43 on Dec. 4, and Toncoin hit its all-time high of $8.25 on Jun. 15.

Crypto Screener and Portfolio Tracker Spreadsheet,SHIBArmy,1hpk3dg,2024-12-30 05:04:45,12,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hpk3dg,Sebastian_DRS,🐕,"I’ve spent an incredible amount of time working on this spreadsheet, and I’m excited to finally share it with you. It’s designed to make managing your crypto portfolio easier while giving you full control. The spreadsheet connects to the Coingecko API to automatically update historical price data in the transactions tab and pulls live prices, token icons, and supply details for the portfolio tab. It even auto-refreshes with triggers to keep your portfolio page up-to-date without you lifting a finger!

For transactions, everything is done manually—just input your trades, including liquidity pools, right into the sheet. I chose not to integrate wallets because I wanted to keep things simple and secure.

It’s easy to use—just make a copy, authorize it, and you’re all set! If you notice any bugs or something that doesn’t add up, let me know. One thing I’m still figuring out is how to get the graphs to show historical data when the numbers are spread across columns. The sparklines work fine, but I had to call them separately through the API. A heads-up: if you delete anything in the transactions tab, you’ll need to recopy the chart data lines for the graphs to work again.

The liquidity pools and NFT sections are flexible and functional, but they’re still a work in progress. You’ll need to manually input API details for NFTs based on your exchange, but I tried to make it as adaptable as possible.

Here’s how I use it: I run a React app in VS Code and embed the spreadsheet using an iframe. It’s displayed on a second monitor all day. The spreadsheet auto-refreshes four times daily (to avoid rate limits), and I use a browser extension to refresh my React app every 30 minutes. This setup lets me monitor all my assets in one place—nothing else I found does this as well.

I’m slowly turning this spreadsheet into a full application, but it’s a long process. I feel like most portfolio tools approach this backwards, rushing to integrate wallets before nailing the basics. I wanted to build something manual, flexible, and reliable first.

If you find this useful, I’d love your feedback. Whether it’s something you like or something that could be improved, let me know! This is my first major project, and I’m always looking to learn and improve.

Here’s a mini list of all the features :

Real-Time Price Updates: Automatically pulls live price data, token icons, and supply info from Coingecko—keeping everything fresh.

Track Transactions & Liquidity Pools: Easily record buys, sells, and liquidity pool actions, with historical price data for better tracking.

Customizable for Any Asset: Whether you’re tracking regular crypto, NFTs, or liquidity pools, it adapts to your needs.

Interactive Portfolio Dashboard: A sleek dashboard that shows your portfolio’s performance in real-time, with sparklines to track price movement over time.

Manual, No Wallet Integrations (Yet): Keep it simple with manual data entry—perfect for those who prefer full control over their data. Automation is on the way!

Simple to Use: No subscriptions or hidden fees—just make a copy and start tracking your investments today.

Historical Data Tracking: Track your portfolio's growth over time with accurate historical price data.

User-Friendly Setup: Easy to set up and start using, even for beginners—no advanced spreadsheet skills required.

Completely Flexible: Can handle multiple tokens, exchanges, and asset types, making it ideal for all crypto investors.

$20k Worth of Crypto Stolen Overnight,CoinBase,1ho6iaa,2024-12-28 09:16:04,551,0.91,736,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/1ho6iaa/20k_worth_of_crypto_stolen_overnight/,FiatWinter,,"Wake up this morning and see an email from coinbase saying that $10k each of my AIOZ and IMX were transferred to some address. Figured there's no way that's possible and just a scam email because I have a 38 character coinbase password and google authenticator for 2fa, plus I never interact with phishing texts/emails etc. Also my cell phone sim card is trough efani which promotes themselves as never having one of their customers get sim swapped. So I login to coinbase and sure enough it's all gone lol. In account activity there haven't been any logins in the last 11 days, a few second factor failure attempts from Brazil and random cities in USA but not showing any successful logins. Have been dabbling in crypto since 2016 and never had anything stolen because I usually keep coins on my trezor. Seems impossibe to get any questions answered by coinbase because it's just a bot that keeps regurgitating bs talking points. Not sure what to do at this point other than to feel dumb for leaving coins on there lol. Here is the address of the wallet my tokens were sent to 0x046f9CD170F5C087244139836BE93923Aa655FC6

Update - DM'd back and forth on X with coinbase support and eventually was given a case number. Then support emailed me with a list of things to look into while my account is locked. I messaged them back saying I did everything on that list. I tried logging back into my account and it had me upload my driver's license and record a short video turning my head to the right and saying the 3 digits that were on my cell phone screen for verification. Now they are doing a manual review of my ID.

Update 12/29 8am - Coinbase gave me back access to my account but said nothing about my stolen funds. Email just saying generic things like to change password again and update my 2fa settings. I have been in contact with blockchainunmasked about what I should do to pursue this further. Not expecting to ever be made whole again but by reporting this case to authorities maybe the fbi or some agency can dig into what happened to me and others and crack down on who is doing this and prevent someone else from losing their assets."

Yeah, BTC’s hitting crazy highs, but if you’re ignoring AI projects and DePINs , you’re probably sleeping on some big opportunities. Here’s where my focus is this year:

Ocean Protocol

First up, Ocean Protocol. If you’re into the whole ""own your data"" , this one’s worth a look. Ocean’s like a decentralized data marketplace where people can buy and sell data without actually giving it up. They use this tech called Compute-to-Data, which lets AI models run on your data without it ever leaving your control. It’s a game-changer for privacy.

What’s cool is they’re pushing into AI too. Their Predictoor platform lets users make AI-driven predictions on crypto price movements (BTC, ETH, etc.) and get rewarded. Also, Ocean is rolling out 25k+ nodes that enable private, secure AI training. They’re even working with the ASI Alliance to integrate with other projects like Injective, which is huge for decentralized AI.

Their Tokenized Intelligence Hackathon is live, $130k in prizes for devs to build cool stuff using their tools. If you’re into data or AI, this is one project that’s not messing around.

Here are some others I’m holding alongside Ocean:

>Focused on decentralized streaming, Web3 storage, and AI computing. They’re built on Cosmos, compatible with EVM, and they’ve got a decentralized marketplace for AI/DePIN assets. Feels like a long-term hold for me.

>

>TAO Protocol

>This one’s super unique with their Proof of Intelligence mechanism. It’s a decentralized marketplace where anyone can create subnets for AI tasks. Definitely has potential if the whole decentralized AI thing blows up.

>

>Render (RNDR)

>A GPU rendering network for creatives and AI developers. It’s making expensive GPU computing way more accessible.

>

>SingularityNET (AGIX)

>They’re creating an open marketplace for AI algorithms. Think of it as a way for AI devs to monetize their work while keeping it decentralized.

So yeah, I’m still bagging BTC, but projects like Ocean Protocol and AIOZ are where I’m looking for the next big gains. The tech is real, the use cases are clear, and the upside is massive.

What about you guys? Are you bullish on these narratives or sticking to the safer plays? Let me know, always curious about what others are holding!"

"Wilder World: The Metaverse powered by AI and unreal engine 5 
",AllCryptoBets,1hgk65f,2024-12-17 15:36:21,3,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllCryptoBets/comments/1hgk65f/wilder_world_the_metaverse_powered_by_ai_and/,stormingaround10,DISCUSSION,"I’m a big believer in AI projects – I’ve been following AI tokens like AIOZ, OCEAN, and FET for a while now. But recently, I found out about the Metaverse project that includes AI features.

Wilder World is building a photorealistic multiplayer Metaverse powered by Unreal Engine 5. The main lack of Metaverse projects is that they are static, but Wilder World is designed to be dynamic and alive with AI-powered NPCs. These characters will interact, learn, and evolve, making the world feel like a living city. WW Wiami is a city inspired by Miami but with a futuristic twist. I like the idea of building a city that supports gaming, digital real estate, and NFT integrations, all tied together by decentralized systems.

As someone focused on the utility of AI, it is good to see changes and fusion with Metaverse. Wilder World has the potential to solve the biggest Metaverse problem: stagnation. By integrating AI, Wilder World offers a virtual universe that’s constantly evolving and alive with intelligent NPCs and systems. This is the kind of innovation that could bring Metaverse to the next level.

Do you think AI is the missing piece to bring the Metaverse to life? Would love to hear thoughts on Wilder World or other projects connecting these two spaces!"
Cool AI Projects That Are Changing the Game😍,CryptoMoonShots,1hg6all,2024-12-17 03:31:13,3,0.81,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1hg6all/cool_ai_projects_that_are_changing_the_game/,iamjide91,Utility :wrench:,"If you're into AI and love how it makes life easier, you've gotta check out these awesome projects in the web3 space. 



They're not just buzzwords; they're doing some real magic with AI and blockchain!



When it comes to Render Network, imagine you're an artist or a 3D animator needing some serious computing muscle. Render Network is like your magic wand, giving you access to high-powered GPUs. It's not all AI yet, but it's setting up the stage for when AI can make your renderings look even more epic. Plus, blockchain keeps everything safe and transparent when you're making those payments.



Ever wished for a little helper that could fetch just the right data for you? That's Fetch.ai! It's not about building AI models from scratch but about getting the info AI needs, fast! It's like having a smart agent that works around the clock, making AI applications smarter by pulling in all the latest data.



BitTensor might sound like a brain teaser, but it's actually a playground for AI lovers. It's like a big marketplace where you can rent brainpower (computing power) for any AI project you can think of. They let you create these cool little spaces called ""subnets"" where everyone can collaborate on AI stuff, potentially changing how we see AI development. Cool, right?



Now, AIOZ is where it gets really exciting, especially if you're into gaming. They've got this marketplace where AI isn't just a concept; it's happening! Developers can share, sell, and work on AI models with privacy in check, thanks to fancy encryption. And for gamers, AIOZ's W3IPFS means your game data is safe, accessible, and free from censorship. With a vibrant community and big-name partners like NVIDIA, AIOZ is like the cool kid on the block everyone wants to hang out with.



We're really moving into an era where AI isn't just a tool; it's becoming part of our daily magic. These projects are paving the way for that future. Let's keep an eye on them and see how they transform our world!"

but first let me clear things up

this is not a financial advise, im not a financial advisor, and even if i was i would still say the same things

cryptocurrencies are extremely risky - expect to lose all your money!

1st in the list is aioz network

https://preview.redd.it/h0h73jb6k77e1.png?width=3450&format=png&auto=webp&s=a49d36cedb7b0f282bc1cfeae310f9481782f804

chainswap offers security and interoperability between networks this coin has a very strong support at 0.55 cents and has bounced back hard every time it touched the support line

3rd is qubic,

https://preview.redd.it/spl2y0i7k77e1.png?width=3448&format=png&auto=webp&s=62463b8717108743614963754cdecbcc998dea42

qubic is a proof of work AGI crypto offering feeles,fast and secure transactions

4th is Zano,

zano is privacy centric blockchain ecosystem that was launched in 2019, it supports on chain alliases, escrow contracts and has a built in staking system with no minimum requirements or time locks, transactions are untraceable and anonymous

5th is altlayer

https://preview.redd.it/seqk8k39k77e1.png?width=3456&format=png&auto=webp&s=23a9f0b9935363239f9c5fc67ad9ed4fb8795dbe

an opensource dencetralized protocol for rollups (Rollup as a service ( RAAS)), such as polygon, arbitrum, zk etc.

Meaning it can enchance the security, interoperability, decentralization and overall functionality of the networks.

These are some of my best picks for massive gains in this bullrun.

Mining AIOZ by providing some disk space is really easy. I installed AIOZ Node 4.0.4 exactly one week ago and set my maximum storage to 650 GB. My location is Germany an my download/upload speed is 60/25 Mbps. This is my experience after 7 days:

Day 1 (Friday, 8 hours online): the first little reward of 0.031 AIOZ popped up 15 min after the initialization. 38.45 GB of storage were built up quickly during the day. AIOZ rewards grew to 0.282, only via Transcoding.

Day 2 (Saturday, 11 hours online): storage increased by only 2 GB while rewards (only Transcoding) were constantly rising to 0.626 AIOZ. The rewards number updates itself every 15-60 minutes by the way.

Day 3 (Sunday, 7 hours online): nothing happened at all

Day 4 (Monday, 4 hours online): Storage went slightly up to 40.71 GB but rewards didn't increase.

Day 5 (Tuesday, 4 hours online): nothing happened at all

Day 6 (Wednesday, 4 hours online): storage went slightly up to 41.22 GB and rewards (Transcoding) went up to 0.767 AIOZ.

Day 7 (Thursday, 3 hours online): storage went slightly up to 42.08 GB but rewards didn't increase.

Summary: One week of mining with AIOZ node brought me 0.767 AIOZ which is currently 0.84 USD. I mean, running AIOZ node on my PC didn't affect my computing performance at all and my PC was running anyway which means no extra energy costs. But one week ago i told myself AIOZ mining is worth above 1 USD per day. I'm far away from that to be honest. However, i was only earning AIOZ by Transcoding and maybe Storage, Delivery and AI will follow soon. I will keep you updated. What's your experience?

This is the screenshot after 1 week (CW50):

Update after 6 weeks (CW4/2025): On average i receive **0.141 AIOZ/day** or **0.024 AOIZ/hour**.

NVIDIA's involvement extends to supporting AI, machine learning, and distributed ledger technologies. Through summits and collaborations, NVIDIA plays a key role in advancing innovation in both blockchain and AI ecosystems.

I recently came across a few projects that have collaborated with NVIDIA, so I took a peek at what they're doing. 

NVIDIA supplies AIOZ Network with the necessary computational resources for AI modeling, data analysis, and other tasks, supporting the growth and development of AIOZ's decentralized solutions.

Humans AI unveiled H1uman at the Summit in Mumbai. As the world’s first decentralized AI worker, it will empower nations with sovereign AI solutions tailored to their unique needs, in collaboration with NVIDIA ofc.

Did you find any interesting partnerships with global brand involvement? Could it boost adoption?
