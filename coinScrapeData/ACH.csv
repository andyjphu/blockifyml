"As a serial procrastinator, it was surprisingly easy to turn life around",u_FrumpyScrumpy,1i9wjkf,2025-01-25 15:44:10,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_FrumpyScrumpy/comments/1i9wjkf/as_a_serial_procrastinator_it_was_surprisingly/,FrumpyScrumpy,,"I have always been a procrastinator to an extent. The habit probably started with academics, where I would need only 1-2 days to study for exams, leading to a habit of 'optimizing' time spent for studying, and gradually, all tasks.

As with all academics, it eventually got tougher and massive amounts of stress during college entrance prep led to burnout and a procrastinating habit. 

Now, after nearly 9 depressing years, I think I am starting to beat the procrastinating habit. 

For a habit that changed the trajectory of my career and life, it was surprisingly easy to break out of it. Of course, the universe came together to manufacture the set of circumstances I needed to give me a push, but the 'mental resistance' that you fear as a procrastinator was surprisingly less!

I have no clue what is the most precise way to beat procrastination, but I'll just yap about my journey in hopes of extracting information. 

For the first time in my life after I turned 14, I have reduced my levels of stress to a manageable levels.

First it was the college entrance exams, for which the amount of stress was unimaginable (and which I believe irrevocably alterred my brain chemistry), next was college with the constant pressure of academics, loneliness, job hunt and Covid. After failing to get into my dream college, I just retreated in my shell. Stopped connecting with people. Stopped studying like I used to, instead just cramming something for exams without understanding it and somehow getting by. I spent the majority of my college life (before Covid hit) watching movies or sitcoms on my laptop. I got into a relationship at the end of college, but that didn't last. Made only one friend with whom I stay in touch with.

After college, I landed a pretty decent internship. But even in the internship, my problems with socialising and worries about getting a return offer or a job through campus placements was sufficiently high. High enough that most of my internship is a haze. I cannot remember events which I was a part of, because I was too locked in my head, in my thoughts to pay attention to what was happening around me.

Things got so bad that I got the news that I had high cholesterol in my very first full body checkup at 24.

But funnily enough, that cholesterol report was one of two triggers that led to improvements in my life. The second was.... a girl!

Nope, she's not my girlfriend. She occupies a special place in my heart, so if she were to ask me out, I'd probably say yes. But I don't believe myself to be capable of handling a relationship just yet, so I never flirted or spoke with her with intentions of asking her out. I probably never will think of her in that way. But I am thankful to her.

We met on Reddit, actually. I had made a comment about being a grammar nazi, and she DMed me, asking to be friends. Slow, probing DMs turned into lenghty DMs about each other's lives which turned to phone calls and then turned into a meetup which itself featured the craziest adventure that I have ever had in my life, and our friendship was cemented. She has moved out of the country but we still talk almost everyday.

But enough about the journey, and moving on to how these two things helped me. In the chronological order.

The girl was a paragon of good habits. Waking up at 6, sleeping at 10. Not drinking or smoking. Gymming or swimming everyday. Spending time in her hobbies, all of which were productive. I admit, I may be putting her on a pedestal here, but she was just that good initially. 

You are the sum of the people you meet. And with such a industrious person who I had the privilege of counting among my friends, I started to wake up early. I don't know how this happened, but it did. She would say good night at 10, and I would log off my phone at 11. She would say good morning at 6, and I would feel guilty about leaving her hanging so I started to wake up early too!

And eventually I settled into a comfortable routine of waking up at 8, and sleeping at 12. I don't think people realize just how crucial sleep is to our emotional and physical wellbeing. Having been on both sides of the wall, I believe sleep is the most important 'nutrient' by far today. Nothing even comes close. Hunger may give you stomach ache, but a person can survive for upto 30 days without food. But go 3 days without sleep, and you are already on the verge of shutting down.

Anyways, meeting her got me into the habit of waking up early, and consequently sleeping early. Not wasting time on the internet till 6 am, which I used to do on a regular basis. 

The second was the cholesterol report. This was 2 months after meeting her. Work had been kicking my ass, and shooting my stress levels high. My full body checkup was scheduled after a particularly harrowing week. I had worked for 18 hours for 8 days straight excluding the commuting time, often sleeping for 3 hours or less. Now, I have to mention that my work should NOT require this much efforts. I'll talk more about this later, but this situation was unnecessary and avoidable.

This report made me realise that unless I exercised regularly, I would end up dead of heart attack by 32. I am not joking, but I had noticed my chest tightening uncomfortably sometimes. I started going to the gym in the morning, and incorporated night walks in my routine. The desperate will to live is a strong motivator. Stronger than the depressed me from college would have thought.

Basically, the waking up early and exercising is working wonders for me. Such a simple piece of wisdom, and such a long journey to obtain it. I find it mildly amusing, to tell you the truth.

My body is better than ever. My chest doesn't feel tight anymore. I sleep better. Every day is 'fresher'. This won't mean anything to someone who hasn't experienced burnout, but to someone who has... you'll know what I mean. Work is better. My hard work last year got me promoted with a huge hike in salary. There is no Damoclean Sword hanging over my head, so stress levels are the lowest they've been since my life got derailed.

Where I wasted 9 months of college exam prep time because of procrastination, I am slowly getting the hang of getting things done.

It is a wonderful thing. To do what you want to do when you want to do it. To not worry about the sheer length of the work to be done, only to put it off for later and watch it as it slowly grows humongous. To not panic about work at the last moment, the last minute or the last day.

Shopping for clothes. Talking to old friends. Going on a vacation. So many things that I've been meaning to do since so long, procrastinating as always. All happening in the next two months. 

I have come out from a long, long limbo. I hope my life continues moving into the light."
Paying rent via PayPal - can I use a linked card? (and get sign up bonuses),biltrewards,1i9w6wq,2025-01-25 15:28:23,0,0.5,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/biltrewards/comments/1i9w6wq/paying_rent_via_paypal_can_i_use_a_linked_card/,relbatnrut,,"I am considering applying for the Bilt card, but I have a couple questions I'm hoping this subreddit might be able to answer. 

I pay my rent via Friends and Family payments on PayPal. Ideally, I would like to use my rent payments to meet sign up bonus (SUB) spending requirements for other, non-Bilt credit cards. Unfortunately, most cards count such payments as cash advances and they don't count towards SUB spending. Rent is my largest expense so I'd like to use it to get SUBs.

I know that you can link other cards in Bilt and use them via ACH. Can I use the ACH account to pay rent via PayPal F&F with one of the linked cards as the spending source? I know I would incur a 3% fee but that would be easily outweighed by the SUB."

I’m curious how many people would be interested in paying their fees via credit card or some sort of buy now, pay later method. 

In my experience producing and writing songs, 90% of my payments are via ACH with the remaining 10% being PayPal for smaller transactions. 

How many of you would prefer to use the mentioned payment methods?"

Proving Jennifer Soto is guilty of neglect and culpable negligence.,jennsoto,1i9t6kv,2025-01-25 13:17:11,6,0.88,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/jennsoto/comments/1i9t6kv/proving_jennifer_soto_is_guilty_of_neglect_and/,Impossible-Spray-643,,"What else can we add?



Proving neglect and culpable negligence:

Jennifer Soto willfully and by culpable negligence failed or omitted to provide Madeline Soto with the care, supervision, and services necessary to maintain Madeline Soto’s physical and mental health.

AND 

Jennifer Soto willfully and by culpable negligence failed to make a reasonable effort to protect Madeleine Soto from the foreseeable and actual abuse and exploitation by another person (Stephan Sterns). 

In so doing, Jennifer Soto ultimately contributed to causing great bodily harm and death to Madeline Soto. 

As Madeline Soto’s biological mother and custodial parent, Jennifer Soto met the definition of caregiver for Madeline Soto under Florida law. Further, as Madeline Soto’s custodial parent, Jennifer Soto was Madeline Soto’s primary caregiver and, because the biological father lived in another state, Jennifer Soto was effectively Madeline Soto’s only parental caregiver.

Madeline Soto was under the age of 18 years at the times she was sexually abused by Stephan Sterns (ages 8 to 13), and was under the age of 18 when she was murdered  (age 13) by Stephan Sterns, Jennifer Soto’s on again off again boyfriend.

Jennifer Soto committed neglect of Madeleine Soto based on repeated conduct in which she: 1) allowed Madeline Soto to sleep in the same bed between her and Stephan Sterns; and 2)  directed Madeline Soto to sleep alone in a separate bedroom with Stephan Sterns (an unrelated adult male) in a room with a small bed and two interior locks on the door; and 3) allowed Stephan Sterns to “snuggle or cuddle” in bed with Madeline Soto, often wearing only boxer shorts ; and 4) Allowed Stephan Sterns to assist Madeline Soto  with bathing and dressing - acts that resulted in, and reasonably could have been expected to result in, serious physical or mental injury to a child.

By doing so, Jennifer Soto failed to provide Madeline Soto with the supervision and care that a prudent person would consider essential for the well-being of a child; and further failed to make any reasonable effort to protect Madeline Soto from foreseeable abuse and exploitation by Stephan Sterns.

Jennifer Soto committed culpable negligence by consciously instructing Madeline Soto to sleep alone in a separate locked bedroom with Stephan Sterns, thus following a course of conduct that Jennifer Soto knew, or reasonably should have known, was likely to result in great bodily harm to Madeline Soto. 

“[C]ulpable negligence [means] more than a failure to use ordinary care.... [I]t must be gross and flagrant [and] committed with an utter disregard for the safety of others.” Burns v. State , 132 So.3d 1238, 1240 (Fla. 1st DCA 2014). It is “consciously doing an act or following a course of conduct that the defendant must have known, or reasonably should have known, was likely to cause death or great bodily harm.” Kish v. State , 145 So.3d 225, 228 (Fla. 1st DCA 2014) (quoting Fla. Std. Jury Instr. (Crim.) 16.6). 

In child neglect cases, a caregiver’s “degree of care, neglect, indifference, or callous disregard” is measured against societal norms and expectations under the circumstances. By repeatedly instructing her daughter to sleep alone in a separate locked bedroom with Stephan Sterns, Jennifer Soto was indifferent to and callously disregarded societal norms and expectations, which unquestionably do not support instructing your 8-13 year old daughter to sleep alone in a locked bedroom with an unrelated adult male.

Further, Jennifer Soto did so when she was also home and sleeping in another bedroom in the same home. The home had four actual bedrooms and a makeshift bedroom, with two of those bedrooms and the makeshift bedroom available for Madeleine Soto to sleep either with her mother (Defendant Jennifer Soto) or alone in her own bed. There was zero justification for the defendant to instruct her daughter to sleep with Stephan Sterns. 

There was also both direct and circumstantial evidence that Jennifer Soto knew or should have known the risk that doing so presented to her daughter, victim Madeleine Soto.

1. Both of Jennifer Soto’s roommates, Nathalie Rosero and Angelica Negro, had expressed concern over Madeline Soto being alone in Stephan Stern’s room with the door closed. Jennifer Soto dismissed these concerns. Further, at least two female roommates had felt uncomfortable enough with Stephan Sterns that they refused to share a bathroom with him, a fact that Jennifer Soto was well aware of.

2. Stephan Stern’s mother, Debra Sterns, had also expressed concerns regarding allowing Madeline Soto to sleep in the same bed with Jennifer Soto and Stephan Sterns, concerns which Jennifer Soto also dismissed.

3. Jennifer Soto’s own family disliked Stephan Sterns and did not want him in the home (and further did not allow him to attend family functions or allow him into their homes). Despite this, Jenn Soto continued to allow Stephan Soto to live in and/or regularly visit for days or weeks at a time, and even went to the extent of misleading her family about Stephan Stern’s presence in the home. 

4. Madeline Soto’s school counselor, Madison Brady, expressed concerns over Madeline’s home life and emotional and mental health, concerns which Jennifer Soto also dismissed. One of those concerns was that Madeline had advised Ms. Brady that Stephan made her uncomfortable by “hanging out in the living room”. Notably, the living room is where Madeline Soto’s makeshift bedroom was. 

5. Jennifer Soto admitted that she was aware that Stephan Sterns had previously dated a 14 to 15 year-old when he was aged 19-21. Such knowledge would likely have concerned a reasonable and/or prudent parent of a teenage daughter.

6. Jennifer Soto was aware and present when Stephan Sterns regularly emerged from the bathroom attached to her bedroom,  nude, in front of both Jennifer Soto and her young daughter, Madeline Soto.  A reasonable and prudent parent would have been alarmed by this, and not allowed it to continue. 

7. Jennifer Soto admitted to witnessing Stephan Sterns “cuddle” with Madeline Soto at night, stating that Madeline  would sleep in the “nook” of Stephan Stern’s arm. She further admitted that Stephan Sterns did not own  pajamas, so often wore only boxer shorts when doing so. Any adult knows that boxer shorts do not secure or contain male genitalia. A reasonable and prudent parent would have been alarmed by this, and not allowed it to continue. 

8. Jennifer Soto witnessed Madeline Soto’s underwear and Stephan Stern’s boxer shorts discarded in a dirty laundry basket in Madeline Soto’s makeshift bedroom, indicating that both Sterns and Madeline Soto undressed in Madeline Soto’s bedroom. Finding their boyfriend’s dirty underwear in their young daughter’s bedroom would have alarmed any reasonable or prudent parent.

9. Jennifer Soto admitted to being aware that Stephan Sterns had  previously given too much prescription medication used for sedation to Madeline Soto, and that Stephan Sterns may have given Madeline Soto THC capsules prescribed to Jennifer Soto, yet still allowed him to have unsupervised access to Madeline, including “assisting” Madeline with “nighttime routines,” which included  administering medications. A prudent parent, after discovering a caregiver had overdosed their child and/or given them THC capsules, would not have allowed that party to handle the child’s medications again, least of all administer them to their child.

10. On one of those occasions, when Jennifer Soto reported that Madeline was non-responsive and that she was unable to awaken her in the morning, Jennifer Soto failed to seek appropriate medical care and instead allegedly called poison control. A prudent parent or caregiver, finding their child unresponsive and being told that they had been given too much of a sedating medication, would have called 911 or taken their child to the emergency room. 

11. Jennifer Soto was aware that Madeline Soto had suffered from constipation, rectal pain, rectal bleeding, and possible anal tears, but failed to seek or obtain appropriate medical care, and instead chose to administer an over the counter constipation medication, Miralax.

12. Jennifer Soto admitted to placing Stephan Sterns, an unrelated adult male with no children,  in charge of Madeline Soto’s “nighttime routines,” which included taking sedating medication, undressing, showering, and going to bed. A reasonable and prudent parent would not have allowed an unrelated adult male to “assist” their 8 to 13-year-old daughter with dressing and bathing.

13. Jennifer Soto admitted to allowing Madeline Soto to sleep in Jennifer’s bed  with Jennifer and Stephan Sterns, inexplicably placing Madeline in the middle (between Jennifer and Stephan).  A reasonable and prudent parent would not allow their young daughter to sleep in bed with an unrelated adult male, least of all be placed in the middle between the mother and the mother’s boyfriend.

14. Jennifer Soto also admitted to instructing Madeline Soto to go upstairs to a bedroom known as “Room Number Four” to sleep alone with Stephan Sterns. Notably, that room had two interior locks on the door, a small bed, and sometimes contained a loaded and unsecured 9mm firearm, which was completely accessible to Madeline Soto.

15. Further, Jennifer Soto admitted to knowing that allowing her daughter to sleep alone with Stephan Sterns was inappropriate, and admitted that she did so anyway, “for her own selfish reasons.”

16. Per Jennifer Soto, Stephan Sterns moved from Jennifer’s bedroom to Room Number Four in June of 2023.

17. During the same month, on June 16, 2023, Jennifer Soto texted Stephan Sterns, stating, “Maddie is no longer sleeping with me, I can’t risk it.”  Jennifer Soto later claimed to not remember said  text and further claimed to have no idea why she sent said text or what it meant. This text indicates that Jennifer Soto may have been aware of the sexual abuse. 

18. Jennifer Soto bizarrely stated to law enforcement ““If anything I’ve always told him [Stephan Sterns] my biggest fear was that this would turn into a Woody Allen situation where the stepdaughter falls…[Jen corrects herself] uh, the dad grooms the child and the child then turns 18 and ends up running away with him. I told him that was my biggest fear and I don't ever want that happening, like, you can't do that to me!"", effectively admitting to being aware of an inappropriate relationship between Stephan  Sterns and her young daughter, and even admitting to disapproving of such relationship - yet doing nothing to protect her daughter.

19. Jennifer Soto also took actions which demonstrated that she was well aware of the risks of sexual abuse to female children, including but not limited to sending Madeline Soto’s biological father, Tyler Wallace, the following text on June 16, 2023: “ I hope nobody touches her or tries shit or films her under the door,” as well as allegedly having a discussion with both Stephan Sterns and Madeline Soto about online safety and sexual predators, when Madeleine Soto was ten-years-old, after it was alleged that an older child online had asked Madeline Soto to send nude photos of herself. 

20. Further, Jennifer Soto was provided with materials discussing sexual abuse and ways to help prevent  the same and ensure your child’s safety by Madeline Soto’s school. This occurred annually, beginning in 5th grade, when Madeline Soto was ten-years-old.

21. Jennifer Soto admitted to doing the family’s laundry and taking out the trash, thus would have seen any evidence of sexual abuse, including but not limited to bodily fluids and/or blood/blood stains on clothing, sheets or towels. She also might have seen discarded condom wrappers, used condoms, soiled tissues, or other evidence of sexual activity or abuse in the home.

22. In school notebooks, which Jennifer Soto had access to, Madeline Soto drew explicit drawings depicting oral sex. Further, Jennifer Soto actually wrote an entry in one of Madeline Soto’s notebooks, proving that she had access to and indeed did access said notebooks.

23. Jennifer Soto was aware that Stephan Sterns exhibited almost textbook signs of pedophelia, including but not limited to: 

* Stephan Sterns sought out a relationship with Jennifer Soto after discovering that she was the single parent of a young daughter.

* Stephan Sterns sought out an inappropriate “friendship” with Madeline Soto, a then vulnerable 8-year-old child.

* Stephan Sterns was possessive of Madeline Soto, erroneously claiming to be her “stepfather” and appearing to be jealous of Madeline Soto’s crush on an age appropriate peer.

* Stephan Sterns had a known history of dating a minor while he was of adult age.

* Stephan Sterns was known to view pornography, including CSAM, and had requested that other romantic partners dress as “little girls” and/or call him “daddy”. He had also requested that another partner lay face down on the bed and remain silent during sex. It is likely that, over a period of seven years, Stephan Sterns would have revealed the same sexual fetishes to Jennifer Soto. If he did so, a reasonable and prudent parent would be cautious of allowing him unsupervised access to her young daughter.

* Stephan Sterns showed an unusual and continuous interest in toys , games, and other children’s activities, including playing games, painting small figurines, and collecting toys.

* Stephan Sterns preferred to spend time as if he were a child and with children, rather than choosing activities for adults or spending time with adults.

* Stephan Sterns had a history of mental illness.

* Stephan Sterns had a history of sporadic employment, termination, and long periods of unemployment.

* Stephan Sterns called, texted, and contacted Madeline Soto regularly and sometimes constantly, via various social media, communicating with her both privately and excessively.

* Stephan Sterns appeared to spend more time with and pay more attention to Madeline Soto than with Jennifer Soto.

* Stephan Sterns insisted on “looking after” Madeline Soto, and “babysat” Madeline Soto for free, even when Jennifer Soto was home, and even after Madeline Soto reached an age where she did not need a “babysitter.”

* Stephan Sterns made efforts to be alone with Madeline Soto, including playing games with her in his room (with the door closed) and sleeping alone with her in his bedroom or in Madeline Soto’s makeshift bedroom. 

* Stephan Sterns groomed Madeline Soto by engaging in children’s activities with her, lavishing attention upon her, and giving her gifts.

* Stephan Sterns criticized Jenn Soto’s approach to parenting to Madeline Soto, in an effort to gain Madeline Soto’s trust and to pit mother and daughter against each other.

* Stephan Sterns ignored Madeline Soto’s boundaries, gave Madeline Soto little to no privacy, and made Madeline Soto uncomfortable.

* Stephan Sterns appeared to know too much about Madeline Soto, including things it would not be normal for a mother’s boyfriend to know about the daughter (such as her exact weight, location of moles or beauty marks, and the timing of menstrual cycles). 

* Stephan Sterns showed too much interest in the sexuality of Madeline Soto, including discussing her development, periods, and crushes.

* Stephan Sterns “accidentally” walked into Jennifer Soto’s bedroom nude while Madeline Soto was present, and would “accidentally” walk in on Madeleine Soto when she was in the bathroom, showering, or changing.

* Stephan Sterns advised others (including law enforcement) that Madeleine Soto “needed human contact” and could not sleep without “snuggling” with him.

* Stephan Sterns “cuddled” with Madeline Soto while sleeping with both Jennifer Soto and Madeline Soto.

* Stephan Sterns continued to sleep with both Jennifer Soto and Madeline Soto or alone with Madeline Soto even after “breaking up” with Jenn Soto, while dating and having sexual relations other women, and after allegedly “moving out” of Jenn Soto’s home.

24. Jennifer Soto was aware that Madeline Soto was exhibiting almost textbook signs of sexual abuse, including but not limited to: 

* 		Painful urination or bowel movements.

* Abdominal, pelvic, rectal, or vaginal pain.

* 		Vaginal or rectal bleeding.

* 		Exhibiting adult-like sexual knowledge, behavior or language.

* 		Having nightmares or trouble sleeping.

* 		Depression or withdrawal.

* 		Crying.

* 		Sudden changes in school performance (plummeting grades, skipping school).

* 		Sudden shyness or avoiding dressing/undressing in front of others (such as for PE classes).

* Running away from home or planning/threatening to run away from home.

* 		Sudden or frequent mood changes, emotional lability.

* Expressing discomfort with an adult in their life.

* Daytime sleepiness.

* Being quieter or more distant than usual. 

* Being clingier than usual.

* Unusual or new fears, sometimes around touch, being alone, being with a particular person or in a particular places.

* Difficulty concentrating or with memory, zoning out, seeming distracted or not listening.

* Eating, sleeping or hygiene changes.

* Sexual themes in artwork, stories, play etc.

* ‘Acting out’ behaviours (aggression, destructive behaviours, truanting behaviour).

* ‘Acting in’ behaviours (withdrawal from friends and family, depression).

* Problems with friends and schoolwork/attendance.

* Vague symptoms of illness such as headache or tummy ache.

* Asking vague questions or making vague statements about topics such as secrets, unusual ‘games’, or adult behaviors.

25. Despite the above knowledge, acts, and omissions, Jennifer Soto took NO ACTION to protect her daughter, Madeline Soto, from the foreseeable and actual sexual abuse and exploitation from Stephan Sterns.

26. Jennifer Soto’s knowledge of Madeline Soto’s medical and emotional/mental health conditions and failure to seek or obtain appropriate medical attention for Madeline constitutes sufficient evidence from which a jury could properly infer that her inaction was “knowing and intentional, or done with such wanton or careless indifference to Madeline Soto’s well-being as to be practically intentional.” Arnold v. State , 755 So.2d 796, 799 (Fla. 2d DCA 2000). 

27. Further, Jennifer Soto’s knowledge of all of the above and below, including Jennifer Soto’s own acts and omissions, and her failure to take any action to protect Madeline Soto from foreseeable and/or known abuse or exploitation by Stephan Sterns constitutes sufficient evidence from which a jury could properly infer that her actions and inactions were “knowing and intentional, or done with such wanton or careless indifference to Madeline Soto’s well-being as to be practically intentional.” Arnold v. State , 755 So.2d 796, 799 (Fla. 2d DCA 2000).

28. Jennifer Soto admitted that, on or about February 25th, 2024, Stephan Sterns had an unsecured and loaded semi automatic 9mm handgun and ammunition in Room Number Four.

29. On or about February 25th, 2024, despite her knowledge of the unsecured firearm and all of the above, Jennifer Soto instructed Madeline Soto to go upstairs to sleep alone with Stephan Sterns in Room Number Four.

30. On or about February 25th, 2024, Jennifer Soto specifically instructed Madeline Soto to go upstairs to Room Number Four to sleep alone with Stephan Sterns. Stephan Sterns then sexually assaulted and murdered Madeline Soto.

31. On or about February 27th, 2024, law enforcement discovered photographs and video on Stephan Stern’s cell phone depicting the sexual abuse and rape of Madeline Soto, including approximately 1700 images or video taken over a five year period between June 2019 and December 2023, when Madeline Soto would have been aged eight to twelve. 

32. All of the abuse depicted appeared to have been committed in Jennifer Soto’s home, in either Jennifer Soto’s bedroom, Madeline Soto’s makeshift bedroom, or in Room Number Four, and at times when Jennifer Soto was also present in the home. Jennifer Soto did not work during this time, thus was present in the home almost 24-7.

33. Again, the abuse depicted appeared to have been committed while Jennifer Soto was also in the home. 

34. After being shown some of these photos (photos clearly depicting Stephan Stern’s sexual abuse and rape of her daughter), as well as being advised that her daughter was likely deceased (and being shown photos of her daughter’s body in the passenger seat of Stephan Stern’s vehicle), Jennifer Soto responded by:  

* Immediately seeking an attorney for Stephan Sterns. 

* Implying that the sexual abuse had not hurt Madeline, was “not evil,” was “fine,” was “a side thing,” and was not related to Madeline’s disappearance or murder. 

* After being told by law enforcement that Stephan Sterns has been sexually abusing Madeline Soto for years, when asked by a detective, “Do you think he would ever hurt her?” Jennifer Soto responded, “I don’t think he would.”

* Again, after being told by by law enforcement that Stephan Sterns has been sexually abusing Madeline Soto for years, and that they believed that Stephan Sterns had killed Madeline Soto, Jennifer Soto stated, “I believe you when you talk about those  images. Those images might be real, or they happened, but I don’t believe they’re related to this case.” 

* Again, after being told by by law enforcement that Stephan Sterns has been sexually abusing Madeline Soto for years, and that they believed that Stephan Sterns had killed Madeline Soto, Jennifer Soto stated, “I didn’t see the rape. I didn’t know she was getting raped until yesterday. I saw the picture of the oral sex happening, and I knew that that was true, right? That was evidence. That’s for real. That’s (expletive) happening. But I kept thinking, going — I don’t know why, I, I can’t tell you why my brain kept thinking, ‘No, he didn’t kill her...’ I felt in my body she was still alive. She was still out there. I told (Sterns’ father) to get him a lawyer because I felt like you guys were chasing the wrong person.”

* Again, after being told by by law enforcement that Stephan Sterns has been sexually abusing Madeline Soto for years, and that they believed that Stephan Sterns had killed Madeline Soto, Jennifer Soto stated, “When you guys showed me the picture of her, I believed the sexual stuff, but I didn’t want to believe that he had done anything evil to her. I’m like what if he did this stuff, fine, but what if she’s still missing out there? What if somebody took her?” 

* Again, after being told by by law enforcement that Stephan Sterns has been sexually abusing Madeline Soto for years, and that they believed that Stephan Sterns had killed Madeline Soto, Jennifer Soto stated, “Let’s say all the sexual stuff happened, or uh we know it did happen, but what if he’s telling the truth about dropping her off and driving in circles and ? Is there video evidence of him, cause I know there’s banks in that plaza and an AM Stop. There must be video of him pulling into that plaza and leaving… if you guys have found evidence of him being in front of the store like he said he was, like, it’s possible that his story might be true and somebody else may have taken her.”  

* Again, after being told by by law enforcement that Stephan Sterns has been sexually abusing Madeline Soto for years, and that they believed that Stephan Sterns had killed Madeline Soto, Jennifer Soto stated   “Okay, like, the sex things happened, right? But what if that’s completely like a side thing and not having to do with this … like her being missing? I mean …” 

* Again, after being told by by law enforcement that Stephan Sterns has been sexually abusing Madeline Soto for years, and that they believed that Stephan Sterns had killed Madeline Soto, Jennifer Soto stated, “Can I choose not to press charges now and change my mind later?”

35. Further, during the course of the investigation into the abuse and murder of her missing daughter, Madeline Soto, Jennifer Soto repeatedly lied to and/or attempted to mislead law enforcement, in an apparent attempt to protect Stephan Sterns. 

36. These false statements included but were not limited to stating that she saw Madeline Soto getting ready for school at 8:00am on Monday, February 26, 2024 (when Madeline Soto was already deceased and her body was strapped into Stephan Stern’s passenger seat).

37. In light of all of the above, it was more than reasonably foreseeable that Jennifer Soto’s acts and omissions would result or was resulting in sexual abuse and/or exploitation by Stephan Sterns of Jennifer Soto’s young daughter, Madeline Soto. 

38. Jennifer Soto was not dependent on Stephan Soto for housing, transportation, food, medical care, income, or childcare. Jennifer Soto received child support, disability income, financial assistance from family, and income from intermittent work. Jennifer Soto lived rent free  (or at a reduced rental rate)  in the condo she resided in, which was owned by her father, Juan Soto. Jennifer Soto likely received additional benefits, including but not limited to SNAP and Medicaid. Jennifer Soto also owned a 2022 car, thus providing her a reliable form of transportation. 

39. Further, Jennifer Soto had multiple family members who resided within 5-30 minutes of her home who were willing to (and in fact did) assist with Madeline Soto’s care and transportation as needed - as well as two female roommates.

40. Stephan Sterns was unemployed, had no reliable transportation, and relied on Jennifer Soto and his parents for housing, transportation, food, and medications. Further, per Jennifer Soto’s own admissions, Stephan Sterns stayed up all night, slept all day, and spent his waking hours window shopping and/or shopping for toys and games, as well as playing video games and board games and painting “war hammer” figurines. Per Jennifer Soto, Stephan Sterns did not contribute to the household in any way.

41. Jennifer Soto could have easily removed Stephan Sterns from the home, forbidden him from returning, or, alternatively, removed Madeline Soto to one of her family’s homes (or to Madeline  Soto’s biological father).

42. At the minimum, Jennifer Soto could have easily provided Madeline with a safe and secure bedroom in her home and not allowed Stephan Sterns unsupervised access to her daughter or allowed him to sleep with her daughter.

43. Instead, Jennifer Soto did absolutely nothing to protect her daughter, Madeline Soto, from Stephan Sterns.

44. Instead , Jennifer Soto allowed Stephan Sterns unfettered access to her daughter, Madeline Soto, instructed Stephan Sterns to “babysit” her, instructed Stephan Sterns to assist with her medications, bathing, and getting ready for bed, and further inexplicably instructed Madeline Soto to sleep alone with Stephan Sterns, in a room with only one bed and with two interior locks on the door. 

44. In light of the direct and circumstantial evidence of Jennifer Soto’s actions and inactions in the face of ostensibly glaring signs of sexual abuse of Madeline Soto by Stephan Sterns clearly demonstrates “an entire want of care raising the presumption of indifference to consequences” and is sufficient to support a finding that  1) Jennifer Soto’s failure to seek appropriate medical  and mental health attention for Madeline Soto; and 2) Jennifer Soto’s failure to take any action to protect her daughter, Madeline Soto, from the foreseeable or known sexual abuse and/or exploitation by Stephen Sterns constituted culpable negligence.

My marketing is a flat fee listing agent and I do all

I’ve thought about doing online rent collection to help my tenants build their credit rating, and wouldn’t mind a better system to track repair expenses, etc. 

I was looking at turbo tenant, but not really impressed with the fact their screening costs a lot. I think it was around $50. There was another issue but I don’t remember what, but either way… not for me.

Is there a website/app I can use that allows me to record rental payments without requiring the payment go through them, track expenses, market properties & screen tenants?

I doubt I’ll get one stop that has everything at the prices I pay, but I figure it’s worth asking."

So, you want to be a Bitcoin wizard, do you? Donning the digital robes, waving your enchanted private keys, and conjuring payments out of thin air? Well, gather ‘round, for I’m about to show you the mystical path to Bitcoin mastery. All you need is a little courage, a touch of curiosity, and the ultimate spellbook: our [Bitcoin QR Code Maker API](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/). Let’s begin.

# Lesson 1: The Call to Crypto Adventure

Every wizard’s journey begins with a spark—a sudden realization that the fiat system is, well, as magical as a soggy wand. The Bitcoin network offers something better: decentralization, transparency, and a community of like-minded sorcerers (okay, maybe we call them developers, traders, and miners).

But here’s the catch—cryptocurrency isn’t for the faint-hearted. It’s a world where digital alchemy turns trust into transactions and where QR codes are your enchanted runes. That’s where the Bitcoin QR Code API comes in. It’s your staff of power, allowing you to wield the blockchain with grace, efficiency, and a flair for the dramatic.

# Lesson 2: Mastering the QR Code Spell

What’s a Bitcoin wizard without a spell? In our case, the spell is the QR code—a deceptively simple black-and-white matrix that can carry the weight of a thousand satoshis. These magical glyphs are your gateway to seamless transactions, enabling anyone with a smartphone to scan and pay faster than you can say “Hocus Pocus.”

Our [Bitcoin QR Code Maker API](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/) takes this spell to the next level. Whether you’re running an e-commerce store, managing a fundraiser, or just flexing your developer muscles, this API helps you generate Bitcoin QR codes with ease. Think of it as your trusty grimoire—it works quietly in the background, but its power is undeniable.

# Lesson 3: Crafting Magical Use Cases

Every good wizard knows how to use their tools creatively. Here are a few enchanting ideas for the Bitcoin QR Code API:

1. **The Merchant’s Charm** Running a shop? Use QR codes to accept Bitcoin payments at lightning speed. No fiddling with wallets, no confusion—just scan, pay, and poof, transaction complete.
2. **The Charitable Enchantment** Fundraising for a cause? QR codes make it easy for donors to contribute in Bitcoin. A scan and a tap later, their donation is on its way.
3. **The Developer’s Elixir** Building a decentralized app? Integrate the Bitcoin QR Code API for frictionless payment processing. Your users will thank you for the wizardry.
4. **The Party Trick** Hosting a crypto-themed event? Use QR codes to collect ticket payments or even as giveaways. Watch as your attendees marvel at your blockchain sorcery.

# Lesson 4: Decoding the Wizard’s Toolbox

You might be wondering, “What makes this Bitcoin QR Code API so special?” Well, let me enlighten you:

* **Simplicity**: No need for an advanced degree in cryptography. The API is designed to be user-friendly, even if your last coding project was a “Hello World” app.
* **Customization**: Personalize your QR codes to reflect your brand or style. Add colors, logos, and more to make your QR codes pop.
* **Speed**: In the fast-paced world of Bitcoin, every second counts. The API generates QR codes faster than you can say “blockchain.”
* **Security**: The API ensures your transactions are safe and secure. No sneaky goblins tampering with your funds here.

# Lesson 5: Overcoming Common Wizarding Challenges

Every aspiring wizard faces challenges on their journey. Here are a few pitfalls to avoid:

1. **The “Oops, Wrong Address” Curse** Double-check those QR codes! One tiny mistake, and your Bitcoin could end up in the abyss. The API minimizes errors, but a little caution goes a long way.
2. **The “Tech Hex”** Not a coding expert? Fear not! The Bitcoin QR Code API comes with documentation so clear, even a Muggle could understand it.
3. **The “Overwhelm Spell”** The crypto world can be daunting. Take it one step at a time. Start small, experiment with the API, and soon you’ll be casting complex payment spells with ease.

# Lesson 6: The Future of Bitcoin Wizardry

The beauty of Bitcoin wizardry lies in its infinite potential. As more people adopt cryptocurrency, the demand for seamless, secure transactions will only grow. By mastering tools like the Bitcoin QR Code API, you position yourself at the forefront of this digital revolution.

Picture this: a world where your QR codes power vending machines, enable micropayments, and even unlock doors (okay, maybe not literal doors, but certainly doors of opportunity). The possibilities are as vast as a dragon’s treasure hoard.

# Lesson 7: Joining the Wizarding Community

No wizard works alone. The Bitcoin ecosystem is brimming with fellow spellcasters eager to share knowledge, trade tips, and collaborate on magical projects. Join forums, attend meetups, and never stop learning. The more you engage, the more powerful your spells will become.

And don’t forget to share your creations! Show off your Bitcoin QR code-powered projects and inspire others to embrace the magic of cryptocurrency.

Ultimate BATTD Eco Guide,battd,1i9r1j1,2025-01-25 11:44:58,8,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/battd/comments/1i9r1j1/ultimate_battd_eco_guide/,BoomerSweetness,Guide,"This guide was made for the Ninja Kiwi discord server but i figure it'd be a good idea to post it here as well for those who needs it. Anyways i'll just compile everything important about eco in it, hopefully this help you in your BATTD journey!

**\_\_What is Eco\_\_**

It's a way to gain extra cash. These can either be gained from towers that give you money every few seconds, towers that give money every rounds, or tower that give extra cash when bloons/moabs are popped by them



IMPORTANT NOTE: You can only make at most 10,000$ per round on martian game, any cash above that will not add to your cash counter  
**\_\_Every Eco Explained\_\_**



**If you want a TLDR version without going in depth, you can use this tierlist over here**



\_\_\*\*Casual Eco (These require little to no setup and can be used in most scenarios including impopable and MG)\*\*\_\_



\*\*S (Always use these if you have them)\*\*: COBRA, Thought Cannon Wand, Treasure Chest Key, Golden Viola



\*\*A (Good pick for extra income)\*\*: Royal Decree, BMO, Tuxedo Jake



\*\*B (Mediocore pick or has some requirement)\*\*: Big Bloon Bounty, Treasure Hunter, Katana Weapon, Brofist (only use brofist if you don't have other choices), King of Ooo Ally (only use for allies only), Shoko



\*\*F (Just don't use)\*\*: Holiday BMO, Universal Coin, Finn Sweater, Betty



\*\*\_\_Hardcore Eco (If you want to make ALOT of money in a short amount of rounds then you can use these. They however take specific setups to get to their full potential)\_\_\*\*

\*\*S:\*\* Eco Charlie Setup



\*\*A:\*\* Eco Finn Setup (unusable if finn level is 10)



\*\*B:\*\* Eco WPB Setup, Eco Marceline Setup, Eco Jake Setup



\*\*F:\*\* The rest of eco setup



**For eco setup requirements you need:** 

\*\*Must\*\*: Dr Monkey with the alchemy upgrade place near the character (the maximum range of the dr monkey should be aligned with the maximum range of your eco character for maximum profit), King of Ooo Staff, Thief King Dagger & Mystery Cave Pick (if your character is melee)



\*\*Optional\*\*: Golden Viola (marceline and tjake are the best characters since you can just make them not attack but jake is also fine), LSP/Slime Princess (do not get the upgrade that make them deal damage though), Golden Crown power



Also another thing to note is that your character MUST have the lowest pierce and damage possible, so do take off things such as heart gauntlet or damage ring if you have them equipped, instruments like the lover or devil monster bass or other dps characters should also not be near your character. For upgrades only get the speed and maybe range upgrade  
**\*\*Explaination on all of the eco sources\*\***



I'll mostly only focus on the S or A tier since for B and F tier i won't suggest using if you just want to be optimal. Also i'll sort from the order when you unlock them



Eco Sources effectiveness and only really measured by 2 things: How fast they pay themselves back and how much income do they make. An eco source that pay itself quickly is good for earlygame while later on how much the eco source make is important, usually good eco sources have both though



\_\_Brofist\_\_: The first income you unlocked in the game, it cost 1400$ in total and need finn + jake and the ""right in the glub"" upgrade for finn. It heals your live by 10 and give you 120$ per round. Overall i'd consider this one to be pretty terrible but it's better than nothing, you can expect it to make a profit in \~12 rounds (\~16 if you also consider the right in the glub upgrade), the heal can also be useful in earlygame. For earlygame your goal is just to rush this upgrade as fast as possible since it'll give you the much needed income for normal or hard mode, this hurts especially hard when you're also locked from the bound by word upgrade which is Finn's most important upgrade for lategame (however it is quite easy to counter this by just selling finn once you have enough money and rebuy him with bound by word). Either way, later on once you get better options stay clear from this one



\_\_BMO\_\_: He's the only rare income ally and does the job pretty well. Unlike brofist he's time-based income instead of round-based income, so if you really want to maximize him you can either put your defense up a put a stall (or even perma-stall setup) to make more cash but it isn't usually needed. Beside that he pays himself off much faster than brofist for the most part and can also be duplicated by PB and Warrior PB upgrades which give him a much better income, only thing you have to look out for is to collect his generated cash before it caps out to avoid loosing money  
  
\_\_Royal Decree\_\_: You can unlock this with level 5 PB. It only costs 2500$ which can be easily afforded early on but pays a whopping 750$ per round. It can make you profit in 4 rounds while also giving you great amount of income, for refrence tuxedo jake with royalties upgrade (the best eco upgrade you can get if you're going the boosting path) only make 300$ per round for 2,250$. So in the end, royal decree is an extremely powerful eco source for all of your game, only disadvantage is that you have to click ability every round (which i mean... just don't be lazy) and it locked you from soda and mints but this can also be easily circumvented by selling and buying back PB later on during the game



\_\_Thought Cannon Wand\_\_: This is a great income source in the later round due to the huge amount of MOAB class it can tag in the lategame which drops a bunch of cash crates. The main reason why this is placed so high though is due to the fact that thought cannon wand is already very good outside of it's eco-purpose due to its range boost and insane orb production, the only disadvantage is that you're forced to bring a wand user (however Sam with the plasma goggles is very strong of an unit and should be bring in every loadout so this should not be an issue) and doesn't provide any eco for the earlygame



\_\_COBRA\_\_: Arguably the best eco source in the game, he acts like BMO but on mega-crack. His income making is actually slightly better than BMO but his main draw is that he has very cheap cost (400$ per ally), and with Commander Cassie and Warrior PB can be duplicated to insane level. While COBRA is the most useful during earlygame, spamming COBRA also give enough cash for your lategame needs as well. Overall this let you snowball to insane amount of eco, just as a bonus cobra later upgrades are also great and very useful for any run really (although you only need to max out 1 COBRA)

\_\_Golden Viola, Treasure Chest Key\_\_: They aren't the most broken eco sources out there but i do think they're still S tier just because of their other benefits (golden viola speed boost and treasure chest key coin/gem farming) that elevates their general usage by alot



\_\_Tuxedo Jake\_\_: He's a great eco characters for endgame usages, although his income is per round which doesn't have as good of a potential as time-based income, it's still good. If you want to go with buffing tjake all the way and get Catchy Tunes, you can upgrade tjake to royalties for 300$ per round which is decent for the 2150$ you pay for. But if you go further and switch out the catchy tunes for superstar and fortune, you get a whopping 1500$ per round for only 6950$, this payback rate is similiar to PB's royal decree except with much better income per round and also extra cash per bloon popped during rock out if you have ""Fortune"" Upgrade. Overall Tuxedo Jake is a solid eco character if you only go up to royalties upgrade, but with superstar and fortune upgrade he can start making crazy banks



\_\_Eco Setup\_\_: I'll just group them all together because they're pretty similiar. The main goal is to abuse the king of ooo scepter money bonus with the dr monkey and banana replicator income buff which in turn can give you some crazy numbers (for refrence, the normal 50$ bonus cash from golden bloon can be buffed to a whopping 300$ bonus cash). The best characters to use it on is charlie (due to high aoe and rather low damage without upgrades) or finn (able to get buffed with royal promise + can equip alot of eco items), the best choice is usually eco charlie so you can free up a slot for missile finn for lategame which is very broken. Do note that the eco builds loose effectiveness in the later rounds but you can still make 100k+ pre-round 20 with the right setup

"A raw, emotional woman struggling with family expectations, self-sacrifice, anxiety, and a forced marriage. Her journey of feeling invisible, misunderstood, and trapped by societal norms and familial pressure sheds light on the inner battles many face but rarely speak about.",u_Old_Association_1602,1i9qskl,2025-01-25 11:33:55,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Old_Association_1602/comments/1i9qskl/a_raw_emotional_woman_struggling_with_family/,Old_Association_1602,,"# Voiceless Hope

Well, I’d like to believe that I’m not living my worst, but it would be best if you all judged. I mean, who doesn’t like to gossip, right? What I’ve been feeling over the past years is hard to express. Am I happy? Sad? Bored? Weird? Let’s give you all a fair chance to decide.

If you ask me, I’m living my worst. Although I’ve always wondered how a mother could not love all her children, it seemed so strange, yet cruel and disheartening. But ask me now, I feel like no one truly loves me. Parents? Nah. Siblings? Nope. Relatives? Yes, but hey, I don’t trust them.

Hey, my name is ……..? Well, I’m ashamed to introduce my name to you. But I do have a beautiful name; I used to cherish it and truly loved it. But now, I just don’t feel the same fondness for it. I completely pity myself. I mean, she is literally going through hell.

My daily routine is quite interesting; I’m trying to understand myself. I have my alarm set for 6:30 AM, but 6:45 is the actual time I wake up. After that, since it’s winter, I’m not going to die after a bath, so I usually skip it. After two legit hours in the metro, I reach the office, and then again from 5 to 7 PM, I’m back home. After resting, I cook for my two family members. I’m not saying I cook regularly, but this has been considered my job since I’m living with male family members. I’m the eldest daughter, and it’s exhausting, truly. So, yeah, this is my life, and I’ve been living like this for many years. Sometimes, once or twice a month, after literally wheedling my father or asking his permission, I can be out, but 4-5 hours is the max I can stay, and 6 PM is the countdown to be back home.

I’m not saying he’s completely wrong, but living like this is also not something to brag about. Right now, I am suffering from anxiety issues because of many incidents related to staying out past 6 PM (some from my female friend's birthday – 'Who is she? Do we know her? Let me talk to her parents first. Who all is coming? Is there any boy?'). After a thorough inquiry, I was allowed to go. Sometimes, if the auto driver or traffic is delayed, my heartbeat races so fast. I know I’ve done nothing wrong, but the constant confrontations, the same questions, and the occasional slap or two – it’s disturbing. Now, I have anxiety issues, and no one in my family knows about it (though I’m glad because they’ll judge me for it too).

So, you guys can tell me, is this how life should be? Am I asking too much? I don’t think I have any confidence left. I don’t feel jealous now of those who are living their lives, but I surely feel inferior.

Oh, by the way, congratulate me – I’m getting married. Am I happy? Definitely not! Does my family ask me about my feelings? No! Do I like him? No! Do they ask me about dates, venues, or food? Not at all! I am being forced into this completely, and as a history student from a women’s college, I’m also paying dowry, which neither my in-laws nor my family even acknowledge. Of course, it’s all being spent on me, and eventually, it’s all for me.

But do I want this? No! As a woman, this is the most shameful thing I’ve ever experienced. I’ve been told about my birth values – it feels like I am a non-living thing, but surely not a person. Everyone else seems happy, but is it my fault? My mother constantly taunts me for not smiling and complains about how other girls are happy with their marriage announcements.

Do other girls always experience this and still stay happy? Since this announcement, I’ve been crying my heart out, of course, without anyone knowing. Still, I cry, and every time my heart aches, I pray, **'Shiv Ji, save me**.' Is there truly a God?

Being a woman is the best thing, something only we truly know, but what it takes to be a woman in this world is something no one can even imagine. It’s 2025, and I still don’t have a choice. A choice to live, a choice to feel acknowledged, a choice to feel sad, a choice to do what I like, a choice to live, basically. Why, as the elder daughter, am I the one who has to sacrifice everything and be considered? And if I raise my voice about all these immoral things, I’m labeled as selfish.

Is taking 2-3k from my entire salary and giving all of it to my father selfish? My mother always taunts me, saying she never knows what my salary is, yet she sees every month that I take none of it. Is this selfish? From that 2-3k, I pay 500 to each of my siblings on their birthdays, and in return, I’ve gotten nothing for the past year. Is this selfish? I do extra work as freelancing and occasionally get 4-5k in a month, but I buy sarees for my mother or jewelry. Is this selfish? Every night, I am scared to sleep due to bad dreams and pray to God to take my life before any of my family members, constantly reading the Hanuman Chalisa (which no one knows about). Is this selfish?

Doing a marriage I’m not happy about, sacrificing my self-respect, being part of a crime like dowry, and giving all my confidence and pride – is this being selfish?

No one celebrates my birthday. I have to prepare and pretend to be happy about it, constantly feeling guilty since no one else seems to care. Is this selfish? My parents don’t even remember my birthday. When I asked as a child, they always said a relative’s child was born 11 days after me. So, I counted and reached his house to find out. They didn’t feel even a little bad about it. Is this being selfish? I’ve been working since I was in 5th class, giving tuition and taking no money from it until my prominent job. Is this selfish?

All I’m saying is that family can lift you up so high and give you everything you need, but they can also make you feel like a terrible person and make you live like hell. So, guys, if you don’t have family, it’s not the worst thing, because you can’t even say a thing to them. Since they’re a part of you, you can’t complain to God about them. Because if they suffer, so will you. So, family is complicated – you still can’t leave them even when you’re living your worst.

That’s all for today. Will connect tomorrow, from this you can gossip all you want."
Banning CBDC's is a bad thing?,Banking,1i9p5o6,2025-01-25 10:20:57,0,0.31,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Banking/comments/1i9p5o6/banning_cbdcs_is_a_bad_thing/,ProudChoferesClaseB,News,"Like blackrock makes all it's money managing trillions in stock and charging a few dozen basis points annually. couldn't the govt replace much of it's taxes by implementing a CBDC incl. for internal use on stock exchanges, and charging a dozen basis points every time money moves? 

the volume of payments and sales and purchases of real estate, securities, ACH/fedwire volumes, etc. 

you'd bring in trillions annually, and if you're not picky about letting it go beyond our borders or trying to censor transactions, even the DPRK and Iran are gonna pay their fair share! 

yes it hurts credit card issuers who charge 3% to merchants, but that's bcuz we don't have a CBDC so these middlemen can get away with it! privacy is a concern, but we gave up on privacy in finance a \*long\* time ago w/ the PATRIOT act & follow on decisions, etc. confiscation is a concern but again, we've had civil asset and criminal forfeiture for ages where the state can just steal your car, it's not going away anytime soon either. 

a CBDC would also get rid of the unfair ""prime broker w/ a fed acct vs. retail"" distinction to an extent, no? it might even, if proper biometrics are used, get rid of the need for savings banks to a large extent so banks could focus on *investing* and not luring in low-wage workers off the street w/ $100 checking account bonuses.

My Love for Him Was Forbidden… But the Truth Couldn't Stay Hidden Forever,stories,1i9ndjd,2025-01-25 08:52:56,0,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1i9ndjd/my_love_for_him_was_forbidden_but_the_truth/,Yamanozkan,Story-related,"[My Love for Him Was Forbidden… But the Truth Couldn't Stay Hidden Forever](https://youtu.be/IIjMYAX90vU)



I never planned to fall for him. He was my brother's best friend, practically a second son in our family, and ten years older than me. Growing up, he was always the one who picked me up from school when my parents were busy, who taught me to ride a bike, who teased me like an annoying older brother. But somewhere along the line, those feelings shifted—at least for me.



It happened the summer I turned 19. He had just come back from a six-month work trip abroad. He looked… different. His hair was longer, his confidence more pronounced, and for the first time, he looked at me like I wasn’t just a kid anymore. It was subtle—a lingering glance here, a crooked smile there—but I felt it. And it terrified me.



One late July evening, my family threw a barbecue. The entire neighborhood was invited, including him. As the night wore on, I found myself stealing glances at him, watching him laugh and talk to others, his deep voice carrying over the hum of the crowd. At one point, our eyes met across the yard, and I felt a rush of heat climb up my neck. He smiled—a knowing smile that sent shivers down my spine.



Later, I retreated to the front porch, hoping to escape the chaos. He found me there, leaning against the railing, a cold drink in hand.



""Escaping the madness?"" he asked, his voice low.



I nodded, unable to meet his gaze. ""Needed some air.""



He leaned against the railing beside me, so close I could feel the warmth radiating from him. We stayed like that for a while, the silence comfortable but charged. Finally, he broke it.



""You’ve grown up,"" he said, his tone unreadable.



I looked at him, surprised. ""I guess… time does that.""



He chuckled softly, shaking his head. ""It’s not just that. You’re… different. Stronger. Smarter. More—"" He stopped, like he’d said too much.



""More what?"" I pressed, my heart pounding.



He looked at me, his eyes soft but intense. ""More everything.""



That night changed everything.

The days after that night were a whirlwind of stolen moments and unspoken words. I couldn't shake the memory of his voice, his gaze, the way he made me feel seen in a way I never had before. It was exhilarating and terrifying all at once.



We didn’t speak about what happened—not directly. But there were signs, small cracks in the façade we both tried to maintain. A brush of hands as we passed each other, his lingering gaze whenever I walked into the room. It felt like a secret, fragile and precious, that only the two of us shared.



One evening, about a week later, I found myself at the lake near our house. It was our family’s usual spot, but tonight it was empty, the water reflecting the fading hues of sunset. I hadn’t expected anyone else to be there, so my heart skipped a beat when I saw him standing by the water, skipping stones.



“You following me now?” I joked, trying to mask my nerves.



He turned, his lips curving into that familiar crooked smile. “Maybe I just like the view.”



I rolled my eyes, but my pulse quickened. “Smooth.”



He stepped closer, his gaze locking with mine. “Do you want me to leave?”



The question hung in the air, heavy with meaning. I hesitated, my heart warring with my head. Finally, I shook my head. “No.”



We sat on the dock, our feet dangling over the edge. The silence between us was comfortable, punctuated only by the gentle lapping of water against the wood. I don’t know who moved first, but suddenly, his hand was on mine, warm and steady.



“This is crazy,” I whispered, my voice barely audible over the sound of the water.



“Maybe,” he said, his thumb brushing over my knuckles. “But it doesn’t feel wrong.”



For the first time, I let myself believe that it didn’t. That what we felt—what I felt—wasn’t something to be ashamed of. But the world doesn’t work like that, does it?



The days that followed felt like a dream I couldn’t wake up from. He was everywhere—in the way the sunlight filtered through the kitchen window, in the songs on the radio, in the restless nights where my mind replayed every stolen glance, every whispered word. 



But reality has a way of intruding on even the sweetest of dreams.



One evening, my brother came home earlier than expected. He tossed his keys onto the counter and leaned against the doorway, his expression unreadable.



“You’ve been spending a lot of time with him,” he said casually, but his eyes betrayed a hint of suspicion.



I froze, my heart skipping a beat. “What? No, not really.”



He raised an eyebrow. “Come on. I’ve seen the way you look at him.”



A wave of panic crashed over me. Did he know? Did he suspect? I laughed, forcing a casual shrug. “Don’t be ridiculous. He’s like family.”



“Exactly,” my brother said, his tone sharp. “Which is why you need to be careful. People talk.”



That was the first time I truly felt the weight of what we were doing. It wasn’t just about us; it was about everyone else—the expectations, the judgments, the lines we weren’t supposed to cross.



I wanted to tell him, to explain that it wasn’t what he thought, but the words wouldn’t come. Instead, I nodded, promising myself that I’d keep my distance, that I’d end this before it spiraled out of control.



But promises like that are hard to keep.



That night, I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, replaying my brother’s words over and over. “People talk.” He didn’t need to say more for me to understand the consequences if anyone found out. This wasn’t just about my feelings; it was about loyalty, trust, and the fragile balance of relationships within our family. 



But the heart doesn’t listen to reason.



The next morning, I resolved to stay away. It was for the best. Yet, as the days turned into weeks, the space between us only seemed to make the pull stronger. Avoiding him didn’t stop the feelings; it amplified them. 



One late evening, I went to the grocery store. It was a mundane errand, a desperate attempt to distract myself. As I wandered aimlessly through the aisles, I heard a familiar voice behind me.



“I thought you were avoiding me.”



I turned to see him standing there, holding a carton of milk and a bag of chips. He was wearing a plain t-shirt and jeans, his usual effortless charm on full display. 



“I wasn’t—” I started, but he cut me off with a knowing look. 



“Don’t lie,” he said, stepping closer. “I know you’re scared. But I need you to know something… This isn’t just in your head. It’s not just you.”



His words hit me like a freight train. The unspoken feelings between us suddenly had weight, a reality I couldn’t ignore. But it didn’t make things easier.



“I can’t do this,” I whispered, my voice breaking. “It’s not fair. To my family, to my brother…”



“And what about you?” he asked, his voice soft but insistent. “What about what you want?”



Tears welled up in my eyes, the emotions I’d been suppressing finally threatening to overflow. “What I want doesn’t matter. It can’t.”



He reached out, his fingers brushing mine. “It does to me.”



We stood there in the middle of the aisle, the world around us blurring into nothing. For a moment, it felt like we were the only two people who existed. But reality has a way of creeping back in.



The days following our encounter at the grocery store were a blur of conflicting emotions. I felt like I was standing on the edge of a cliff, knowing the fall would be devastating but unable to turn away. Every logical thought screamed at me to stop, to walk away before it was too late. But my heart had already crossed the line.



One evening, I found myself wandering aimlessly through the town, trying to clear my head. The sunset painted the sky in hues of orange and pink, the kind of serene beauty that usually brought me peace. But tonight, it felt like a cruel reminder of the chaos inside me. 



As I rounded the corner near the park, I saw him sitting on a bench. His head was tilted back, eyes closed, as if he were lost in his own battle. I hesitated, my feet rooted to the ground, but before I could turn and walk away, he opened his eyes and saw me. 



For a moment, neither of us moved. Then he stood, his expression unreadable, and walked toward me. 



“You can’t keep running,” he said softly, stopping just a few feet away. 



“I’m not running,” I replied, though the tremor in my voice betrayed me.



He took a step closer. “Then stay.”



Those two words hung in the air, heavier than anything he’d said before. Stay. It wasn’t a question or a plea—it was a challenge, a dare to stop pretending and face the truth.



“I can’t,” I whispered, tears pricking at my eyes. “You know I can’t.”



“Why not?” he asked, his voice filled with a quiet intensity. “Because of what people might think? Because of your brother? What about what we feel? What about us?”



His words broke something inside me. The walls I had built to keep him out, to keep myself safe, came crashing down. I took a shaky step forward, my hands trembling as I reached for him. 



“I’m scared,” I admitted, my voice barely audible. “I’m scared of what this means, of what it’ll do to everyone else.”



He cupped my face in his hands, his touch steady and grounding. “I’m scared too. But I’d rather face that fear with you than spend the rest of my life wondering what could’ve been.”



In that moment, the world seemed to fall away. It was just us—two people caught in a storm of emotions, clinging to each other like lifelines. I closed my eyes, leaning into him, and for the first time, I let myself believe that maybe, just maybe, this could work.



I spent the next several days avoiding everyone. I ignored his calls, dodged my brother’s questions, and buried myself in anything that could distract me. Cleaning, reorganizing my room, and even volunteering for extra shifts at the café. But no matter how busy I tried to keep myself, the memories of him lingered like a ghost, haunting every quiet moment.



One night, I was closing up the café when he walked in. My heart leapt into my throat at the sight of him. He looked tired, like he hadn’t been sleeping, and his usual confident demeanor was replaced with something softer, more vulnerable.



“We need to talk,” he said, his voice steady but filled with an edge of desperation.



I glanced around the empty café, suddenly hyper-aware of the silence between us. “There’s nothing to talk about.”



He frowned, stepping closer. “Don’t do that. Don’t shut me out.”



I busied myself wiping down the counter, avoiding his gaze. “It’s better this way.”



“For who?” he asked, his tone rising slightly. “Because it sure as hell doesn’t feel better for me.”



I froze, the cloth in my hand hovering over the counter. “It’s not about what feels better. It’s about what’s right.”



He let out a bitter laugh. “And who decides that? Your brother? Your family? Or the people who don’t even matter in the end?”



“It’s not that simple,” I said, turning to face him. “You know it’s not.”



He stepped closer, his eyes searching mine. “It is. You just don’t want to admit it.”



My resolve began to crack under his gaze. “What do you want from me?” I asked, my voice breaking. “What do you expect me to do?”



“I want you to stop running,” he said, his voice softening. “I want you to let yourself feel this, to let us be something—anything—because pretending it doesn’t exist isn’t working for either of us.”



Tears welled up in my eyes, and I turned away, biting my lip to keep from crying. “I can’t.”



“Yes, you can,” he said, stepping even closer. His hands found mine, his touch warm and grounding. “You just won’t.”



The silence that followed was deafening. My heart pounded in my chest as I fought the urge to lean into him, to let myself believe that this could somehow work. But every time I got close, the weight of what was at stake pulled me back.



Finally, I pulled away, stepping out of his reach. “You should go.”



His jaw tightened, and for a moment, I thought he might argue. But then he nodded, a look of resignation in his eyes. “If that’s what you really want.”



I didn’t respond, and he turned, walking out of the café and into the night. As the door closed behind him, I felt a pang of regret so deep it almost took my breath away. But I told myself it was for the best. It had to be.



After that night, I threw myself even harder into work. But no matter how much I tried to convince myself that I had made the right choice, the ache in my chest refused to go away.



One afternoon, I was restocking shelves when my brother walked in. He leaned against the counter, watching me with a look I couldn’t quite read.



“You’ve been avoiding him,” he said bluntly.



I froze, my heart skipping a beat. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”



He raised an eyebrow. “Don’t play dumb. It’s obvious.”



I forced myself to keep moving, hoping he couldn’t see the panic in my eyes. “It’s none of your business.”



“It is when it starts affecting him—and you.” He paused, his voice softening. “Look, I don’t know what’s going on between you two, but he’s my best friend. And you’re my sister. I just… I don’t want anyone getting hurt.”



His words hit me harder than I expected. I nodded, unable to find the right words to respond. He gave me a small smile, then left, leaving me alone with my thoughts.



The weeks that followed were a blur of suppressed emotions and forced normalcy. I buried myself in work and routine, avoiding any situation where I might run into him. But it didn’t matter how far I tried to push him out of my mind—he was always there, lingering like a shadow I couldn’t escape.



One evening, my family hosted another barbecue. This time, I tried to keep my distance, sticking to the kitchen and keeping myself busy with preparations. But avoiding him at a gathering like this was nearly impossible.



He arrived late, as always, with a bottle of wine in one hand and his signature smile in place. My brother greeted him warmly, oblivious to the tension simmering just beneath the surface. I kept my eyes fixed on the food in front of me, pretending not to notice.



“Hey,” his voice cut through the noise, soft but impossible to ignore.



I glanced up, my heart skipping a beat. “Hey.”



“Can we talk?” he asked, his expression serious.



“Not here,” I said quickly, glancing around to make sure no one was paying attention.



He nodded toward the backyard gate. “Outside?”



Reluctantly, I followed him out into the night. The cool air was a welcome relief from the heat of the party, but it did little to calm my nerves. We walked in silence until we were far enough from the house that no one could overhear us.



“I can’t keep doing this,” he said, turning to face me. His eyes were tired, filled with a mix of frustration and longing. “I can’t keep pretending that none of this matters.”



“It’s not that simple,” I said, crossing my arms defensively.



“Yes, it is,” he argued, his voice rising slightly. “You’re the one making it complicated.”



“That’s not fair,” I shot back, my own frustration bubbling to the surface. “You don’t understand—”



“Then explain it to me!” he interrupted, his tone desperate. “Because all I know is that I can’t stop thinking about you. And I know you feel the same way.”



His words hung in the air, heavy and undeniable. I opened my mouth to respond, but no words came out. He took a step closer, his voice softening.



“I’m not asking for anything crazy. I’m just asking you to stop running. To give this a chance.”



Tears welled up in my eyes, and I turned away, unable to face the raw intensity of his gaze. “And what happens if it all goes wrong? What happens if we hurt everyone around us?”



He reached for my hand, his touch warm and steady. “Then we figure it out. Together.”



For a moment, I let myself believe that it could be that simple. That we could face whatever came our way as long as we had each other. But the weight of reality came crashing back down, and I pulled away.



“I can’t,” I whispered, my voice breaking. “I’m sorry.”



He let out a shaky breath, his shoulders sagging in defeat. “Okay. If that’s what you want.”



As he walked away, a part of me wanted to call out to him, to tell him to stay. But I stayed silent, rooted to the spot as I watched him disappear into the night.



In the days that followed, life moved on around me, but I felt stuck. Every interaction with my family felt like a performance, a desperate attempt to convince them—and myself—that everything was fine. But late at night, when the house was quiet, I couldn’t escape the ache in my chest or the constant replay of his words in my mind.



One evening, my brother and I sat in the living room watching a game. He seemed unusually quiet, his usual banter replaced with a distracted silence. Finally, he turned to me, his brow furrowed.



“Is there something going on between you two?” he asked, his voice calm but probing.



I froze, my pulse quickening. “What? No, of course not. Why would you think that?”



He studied me for a moment, his gaze piercing. “Because he’s been off lately. And so have you.”



I forced a laugh, shaking my head. “You’re imagining things.”



“Am I?” he pressed. “Look, I’m not trying to accuse you of anything. I just… I need to know if there’s something I should be worried about.”



My chest tightened as I struggled to keep my composure. “There’s nothing to worry about,” I said, my voice steadier than I felt.



He nodded slowly, though the suspicion didn’t leave his eyes. “Okay. If you say so.”



The tension between us lingered, but I tried to push it aside. I couldn’t afford to let my brother’s suspicions grow, especially not with everything else weighing on me. But avoiding the problem didn’t make it go away.



A week later, I ran into him at the grocery store again. This time, there were no lingering glances or soft words. His expression was guarded, his tone clipped. It was as if he had built a wall between us, and I couldn’t blame him.



“How are you?” I asked hesitantly, breaking the awkward silence.



“Fine,” he said shortly, not meeting my eyes.



The distance between us was palpable, and it hurt more than I expected. “Look, I’m sorry,” I blurted out, my voice trembling. “For everything.”



He finally looked at me, his gaze hard but tinged with sadness. “Sorry doesn’t change anything.”



“I know,” I said quickly. “But I never wanted to hurt you.”



His jaw tightened, and he shook his head. “You think this is just about me? Do you have any idea how hard this has been for me? Watching you act like none of this matters while I’m falling apart?”



Tears pricked at my eyes, but I forced them back. “It matters,” I said softly. “More than you know.”



“Then why?” he demanded, his voice breaking. “Why can’t you just let yourself feel it?”



“Because I’m scared,” I admitted, my voice barely audible. “Scared of losing everything—my family, my brother… you.”



He stared at me for a long moment, his expression softening. “You’re not going to lose me. But if you keep pushing me away, you might.”



That night, I lay awake for hours, replaying his words in my mind. He was right. I had spent so much time trying to protect everyone else that I hadn’t stopped to think about what I wanted—or what I was losing by holding back.



The next day, I made a decision. It wasn’t going to be easy, and I didn’t know how it would end, but I couldn’t keep running. I owed it to myself—and to him—to try.



The next morning, I woke up with a nervous energy coursing through me. It was as if my body already knew that this day would mark a turning point. I didn’t have a clear plan, but I knew one thing for certain—I couldn’t let things stay the way they were.



I waited until the evening, my heart pounding as I dialed his number. It rang twice before he answered, his voice cautious.



“Hey.”



“Can we talk?” I asked, my voice trembling despite my best efforts to sound calm.



There was a pause, and I held my breath. “Where?” he finally asked.



“The lake,” I said. “An hour?”



“Okay,” he said softly, and the line went dead.



When I arrived at the lake, the sun was just beginning to set, casting the water in shades of gold and amber. He was already there, leaning against his car with his arms crossed. He didn’t look up as I approached, but I could feel the tension radiating off him.



“Thanks for coming,” I said, stopping a few feet away.



He nodded, his gaze fixed on the horizon. “What’s this about?”



I took a deep breath, forcing myself to meet his eyes. “I’m tired of running.”



That got his attention. He turned to face me, his expression unreadable. “What are you saying?”



“I’m saying I’m done pretending that this doesn’t matter,” I said, my voice steady despite the storm raging inside me. “I’m scared, and I don’t know what’s going to happen, but I don’t want to lose you.”



His eyes softened, and for a moment, I thought he might pull me into his arms. But he stayed where he was, his hands clenched at his sides.



“You don’t know how long I’ve been waiting to hear you say that,” he said quietly. “But this isn’t just about us. You know that, right?”



“I know,” I said, nodding. “And I’m willing to face whatever comes. I just… I need to know if you are too.”



He stepped closer, his gaze intense. “I’ve been ready for a long time. I just didn’t think you’d ever get here.”



A tear slipped down my cheek, and he reached out, brushing it away with his thumb. The warmth of his touch sent a shiver through me, but it was the look in his eyes that truly undid me—hope, love, and a determination that matched my own.



“Then let’s stop waiting,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper.



He didn’t hesitate. He pulled me into his arms, holding me like he was afraid I might disappear. And for the first time, I let myself believe that this could work—that we could face whatever came our way as long as we were together.



The days that followed were a blur of quiet moments and stolen glances, each one solidifying the bond between us. We weren’t reckless, but we weren’t hiding either. It was a delicate balance, and we both knew it couldn’t last forever.



One afternoon, as we sat together on the dock by the lake, he turned to me, his expression serious. “We need to tell your brother.”



The words sent a chill through me, but I knew he was right. We couldn’t keep this a secret forever, and the longer we waited, the harder it would be.



“Okay,” I said, though my voice shook. “But I need to do it my way.”



He nodded, his hand finding mine. “I’ll be here. No matter what.”



The confrontation didn’t go as smoothly as I had hoped. My brother’s reaction was every bit as explosive as I had feared. He felt betrayed, angry that we had kept this from him. But underneath the anger, there was hurt—the kind that only comes from someone you love.



“You should have told me,” he said, his voice heavy with disappointment. “I’m not mad that you have feelings for each other. I’m mad that you didn’t trust me enough to be honest.”



“I’m sorry,” I said, tears streaming down my face. “I was scared. I didn’t want to hurt you.”



“You did anyway,” he said quietly. “But… I’ll get over it. Eventually.”



It wasn’t the resolution I had hoped for, but it was a start. And as we left his house that night, his parting words gave me hope.



“Take care of her,” he said to him, his voice softer now. “She deserves it.”



As we drove away, I felt a weight lift off my shoulders. The road ahead wouldn’t be easy, but for the first time in a long time, I felt like we had a real chance. And that was enough."
How To Read Carl Jung (Demystifying The Collected Works),Jung,1i9ncan,2025-01-25 08:51:04,17,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jung/comments/1i9ncan/how_to_read_carl_jung_demystifying_the_collected/,Rafaelkruger,,"To end the **Demystifying Jungian Psychology Series**, I’d like to leave you a few extra keys that will help you understand how Carl Jung structured his psychology around striving to conciliate the paradoxical nature of the *psyche*.

Jung follows a few precepts he calls *antinomies,* which can also be understood as paradoxes. Once again, I’d like to mention the works of Heráclito Pinheiro who introduced me to this line of thought and guides, to which I made sight changes.

By the way, if you're not a nerd like me, I allow you to jump right into the reading guide section, lol.

# Antinomies

*The Practice of Psychotherapy* is the only book in which Carl Jung reveals concisely how he thinks about his psychology and his psychotherapeutic method. Jung states that “The psyche is infinitely more complicated than light; hence a great number of antinomies is required to describe the nature of the psyche satisfactorily” (C. G. Jung - V16 - §1). In this light, there are four major precepts Carl Jung follows:

**1 - “Psyche depends on body and body depends on psyche”.**

This first antinomy refers to the conflict between *psyche* and matter. In psychology, this debate revolves mainly around the physicalist perspective, i.e., if the *psyche* is a mere epiphenomenon of the brain. If that’s the case, the *psyche* would be considered a mere fruit of brain activity and it would be possible to influence it exclusively through physiological interventions. Taking this view to an extreme, we would be able to solve every psychological problem with surgeries and medication.

We have to remember that Carl Jung was a doctor and was obviously aware of the influence of the body over the *psyche*, but his findings dictate that the opposite is also true, the *psyche* can also influence the body. However, we can’t isolate either one of them, as both are interdependent, that’s why it’s a paradox. Furthermore, Carl Jung was interested in creating a psychology capable of holding these opposing and complementary truths, intending to create a new way of studying the *psyche* that’s different from the materialistic standpoint, giving the *psyche* its own dignity.

**2 - “The individual signifies nothing in comparison with the universal, and the universal signifies nothing in comparison with the individual"".**

This second antinomy refers to the paradox between the individual and the collective truth. Every time we try to create a formula and something that’s generally valid, we’re disregarding individuality. This creates a major problem since we need generally valid truths to live in society, to share knowledge, and to have replicability. However, it’s impossible to encompass everyone and every individual perspective. Carl Jung was aware that he needed to create a psychology that was capable of being generally valid, but at the same time, it had to respect individuality. That’s precisely why, as we’ve seen in the first chapter, he never created a theory, but a map to navigate the *psyche*.

**3 - “A psychological statement is only true if its opposite can be asserted”.**

This antinomy makes a direct reference to the paradoxical nature of the *psyche,* as truth is dependent on the perspective you adopt. For instance, as we’ve discussed in the *psychological types* chapter, every statement that we make about extroverts works in the exact opposite manner for introverts, and vice-versa. When interpreting dreams, we can always interpret in a positive or negative light, the right interpretation is dependent on the individual's *conscious attitude*. Lastly, a strong ego-complex is one capable of holding opposing and complementary truths, which is the premise for the *individuation process*.

**4 - “In psychotherapy there are no rules”.**

In this last antinomy, Carl Jung is explaining once again his attitude toward theories. But since this statement also needs to follow his own precept, psychotherapy does have rules and at the same time, it doesn’t. We certainly need knowledge of common and recurring patterns and they’re extremely relevant to share and expand psychological knowledge, however, we always have to understand how this is being expressed in a single individual. Carl Jung even states that he needs to be ready to produce a new and unique understanding to every patient he meets, knowing very well, that he'll also find many commonalities and patterns.

# Introductory Reading Guide

With these last four keys, I believe I provided you with a solid foundation for you to continue your journey into Jungian Psychology. That said, one question I get all the time is: ""In what order should I read the *collected works*”?

Say less, I got you! If I had to do it all over again that’s exactly what I’d follow:

**1 – “Man and His Symbols”.**

I suggest reading only chapters 1 (Jung’s chapter) and 3 (Von Franz’s). Jung wrote this book after a dream that propelled him to create something for the layman to get acquainted with his ideas, making this a perfect introduction.

**2 – Volume 10 – “Civilization in Transition” – Chapter 4 – “The Undiscovered Self (Present and Future)”.**

In this chapter, Jung explores what self-knowledge truly means. He criticizes the statistical and scientific method, and presents us with how we can develop our own personalities and individuality.

**3 - Volume 16 – “The Practice of Psychotherapy” – Part I.**

This is the only book where Carl Jung gives a detailed explanation of his methods and the foundations of his thinking. Furthermore, he gives a clear explanation of the development of personality and his views on psychotherapy. Just an amazing book overall.

**4 – volume 17 – “Development of Personality” – Chapter 7 also entitled “The Development of Personality”.**

This is one of my favorite chapters of all time and I feel inspired every time I read it. It’s important to say that “development of personality” and “*individuation process*” are synonyms, and in this book, Jung explores in-depth what this truly means and what it entails.

**5 – Volume 9 – “Aion” – The First 4 Chapters – “The Ego, The Shadow, The Syzygy, and The Self”.**

This book is so hard to understand that the editors asked Jung to prepare an introduction about his main concepts. This is the only time you’ll see him writing about his ideas in individual chapters.

**6 – Volume 18 – “Symbolic Life” – Chapter 12 – “A reply to Martin Bubber”.**

This is an essential read to clearly understand Jung’s position on religion and metaphysics. Spoiler alert: If you believe he was gnostic or a mad wizard you’ll be disappointed.

**7 – Volume 7 – “Two Essays On Analytical Psychology”.**

Now that you have a good background it’s time to read the whole volume 7. Every bit of Jung’s ideas are in this volume, making this one of his most important works.

**8 – Volume 18 – “Symbolic Life”- Chapter 1 – “*****The Travistock Lectures*****”.**

Here’s where Jung introduces his typological method, the backbone of his psychology. It also has an introductory feel to it and it’s great to read this instead of jumping right into volume 6 – The Psychological Types. Furthermore, you can see how the British fellows were trying to grill him, which also adds to an enjoyable reading, haha.

**9 – Volume 9.1 – “Archetypes of the Collective Unconscious” – First 3 Chapters – “Archetypes of the Collective Unconscious”, “The Concept of the Collective Unconscious”, “Concerning the Archetypes, with Special Reference to the Anima Concept”.**

Lastly, these chapters can give you a better understanding of the concept of *archetypes* and their applications.

**10 – Volume 6 – “The Psychological Types”- Chapter 5 – “The Type Problem In Poetry”.**

In this chapter, Jung introduces his most important idea and the goal of his entire work: The *symbol formation process*. He explores the redeeming journey our soul must endure in order to unite the opposites within, unraveling the *Self.*

**11 – Bonus 1 – “Animus and Anima” – by Emma Jung.**

Emma Jung was Carl Jung’s wife, so I guess there’s no one better to teach us about the *animus* and *anima*. Her writing style is clear and concise, a pleasant reading overall.

**12 – Bonus 2 – “Inner Work” – by Robert Johnson.**

Robert Johnson did a great job synthesizing Carl Jung's method of dream analysis and active imagination. You can tell he is very familiar with Jung's works. Plus, he provides many practical examples and interesting tips and uses accessible language. I believe this is a great introduction, especially if you feel overwhelmed by Jung's collected works.

**13 – Pro Tip – Volume 6 – “The Psychological Types” – Chapter 11 – Definitions.**

In the final part of this volume, Jung left us a kind of “dictionary”. Whenever you’re feeling lost and can’t understand what the heck he’s talking about, you can check the terms and concepts there.

**PS**: I can already see a few people rolling their eyes saying this is too much and asking me what would be absolutely essential to read. Well, Just read the first part of Volume 16, The *Travistock Lectures,* and the whole Volume 7.

# Intermediate Reading Guide

I could've stopped at the beginner’s guide, but I know there’s a few insatiable souls like me reading this right now, so I’ll also share with you an intermediate reading guide. The following books are crucial to acquire a solid foundation in Jungian Psychology:

**1 – Volume 6 – “The Psychological Types”.**

Volume 6 explores the backbone of Jungian Psychology, namely the *psychological types*. This knowledge is crucial to understanding everything about *psychodynamics, individuation,*  and his most advanced works, such as alchemy. Pay especial attention to chapter V, where Jung explores the *symbol formation process*.

**2 – ""Psychotherapy"" - Marie Von Franz.**

Marie Von Franz is the righteous heiress of Jungian Psychology and this is one of her masterpieces.  Moreover, understanding Jung becomes a lot easier when you see it through her eyes.

**3 – Volume 8 – “Structures and Dynamics of The Psyche”.**

This book is an important foundation for understanding Carl Jung's epistemology and important ideas such as *complexes* and *archetypes,* dream analysis, the notion of *psychic reality,* and *psychic energy* and *synchronicity.*

**4 – Volume 5 – “Symbols of Transformation”.**

This one is mind-blowing since Jung explores his most valuable idea, the *symbol formation.* In other words, he dissects the process of transformation our personality must endure in the different periods of our lives. This book is a map to understand the works of the inner center - The *Self*. For a complete picture, this book must be paired with Chapter V - ""The Type Problem in Poetry"" - from Volume 6, and the first chapter of Volume 8 - “On Psychic Energy”.

**5 - “Alchemy - An introduction to the Symbolism and the Psychology” - Marie Von Franz**

Finally, this book demystifies the relationship between psychology and alchemy and why it was relevant for Carl Jung structuring his ideas. There was no one better to give this introduction since Marie Von Franz was the one who translated most of the pieces Carl Jung used for his books. Moreover, Von Franz was the one who finished *Mysterium Coniunctionis*. After this book, you'll be ready to attack Carl Jung's most advanced works.

Lastly, I know that following this guide is for very few people and honestly, if you don't devote a lot of time and know how to apply Jung's highly abstract concepts, it'll be a waste of time.

That's why I wrote my book **PISTIS - Demystifying Jungian Psychology**, in which I synthesized Carl Jung's whole body of work with simple language and practical advice.

This is the best way possible to start with Jungian Psychology and apply it right away, you can [download your free copy here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jung/comments/1b2ghif/i_wrote_an_introductory_book_to_jungian/).

How To Read Carl Jung (Demystifying The Collected Works),ShadowWork,1i9nasp,2025-01-25 08:48:49,4,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowWork/comments/1i9nasp/how_to_read_carl_jung_demystifying_the_collected/,Rafaelkruger,,"To end the **Demystifying Jungian Psychology Series**, I’d like to leave you a few extra keys that will help you understand how Carl Jung structured his psychology around striving to conciliate the paradoxical nature of the *psyche*.

Jung follows a few precepts he calls *antinomies,* which can also be understood as paradoxes. Once again, I’d like to mention the works of Heráclito Pinheiro who introduced me to this line of thought and guides, to which I made sight changes.

By the way, if you're not a nerd like me, I allow you to jump right into the reading guide section, lol.

# Antinomies

*The Practice of Psychotherapy* is the only book in which Carl Jung reveals concisely how he thinks about his psychology and his psychotherapeutic method. Jung states that “The psyche is infinitely more complicated than light; hence a great number of antinomies is required to describe the nature of the psyche satisfactorily” (C. G. Jung - V16 - §1). In this light, there are four major precepts Carl Jung follows:

**1 - “Psyche depends on body and body depends on psyche”.**

This first antinomy refers to the conflict between *psyche* and matter. In psychology, this debate revolves mainly around the physicalist perspective, i.e., if the *psyche* is a mere epiphenomenon of the brain. If that’s the case, the *psyche* would be considered a mere fruit of brain activity and it would be possible to influence it exclusively through physiological interventions. Taking this view to an extreme, we would be able to solve every psychological problem with surgeries and medication.

We have to remember that Carl Jung was a doctor and was obviously aware of the influence of the body over the *psyche*, but his findings dictate that the opposite is also true, the *psyche* can also influence the body\*.\* However, we can’t isolate either one of them, as both are interdependent, that’s why it’s a paradox. Furthermore, Carl Jung was interested in creating a psychology capable of holding these opposing and complementary truths, intending to create a new way of studying the *psyche* that’s different from the materialistic standpoint, giving the *psyche* its own dignity.

**2 - “The individual signifies nothing in comparison with the universal, and the universal signifies nothing in comparison with the individual"".**

This second antinomy refers to the paradox between the individual and the collective truth. Every time we try to create a formula and something that’s generally valid, we’re disregarding individuality. This creates a major problem since we need generally valid truths to live in society, to share knowledge, and to have replicability. However, it’s impossible to encompass everyone and every individual perspective. Carl Jung was aware that he needed to create a psychology that was capable of being generally valid, but at the same time, it had to respect individuality. That’s precisely why, as we’ve seen in the first chapter, he never created a theory, but a map to navigate the *psyche*.

**3 - “A psychological statement is only true if its opposite can be asserted”.**

This antinomy makes a direct reference to the paradoxical nature of the *psyche,* as truth is dependent on the perspective you adopt. For instance, as we’ve discussed in the *psychological types* chapter, every statement that we make about extroverts works in the exact opposite manner for introverts, and vice-versa. When interpreting dreams, we can always interpret in a positive or negative light, the right interpretation is dependent on the individual's *conscious attitude*. Lastly, a strong ego-complex is one capable of holding opposing and complementary truths, which is the premise for the *individuation process*.

**4 - “In psychotherapy there are no rules”.**

In this last antinomy, Carl Jung is explaining once again his attitude toward theories. But since this statement also needs to follow his own precept, psychotherapy does have rules and at the same time, it doesn’t. We certainly need knowledge of common and recurring patterns and they’re extremely relevant to share and expand psychological knowledge, however, we always have to understand how this is being expressed in a single individual. Carl Jung even states that he needs to be ready to produce a new and unique understanding to every patient he meets, knowing very well, that he'll also find many commonalities and patterns.

"Is Working In a Restaurant Hard? Yes, and That’s Why I’d Recommend It",ImogenSharma,1i9mk01,2025-01-25 08:06:47,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ImogenSharma/comments/1i9mk01/is_working_in_a_restaurant_hard_yes_and_thats_why/,ImogenSharma,Experience,"When I was 23, I started working in a restaurant. I had no work ethic. In fact, that’s too generous. I had negative work ethic. At school, I sailed by thanks to a good memory, never learning the value of hard work. My undiagnosed issues looked and felt like laziness, until my very first day on the job as a waitress. Ever since, I’ve been on an unstoppable journey toward self-actualization—or whatever you want to call it.

Is working in a restaurant hard? Yes, absolutely. Back of house is even harder than front of house, but both will test your mettle and give you a solid foundation for a career. You might want a long-term career in hospitality, where you can quickly climb the ranks and earn good money if you work hard. Alternatively, like me, a restaurant job could be your stepping stone to the career of your dreams.

Keep reading to learn what makes working in a restaurant so hard and why that might be the best thing that ever happens to you.

# Why Working in a Restaurant Is Hard

Working in a restaurant is hard, but there are tons of opportunities to progress, no matter your skill set or preferences I was lucky to work at some incredible venues, including the steakhouses Hawksmoor, Boisdale, and Smith & Wollensky, and I’d recommend all of them in a heartbeat. There were amazing senior team members and peers at each place whom I owe a lot to. And I learned something beautiful from all of them.

If you’re willing to put in the effort, people will help you out. It’s a tight-knit, family-like environment that I would particularly recommend to individuals whose home lives were unstable growing up. 

Here’s what makes working in a restaurant hard and how it will build your character if you fully commit.

# A Lot of Physical Exertion

Legs burn. Arms ache. Sweat collects in places you didn’t know existed. Most people don’t realize how physical restaurant work can be until they endure a busy dinner rush that never seems to end. The constant movement—dashing between tables, balancing multiple plates, hovering over a sizzling grill, gracefully sidestepping unexpected spills, or offering quick reassurances to anxious customers—demands real athleticism. 

Oddly enough, it becomes exhilarating. Your heart pounds as you weave around coworkers in a dance that only makes sense to those who’ve done it. Over time, you notice improved stamina, and you might even appreciate the built-in cardio aspect. It’s like stumbling into a free workout plan, minus the fancy gym membership.

# You Have to Learn Fast and Rely on Initiative

Managers don’t have time for hand-holding when the dinner rush hits. Tickets pour in, customers wave for your attention, the phone rings, coworkers call your name for help, and online orders pop up with special requests—and you’re expected to handle it all—even on your first week. That immersive trial-by-fire can feel overwhelming, but it quickly reveals hidden strengths. Memorizing the menu, sorting out the point-of-sale system, and figuring out how to solve mini-crises on the spot sharpen your reflexes. 

There’s no better way to show you’re proactive than by taking out the trash before anyone mentions it or restocking the fridge right when supplies run low. Quick thinking, plus a can-do attitude, will carry you far in any future job.

# People Are Rude to You Every Day

It’s rough, but it happens. Some diners complain about details you can’t control, others talk down to you like you’re incompetent, a few might even snap their fingers to get your attention, certain patrons glare at you for trivial issues, and occasional conspiracy theorists accuse you of sabotaging their meal. 

Early on, I felt tears welling up more often than I’d like to admit. There’s a jolt of shock the first time a customer lashes out because the kitchen ran out of salmon, and you have to stand there, apologizing for something you had zero part in. Adapting to that level of confrontation builds a thick skin faster than anything I’ve experienced. Techniques like validating their frustration (without taking blame for what isn’t your fault) can defuse the tension. Later, you realize these same techniques work wonders when dealing with tough bosses, irritated family members, or any other prickly encounters outside the restaurant world.

Deeper empathy emerges here too. While rude behavior is never okay, you learn that many customers bring stress from elsewhere—maybe a horrendous day at work or a fight with their spouse. You happen to be in the line of fire at the worst time. Leaning into understanding can prevent your temper from flaring, and it teaches you to navigate conflict gracefully under pressure.

# You’re Working While Everyone You Serve Is Having a Great Time

Groups show up with birthday balloons, couples sip champagne on date night, families laugh at inside jokes you’ll never hear the punchline to, rowdy friends celebrate promotions with loud toasts, and solo diners quietly savor a well-deserved break. You might be sweating profusely, ushering plates to their tables. Yes, it stings a bit when you see folks relaxing while you’re hustling.

The upside is that you share in their joy by making sure every dish arrives hot, every drink tastes perfect, every greeting feels warm, every request gets handled promptly, and every small detail feels just right. Once you recognize your role in creating those memories, a sense of purpose overrides the envy.

# You Have to Move Quickly to Do Well

Restaurants thrive on speed, and that’s no secret. Guests expect dishes promptly, and a delay in any step slows the entire system. Servers juggle multiple tables, line cooks scramble to plate dishes simultaneously, bartenders pour drinks at lightning speed—often while chatting with guests, hosts juggle new arrivals on the waitlist, and dishwashers race to keep everything spotless.

Each shift refines your agility, turning you into a master of multitasking. You learn shortcuts that don’t compromise quality, and you find subtle ways to shave seconds off each task. Before you know it, you’re anticipating the next request before the guest even speaks. This skill of controlled urgency has real-world implications, whether you head into corporate offices or run your own business.

# High-Paying Restaurant Jobs Are Very Demanding

Not every position in a restaurant offers glamorous pay, but certain roles can be lucrative. High-end bartenders skilled in craft mixology often bring home hefty tips, and sous chefs at upscale establishments may earn competitive salaries. The key lies in the relentless standards. Missing a garnish detail at a fancy steakhouse or messing up a signature cocktail order can feel catastrophic. Patrons who pay top dollar expect perfection, and top-tier management will push you hard to deliver it. That environment breeds razor-sharp skills and a reputation for excellence—two assets that can open massive doors if you stick with the industry.

Expanding your skill set becomes a necessity. Learning different cooking techniques, memorizing hundreds of cocktail recipes, mastering the art of table-side meat carving, perfecting dessert flambés on the spot, or discovering the nuances of international wine pairings puts you in line for bigger tips or higher positions. You might find it terrifying in the beginning, but the payoff can be remarkable if you’re hungry for success.

# Having a Healthy Lifestyle Is Challenging Due to Shift Work

Late nights, unpredictable schedules, split shifts, sudden staff shortages, and last-minute menu changes test your self-care commitment. Sleep often takes a back seat, and grabbing the quickest snack can seem like the only option in the frenzy. Stress from back-to-back shifts can drive you to guzzle energy drinks or rely on sugar just to keep going.

Cultivating healthier habits requires extra determination. Making meals in bulk, sipping water during short breaks, building a consistent wind-down routine, sneaking in power naps whenever possible, and planning healthier grab-and-go snacks might sound easy in theory, but it’s surprisingly tough when you crawl home at midnight and have to open the restaurant again in less than 12 hours.

# There Are Tons of Unwritten Rules

A kitchen feels like a secret society where everyone grasps the hidden etiquette—from exactly how to call out orders to which dishwasher you can ask for “just one more clean frying pan” during the dinner rush. Misreading these unspoken boundaries can cause friction. Ego battles sometimes flare up when a new hire doesn’t realize who handles a particular task or how the head chef prefers the plates stacked. Observing the hierarchy and paying attention to subtle cues teach you the diplomatic side of restaurant life.

Over time, you’ll also pick up on staff shortcuts, like the best way to hustle soup bowls to the line without cluttering someone else’s station. These micro-adjustments keep everyone from crashing into each other during the busiest hours. That social and situational awareness becomes second nature—a valuable asset for any collaborative environment outside the restaurant.

# What Is the Hardest Job in a Restaurant?

Debates about the most challenging role never end. Certain positions carry an aura of difficulty, though, so here’s a quick breakdown of who faces the largest hurdles—and why.

# Head Chef (10/10)

Leadership in a high-pressure environment defines the Head Chef. Every dish, every plating decision, and every supply order lands on their shoulders. If the sauce is bland or someone overcooks the fish, Head Chef gets the blame.

Those who excel in this role relish the creative freedom and sheer strength needed to juggle the demands of staff supervision, cost control, and menu innovation. The payoff lies in seeing your vision come to life on every plate that leaves the kitchen.

# Sous Chef (9/10)

Second-in-command doesn’t mean second in stress. The Sous Chef acts as a vital link between the Head Chef and the rest of the brigade. Keeping morale high in the kitchen, confirming that each station is prepped, and stepping in to fix issues on the fly drains energy fast. Those who excel at organization and crisis management tend to thrive. Plenty of Sous Chefs eventually climb the ranks to become Head Chefs themselves.

# Line Cook (8/10)

Cooking entrée after entrée in a chaos-filled environment demands laser-like focus. One overcooked steak can disrupt the timing for the entire table, while one missed ingredient can ruin a dish.

There’s an intense satisfaction, though, in mastering a station. The repetitive motions almost become meditative once you hit your stride. Adrenaline spikes as ticket orders fly in, and you turn raw ingredients into works of art—hopefully without burning your fingertips in the process.

# Dishwasher (7/10)

Teetering stacks of dirty dishes never stop coming, and heat from the washer fogs the entire station. This role can feel invisible, but without clean dishes, nothing moves forward. It’s physically draining, often wet, and usually relentless. The upside? You get an unmatched sense of satisfaction when that final rush of plates comes in, you power through, and the kitchen remains fully stocked with clean equipment.

Some dishwashers move on to prep or line cook roles, taking the next step with foundational knowledge of how the kitchen operates behind the scenes.

# Server (8/10)

Serving means wearing multiple hats at once: memorizing menus, reading customers’ moods, and delivering speedy service while staying friendly, anticipating subtle nonverbal cues, and pivoting gracefully when guests change their minds. Handling complicated special requests or dealing with grumpy tables adds mental weight. Servers often rely on tips for the majority of their income, creating an extra layer of pressure.

On a good night, you’ll walk out with a fat stack of cash. On a rough night, you’ll question why you signed up for the job. Either way, your multitasking skills grow, and you develop the ability to handle high-stakes situations with a smile.

# Bartender (8/10)

Charming patrons while mixing drinks at lightning speed sounds glamorous until you have to restock an empty fridge mid-rush or quickly craft complicated cocktail recipes for a crowd three-deep at the bar. Remembering faces, favorite drinks, quirky orders, off-menu item requests, and unique garnish preferences becomes part of the gig. Personality helps a lot, because patrons often come for the conversation just as much as the beverage. A bartender who masters showmanship and efficiency can earn fantastic tips—although the mental and physical strain sneaks up quickly if you’re not pacing yourself.

# Host/Hostess (6/10)

Greetings at the front door set the stage for each guest’s experience. Cozy couples, large groups, restless families with small kids, coworkers out for happy hour, and solo travelers on business might all arrive simultaneously, clamoring for seating.

Maintaining calm while juggling reservations and wait times calls for strong organizational skills. The physical demands aren’t extreme, but stress levels can climb on busy nights. If you excel at making people feel welcome and balancing multiple demands at once, it’s a great introduction to the hospitality world.

# Restaurant Manager (9/10)

Management covers budgeting, scheduling, menu planning, conflict resolution, and troubleshooting everything from a broken fryer to an understaffed shift. Staffers rely on you for guidance, while owners expect you to keep profits high and costs low.

A single shift can swing from a friendly business meeting with a vendor, to a tense conversation with a late employee, followed by soothing an angry customer, assisting a panicked kitchen staff with supply shortages, and rearranging the entire floor plan for a surprise party. The mental load is considerable, but the fulfillment of orchestrating an excellent dining experience can be immense.

# Carve Your Career Path in Hospitality

That’s a glimpse into why people keep asking, “Is working in a restaurant hard?” Nobody denies the intensity—it’s grueling, sweaty, sometimes thankless. Yet every tough moment builds a skill set that transforms your resilience, efficiency, and understanding of human nature. A server evolves into a bartender who learns creative mixology, then transitions into management, writes a best-selling cocktail book, volunteers as a local food festival judge, or opens a place of their own. A dishwasher discovers a hidden passion for cooking and eventually becomes a sous chef. Doors keep opening if you keep learning.

Some stay with restaurants for life, loving the thrill of the dinner rush and the camaraderie of the kitchen. Others translate these lessons into new fields like event planning, sales, freelancing, entrepreneurship, gourmet catering, or hospitality consulting, because they’ve mastered dealing with chaos, deadlines, demanding personalities, high-stakes decision-making, and intense public scrutiny. Anyone feeling alone in this quest can tap into a whole community of hospitality veterans who share tips, trade war stories, and look out for each other.

Nothing else compares to the adrenaline of a packed house at 7 p.m., or the relief of that final table leaving at midnight. A restaurant job demands so much, yet it gives back in the form of pride, newfound grit, and the knowledge you can handle just about anything life throws at you. Lean into the hustle. You may find that conquering hard becomes a habit that shapes the rest of your journey—inside and outside the dining room.

Disagree with my rankings for hardest job in a restaurant? Tell me what you think in the comments. If you thrive on a challenge and are considering working in hospitality, my advice is to go for it. You’ll learn loads, meet amazing people, eat delicious food, and master the basics of working and taking care of business.

Detailed Guide - How I've Been Self Employed for 2 Years Selling Posters,sidehustle,1i9mi9w,2025-01-25 08:03:57,35,0.87,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/sidehustle/comments/1i9mi9w/detailed_guide_how_ive_been_self_employed_for_2/,tommo278,Success Story,"Hey everyone, bit of context before you read through this. I have been selling POD posters full time for over 2 years now. My next venture is that I have started my own Print on Demand company for posters, PrintShrimp. As one way of creating customers for our service, we are teaching people for free how to also sell posters. Here is a guide I have written on how to sell posters on Etsy. Feel free to have a read through and then check out PrintShrimp, hopefully can help some of you guys out (and get us some more customers!)

All of this is also available in video format on our website too, if you prefer to learn that way. Thanks guys! And as some people asked in other subs, no this isn't written with AI 😅 This took a couple of weeks to put together!

Through this guide, we will teach you everything you need to know about starting to sell posters and generate some income. We will also show you why PrintShrimp is the best POD supplier for all of your poster needs. Trust me, you won’t need much convincing. 

**So, why are posters the best product to sell?**

Also, just thought I’d quickly answer the question - ***why posters?*** If you’ve been researching Print on Demand you’ve probably come across the infinite options of t-shirts, mugs, hats, phone cases, and more. All of these are viable options, however we think posters are the perfect place to start. You can always expand into other areas further down the line! So a brief summary of why posters are the perfect product for Print on Demand:

\-They are ***very easy to design***! Posters are a very easy shape to deal with - can’t go wrong with a rectangle. This makes designing products very easy.

\-Similarly to this, ***what you see is what you get*** with a poster. You can literally see your finished product as you design it in either canva or photoshop. With T-Shirts for example, you have to make your design, and then place it on a t-shirt. Then you have to coordinate with your printers the size you would like the design on the tshirt and many other variables like that. There is no messing about with posters - what you see is what you get.

\-***The same high quality, everywhere***. With other products, if you want to reap the benefits of a printing in various countries, you need to ensure each of your global suppliers stocks the same t-shirts, is able to print in the same way, carries the same sizes etc. Again with posters you avoid all of this hassle- your products will come out the same, no matter which of our global locations are used.

\-They have a ***very favorable profit margin***. As you will see later, the cost price of posters is very low. And people are prepared to pay quite a lot for a decent bit of wall art! I have tried out other products, and the profit margin combined with the order quantity of posters makes them my most profitable product, every single time. Using PrintShrimp, you can be sure to enjoy profits of anywhere between £6 - £40 pure profit per sale. 

\-They are one of the ***easiest to print white label***. This makes them perfect for Print on Demand. Your posters are simply put in a tube, and off they go. There are no extras you need to faff around with, compared to the extra elements other products come with, such as clothing labels on t-shirts. 

**Picking your poster niche**

So, you are ready to start selling posters. Great! Now, the blessing and curse with selling posters is that there are ***infinite possibilities*** regarding what you can sell. So, it can easily be quite overwhelming at first. 

The first thing I would recommend doing is having a ***look at what others are selling***. Etsy is a wonderful place for this (and will likely be a key part of your poster selling journey). So, log on to Etsy and simply type in ‘poster’ in the search bar. Get ready to write a massive list of the broad categories and type of posters that people are selling. 

If you do not have more than 50 categories written down by the end, you are doing something wrong. There are seriously an infinite amount of posters! For example, here are some popular ones to get you started:

Star sign posters, Kitchen posters, World map posters, Custom Dog Portrait posters, Music posters, Movie posters, Fine art posters, Skiing posters, Girl Power posters and Football posters. 

Now, you have a huge list of potential products to sell. What next? There are a few important things you need to bear in mind when picking your niche:

\-**Does this interest me?** 

Don’t make the mistake of going down a niche that didn’t actually interest you just because it would probably be a money maker. Before you know it, what can be a very fun process of making designs can become incredibly \*\*\*monotonous, and feel like a chore\*\*\*. You need to bear in mind that you will be spending a lot of time creating designs - if it is something you are interested in you are much less likely to get burnt out! As well, \*\*\*creativity will flow\*\*\* far better if it is something you are interested in, which at the end of the day will lead to better designs that are more likely to be purchased by customers. 

\-Is this within my design range?

Don’t let this put you off too much. We will go through how to get started on design later on in this guide. However, it is important to note that the plain truth of it is that some niches and designs are a hell of a lot more complicated than others. For example, quote posters can essentially be designed by anyone when you learn about how to put nice fonts together in a good color scheme. On the other hand, some posters you see may have been designed with complex illustrations in a program like Illustrator. To start with, it may be better to pick a niche that seems a bit more simple to get into, as you can always expand your range with other stores further down the line. A good way of evaluating the design complexity is by identifying if this poster is \*\*\*a lot of elements put together\*\*\* or is \*\*\*a lot of elements created by the designer themselves\*\*\*\*\*.\*\* Design can in a lot of cases be like a jigsaw - putting colours, shapes and text together to create an image. This will be a lot easier to start with and can be learnt by anyone, compared to complex drawings and illustrations. 

\-Is this niche subject to copyright issues?

Time to delve deep into good old copyright. Now, when you go through Etsy, you will without a doubt see hundreds of sellers selling music album posters, car posters, movie posters and more. Obviously, these posters contain the property of musicians, companies and more and are therefore copyrighted. The annoying thing is - these are \*\*\*a complete cash cow.\*\*\* If you go down the music poster route, I will honestly be surprised if you \*\*don’t\*\* make thousands. However it is only a matter of time before the copyright strikes start rolling in and you eventually get banned from Etsy. 

So I would highly recommend \*\*\*not making this mistake\*\*\*. Etsy is an incredible platform for selling posters, and it is a hell of a lot easier to make sales on there compared to advertising your own website. And, you \*\*\*only get one chance on Etsy.\*\*\* Once you have been banned once, you are not allowed to sign up again (and they do ID checks - so you won’t be able to rejoin again under your own name). 

So, don’t be shortsighted when it comes to entering Print on Demand. If you keep your designs legitimate, they will last you a lifetime and you will then later be able to crosspost them to other platforms, again without the worry of ever getting shut down. 

**So, how do I actually design posters?**

Now you have an idea of what kind of posters you want to be making, it’s time to get creative and make some designs! Photoshop (and the creative cloud in general) is probably the best for this. However, when starting out it can be a scary investment (it costs about £30 a month unless you can get a student rate!). 

So, while Photoshop is preferable in the long term, when starting out you can learn the ropes of design and get going with Canva. This can be great at the start as they have a load of templates that you can use to get used to designing and experimenting (while it might be tempting to slightly modify these and sell them - this will be quite saturated on places like Etsy so we would recommend doing something new). 

**What size format should I use?**

The best design format to start with is arguably the A sizes - as all the A sizes (A5, A4, A3, A2, A1, A0) are ***scalable***. This means that you can make all of your designs in one size, for example A3, and these designs will be ready to fit to all other A sizes. For example, if you design an A3 poster and someone orders A1, you can just upload this A3 file to PrintShrimp and it will be ready to print.

There is a wide range of other sizes you should consider offering on your shop, especially as these sizes are very popular with the American market. They have a wide range of popular options, which unfortunately aren’t all scalable with each other. This does mean that you will therefore have to make some slight modifications to your design in order to be able to offer them in American sizing, in a few different aspect ratios.

What you can do however is design all of your products in UK sizing, and simply redesign to fit American sizing once you have had an order. Essentially: design in UK sizing, but list in both UK and US sizing. Then when you get a non-A size order, you can quickly redesign it on demand. This means that you don’t have to make a few different versions of each poster when first designing, and can simply do a quick redesign for US sizing when you need to.

Below is PrintShrimps standard size offering. We can also offer any custom sizing too, so please get in touch if you are looking for anything else. With these sizes, your poster orders will be dispatched domestically in whatever country your customer orders from.

**Our recommendations for starting design**

One thing that will not be featured in this guide is a written out explanation or guide on how to design. Honestly, I can’t think of a more boring, or frankly worse, way to learn design. When it comes to getting started, ***experimenting is your best friend!*** Just have a play around and see what you can do. It is a really fun thing to get started with, and the satisfaction of when a poster design comes together is like no other.

A good way to start is honestly by straight up ***copying a poster you see for sale online***. And we don’t mean copying to sell! But just trying to replicate other designs is a great way to get a feel for it and what you can do. We really think you will be surprised at how easy it is to pull together a lot of designs that at first can appear quite complicated!

Your best friend throughout this whole process will be ***google.*** At the start you will not really know how to do anything - but learning how to look into things you want to know about design is all part of the process. At first, it can be quite hard to even know how to search for what you are trying to do, but this will come with time (we promise). Learning ***how to google*** is a skill that you will learn throughout this process. 

Above all, what we think is most important is this golden rule: ***take inspiration but do not steal***. You want to be ***selling similar products in your niche, but not copies***. You need to see what is selling in your niche and get ideas from that, but if you make designs too similar to ones already available, you won’t have much luck. At the end of the day, if two very similar posters are for sale and one shop has 1000 reviews and your newer one has 2, which one is the customer going to buy? You need to make yours offer something different and stand out enough to attract customers.

**Etsy SEO and maximizing your sales**

You may have noticed in this guide we have mentioned Etsy quite a few times! That is because we think it is hands down the best place to ***start selling*** posters. Why? Etsy is a go to place for many looking to decorate their homes and also to buy gifts. It might be tempting to start selling with your own website straight away, however we recommend Etsy as it ***brings the customers to you.*** For example, say you start selling Bathroom Posters. It is going to be a hell of a lot easier to convert sales when you already have customers being shown your page after searching ‘bathroom decor’, compared to advertising your own website. This is especially true as it can be hard to identify your ideal target audience to then advertise to via Meta (Facebook/Instagram) for example. Websites are a great avenue to explore eventually like I now have, but we recommend starting with Etsy and going from there.

**What costs do I need to be aware of?**

So, setting up an Etsy sellers account is currently costs £15. The only other **upfront** cost you will have is the cost of listing a product - this is 20 cents per listing. From then on, every time you make a sale you will be charged a transaction fee of 6.5%, a small payment processing fee, plus another 20 cents for a renewed listing fee. It normally works out to about 10% of each order, a small price to pay for all the benefits Etsy brings. No matter what platform you sell on, you will be faced with some form of transaction fee. Etsy is actually quite reasonable especially as they do not charge you to use their platform on a monthly basis. 

**What do I need to get selling?**

**1. Getting your shop looking pretty**

\-Think of a shop name and design (now you are a professional designer) a logo

\-Design a banner for the top of your shop

\-Add in some about me info/shop announcement

\-I recommend running a sale wherein orders of 3+ items get a 20% of discount. Another big benefit of PrintShrimp is that you receive large discounts when ordering multiple posters. This is great for attracting buyers and larger orders. 

**2. Making your products look attractive**

That is the bulk of the ‘decor’ you will need to do. Next up is ***placing your posters in mock ups!*** As you may notice on Etsy, most shops show their posters framed and hanging on walls. These are 99% of the time not real photos, but digital mock ups. This is where Photoshop comes in really handy, as you can automate this process through a plug in called Bulk Mock Up. If you don’t have photoshop, you can do this on Canva, you will just have to do it manually which can be rather time consuming. 

Now, where can you get the actual Mock Ups? One platform we highly recommend for design in general is platforms like ***Envato Elements***. These are design marketplaces where you have access to millions of design resources that you are ***fully licensed*** to use! 

**3. Titles, tags, and descriptions** 

Now for the slightly more nitty gritty part. You could have the world's most amazing looking poster, however, if you do not get the Etsy SEO right, ***no one is going to see it!*** We will take you through creating a new Etsy listing field by field so you can know how to best list your products. 

The key to Etsy listing optimisation is to ***maximise.*** Literally cram in as many key words as you possibly can! Before you start this process, create a word map of anything you can think of relating to your listing. And come at this from the point of view of, ***if I was looking for a poster like mine, what would I search?***

**Titles**

\-Here you are blessed with 140 characters to title your listing. Essentially, start off with a concise way of properly describing your poster. And then afterwards, add in as many key words as you can! Here is an example of the title of a well selling Skiing poster:

Les Arcs Skiing Poster, Les Arcs Print, Les Alpes, France Ski Poster, Skiing Poster, Snowboarding Poster, Ski Resort Poster Holiday, French

This is 139 characters out of 140 - you should try and maximise this as much as possible! As you can see, this crams in a lot of key words and search terms both related to Skiing as a whole, ***the poster category,*** and then the ***specifics of the poster itself*** (Les Arcs resort in France).

Bear in mind that if you are listing a lot of listings that are of the same theme, you won’t have to spend time creating an entirely new title. For example if your next poster was of a ski resort in Italy, you can copy this one over and just swap out the specifics. For example change “France ski poster” to “Italy ski poster”, change “Les Arcs” to “The Dolomites”, etc. 

**Description**

\-Same logic applies for descriptions - try and cram in as many key words as you can! Here is an example for a Formula One poster:

George Russell, Mercedes Formula One Poster  ***- item specific keywords***

Bright, modern and vibrant poster to liven up your home.  - ***Describes the style of the poster***

All posters are printed on high quality, museum grade 200gsm poster paper. Suitable for framing and frames. - ***Shows the quality of the print. Mentions frames whilst showing it comes unframed***

Experience the thrill of the **racetrack** with this stunning **Formula One** poster. Printed on **high-quality** paper, this **racing car** **wall art print** features a dynamic image of a Formula One car in action, perfect for adding a touch of speed and excitement to any **motorsports room** or **man cave**. Whether you're a die-hard fan or simply appreciate the adrenaline of high-speed **racing**, this poster is sure to impress. Available in a range of sizes, it makes a great addition to your **home or office**, or as a **gift** for a fellow **Formula One enthusiast**. Each poster is **carefully packaged** to ensure **safe delivery**, so you can enjoy your new piece of **art** as soon as possible. - ***A nice bit of text really highlighting a lot of key words such as gift, motorsports, racetrack etc.*** 

You could go further with this too, by adding in extra things related to the poster such as ‘Perfect gift for a Mercedes F1 fan’ etc. 

**Tags**

Now, these are actually probably the ***most important part of your listing***! You get 13 tags (20 character limit for each) and there are essentially search terms that will match your listing with what customers search for when shopping. 

You really need to maximize these - whilst Title and Description play a part, these are the main things that will bring buyers to your listing. Once again, it is important to think about what customers are likely to be searching when looking for a poster similar to yours.

**Life hack alert!** You can actually ***see what tags other sellers are using***. All you need to do is go to a listing similar to yours that is selling well, scroll down and you can actually see them listed out at the bottom of the page! Here is an example of what this may look like:

So, go through a few listings of competitors and make notes on common denominators that you can integrate into your listing.

As you can see here, this seller uses tags such as ‘Birthday Gift’ and ‘Poster Print’. When you first start out, you may be better off ***swapping these out for more listing specific tags***. This seller has been on Etsy for a few years however and has 15,000+ sales, so are more likely to see success from these tags. 

If it’s not clear why, think about it this way. If you searched ‘poster print’ on Etsy today, there will be ***10s of thousands of results***. However, if you searched ‘Russell Mercedes Poster’, you will (as of writing) get ***336 results***. Etsy is far more likely to push your product to the top of the latter tag, against 300 other listings, rather than the top of ‘Poster Print’ where it is incredibly competitive. It is only when you are a more successful shop pulling in a high quantity of orders that these larger and more generic tags will work for you, as Etsy has more trust in your shop and will be more likely to push you to the front. 

**SKUs**

\-One important thing you need to do is add SKUs to all of your products! This is worth doing at the start as it will make your life so much easier when it comes to making sales and using PrintShrimp further down the line. What is an SKU? It is a ‘stock keeping unit’, and is essentially just a product identifier. Your ***SKUs need to match your file name*** that you upload to PrintShrimp. For example, if you made a poster about the eiffel tower, you can literally name the SKU eiffel-tower. There is no need to complicate things! As long as your file name (as in ***the image name of your poster on your computer***) matches your SKU, you will be good to go. 

\-It may be more beneficial to set up a system with unique identifiers, to make organising your files a lot easier further down the line. Say you get to 1000 posters eventually, you’ll want to be able to ***quickly search a code***, and also ensure every ***SKU is always unique***, so you won’t run into accidentally using the same SKU twice further down the line. For example, you can set it up so at the start of each file name, you have \[unique id\]\[info\], so your files will look like - 

A1eiffeltower

A2france

And further down the line:

A99aperolspritz

B1potatoart

This not only removes the potential issue of duplicating SKUs accidentally (for example if you made a few posters of the same subject), but also keeps your files well organised. If you need to find a file, you can search your files according to the code, so just by searching ‘a1’ for example, rather than having to trawl through a load of different files until you find the correct one.

\-If your poster has variations, for example color variations, you can set a ***different SKU for each variation***. Just click the little box when setting up variations that says ‘SKUs vary for each (variation)’. So if you have a poster available either in a white or black background, you can name each file, and therefore each SKU, a1eiffel-tower-black and a1eiffel-tower-white for example.

\-The same goes for different sizes. As different American sizes have different aspect ratios, as mentioned above you may have to reformat some posters if you get a sale for one of these sizes. You can then add in the SKU to your listing once you have reformatted your poster. So for example if you sell a 16x20” version of the eiffel tower poster, you can name this file eiffel-tower-white-1620. Whilst this involves a little bit of set up, the time it saves you overall is massive! 

**Variations and Prices**

\-So, when selling posters there is a huge variety of sizes that you can offer, as mentioned previously. Non-negotiable is that you should be offering A5-A1. These will likely be your main sellers! Especially in the UK. It is also a good idea to offer inch sizing to appeal to a global audience (as bear in mind with PrintShrimp you will be able to print in multiple countries around the world!). 

Below is a recommended pricing structure of what to charge on Etsy. Feel free to mess around with these! You may notice on Etsy that many shops charge a whole lot more for sizes such as A1, 24x36” etc. In my experience I prefer charging a lower rate to attract more sales, but there is validity in going for a lower amount of sales with higher profits.

As mentioned above, you can also offer different variations on items - for example different colour schemes on posters. This is always a decent idea (if it suits the design) as it provides the customer with more options, which might help to convert the sale. You can always add this in later however if you want to keep it simple while you start!

**Setting up shipping profiles**

Etsy makes it very easy to set up different shipping rates for different countries. However, luckily with PrintShrimp you can offer free shipping to the majority of the major countries that are active on Etsy! 

Using PrintShrimp means that your production costs are low enough in each domestic market to justify this. If you look on Etsy you can see there are many shops that ***post internationally*** to countries such as the US or Australia. Therefore, they often charge £8-10 in postage, and have a delivery time of 1-2 weeks. This really ***limits their customer base*** to their domestic market. 

Using PrintShrimp avoids this and means you can offer free shipping (as we absorb the shipping cost in our prices) to the major markets of the UK, Australia, and USA (Europe coming soon!). 

We also offer a ***1 day processing time,*** unlike many POD poster suppliers. This means you can set your Etsy processing time to just one day, which combined with our quick shipping, means you will be ***one of the quickest on Etsy*** at sending out orders. This is obviously very attractive for customers, who are often very impatient with wanting their orders! 

**Getting the sales and extra tips**

\-Don’t list an insane amount of listings when you first get started. Etsy will be like ‘hang on a second’ if a brand new shop suddenly has 200 items in the first week. ***Warm up your account***, and take things slow as you get going. We recommend 5 a day for the first week or so, and then you can start uploading more. You don’t want Etsy to flag your account for suspicious bot-like activity when you first get going. 

\-It is very easy to ***copy listings*** when creating a new one. Simply select an old listing and press copy, and then you can just change the listing specific details to create a new one, rather than having to start from scratch. It can feel like a bit of a ball-ache setting up your first ever listing, but from then on you can just copy it over and just change the specifics. 

\-Try and organize your listings into ***sections***! This really helps the customer journey. Sometimes a customer will click onto your shop after seeing one of your listings, so it really helps if they can easily navigate your shop for what they are looking for.

So, you now have a fully fledged Etsy shop. Well done! Time to start making £3,000 a month straight away right? Not quite. Please bear in mind, ***patience is key*** when starting out. If you started doing this because you are £10,000 in debt to the Albanian mafia and need to pay it off next week, you have come into this in the wrong frame of mind. If you have however started this to slowly build up a side hustle which hopefully one day become your full time gig, then winner winner chicken dinner. 

***Starting out on Etsy isn’t always easy.*** It takes time for your shop to build up trust! As I’ve said before, a buyer is far more likely to purchase from a shop with 1000s of reviews, than a brand new one with 0. But before you know it, you can become one of these shops!

One thing you can do at the very start is to ***encourage your friends and family to buy your posters!*** This is a slightly naughty way of getting a few sales at the start, of course followed by a few glowing 5\* reviews. It really helps to give your shop this little boost at the start, so if this is something you can do then I recommend it. 

Okay, so once you have a fully fledged shop with a decent amount of listings, you might be expecting the sales to start rolling in. And, if you are lucky, they indeed might. However, in my experience, you need to give your listings a little boost. So let us introduce you to:

**The wonderful world of Etsy ads**

Ads!! Oh no, that means money!! We imagine some of you more risk averse people are saying to yourself right now. And yes, it indeed does. But more often than not unfortunately you do ***have to spend money to make money***. 

Fortunately, in my experience anyway, ***Etsy ads do tend to work***. This does however only apply if your products are actually good however, so if you’re back here after paying for ads for 2 months and are losing money at the same rate as your motivation, maybe go back to the start of this guide and pick another niche. 

When you first start out, there are two main strategies. 

**Number 1: The Safer Option**

So, with PrintShrimp, you will essentially be making a minimum of £6 profit per order. With this in mind, I normally start a new shop with a safer strategy of advertising my products with a budget of $3-5 dollars a day. This then means that at the start, you only need to make 1 sale to break even, and anything above that is pure profit! This might not seem like the most dazzling proposition right now, but again please bear in mind that ***growth will be slow at the start.*** This means that you can gradually grow your shop, and therefore the trust that customers have in your shop, over time with a very small risk of ever actually losing money.

**Number 2: The Billy Big Balls Option**

If you were yawning while reading the first option, then this strategy may be for you. This will be better suited to those of you that are a bit more ***risk prone***, and it also helps if you have a bit more ***cash to invest*** at the start. Through this strategy, you can essentially ***pay your way to the top*** of Etsy's rankings. For this, you’ll probably be looking at spending $20 a day on ads. So, this can really add up quickly and is definitely the riskier option. In my experience, the level of sales with this may not always match up to your spend every day. You may find that some days you rake in about 10 sales, and other days only one. But what this does mean is that as your listings get seen and purchased more, they will begin to ***rank higher in Etsy’s organic search rankings***, at a much quicker rate than option one.

This is the beauty of Etsy’s ads. You can pay to boost your products, but then results from this paid promotion ***feed into the organic ranking of your products***. So you may find that you can splash the cash for a while at the start in order to race to the top, and then drop your ad spending later on when your products are already ranking well. 

**Sending your poster orders**

So, you’ve now done the hard bit. You have a running Etsy store, and essentially all you need to now on a daily basis is send out your orders and reply to customer messages! This is where it really becomes ***passive income.*** 

\-Check out the PrintShrimp order portal. Simply sign up, and you can place individual orders through there.

\-Bulk upload: We have an option to bulk upload your Esty orders via csv. 

Seriously, when you are up and running with your first store, it is really as easy as that. 

Once you have your first Etsy store up and running, you can think about expanding. There are many ways to expand your income.

I have been selling POD posters full time for over 2 years now. My next venture is that I have started my own Print on Demand company for posters, PrintShrimp. As one way of creating customers for our service, we are teaching people for free how to also sell posters. Here is a guide I have written on how to sell posters on Etsy. Feel free to have a read through and then check out PrintShrimp, hopefully can help some of you guys out (and get us some more customers!)

All of this is also available in video format on our website too, if you prefer to learn that way. Thanks guys!

Through this guide, we will teach you everything you need to know about starting to sell posters and generate some income. We will also show you why PrintShrimp is the best POD supplier for all of your poster needs. Trust me, you won’t need much convincing. 

**So, why are posters the best product to sell?**

Also, just thought I’d quickly answer the question - ***why posters?*** If you’ve been researching Print on Demand you’ve probably come across the infinite options of t-shirts, mugs, hats, phone cases, and more. All of these are viable options, however we think posters are the perfect place to start. You can always expand into other areas further down the line! So a brief summary of why posters are the perfect product for Print on Demand:

\-They are ***very easy to design***! Posters are a very easy shape to deal with - can’t go wrong with a rectangle. This makes designing products very easy.

\-Similarly to this, ***what you see is what you get*** with a poster. You can literally see your finished product as you design it in either canva or photoshop. With T-Shirts for example, you have to make your design, and then place it on a t-shirt. Then you have to coordinate with your printers the size you would like the design on the tshirt and many other variables like that. There is no messing about with posters - what you see is what you get.

\-***The same high quality, everywhere***. With other products, if you want to reap the benefits of a printing in various countries, you need to ensure each of your global suppliers stocks the same t-shirts, is able to print in the same way, carries the same sizes etc. Again with posters you avoid all of this hassle- your products will come out the same, no matter which of our global locations are used.

\-They have a ***very favorable profit margin***. As you will see later, the cost price of posters is very low. And people are prepared to pay quite a lot for a decent bit of wall art! I have tried out other products, and the profit margin combined with the order quantity of posters makes them my most profitable product, every single time. Using PrintShrimp, you can be sure to enjoy profits of anywhere between £6 - £40 pure profit per sale. 

\-They are one of the ***easiest to print white label***. This makes them perfect for Print on Demand. Your posters are simply put in a tube, and off they go. There are no extras you need to faff around with, compared to the extra elements other products come with, such as clothing labels on t-shirts. 

**Picking your poster niche**

So, you are ready to start selling posters. Great! Now, the blessing and curse with selling posters is that there are ***infinite possibilities*** regarding what you can sell. So, it can easily be quite overwhelming at first. 

The first thing I would recommend doing is having a ***look at what others are selling***. Etsy is a wonderful place for this (and will likely be a key part of your poster selling journey). So, log on to Etsy and simply type in ‘poster’ in the search bar. Get ready to write a massive list of the broad categories and type of posters that people are selling. 

If you do not have more than 50 categories written down by the end, you are doing something wrong. There are seriously an infinite amount of posters! For example, here are some popular ones to get you started:

Star sign posters, Kitchen posters, World map posters, Custom Dog Portrait posters, Music posters, Movie posters, Fine art posters, Skiing posters, Girl Power posters and Football posters. 

Now, you have a huge list of potential products to sell. What next? There are a few important things you need to bear in mind when picking your niche:

\-**Does this interest me?** 

Don’t make the mistake of going down a niche that didn’t actually interest you just because it would probably be a money maker. Before you know it, what can be a very fun process of making designs can become incredibly \*\*\*monotonous, and feel like a chore\*\*\*. You need to bear in mind that you will be spending a lot of time creating designs - if it is something you are interested in you are much less likely to get burnt out! As well, \*\*\*creativity will flow\*\*\* far better if it is something you are interested in, which at the end of the day will lead to better designs that are more likely to be purchased by customers. 

\-Is this within my design range?

Don’t let this put you off too much. We will go through how to get started on design later on in this guide. However, it is important to note that the plain truth of it is that some niches and designs are a hell of a lot more complicated than others. For example, quote posters can essentially be designed by anyone when you learn about how to put nice fonts together in a good color scheme. On the other hand, some posters you see may have been designed with complex illustrations in a program like Illustrator. To start with, it may be better to pick a niche that seems a bit more simple to get into, as you can always expand your range with other stores further down the line. A good way of evaluating the design complexity is by identifying if this poster is \*\*\*a lot of elements put together\*\*\* or is \*\*\*a lot of elements created by the designer themselves\*\*\*\*\*.\*\* Design can in a lot of cases be like a jigsaw - putting colours, shapes and text together to create an image. This will be a lot easier to start with and can be learnt by anyone, compared to complex drawings and illustrations. 

\-Is this niche subject to copyright issues?

Time to delve deep into good old copyright. Now, when you go through Etsy, you will without a doubt see hundreds of sellers selling music album posters, car posters, movie posters and more. Obviously, these posters contain the property of musicians, companies and more and are therefore copyrighted. The annoying thing is - these are \*\*\*a complete cash cow.\*\*\* If you go down the music poster route, I will honestly be surprised if you \*\*don’t\*\* make thousands. However it is only a matter of time before the copyright strikes start rolling in and you eventually get banned from Etsy. 

So I would highly recommend \*\*\*not making this mistake\*\*\*. Etsy is an incredible platform for selling posters, and it is a hell of a lot easier to make sales on there compared to advertising your own website. And, you \*\*\*only get one chance on Etsy.\*\*\* Once you have been banned once, you are not allowed to sign up again (and they do ID checks - so you won’t be able to rejoin again under your own name). 

So, don’t be shortsighted when it comes to entering Print on Demand. If you keep your designs legitimate, they will last you a lifetime and you will then later be able to crosspost them to other platforms, again without the worry of ever getting shut down. 

**So, how do I actually design posters?**

Now you have an idea of what kind of posters you want to be making, it’s time to get creative and make some designs! Photoshop (and the creative cloud in general) is probably the best for this. However, when starting out it can be a scary investment (it costs about £30 a month unless you can get a student rate!). 

So, while Photoshop is preferable in the long term, when starting out you can learn the ropes of design and get going with Canva. This can be great at the start as they have a load of templates that you can use to get used to designing and experimenting (while it might be tempting to slightly modify these and sell them - this will be quite saturated on places like Etsy so we would recommend doing something new). 

**What size format should I use?**

The best design format to start with is arguably the A sizes - as all the A sizes (A5, A4, A3, A2, A1, A0) are ***scalable***. This means that you can make all of your designs in one size, for example A3, and these designs will be ready to fit to all other A sizes. For example, if you design an A3 poster and someone orders A1, you can just upload this A3 file to PrintShrimp and it will be ready to print.

There is a wide range of other sizes you should consider offering on your shop, especially as these sizes are very popular with the American market. They have a wide range of popular options, which unfortunately aren’t all scalable with each other. This does mean that you will therefore have to make some slight modifications to your design in order to be able to offer them in American sizing, in a few different aspect ratios.

What you can do however is design all of your products in UK sizing, and simply redesign to fit American sizing once you have had an order. Essentially: design in UK sizing, but list in both UK and US sizing. Then when you get a non-A size order, you can quickly redesign it on demand. This means that you don’t have to make a few different versions of each poster when first designing, and can simply do a quick redesign for US sizing when you need to.

Below is PrintShrimps standard size offering. We can also offer any custom sizing too, so please get in touch if you are looking for anything else. With these sizes, your poster orders will be dispatched domestically in whatever country your customer orders from.

**Our recommendations for starting design**

One thing that will not be featured in this guide is a written out explanation or guide on how to design. Honestly, I can’t think of a more boring, or frankly worse, way to learn design. When it comes to getting started, ***experimenting is your best friend!*** Just have a play around and see what you can do. It is a really fun thing to get started with, and the satisfaction of when a poster design comes together is like no other.

A good way to start is honestly by straight up ***copying a poster you see for sale online***. And we don’t mean copying to sell! But just trying to replicate other designs is a great way to get a feel for it and what you can do. We really think you will be surprised at how easy it is to pull together a lot of designs that at first can appear quite complicated!

Your best friend throughout this whole process will be ***google.*** At the start you will not really know how to do anything - but learning how to look into things you want to know about design is all part of the process. At first, it can be quite hard to even know how to search for what you are trying to do, but this will come with time (we promise). Learning ***how to google*** is a skill that you will learn throughout this process. 

Above all, what we think is most important is this golden rule: ***take inspiration but do not steal***. You want to be ***selling similar products in your niche, but not copies***. You need to see what is selling in your niche and get ideas from that, but if you make designs too similar to ones already available, you won’t have much luck. At the end of the day, if two very similar posters are for sale and one shop has 1000 reviews and your newer one has 2, which one is the customer going to buy? You need to make yours offer something different and stand out enough to attract customers.

**Etsy SEO and maximizing your sales**

You may have noticed in this guide we have mentioned Etsy quite a few times! That is because we think it is hands down the best place to ***start selling*** posters. Why? Etsy is a go to place for many looking to decorate their homes and also to buy gifts. It might be tempting to start selling with your own website straight away, however we recommend Etsy as it ***brings the customers to you.*** For example, say you start selling Bathroom Posters. It is going to be a hell of a lot easier to convert sales when you already have customers being shown your page after searching ‘bathroom decor’, compared to advertising your own website. This is especially true as it can be hard to identify your ideal target audience to then advertise to via Meta (Facebook/Instagram) for example. Websites are a great avenue to explore eventually like I now have, but we recommend starting with Etsy and going from there.

**What costs do I need to be aware of?**

So, setting up an Etsy sellers account is currently costs £15. The only other **upfront** cost you will have is the cost of listing a product - this is 20 cents per listing. From then on, every time you make a sale you will be charged a transaction fee of 6.5%, a small payment processing fee, plus another 20 cents for a renewed listing fee. It normally works out to about 10% of each order, a small price to pay for all the benefits Etsy brings. No matter what platform you sell on, you will be faced with some form of transaction fee. Etsy is actually quite reasonable especially as they do not charge you to use their platform on a monthly basis. 

**What do I need to get selling?**

**1. Getting your shop looking pretty**

\-Think of a shop name and design (now you are a professional designer) a logo

\-Design a banner for the top of your shop

\-Add in some about me info/shop announcement

\-I recommend running a sale wherein orders of 3+ items get a 20% of discount. Another big benefit of PrintShrimp is that you receive large discounts when ordering multiple posters. This is great for attracting buyers and larger orders. 

**2. Making your products look attractive**

That is the bulk of the ‘decor’ you will need to do. Next up is ***placing your posters in mock ups!*** As you may notice on Etsy, most shops show their posters framed and hanging on walls. These are 99% of the time not real photos, but digital mock ups. This is where Photoshop comes in really handy, as you can automate this process through a plug in called Bulk Mock Up. If you don’t have photoshop, you can do this on Canva, you will just have to do it manually which can be rather time consuming. 

Now, where can you get the actual Mock Ups? One platform we highly recommend for design in general is platforms like ***Envato Elements***. These are design marketplaces where you have access to millions of design resources that you are ***fully licensed*** to use! 

**3. Titles, tags, and descriptions** 

Now for the slightly more nitty gritty part. You could have the world's most amazing looking poster, however, if you do not get the Etsy SEO right, ***no one is going to see it!*** We will take you through creating a new Etsy listing field by field so you can know how to best list your products. 

The key to Etsy listing optimisation is to ***maximise.*** Literally cram in as many key words as you possibly can! Before you start this process, create a word map of anything you can think of relating to your listing. And come at this from the point of view of, ***if I was looking for a poster like mine, what would I search?***

**Titles**

\-Here you are blessed with 140 characters to title your listing. Essentially, start off with a concise way of properly describing your poster. And then afterwards, add in as many key words as you can! Here is an example of the title of a well selling Skiing poster:

Les Arcs Skiing Poster, Les Arcs Print, Les Alpes, France Ski Poster, Skiing Poster, Snowboarding Poster, Ski Resort Poster Holiday, French

This is 139 characters out of 140 - you should try and maximise this as much as possible! As you can see, this crams in a lot of key words and search terms both related to Skiing as a whole, ***the poster category,*** and then the ***specifics of the poster itself*** (Les Arcs resort in France).

Bear in mind that if you are listing a lot of listings that are of the same theme, you won’t have to spend time creating an entirely new title. For example if your next poster was of a ski resort in Italy, you can copy this one over and just swap out the specifics. For example change “France ski poster” to “Italy ski poster”, change “Les Arcs” to “The Dolomites”, etc. 

**Description**

\-Same logic applies for descriptions - try and cram in as many key words as you can! Here is an example for a Formula One poster:

George Russell, Mercedes Formula One Poster  ***- item specific keywords***

Bright, modern and vibrant poster to liven up your home.  - ***Describes the style of the poster***

All posters are printed on high quality, museum grade 200gsm poster paper. Suitable for framing and frames. - ***Shows the quality of the print. Mentions frames whilst showing it comes unframed***

Experience the thrill of the **racetrack** with this stunning **Formula One** poster. Printed on **high-quality** paper, this **racing car** **wall art print** features a dynamic image of a Formula One car in action, perfect for adding a touch of speed and excitement to any **motorsports room** or **man cave**. Whether you're a die-hard fan or simply appreciate the adrenaline of high-speed **racing**, this poster is sure to impress. Available in a range of sizes, it makes a great addition to your **home or office**, or as a **gift** for a fellow **Formula One enthusiast**. Each poster is **carefully packaged** to ensure **safe delivery**, so you can enjoy your new piece of **art** as soon as possible. - ***A nice bit of text really highlighting a lot of key words such as gift, motorsports, racetrack etc.*** 

You could go further with this too, by adding in extra things related to the poster such as ‘Perfect gift for a Mercedes F1 fan’ etc. 

**Tags**

Now, these are actually probably the ***most important part of your listing***! You get 13 tags (20 character limit for each) and there are essentially search terms that will match your listing with what customers search for when shopping. 

You really need to maximize these - whilst Title and Description play a part, these are the main things that will bring buyers to your listing. Once again, it is important to think about what customers are likely to be searching when looking for a poster similar to yours.

**Life hack alert!** You can actually ***see what tags other sellers are using***. All you need to do is go to a listing similar to yours that is selling well, scroll down and you can actually see them listed out at the bottom of the page! Here is an example of what this may look like:

So, go through a few listings of competitors and make notes on common denominators that you can integrate into your listing.

As you can see here, this seller uses tags such as ‘Birthday Gift’ and ‘Poster Print’. When you first start out, you may be better off ***swapping these out for more listing specific tags***. This seller has been on Etsy for a few years however and has 15,000+ sales, so are more likely to see success from these tags. 

If it’s not clear why, think about it this way. If you searched ‘poster print’ on Etsy today, there will be ***10s of thousands of results***. However, if you searched ‘Russell Mercedes Poster’, you will (as of writing) get ***336 results***. Etsy is far more likely to push your product to the top of the latter tag, against 300 other listings, rather than the top of ‘Poster Print’ where it is incredibly competitive. It is only when you are a more successful shop pulling in a high quantity of orders that these larger and more generic tags will work for you, as Etsy has more trust in your shop and will be more likely to push you to the front. 

**SKUs**

\-One important thing you need to do is add SKUs to all of your products! This is worth doing at the start as it will make your life so much easier when it comes to making sales and using PrintShrimp further down the line. What is an SKU? It is a ‘stock keeping unit’, and is essentially just a product identifier. Your ***SKUs need to match your file name*** that you upload to PrintShrimp. For example, if you made a poster about the eiffel tower, you can literally name the SKU eiffel-tower. There is no need to complicate things! As long as your file name (as in ***the image name of your poster on your computer***) matches your SKU, you will be good to go. 

\-It may be more beneficial to set up a system with unique identifiers, to make organising your files a lot easier further down the line. Say you get to 1000 posters eventually, you’ll want to be able to ***quickly search a code***, and also ensure every ***SKU is always unique***, so you won’t run into accidentally using the same SKU twice further down the line. For example, you can set it up so at the start of each file name, you have \[unique id\]\[info\], so your files will look like - 

A1eiffeltower

A2france

And further down the line:

A99aperolspritz

B1potatoart

This not only removes the potential issue of duplicating SKUs accidentally (for example if you made a few posters of the same subject), but also keeps your files well organised. If you need to find a file, you can search your files according to the code, so just by searching ‘a1’ for example, rather than having to trawl through a load of different files until you find the correct one.

\-If your poster has variations, for example color variations, you can set a ***different SKU for each variation***. Just click the little box when setting up variations that says ‘SKUs vary for each (variation)’. So if you have a poster available either in a white or black background, you can name each file, and therefore each SKU, a1eiffel-tower-black and a1eiffel-tower-white for example.

\-The same goes for different sizes. As different American sizes have different aspect ratios, as mentioned above you may have to reformat some posters if you get a sale for one of these sizes. You can then add in the SKU to your listing once you have reformatted your poster. So for example if you sell a 16x20” version of the eiffel tower poster, you can name this file eiffel-tower-white-1620. Whilst this involves a little bit of set up, the time it saves you overall is massive! 

**Variations and Prices**

\-So, when selling posters there is a huge variety of sizes that you can offer, as mentioned previously. Non-negotiable is that you should be offering A5-A1. These will likely be your main sellers! Especially in the UK. It is also a good idea to offer inch sizing to appeal to a global audience (as bear in mind with PrintShrimp you will be able to print in multiple countries around the world!). 

Below is a recommended pricing structure of what to charge on Etsy. Feel free to mess around with these! You may notice on Etsy that many shops charge a whole lot more for sizes such as A1, 24x36” etc. In my experience I prefer charging a lower rate to attract more sales, but there is validity in going for a lower amount of sales with higher profits.

As mentioned above, you can also offer different variations on items - for example different colour schemes on posters. This is always a decent idea (if it suits the design) as it provides the customer with more options, which might help to convert the sale. You can always add this in later however if you want to keep it simple while you start!

**Setting up shipping profiles**

Etsy makes it very easy to set up different shipping rates for different countries. However, luckily with PrintShrimp you can offer free shipping to the majority of the major countries that are active on Etsy! 

Using PrintShrimp means that your production costs are low enough in each domestic market to justify this. If you look on Etsy you can see there are many shops that ***post internationally*** to countries such as the US or Australia. Therefore, they often charge £8-10 in postage, and have a delivery time of 1-2 weeks. This really ***limits their customer base*** to their domestic market. 

Using PrintShrimp avoids this and means you can offer free shipping (as we absorb the shipping cost in our prices) to the major markets of the UK, Australia, and USA (Europe coming soon!). 

We also offer a ***1 day processing time,*** unlike many POD poster suppliers. This means you can set your Etsy processing time to just one day, which combined with our quick shipping, means you will be ***one of the quickest on Etsy*** at sending out orders. This is obviously very attractive for customers, who are often very impatient with wanting their orders! 

**Getting the sales and extra tips**

\-Don’t list an insane amount of listings when you first get started. Etsy will be like ‘hang on a second’ if a brand new shop suddenly has 200 items in the first week. ***Warm up your account***, and take things slow as you get going. We recommend 5 a day for the first week or so, and then you can start uploading more. You don’t want Etsy to flag your account for suspicious bot-like activity when you first get going. 

\-It is very easy to ***copy listings*** when creating a new one. Simply select an old listing and press copy, and then you can just change the listing specific details to create a new one, rather than having to start from scratch. It can feel like a bit of a ball-ache setting up your first ever listing, but from then on you can just copy it over and just change the specifics. 

\-Try and organize your listings into ***sections***! This really helps the customer journey. Sometimes a customer will click onto your shop after seeing one of your listings, so it really helps if they can easily navigate your shop for what they are looking for.

So, you now have a fully fledged Etsy shop. Well done! Time to start making £3,000 a month straight away right? Not quite. Please bear in mind, ***patience is key*** when starting out. If you started doing this because you are £10,000 in debt to the Albanian mafia and need to pay it off next week, you have come into this in the wrong frame of mind. If you have however started this to slowly build up a side hustle which hopefully one day become your full time gig, then winner winner chicken dinner. 

***Starting out on Etsy isn’t always easy.*** It takes time for your shop to build up trust! As I’ve said before, a buyer is far more likely to purchase from a shop with 1000s of reviews, than a brand new one with 0. But before you know it, you can become one of these shops!

One thing you can do at the very start is to ***encourage your friends and family to buy your posters!*** This is a slightly naughty way of getting a few sales at the start, of course followed by a few glowing 5\* reviews. It really helps to give your shop this little boost at the start, so if this is something you can do then I recommend it. 

Okay, so once you have a fully fledged shop with a decent amount of listings, you might be expecting the sales to start rolling in. And, if you are lucky, they indeed might. However, in my experience, you need to give your listings a little boost. So let us introduce you to:

**The wonderful world of Etsy ads**

Ads!! Oh no, that means money!! We imagine some of you more risk averse people are saying to yourself right now. And yes, it indeed does. But more often than not unfortunately you do ***have to spend money to make money***. 

Fortunately, in my experience anyway, ***Etsy ads do tend to work***. This does however only apply if your products are actually good however, so if you’re back here after paying for ads for 2 months and are losing money at the same rate as your motivation, maybe go back to the start of this guide and pick another niche. 

When you first start out, there are two main strategies. 

**Number 1: The Safer Option**

So, with PrintShrimp, you will essentially be making a minimum of £6 profit per order. With this in mind, I normally start a new shop with a safer strategy of advertising my products with a budget of $3-5 dollars a day. This then means that at the start, you only need to make 1 sale to break even, and anything above that is pure profit! This might not seem like the most dazzling proposition right now, but again please bear in mind that ***growth will be slow at the start.*** This means that you can gradually grow your shop, and therefore the trust that customers have in your shop, over time with a very small risk of ever actually losing money.

**Number 2: The Billy Big Balls Option**

If you were yawning while reading the first option, then this strategy may be for you. This will be better suited to those of you that are a bit more ***risk prone***, and it also helps if you have a bit more ***cash to invest*** at the start. Through this strategy, you can essentially ***pay your way to the top*** of Etsy's rankings. For this, you’ll probably be looking at spending $20 a day on ads. So, this can really add up quickly and is definitely the riskier option. In my experience, the level of sales with this may not always match up to your spend every day. You may find that some days you rake in about 10 sales, and other days only one. But what this does mean is that as your listings get seen and purchased more, they will begin to ***rank higher in Etsy’s organic search rankings***, at a much quicker rate than option one.

This is the beauty of Etsy’s ads. You can pay to boost your products, but then results from this paid promotion ***feed into the organic ranking of your products***. So you may find that you can splash the cash for a while at the start in order to race to the top, and then drop your ad spending later on when your products are already ranking well. 

**Sending your poster orders**

So, you’ve now done the hard bit. You have a running Etsy store, and essentially all you need to now on a daily basis is send out your orders and reply to customer messages! This is where it really becomes ***passive income.*** 

\-Check out the PrintShrimp order portal. Simply sign up, and you can place individual orders through there.

\-Bulk upload: We have an option to bulk upload your Esty orders via csv. 

Seriously, when you are up and running with your first store, it is really as easy as that. 

Once you have your first Etsy store up and running, you can think about expanding. There are many ways to expand your income. You can set up other Etsy stores, as long as the type of posters you are selling varies. You can look into setting up your own Shopify stores, and advertise them through Facebook, Instagram etc.

**So, why are posters the best product to sell?**

Also, just thought I’d quickly answer the question - ***why posters?*** If you’ve been researching Print on Demand you’ve probably come across the infinite options of t-shirts, mugs, hats, phone cases, and more. All of these are viable options, however we think posters are the perfect place to start. You can always expand into other areas further down the line! So a brief summary of why posters are the perfect product for Print on Demand:

\-They are ***very easy to design***! Posters are a very easy shape to deal with - can’t go wrong with a rectangle. This makes designing products very easy.

\-Similarly to this, ***what you see is what you get*** with a poster. You can literally see your finished product as you design it in either canva or photoshop. With T-Shirts for example, you have to make your design, and then place it on a t-shirt. Then you have to coordinate with your printers the size you would like the design on the tshirt and many other variables like that. There is no messing about with posters - what you see is what you get.

\-***The same high quality, everywhere***. With other products, if you want to reap the benefits of a printing in various countries, you need to ensure each of your global suppliers stocks the same t-shirts, is able to print in the same way, carries the same sizes etc. Again with posters you avoid all of this hassle- your products will come out the same, no matter which of our global locations are used.

\-They have a ***very favorable profit margin***. As you will see later, the cost price of posters is very low. And people are prepared to pay quite a lot for a decent bit of wall art! I have tried out other products, and the profit margin combined with the order quantity of posters makes them my most profitable product, every single time. Using PrintShrimp, you can be sure to enjoy profits of anywhere between £6 - £40 pure profit per sale. 

\-They are one of the ***easiest to print white label***. This makes them perfect for Print on Demand. Your posters are simply put in a tube, and off they go. There are no extras you need to faff around with, compared to the extra elements other products come with, such as clothing labels on t-shirts. 

**Picking your poster niche**

So, you are ready to start selling posters. Great! Now, the blessing and curse with selling posters is that there are ***infinite possibilities*** regarding what you can sell. So, it can easily be quite overwhelming at first. 

The first thing I would recommend doing is having a ***look at what others are selling***. Etsy is a wonderful place for this (and will likely be a key part of your poster selling journey). So, log on to Etsy and simply type in ‘poster’ in the search bar. Get ready to write a massive list of the broad categories and type of posters that people are selling. 

If you do not have more than 50 categories written down by the end, you are doing something wrong. There are seriously an infinite amount of posters! For example, here are some popular ones to get you started:

Star sign posters, Kitchen posters, World map posters, Custom Dog Portrait posters, Music posters, Movie posters, Fine art posters, Skiing posters, Girl Power posters and Football posters. 

Now, you have a huge list of potential products to sell. What next? There are a few important things you need to bear in mind when picking your niche:

\-**Does this interest me?** 

Don’t make the mistake of going down a niche that didn’t actually interest you just because it would probably be a money maker. Before you know it, what can be a very fun process of making designs can become incredibly \*\*\*monotonous, and feel like a chore\*\*\*. You need to bear in mind that you will be spending a lot of time creating designs - if it is something you are interested in you are much less likely to get burnt out! As well, \*\*\*creativity will flow\*\*\* far better if it is something you are interested in, which at the end of the day will lead to better designs that are more likely to be purchased by customers. 

\-Is this within my design range?

Don’t let this put you off too much. We will go through how to get started on design later on in this guide. However, it is important to note that the plain truth of it is that some niches and designs are a hell of a lot more complicated than others. For example, quote posters can essentially be designed by anyone when you learn about how to put nice fonts together in a good color scheme. On the other hand, some posters you see may have been designed with complex illustrations in a program like Illustrator. To start with, it may be better to pick a niche that seems a bit more simple to get into, as you can always expand your range with other stores further down the line. A good way of evaluating the design complexity is by identifying if this poster is \*\*\*a lot of elements put together\*\*\* or is \*\*\*a lot of elements created by the designer themselves\*\*\*\*\*.\*\* Design can in a lot of cases be like a jigsaw - putting colours, shapes and text together to create an image. This will be a lot easier to start with and can be learnt by anyone, compared to complex drawings and illustrations. 

\-Is this niche subject to copyright issues?

Time to delve deep into good old copyright. Now, when you go through Etsy, you will without a doubt see hundreds of sellers selling music album posters, car posters, movie posters and more. Obviously, these posters contain the property of musicians, companies and more and are therefore copyrighted. The annoying thing is - these are \*\*\*a complete cash cow.\*\*\* If you go down the music poster route, I will honestly be surprised if you \*\*don’t\*\* make thousands. However it is only a matter of time before the copyright strikes start rolling in and you eventually get banned from Etsy.   
  
So I would highly recommend \*\*\*not making this mistake\*\*\*. Etsy is an incredible platform for selling posters, and it is a hell of a lot easier to make sales on there compared to advertising your own website. And, you \*\*\*only get one chance on Etsy.\*\*\* Once you have been banned once, you are not allowed to sign up again (and they do ID checks - so you won’t be able to rejoin again under your own name).   
  
So, don’t be shortsighted when it comes to entering Print on Demand. If you keep your designs legitimate, they will last you a lifetime and you will then later be able to crosspost them to other platforms, again without the worry of ever getting shut down. 

**So, how do I actually design posters?**

Now you have an idea of what kind of posters you want to be making, it’s time to get creative and make some designs! Photoshop (and the creative cloud in general) is probably the best for this. However, when starting out it can be a scary investment (it costs about £30 a month unless you can get a student rate!). 

So, while Photoshop is preferable in the long term, when starting out you can learn the ropes of design and get going with Canva. This can be great at the start as they have a load of templates that you can use to get used to designing and experimenting (while it might be tempting to slightly modify these and sell them - this will be quite saturated on places like Etsy so we would recommend doing something new). 

**What size format should I use?**

The best design format to start with is arguably the A sizes - as all the A sizes (A5, A4, A3, A2, A1, A0) are ***scalable***. This means that you can make all of your designs in one size, for example A3, and these designs will be ready to fit to all other A sizes. For example, if you design an A3 poster and someone orders A1, you can just upload this A3 file to PrintShrimp and it will be ready to print.

There is a wide range of other sizes you should consider offering on your shop, especially as these sizes are very popular with the American market. They have a wide range of popular options, which unfortunately aren’t all scalable with each other. This does mean that you will therefore have to make some slight modifications to your design in order to be able to offer them in American sizing, in a few different aspect ratios.

What you can do however is design all of your products in UK sizing, and simply redesign to fit American sizing once you have had an order. Essentially: design in UK sizing, but list in both UK and US sizing. Then when you get a non-A size order, you can quickly redesign it on demand. This means that you don’t have to make a few different versions of each poster when first designing, and can simply do a quick redesign for US sizing when you need to.

Below is PrintShrimps standard size offering. We can also offer any custom sizing too, so please get in touch if you are looking for anything else. With these sizes, your poster orders will be dispatched domestically in whatever country your customer orders from.

**Our recommendations for starting design**

One thing that will not be featured in this guide is a written out explanation or guide on how to design. Honestly, I can’t think of a more boring, or frankly worse, way to learn design. When it comes to getting started, ***experimenting is your best friend!*** Just have a play around and see what you can do. It is a really fun thing to get started with, and the satisfaction of when a poster design comes together is like no other.

A good way to start is honestly by straight up ***copying a poster you see for sale online***. And we don’t mean copying to sell! But just trying to replicate other designs is a great way to get a feel for it and what you can do. We really think you will be surprised at how easy it is to pull together a lot of designs that at first can appear quite complicated!

Your best friend throughout this whole process will be ***google.*** At the start you will not really know how to do anything - but learning how to look into things you want to know about design is all part of the process. At first, it can be quite hard to even know how to search for what you are trying to do, but this will come with time (we promise). Learning ***how to google*** is a skill that you will learn throughout this process. 

Above all, what we think is most important is this golden rule: ***take inspiration but do not steal***. You want to be ***selling similar products in your niche, but not copies***. You need to see what is selling in your niche and get ideas from that, but if you make designs too similar to ones already available, you won’t have much luck. At the end of the day, if two very similar posters are for sale and one shop has 1000 reviews and your newer one has 2, which one is the customer going to buy? You need to make yours offer something different and stand out enough to attract customers.

**Etsy SEO and maximizing your sales**

You may have noticed in this guide we have mentioned Etsy quite a few times! That is because we think it is hands down the best place to ***start selling*** posters. Why? Etsy is a go to place for many looking to decorate their homes and also to buy gifts. It might be tempting to start selling with your own website straight away, however we recommend Etsy as it ***brings the customers to you.*** For example, say you start selling Bathroom Posters. It is going to be a hell of a lot easier to convert sales when you already have customers being shown your page after searching ‘bathroom decor’, compared to advertising your own website. This is especially true as it can be hard to identify your ideal target audience to then advertise to via Meta (Facebook/Instagram) for example. Websites are a great avenue to explore eventually like I now have, but we recommend starting with Etsy and going from there.

**What costs do I need to be aware of?**

So, setting up an Etsy sellers account is currently costs £15. The only other **upfront** cost you will have is the cost of listing a product - this is 20 cents per listing. From then on, every time you make a sale you will be charged a transaction fee of 6.5%, a small payment processing fee, plus another 20 cents for a renewed listing fee. It normally works out to about 10% of each order, a small price to pay for all the benefits Etsy brings. No matter what platform you sell on, you will be faced with some form of transaction fee. Etsy is actually quite reasonable especially as they do not charge you to use their platform on a monthly basis. 

**What do I need to get selling?**

**1. Getting your shop looking pretty**

\-Think of a shop name and design (now you are a professional designer) a logo

\-Design a banner for the top of your shop

\-Add in some about me info/shop announcement

\-I recommend running a sale wherein orders of 3+ items get a 20% of discount. Another big benefit of PrintShrimp is that you receive large discounts when ordering multiple posters. This is great for attracting buyers and larger orders. 

**2. Making your products look attractive**

That is the bulk of the ‘decor’ you will need to do. Next up is ***placing your posters in mock ups!*** As you may notice on Etsy, most shops show their posters framed and hanging on walls. These are 99% of the time not real photos, but digital mock ups. This is where Photoshop comes in really handy, as you can automate this process through a plug in called Bulk Mock Up. If you don’t have photoshop, you can do this on Canva, you will just have to do it manually which can be rather time consuming. 

Now, where can you get the actual Mock Ups? One platform we highly recommend for design in general is platforms like ***Envato Elements***. These are design marketplaces where you have access to millions of design resources that you are ***fully licensed*** to use! 

**3. Titles, tags, and descriptions** 

Now for the slightly more nitty gritty part. You could have the world's most amazing looking poster, however, if you do not get the Etsy SEO right, ***no one is going to see it!*** We will take you through creating a new Etsy listing field by field so you can know how to best list your products. 

The key to Etsy listing optimisation is to ***maximise.*** Literally cram in as many key words as you possibly can! Before you start this process, create a word map of anything you can think of relating to your listing. And come at this from the point of view of, ***if I was looking for a poster like mine, what would I search?***

**Titles**

\-Here you are blessed with 140 characters to title your listing. Essentially, start off with a concise way of properly describing your poster. And then afterwards, add in as many key words as you can! Here is an example of the title of a well selling Skiing poster:

Les Arcs Skiing Poster, Les Arcs Print, Les Alpes, France Ski Poster, Skiing Poster, Snowboarding Poster, Ski Resort Poster Holiday, French

This is 139 characters out of 140 - you should try and maximise this as much as possible! As you can see, this crams in a lot of key words and search terms both related to Skiing as a whole, ***the poster category,*** and then the ***specifics of the poster itself*** (Les Arcs resort in France).

Bear in mind that if you are listing a lot of listings that are of the same theme, you won’t have to spend time creating an entirely new title. For example if your next poster was of a ski resort in Italy, you can copy this one over and just swap out the specifics. For example change “France ski poster” to “Italy ski poster”, change “Les Arcs” to “The Dolomites”, etc. 

**Description**

\-Same logic applies for descriptions - try and cram in as many key words as you can! Here is an example for a Formula One poster:

George Russell, Mercedes Formula One Poster  ***- item specific keywords***

Bright, modern and vibrant poster to liven up your home.  - ***Describes the style of the poster***

All posters are printed on high quality, museum grade 200gsm poster paper. Suitable for framing and frames. - ***Shows the quality of the print. Mentions frames whilst showing it comes unframed***

Experience the thrill of the **racetrack** with this stunning **Formula One** poster. Printed on **high-quality** paper, this **racing car** **wall art print** features a dynamic image of a Formula One car in action, perfect for adding a touch of speed and excitement to any **motorsports room** or **man cave**. Whether you're a die-hard fan or simply appreciate the adrenaline of high-speed **racing**, this poster is sure to impress. Available in a range of sizes, it makes a great addition to your **home or office**, or as a **gift** for a fellow **Formula One enthusiast**. Each poster is **carefully packaged** to ensure **safe delivery**, so you can enjoy your new piece of **art** as soon as possible. - ***A nice bit of text really highlighting a lot of key words such as gift, motorsports, racetrack etc.*** 

You could go further with this too, by adding in extra things related to the poster such as ‘Perfect gift for a Mercedes F1 fan’ etc. 

**Tags**

Now, these are actually probably the ***most important part of your listing***! You get 13 tags (20 character limit for each) and there are essentially search terms that will match your listing with what customers search for when shopping. 

You really need to maximize these - whilst Title and Description play a part, these are the main things that will bring buyers to your listing. Once again, it is important to think about what customers are likely to be searching when looking for a poster similar to yours.

**Life hack alert!** You can actually ***see what tags other sellers are using***. All you need to do is go to a listing similar to yours that is selling well, scroll down and you can actually see them listed out at the bottom of the page! Here is an example of what this may look like:

So, go through a few listings of competitors and make notes on common denominators that you can integrate into your listing.

As you can see here, this seller uses tags such as ‘Birthday Gift’ and ‘Poster Print’. When you first start out, you may be better off ***swapping these out for more listing specific tags***. This seller has been on Etsy for a few years however and has 15,000+ sales, so are more likely to see success from these tags. 

If it’s not clear why, think about it this way. If you searched ‘poster print’ on Etsy today, there will be ***10s of thousands of results***. However, if you searched ‘Russell Mercedes Poster’, you will (as of writing) get ***336 results***. Etsy is far more likely to push your product to the top of the latter tag, against 300 other listings, rather than the top of ‘Poster Print’ where it is incredibly competitive. It is only when you are a more successful shop pulling in a high quantity of orders that these larger and more generic tags will work for you, as Etsy has more trust in your shop and will be more likely to push you to the front. 

**SKUs**

\-One important thing you need to do is add SKUs to all of your products! This is worth doing at the start as it will make your life so much easier when it comes to making sales and using PrintShrimp further down the line. What is an SKU? It is a ‘stock keeping unit’, and is essentially just a product identifier. Your ***SKUs need to match your file name*** that you upload to PrintShrimp. For example, if you made a poster about the eiffel tower, you can literally name the SKU eiffel-tower. There is no need to complicate things! As long as your file name (as in ***the image name of your poster on your computer***) matches your SKU, you will be good to go. 

\-It may be more beneficial to set up a system with unique identifiers, to make organising your files a lot easier further down the line. Say you get to 1000 posters eventually, you’ll want to be able to ***quickly search a code***, and also ensure every ***SKU is always unique***, so you won’t run into accidentally using the same SKU twice further down the line. For example, you can set it up so at the start of each file name, you have \[unique id\]\[info\], so your files will look like - 

A1eiffeltower

A2france

And further down the line:

A99aperolspritz

B1potatoart

This not only removes the potential issue of duplicating SKUs accidentally (for example if you made a few posters of the same subject), but also keeps your files well organised. If you need to find a file, you can search your files according to the code, so just by searching ‘a1’ for example, rather than having to trawl through a load of different files until you find the correct one.

\-If your poster has variations, for example color variations, you can set a ***different SKU for each variation***. Just click the little box when setting up variations that says ‘SKUs vary for each (variation)’. So if you have a poster available either in a white or black background, you can name each file, and therefore each SKU, a1eiffel-tower-black and a1eiffel-tower-white for example.

\-The same goes for different sizes. As different American sizes have different aspect ratios, as mentioned above you may have to reformat some posters if you get a sale for one of these sizes. You can then add in the SKU to your listing once you have reformatted your poster. So for example if you sell a 16x20” version of the eiffel tower poster, you can name this file eiffel-tower-white-1620. Whilst this involves a little bit of set up, the time it saves you overall is massive! 

**Variations and Prices**

\-So, when selling posters there is a huge variety of sizes that you can offer, as mentioned previously. Non-negotiable is that you should be offering A5-A1. These will likely be your main sellers! Especially in the UK. It is also a good idea to offer inch sizing to appeal to a global audience (as bear in mind with PrintShrimp you will be able to print in multiple countries around the world!). 

Below is a recommended pricing structure of what to charge on Etsy. Feel free to mess around with these! You may notice on Etsy that many shops charge a whole lot more for sizes such as A1, 24x36” etc. In my experience I prefer charging a lower rate to attract more sales, but there is validity in going for a lower amount of sales with higher profits.

As mentioned above, you can also offer different variations on items - for example different colour schemes on posters. This is always a decent idea (if it suits the design) as it provides the customer with more options, which might help to convert the sale. You can always add this in later however if you want to keep it simple while you start!

**Setting up shipping profiles**

Etsy makes it very easy to set up different shipping rates for different countries. However, luckily with PrintShrimp you can offer free shipping to the majority of the major countries that are active on Etsy! 

Using PrintShrimp means that your production costs are low enough in each domestic market to justify this. If you look on Etsy you can see there are many shops that ***post internationally*** to countries such as the US or Australia. Therefore, they often charge £8-10 in postage, and have a delivery time of 1-2 weeks. This really ***limits their customer base*** to their domestic market. 

Using PrintShrimp avoids this and means you can offer free shipping (as we absorb the shipping cost in our prices) to the major markets of the UK, Australia, and USA (Europe coming soon!). 

We also offer a ***1 day processing time,*** unlike many POD poster suppliers. This means you can set your Etsy processing time to just one day, which combined with our quick shipping, means you will be ***one of the quickest on Etsy*** at sending out orders. This is obviously very attractive for customers, who are often very impatient with wanting their orders! 

**Getting the sales and extra tips**

\-Don’t list an insane amount of listings when you first get started. Etsy will be like ‘hang on a second’ if a brand new shop suddenly has 200 items in the first week. ***Warm up your account***, and take things slow as you get going. We recommend 5 a day for the first week or so, and then you can start uploading more. You don’t want Etsy to flag your account for suspicious bot-like activity when you first get going. 

\-It is very easy to ***copy listings*** when creating a new one. Simply select an old listing and press copy, and then you can just change the listing specific details to create a new one, rather than having to start from scratch. It can feel like a bit of a ball-ache setting up your first ever listing, but from then on you can just copy it over and just change the specifics. 

\-Try and organize your listings into ***sections***! This really helps the customer journey. Sometimes a customer will click onto your shop after seeing one of your listings, so it really helps if they can easily navigate your shop for what they are looking for.

So, you now have a fully fledged Etsy shop. Well done! Time to start making £3,000 a month straight away right? Not quite. Please bear in mind, ***patience is key*** when starting out. If you started doing this because you are £10,000 in debt to the Albanian mafia and need to pay it off next week, you have come into this in the wrong frame of mind. If you have however started this to slowly build up a side hustle which hopefully one day become your full time gig, then winner winner chicken dinner. 

***Starting out on Etsy isn’t always easy.*** It takes time for your shop to build up trust! As I’ve said before, a buyer is far more likely to purchase from a shop with 1000s of reviews, than a brand new one with 0. But before you know it, you can become one of these shops!

One thing you can do at the very start is to ***encourage your friends and family to buy your posters!*** This is a slightly naughty way of getting a few sales at the start, of course followed by a few glowing 5\* reviews. It really helps to give your shop this little boost at the start, so if this is something you can do then I recommend it. 

Okay, so once you have a fully fledged shop with a decent amount of listings, you might be expecting the sales to start rolling in. And, if you are lucky, they indeed might. However, in my experience, you need to give your listings a little boost. So let us introduce you to:

**The wonderful world of Etsy ads**

Ads!! Oh no, that means money!! We imagine some of you more risk averse people are saying to yourself right now. And yes, it indeed does. But more often than not unfortunately you do ***have to spend money to make money***. 

Fortunately, in my experience anyway, ***Etsy ads do tend to work***. This does however only apply if your products are actually good however, so if you’re back here after paying for ads for 2 months and are losing money at the same rate as your motivation, maybe go back to the start of this guide and pick another niche. 

When you first start out, there are two main strategies. 

**Number 1: The Safer Option**

So, with PrintShrimp, you will essentially be making a minimum of £6 profit per order. With this in mind, I normally start a new shop with a safer strategy of advertising my products with a budget of $3-5 dollars a day. This then means that at the start, you only need to make 1 sale to break even, and anything above that is pure profit! This might not seem like the most dazzling proposition right now, but again please bear in mind that ***growth will be slow at the start.*** This means that you can gradually grow your shop, and therefore the trust that customers have in your shop, over time with a very small risk of ever actually losing money.

**Number 2: The Billy Big Balls Option**

If you were yawning while reading the first option, then this strategy may be for you. This will be better suited to those of you that are a bit more ***risk prone***, and it also helps if you have a bit more ***cash to invest*** at the start. Through this strategy, you can essentially ***pay your way to the top*** of Etsy's rankings. For this, you’ll probably be looking at spending $20 a day on ads. So, this can really add up quickly and is definitely the riskier option. In my experience, the level of sales with this may not always match up to your spend every day. You may find that some days you rake in about 10 sales, and other days only one. But what this does mean is that as your listings get seen and purchased more, they will begin to ***rank higher in Etsy’s organic search rankings***, at a much quicker rate than option one.

This is the beauty of Etsy’s ads. You can pay to boost your products, but then results from this paid promotion ***feed into the organic ranking of your products***. So you may find that you can splash the cash for a while at the start in order to race to the top, and then drop your ad spending later on when your products are already ranking well. 

**Sending your poster orders**

So, you’ve now done the hard bit. You have a running Etsy store, and essentially all you need to now on a daily basis is send out your orders and reply to customer messages! This is where it really becomes ***passive income.*** 

\-Check out the PrintShrimp order portal. Simply sign up, and you can place individual orders through there.

\-Bulk upload: We have an option to bulk upload your Esty orders via csv. 

Seriously, when you are up and running with your first store, it is really as easy as that. 

Once you have your first Etsy store up and running, you can think about expanding. There are many ways to expand your income. You can set up other Etsy stores, as long as the type of posters you are selling varies. You can look into setting up your own Shopify stores, and advertise them through Facebook, Instagram etc.

Through this guide, we will teach you everything you need to know about starting to sell posters and generate some income. We will also show you why PrintShrimp is the best POD supplier for all of your poster needs. Trust me, you won’t need much convincing. "

Quiet Life Pt 2,Horror_stories,1i9l8zc,2025-01-25 06:44:09,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1i9l8zc/quiet_life_pt_2/,NecroNinjax,,"Marcus stared at the television, his eyes glazed over. The laugh track of a sitcom played in the background, a jarring juxtaposition to the horror he had wrought. The alcohol had been a crutch, a way to silence the taunts of his past and the noise of his present. But now, it was a liability. He couldn't risk the fog of a hangover, not with the police so close.

He went to the kitchen and filled a glass with water, downing it in one gulp. The cold liquid did little to soothe his parched throat, but it was a start. As he set the glass down, he caught his reflection in the window. The man staring back at him was a ghost, a mere shadow of who he once was. His hand trembled, and he clenched it into a fist to steady himself. He had to get a grip. The whiskey bottle was still there, on the floor, a silent sentinel to his descent.

He decided to clean the kitchen, hoping the repetitive motions would help clear his head. As he wiped down the counters, he noticed a smear of blood, a grim souvenir of his nocturnal escapade. Panic surged through him, and he grabbed a clean cloth, scrubbing furiously at the stain. The smell of bleach filled the room, a harsh contrast to the lingering scent of whiskey. He had to be thorough. He had to be careful.

SUMMARY^1: Marcus, feeling the weight of his recent actions, sits in his cleaned kitchen, watching a sitcom to distract from his guilt. His trembling hand and the whiskey bottle on the floor serve as stark reminders of his struggle. A police welfare check looms, prompting him to clean up a bloodstain, symbolizing his attempt to cover his tracks and maintain a semblance of normalcy amidst the horror.

Once the kitchen was spotless, Marcus went to the living room and sat on the couch, his eyes darting around the room. The TV played on, the laughter a hollow echo of the joy that had once filled this space. The walls seemed to whisper of his dark secrets, threatening to give him away. He knew he couldn't stay here, not with the bodies of Larry and Tiffany hidden in plain sight.

He needed an alibi, a foolproof way to account for his whereabouts during the time of the murders. His thoughts turned to his old drinking buddies, the ones he had pushed away when his addiction took over. Could he trust them to cover for him? Or would they be the first to suspect? He picked up his phone, his thumb hovering over the contacts. The screen was a blur, his mind racing with possibilities.

He scrolled through the numbers, each name a potential lifeline. Finally, he settled on one: Dave. They hadn't spoken in months, but Marcus knew he owed him a favor. He took a deep breath and dialed, his heart pounding in his chest. The phone rang once, twice, three times before a sleepy voice answered.

""Dave, it's me, Marcus,"" he whispered, the words sticking in his throat. ""Look, I need your help. Something happened last night."" He paused, his mind racing. ""I was at your place, okay? We had a few drinks, and I crashed on your couch. You don't remember because you passed out. That's my story, alright?""

SUMMARY^1: Marcus contemplates the necessity of an alibi, fearful of the police investigation. He decides to use his old drinking buddy, Dave, as a cover. He calls him, creating a false story about being at Dave's place during the murders, hoping the lie will hold and provide the necessary distance from the suspicion that looms.

There was silence on the other end, and for a moment, Marcus feared he had made a mistake. Then, a sigh. ""Alright, man. Whatever you say. But you owe me big time.""

The words were a lifeline, a semblance of safety in a world that was quickly spiraling out of control. Marcus hung up, his hand shaking. He had bought himself some time, but it was only a matter of when, not if, the truth would come out. The silence of the house was a ticking clock, each second bringing him closer to discovery.

He had to act quickly. He needed to move the bodies, to make it look like an accident. His mind raced with the possibilities, the plans forming like shadows in the corners of his thoughts. He knew the neighborhood well, the old factory that had been abandoned for years, the river that flowed through the outskirts, a convenient disposal site for those who knew where to look.

Marcus took a deep breath, steeling himself for what was to come. The sun was rising, casting long shadows across the floor. The house was waking up, the day stretching out before him like a prison sentence. He had to be smart, had to be careful. But as he stood up from the couch, his legs felt like lead. The weight of his actions pressed down on him, threatening to crush him beneath its inescapable gravity.

SUMMARY^1: Marcus calls his old friend Dave, establishing a false alibi for the night of the murders. He knows the truth can't stay buried forever, and the pressure builds as he considers his next move. The house's silence is a ticking clock, and he plans to relocate the bodies, aiming for a convincing accident scenario. The rising sun is a stark reminder of the dawning reality of his situation, weighing heavily on his shoulders.

He took one last look around the room, memorizing every detail, every potential clue. Then, with a resigned sigh, he turned off the TV and made his way to the basement. The water in the tub was still, a crimson pool that reflected the horror of his actions. Larry's body lay in the water, lifeless, a grotesque parody of peace. Marcus knew he had to act, had to keep moving. The whispers of guilt grew louder, but he pushed them down, focusing on the task at hand.

With trembling hands, he reached into the tub and began to untie the knots that held the cushions in place. The water was warm and sticky, the cushions heavy with the weight of death. He pulled them free, the water gurgling around him as Larry's body shifted, sending ripples across the surface. He stepped back, his eyes avoiding the corpse as he grabbed the plastic bag containing Tiffany's dismembered remains.

The trip to the dumpster was a blur, his mind racing with every step. The alley was still, the shadows holding their breath as he moved through them. The dumpster was a maw of darkness, the perfect receptacle for his sins. With a grunt, he heaved the bag inside, the plastic crunching against the metal. The lid slammed shut, a finality that echoed through the alley.

He stepped back, his eyes scanning the area for any sign of his presence. The delivery man's footsteps echoed in his memory, a reminder that the world was waking up to a day that had irrevocably changed for him. The sun had fully risen now, casting the alley in a harsh, unforgiving light. He took a deep breath, the scent of garbage mingling with the coppery tang of blood.

The police would come, of that he had no doubt. But for now, he had bought himself a little more time. He turned and walked back into the house, the silence of his footsteps a stark contrast to the cacophony in his mind. The whiskey bottle called to him from the floor of his room, a seductive whisper promising to dull the pain.

But Marcus knew he couldn't give in, not now. He had to keep moving, had to stay sharp. He grabbed the phone and called in sick to work, his voice a shaky imitation of his usual gruffness. Then, he began to pack a bag, filling it with essentials: a change of clothes, his wallet, and the TV remote. He had to get out, had to put distance between himself and the bodies.

He took one last look around the room, the whiskey bottle glinting in the light, a silent specter of his past. He left it there, a symbol of his old life, and stepped into the hallway. The floorboards creaked, a mournful tune that seemed to follow him. He closed the door to his room, the sound of the lock clicking into place a mournful echo.

The house was still, the silence a cocoon around him. He moved quickly, gathering his things, the fear of discovery a constant companion. As he descended the stairs, the sunlight spilled in through the windows, painting the walls a warm gold. For a moment, he allowed himself to believe that he could leave it all behind, that he could start anew.

But as he stepped outside, the cold reality of his situation hit him like a slap in the face. The world had not stopped turning, the laughter of children playing in the street a mocking contrast to the darkness in his soul. He knew he couldn't outrun the truth, not forever. The bodies would be found, and the whispers would start. He was a killer now, a man with secrets that would never truly die.

He walked to the bus stop, the bag heavy on his shoulder. The TV remote dug into his side, a constant reminder of the lives he had taken. The bus pulled up, its engine purring with the promise of escape. Marcus climbed aboard, the diesel fumes mixing with the scent of his own fear. He took a seat in the back, his eyes on the world outside the window.

The city rolled by in a blur of concrete and steel, a testament to the lives lived and lost. The sun climbed higher in the sky, the heat of the day seeping into his bones. He knew he had to keep moving, had to find a place to hide, to think. But as the bus lurched forward, carrying him away from the scene of his crimes, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.

He glanced around the bus, his eyes meeting the gazes of the other passengers. They were just faces in the crowd, but to him, they were judges and jurors, ready to condemn him at a moment's notice. His palms grew slick with sweat, and his breath came in shallow gasps. The whispers of his guilt grew louder, drowning out the murmur of the engine.

Marcus stepped off the bus at the next stop, his legs shaking with the effort of maintaining his composure. He wandered aimlessly, the buildings closing in around him like a maze with no exit. The heat was oppressive, the air thick with the scent of exhaust and despair. He needed a new plan, a way to disappear. The TV was a beacon of hope, a ticket to a new life, if he could just figure out how to use it.

He found a quiet alley, the shadows a comforting embrace. He sat on the ground, the TV remote clutched in his hand like a talisman. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes, willing the panic to subside. The whispers grew fainter, and he could almost feel the beginnings of a plan forming in his mind.

He would sell the TV, get some cash, and leave town. He had a friend in the next state over, a man named Jerry who owed him a favor. He could lie low there, build a new life, away from the prying eyes of the police and the specter of his past. The thought brought a glimmer of hope, a spark in the abyss of his fear.

But first, he had to ditch the evidence, the bloody couch cushions and the plastic bag that held the grisly remains of his former neighbors. He found a dumpster, the stench of rotting food a welcome distraction from his own odor of death. He heaved the cushions in, the sound of them landing with a wet thud echoing in the alley. The bag with Tiffany followed, a final goodbye to the life he had destroyed.

Marcus stood for a moment, his eyes closed, listening to the fading sounds of the city. The sirens in the distance grew louder, a symphony of chaos that seemed to be closing in on him. He had to move quickly, had to vanish before the noose tightened.

With a newfound urgency, he hailed a taxi, the TV remote still clutched in his hand. He gave the driver an address, a random number on a street he had never been to before. The car pulled away from the curb, the engine a soothing lullaby as the city blurred into a kaleidoscope of colors.

In the taxi, the whispers grew faint, the guilt a distant memory. For now, he was free, a man on the run with the wind in his hair and the world at his fingertips. But he knew it wouldn't last. The shadows of his past would always follow him, a relentless pursuer that would never tire.

He had to be smarter, had to stay one step ahead. As the car sped through the streets, he began to formulate a new identity, a new life. He would become someone else, leave Marcus and his demons behind. The TV remote was his key to a fresh start, a gateway to a world of anonymity and escape.

The taxi pulled up to a pawnshop, the neon sign flickering in the early morning light. Marcus stepped out, the bag with the TV remote in his pocket. The bell jingled as he pushed open the door, the smell of stale cigarette smoke and dusty dreams enveloping him. He approached the counter, his heart racing, and laid the remote on the grimy glass.

The pawnbroker looked him over, his eyes shrewd and assessing. ""What's the story with this?"" he asked, his voice gravelly from years of hard living.

Marcus forced a smile, the lie coming easily to his lips. ""It's just a TV remote,"" he said, the words tasting like ash. ""It's not worth much, but I need the cash.""

The pawnbroker studied the remote, then nodded. ""Fifty bucks,"" he said, sliding the money across the counter.

Marcus took the cash, the feel of it in his hand a strange comfort amidst the chaos. He had to be smart now, had to play the part of the desperate man with nothing to hide. He pocketed the money and left the pawnshop, the bell chiming a tune of both liberation and finality. The cash burned a hole in his pocket, a siren song of escape beckoning him westward.

He bought a bus ticket at the station, choosing a route that would take him as far from the city as possible. The line to the counter was long, a serpentine of people with their own stories of despair and hope. He waited, his eyes darting from face to face, searching for any sign of recognition or suspicion. But all he saw were the weary expressions of those trapped in their own struggles, oblivious to the monster in their midst.

The bus ride was a blur of passing scenery and racing thoughts. He had to stay off the grid, find a place where no one would look for him. He had to become someone else, erase every trace of Marcus from existence. The whispers of his past grew fainter with each mile, replaced by the rumble of the engine and the hiss of tires on asphalt.

When the bus finally pulled into a small town, Marcus knew he had found his refuge. The streets were quiet, the buildings old and weathered. It was a place where the world had moved on, leaving behind a quiet dignity that whispered of forgotten secrets and second chances. He stepped off the bus, the warmth of the sun a stark contrast to the cold grip of fear that had held him for so long.

The local diner was a beacon of light, the scent of greasy food and strong coffee a balm to his frayed nerves. He took a seat at the counter, the vinyl stool sticking to his skin. The waitress, a middle-aged woman with a kind smile, brought him a cup of coffee without asking. Her eyes held a knowing look, as if she had seen men like him before, men running from their own shadows.

He took a sip, the liquid scalding his throat, grounding him in the present. For a moment, he allowed himself to feel the warmth of human connection, the comfort of anonymity. But as he glanced at the TV above the counter, the news flashed a story of a gruesome murder, the image of Larry and Tiffany's house plastered on the screen. The whispers grew louder, the noose tightening once more.

Marcus's hand trembled, the cup rattling against the saucer. The waitress's eyes flicked up to meet his, a question in her gaze. He forced a smile, the muscles in his cheeks aching with the effort. ""Just tired,"" he murmured, pushing the coffee away. He couldn't stay here, not now. The whispers had become a roar, a siren's call that would lead the authorities straight to him.

With a heavy heart, he stood up, the TV's chatter a cacophony of accusations. He had to keep moving, had to find a place where the whispers couldn't follow. He stepped out into the sun-drenched street, the TV's remote still in his pocket, a silent testament to the life he had left behind. The world waited for him, vast and unknowable, full of danger and potential.

He walked towards the horizon, the sun a blinding spot in the sky. His steps were unsteady, his breathing ragged. The town grew smaller in the distance, a mirage of a life he could never have. The whispers grew faint, the fear a dull throb in his chest. Marcus knew he couldn't outrun the truth forever, but for now, he had a head start.

The road ahead was long, the future uncertain. But as he disappeared into the horizon, the whispers of his past grew quieter, the promise of a new identity beckoning him onward. The TV remote was a reminder of the life he had stolen, but also a symbol of the power to rewrite his own story.

And as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the world in shadows, Marcus took the first step into his new life, the echoes of his past fading with each stride. The quiet of the evening was a balm to his soul, the silence a promise of a life untainted by the cackling laughter of his demons. He had survived the night of blood and whispers, and now, he had to survive the aftermath.

He found a small, dilapidated motel on the outskirts of the next town. The neon sign flickered, the letters spelling out ""VACANCY"" in a seductive dance of light. Marcus approached the office, his heart hammering in his chest. The clerk, an old man with a world-weary gaze, barely looked up as he handed over the key. The room was a sanctuary, the worn-out bed and peeling wallpaper a stark contrast to the gleaming TV that dominated the space.

He turned it on, the static a comforting white noise that drowned out the whispers. The news played in the background, but he couldn't bring himself to watch it. Instead, he stared at the wall, his mind racing with the what-ifs and hows. How long could he keep this up? Would he ever find peace?

The knock on the door startled him, sending his heart into a frenzy. He approached it, his hand on the knob, his breath shallow. When he peeked through the peephole, he saw a young girl, her eyes wide with fear. She clutched a plastic bag, her knuckles white. ""Please,"" she whispered, her voice barely audible. ""I need help.""

The whispers grew louder, a cacophony of doubt and suspicion. He knew he should turn her away, keep moving, stay hidden. But something in her eyes, a flicker of innocence lost, called to him. He opened the door, the chill of the evening air a slap to the face. ""What's wrong?"" he asked, his voice gruff, unused to kindness.

Her story spilled out, a tale of a world crueler than he could ever imagine. Her father had gone missing, leaving her alone with a mother who had turned to drugs and abuse. Marcus felt a twinge of pity, a spark of something he thought he had lost. He offered her a bed for the night, a sandwich, and the quiet refuge of his room.

As they sat on the bed, the TV playing a mindless sitcom, she talked of her dreams, her hopes, her fears. The whispers grew quieter, drowned out by the steady rhythm of her voice. And for a brief moment, Marcus allowed himself to feel something other than the cold grip of guilt. He saw in her a reflection of himself, a soul adrift in a sea of chaos.

When she finally fell asleep, her head on his shoulder, the TV still playing, Marcus sat in the darkness, the weight of his actions pressing down on him. He knew he couldn't save her, couldn't save anyone. But he could give her a night of peace, a small reprieve from the horrors that awaited her outside.

The whispers grew faint, the TV's glow a comforting presence in the gloom. He sat there, the remote in his hand, the power to change the channel a symbol of his dwindling control over his own fate. But as the night stretched on, the whispers grew louder, more insistent. He knew that soon, the past would catch up with him, the bodies would be found, and the hunt would begin anew.

With a heavy sigh, Marcus stood up, the girl's head rolling onto the pillow. He knew he had to go, had to leave before the whispers grew too loud to ignore. He gathered his things, the TV remote a silent witness to the brief connection he had allowed himself. He stepped out into the night, the motel's neon glow a beacon of the life he had left behind.

The stars above twinkled like a thousand accusatory eyes, but he ignored them, focusing on the road ahead. The whispers had become a constant companion, a reminder of the lives he had taken and the price he would pay. But for now, he had to keep moving, had to stay one step ahead of the inevitable.

The night was long, the miles stretching out before him like a black ribbon of uncertainty. The TV remote felt heavier with each step, a burden that weighed on his soul. But it was also a reminder of the power to choose, to rewrite his story. And so, he walked into the darkness, the whispers of his past a fading echo, the promise of a new dawn a beacon in the distance."
Pain after treatment when I was fine before,askdentists,1i9ki43,2025-01-25 05:51:14,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1i9ki43/pain_after_treatment_when_i_was_fine_before/,Hot-Bottle9939,question,"My teeth are really really bad after years of depression and back to back pregnancies with sickness. I have severe anxiety/panic disorder and agoraphobia as well as PTSD around being touched…. So it took me a really long time to get the courage to go to the dentist. 

The first one I tried yelled at me for crying as soon as he touched me for the exam 😭 I left and didn’t go back or try another dentist for over a year….

I finally tried again at another place. I even took my mom lol. I really liked this guy.  Even though I did cry (as well as at a couple later visits) he was really understanding and patient and always told me what he was doing and if it was okay to touch me multiple times per visit. 

I got my first treatment a year ago. I had two fillings done on teeth 12 and 22. It was fine after. No issues. 

Next visit I had teeth 11 and 21 done. Two fillings. 21 needing a bit of building up from an old filling between the two teeth falling out. I have had pain in that one tooth ever since. I can’t really bite down. It would be a dull, sometimes sharp pain. I later had the back of it smoothed out because it was a bit “thick” and would hit my bottom teeth a bit hard. Slight improvement after. 

Third visit I had a crowns put on 13 and 12. I asked why I needed one on 13 after paying to have the fillings done. I can’t remember what he said. But I went with it. (Anxiety keeping me from speaking up with each of these visits) I had bad pain after that was done. It lasted two weeks of really severe pain in my mouth. I had to take 2 kinds of pain meds around the clock. And it would wake me up out of a dead sleep with the pain. 

My next visit, I told him about the pain. I said the bad pain did subside. But biting is hard still on both of those teeth. And cause a dull pain and almost a weak feeling. He smoothed out the back of tooth 12 because again, it was too “thick” and hitting my bottom teeth. I had a crown placed on tooth 14. 

This time, I had severe pain AGAIN like before. It lasted 3 weeks this time. Couldn’t sleep. Literally in tears over it feeling like I’ve made a terrible mistake getting dental work done. The pain subsided and chewing was fine. Only teeth 13 and 13 still causing problems when biting.  

I just had another visit last week. I stated my concerns. Number 12 had cement stuck between that he was able to remove after I told him (since I finally remembered) that I couldn’t floss between that one and the front tooth. I thought maybe that was part of the problem. I was supposed to have two fillings, possible root canal (this would be the 3rd tooth he suspected would need one. The others he said didn’t once he was drilling) and another crown on tooth 17

I told him I did not want to do the back tooth. I’m scared of the pain. I really don’t want to do it again.  He did fillings on teeth 15 and 16. Same day I felt fine. Mild ache in the mouth but I couldn’t tell if it was from the teeth that were worked on. My tmj was really bad though after and I had to take a bit of pain meds for a couple of days. My mouth wouldn’t close properly for a while and my bite was crooked. (My tmj is bad. I get Botox Injections for it which helps some) 

The past few days however, I can’t chew. Those two fillings hurt. Bad stabbing, sharp pain and a dull ache that doesn’t quite go away. To be fair, I do clench my jaw almost 24/7. I just can’t not do it. So the ache could be related to that. 

Now, I can’t bite or chew on one side of my mouth. Every time I have some sort of problem. It’s horrible. And I feel worse than before. Only plus is that my smile is getting better. But what does that even matter if I have all this pain??? I’m already out about $10k on all this work. 

Is this even normal??? Why do I have so much pain? Is he doing something wrong? I know my teeth had severe decay. And maybe that’s the problem. And I’m afraid to speak up since I signed all this paperwork saying none of the treatment is guaranteed to be successful. Which feels kinda fucked. 

I’m afraid to go to another dentist because I actually really like and trust him. He’s always really patient and eases my anxiety. I’m just so confused. What would cause these issues to keep coming up every time? "

Do the ISP's pay off the admins of Customer Feedback groups on Facebook?,PakGamers,1i9ju1a,2025-01-25 05:01:52,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PakGamers/comments/1i9ju1a/do_the_isps_pay_off_the_admins_of_customer/,Ok-Field5814,Discussion,"I have been trying to post about StormFiber's poor customer support on the Facebook groups named Voice of Customer and Tech Aches but TechAches removes my post after approving them for few minutes and asks me to post StormFiber related issues on a dedicated thread created back in 2016 which is a useless exercise that posting on a thread doesnt give it visibility and Voice of Customer has never approved my post which i have shared my negative experience with Storm Fiber infact the last negative post on VOC about StormFiber was posted on that group back in 2022 so is it safe to assume that the ISP's pay group admins to not approve negative posts against them.

Quiet Life Pt 2,scarystories,1i9jnjz,2025-01-25 04:48:25,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1i9jnjz/quiet_life_pt_2/,NecroNinjax,,"Marcus stared at the television, his eyes glazed over. The laugh track of a sitcom played in the background, a jarring juxtaposition to the horror he had wrought. The alcohol had been a crutch, a way to silence the taunts of his past and the noise of his present. But now, it was a liability. He couldn't risk the fog of a hangover, not with the police so close.

He went to the kitchen and filled a glass with water, downing it in one gulp. The cold liquid did little to soothe his parched throat, but it was a start. As he set the glass down, he caught his reflection in the window. The man staring back at him was a ghost, a mere shadow of who he once was. His hand trembled, and he clenched it into a fist to steady himself. He had to get a grip. The whiskey bottle was still there, on the floor, a silent sentinel to his descent.

He decided to clean the kitchen, hoping the repetitive motions would help clear his head. As he wiped down the counters, he noticed a smear of blood, a grim souvenir of his nocturnal escapade. Panic surged through him, and he grabbed a clean cloth, scrubbing furiously at the stain. The smell of bleach filled the room, a harsh contrast to the lingering scent of whiskey. He had to be thorough. He had to be careful.

SUMMARY^1: Marcus, feeling the weight of his recent actions, sits in his cleaned kitchen, watching a sitcom to distract from his guilt. His trembling hand and the whiskey bottle on the floor serve as stark reminders of his struggle. A police welfare check looms, prompting him to clean up a bloodstain, symbolizing his attempt to cover his tracks and maintain a semblance of normalcy amidst the horror.

Once the kitchen was spotless, Marcus went to the living room and sat on the couch, his eyes darting around the room. The TV played on, the laughter a hollow echo of the joy that had once filled this space. The walls seemed to whisper of his dark secrets, threatening to give him away. He knew he couldn't stay here, not with the bodies of Larry and Tiffany hidden in plain sight.

He needed an alibi, a foolproof way to account for his whereabouts during the time of the murders. His thoughts turned to his old drinking buddies, the ones he had pushed away when his addiction took over. Could he trust them to cover for him? Or would they be the first to suspect? He picked up his phone, his thumb hovering over the contacts. The screen was a blur, his mind racing with possibilities.

He scrolled through the numbers, each name a potential lifeline. Finally, he settled on one: Dave. They hadn't spoken in months, but Marcus knew he owed him a favor. He took a deep breath and dialed, his heart pounding in his chest. The phone rang once, twice, three times before a sleepy voice answered.

""Dave, it's me, Marcus,"" he whispered, the words sticking in his throat. ""Look, I need your help. Something happened last night."" He paused, his mind racing. ""I was at your place, okay? We had a few drinks, and I crashed on your couch. You don't remember because you passed out. That's my story, alright?""

SUMMARY^1: Marcus contemplates the necessity of an alibi, fearful of the police investigation. He decides to use his old drinking buddy, Dave, as a cover. He calls him, creating a false story about being at Dave's place during the murders, hoping the lie will hold and provide the necessary distance from the suspicion that looms.

There was silence on the other end, and for a moment, Marcus feared he had made a mistake. Then, a sigh. ""Alright, man. Whatever you say. But you owe me big time.""

The words were a lifeline, a semblance of safety in a world that was quickly spiraling out of control. Marcus hung up, his hand shaking. He had bought himself some time, but it was only a matter of when, not if, the truth would come out. The silence of the house was a ticking clock, each second bringing him closer to discovery.

He had to act quickly. He needed to move the bodies, to make it look like an accident. His mind raced with the possibilities, the plans forming like shadows in the corners of his thoughts. He knew the neighborhood well, the old factory that had been abandoned for years, the river that flowed through the outskirts, a convenient disposal site for those who knew where to look.

Marcus took a deep breath, steeling himself for what was to come. The sun was rising, casting long shadows across the floor. The house was waking up, the day stretching out before him like a prison sentence. He had to be smart, had to be careful. But as he stood up from the couch, his legs felt like lead. The weight of his actions pressed down on him, threatening to crush him beneath its inescapable gravity.

SUMMARY^1: Marcus calls his old friend Dave, establishing a false alibi for the night of the murders. He knows the truth can't stay buried forever, and the pressure builds as he considers his next move. The house's silence is a ticking clock, and he plans to relocate the bodies, aiming for a convincing accident scenario. The rising sun is a stark reminder of the dawning reality of his situation, weighing heavily on his shoulders.

He took one last look around the room, memorizing every detail, every potential clue. Then, with a resigned sigh, he turned off the TV and made his way to the basement. The water in the tub was still, a crimson pool that reflected the horror of his actions. Larry's body lay in the water, lifeless, a grotesque parody of peace. Marcus knew he had to act, had to keep moving. The whispers of guilt grew louder, but he pushed them down, focusing on the task at hand.

With trembling hands, he reached into the tub and began to untie the knots that held the cushions in place. The water was warm and sticky, the cushions heavy with the weight of death. He pulled them free, the water gurgling around him as Larry's body shifted, sending ripples across the surface. He stepped back, his eyes avoiding the corpse as he grabbed the plastic bag containing Tiffany's dismembered remains.

The trip to the dumpster was a blur, his mind racing with every step. The alley was still, the shadows holding their breath as he moved through them. The dumpster was a maw of darkness, the perfect receptacle for his sins. With a grunt, he heaved the bag inside, the plastic crunching against the metal. The lid slammed shut, a finality that echoed through the alley.

He stepped back, his eyes scanning the area for any sign of his presence. The delivery man's footsteps echoed in his memory, a reminder that the world was waking up to a day that had irrevocably changed for him. The sun had fully risen now, casting the alley in a harsh, unforgiving light. He took a deep breath, the scent of garbage mingling with the coppery tang of blood.

The police would come, of that he had no doubt. But for now, he had bought himself a little more time. He turned and walked back into the house, the silence of his footsteps a stark contrast to the cacophony in his mind. The whiskey bottle called to him from the floor of his room, a seductive whisper promising to dull the pain.

But Marcus knew he couldn't give in, not now. He had to keep moving, had to stay sharp. He grabbed the phone and called in sick to work, his voice a shaky imitation of his usual gruffness. Then, he began to pack a bag, filling it with essentials: a change of clothes, his wallet, and the TV remote. He had to get out, had to put distance between himself and the bodies.

He took one last look around the room, the whiskey bottle glinting in the light, a silent specter of his past. He left it there, a symbol of his old life, and stepped into the hallway. The floorboards creaked, a mournful tune that seemed to follow him. He closed the door to his room, the sound of the lock clicking into place a mournful echo.

The house was still, the silence a cocoon around him. He moved quickly, gathering his things, the fear of discovery a constant companion. As he descended the stairs, the sunlight spilled in through the windows, painting the walls a warm gold. For a moment, he allowed himself to believe that he could leave it all behind, that he could start anew.

But as he stepped outside, the cold reality of his situation hit him like a slap in the face. The world had not stopped turning, the laughter of children playing in the street a mocking contrast to the darkness in his soul. He knew he couldn't outrun the truth, not forever. The bodies would be found, and the whispers would start. He was a killer now, a man with secrets that would never truly die.

He walked to the bus stop, the bag heavy on his shoulder. The TV remote dug into his side, a constant reminder of the lives he had taken. The bus pulled up, its engine purring with the promise of escape. Marcus climbed aboard, the diesel fumes mixing with the scent of his own fear. He took a seat in the back, his eyes on the world outside the window.

The city rolled by in a blur of concrete and steel, a testament to the lives lived and lost. The sun climbed higher in the sky, the heat of the day seeping into his bones. He knew he had to keep moving, had to find a place to hide, to think. But as the bus lurched forward, carrying him away from the scene of his crimes, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.

He glanced around the bus, his eyes meeting the gazes of the other passengers. They were just faces in the crowd, but to him, they were judges and jurors, ready to condemn him at a moment's notice. His palms grew slick with sweat, and his breath came in shallow gasps. The whispers of his guilt grew louder, drowning out the murmur of the engine.

Marcus stepped off the bus at the next stop, his legs shaking with the effort of maintaining his composure. He wandered aimlessly, the buildings closing in around him like a maze with no exit. The heat was oppressive, the air thick with the scent of exhaust and despair. He needed a new plan, a way to disappear. The TV was a beacon of hope, a ticket to a new life, if he could just figure out how to use it.

He found a quiet alley, the shadows a comforting embrace. He sat on the ground, the TV remote clutched in his hand like a talisman. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes, willing the panic to subside. The whispers grew fainter, and he could almost feel the beginnings of a plan forming in his mind.

He would sell the TV, get some cash, and leave town. He had a friend in the next state over, a man named Jerry who owed him a favor. He could lie low there, build a new life, away from the prying eyes of the police and the specter of his past. The thought brought a glimmer of hope, a spark in the abyss of his fear.

But first, he had to ditch the evidence, the bloody couch cushions and the plastic bag that held the grisly remains of his former neighbors. He found a dumpster, the stench of rotting food a welcome distraction from his own odor of death. He heaved the cushions in, the sound of them landing with a wet thud echoing in the alley. The bag with Tiffany followed, a final goodbye to the life he had destroyed.

Marcus stood for a moment, his eyes closed, listening to the fading sounds of the city. The sirens in the distance grew louder, a symphony of chaos that seemed to be closing in on him. He had to move quickly, had to vanish before the noose tightened.

With a newfound urgency, he hailed a taxi, the TV remote still clutched in his hand. He gave the driver an address, a random number on a street he had never been to before. The car pulled away from the curb, the engine a soothing lullaby as the city blurred into a kaleidoscope of colors.

In the taxi, the whispers grew faint, the guilt a distant memory. For now, he was free, a man on the run with the wind in his hair and the world at his fingertips. But he knew it wouldn't last. The shadows of his past would always follow him, a relentless pursuer that would never tire.

He had to be smarter, had to stay one step ahead. As the car sped through the streets, he began to formulate a new identity, a new life. He would become someone else, leave Marcus and his demons behind. The TV remote was his key to a fresh start, a gateway to a world of anonymity and escape.

The taxi pulled up to a pawnshop, the neon sign flickering in the early morning light. Marcus stepped out, the bag with the TV remote in his pocket. The bell jingled as he pushed open the door, the smell of stale cigarette smoke and dusty dreams enveloping him. He approached the counter, his heart racing, and laid the remote on the grimy glass.

The pawnbroker looked him over, his eyes shrewd and assessing. ""What's the story with this?"" he asked, his voice gravelly from years of hard living.

Marcus forced a smile, the lie coming easily to his lips. ""It's just a TV remote,"" he said, the words tasting like ash. ""It's not worth much, but I need the cash.""

The pawnbroker studied the remote, then nodded. ""Fifty bucks,"" he said, sliding the money across the counter.

Marcus took the cash, the feel of it in his hand a strange comfort amidst the chaos. He had to be smart now, had to play the part of the desperate man with nothing to hide. He pocketed the money and left the pawnshop, the bell chiming a tune of both liberation and finality. The cash burned a hole in his pocket, a siren song of escape beckoning him westward.

He bought a bus ticket at the station, choosing a route that would take him as far from the city as possible. The line to the counter was long, a serpentine of people with their own stories of despair and hope. He waited, his eyes darting from face to face, searching for any sign of recognition or suspicion. But all he saw were the weary expressions of those trapped in their own struggles, oblivious to the monster in their midst.

The bus ride was a blur of passing scenery and racing thoughts. He had to stay off the grid, find a place where no one would look for him. He had to become someone else, erase every trace of Marcus from existence. The whispers of his past grew fainter with each mile, replaced by the rumble of the engine and the hiss of tires on asphalt.

When the bus finally pulled into a small town, Marcus knew he had found his refuge. The streets were quiet, the buildings old and weathered. It was a place where the world had moved on, leaving behind a quiet dignity that whispered of forgotten secrets and second chances. He stepped off the bus, the warmth of the sun a stark contrast to the cold grip of fear that had held him for so long.

The local diner was a beacon of light, the scent of greasy food and strong coffee a balm to his frayed nerves. He took a seat at the counter, the vinyl stool sticking to his skin. The waitress, a middle-aged woman with a kind smile, brought him a cup of coffee without asking. Her eyes held a knowing look, as if she had seen men like him before, men running from their own shadows.

He took a sip, the liquid scalding his throat, grounding him in the present. For a moment, he allowed himself to feel the warmth of human connection, the comfort of anonymity. But as he glanced at the TV above the counter, the news flashed a story of a gruesome murder, the image of Larry and Tiffany's house plastered on the screen. The whispers grew louder, the noose tightening once more.

Marcus's hand trembled, the cup rattling against the saucer. The waitress's eyes flicked up to meet his, a question in her gaze. He forced a smile, the muscles in his cheeks aching with the effort. ""Just tired,"" he murmured, pushing the coffee away. He couldn't stay here, not now. The whispers had become a roar, a siren's call that would lead the authorities straight to him.

With a heavy heart, he stood up, the TV's chatter a cacophony of accusations. He had to keep moving, had to find a place where the whispers couldn't follow. He stepped out into the sun-drenched street, the TV's remote still in his pocket, a silent testament to the life he had left behind. The world waited for him, vast and unknowable, full of danger and potential.

He walked towards the horizon, the sun a blinding spot in the sky. His steps were unsteady, his breathing ragged. The town grew smaller in the distance, a mirage of a life he could never have. The whispers grew faint, the fear a dull throb in his chest. Marcus knew he couldn't outrun the truth forever, but for now, he had a head start.

The road ahead was long, the future uncertain. But as he disappeared into the horizon, the whispers of his past grew quieter, the promise of a new identity beckoning him onward. The TV remote was a reminder of the life he had stolen, but also a symbol of the power to rewrite his own story.

And as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the world in shadows, Marcus took the first step into his new life, the echoes of his past fading with each stride. The quiet of the evening was a balm to his soul, the silence a promise of a life untainted by the cackling laughter of his demons. He had survived the night of blood and whispers, and now, he had to survive the aftermath.

He found a small, dilapidated motel on the outskirts of the next town. The neon sign flickered, the letters spelling out ""VACANCY"" in a seductive dance of light. Marcus approached the office, his heart hammering in his chest. The clerk, an old man with a world-weary gaze, barely looked up as he handed over the key. The room was a sanctuary, the worn-out bed and peeling wallpaper a stark contrast to the gleaming TV that dominated the space.

He turned it on, the static a comforting white noise that drowned out the whispers. The news played in the background, but he couldn't bring himself to watch it. Instead, he stared at the wall, his mind racing with the what-ifs and hows. How long could he keep this up? Would he ever find peace?

The knock on the door startled him, sending his heart into a frenzy. He approached it, his hand on the knob, his breath shallow. When he peeked through the peephole, he saw a young girl, her eyes wide with fear. She clutched a plastic bag, her knuckles white. ""Please,"" she whispered, her voice barely audible. ""I need help.""

The whispers grew louder, a cacophony of doubt and suspicion. He knew he should turn her away, keep moving, stay hidden. But something in her eyes, a flicker of innocence lost, called to him. He opened the door, the chill of the evening air a slap to the face. ""What's wrong?"" he asked, his voice gruff, unused to kindness.

Her story spilled out, a tale of a world crueler than he could ever imagine. Her father had gone missing, leaving her alone with a mother who had turned to drugs and abuse. Marcus felt a twinge of pity, a spark of something he thought he had lost. He offered her a bed for the night, a sandwich, and the quiet refuge of his room.

As they sat on the bed, the TV playing a mindless sitcom, she talked of her dreams, her hopes, her fears. The whispers grew quieter, drowned out by the steady rhythm of her voice. And for a brief moment, Marcus allowed himself to feel something other than the cold grip of guilt. He saw in her a reflection of himself, a soul adrift in a sea of chaos.

When she finally fell asleep, her head on his shoulder, the TV still playing, Marcus sat in the darkness, the weight of his actions pressing down on him. He knew he couldn't save her, couldn't save anyone. But he could give her a night of peace, a small reprieve from the horrors that awaited her outside.

The whispers grew faint, the TV's glow a comforting presence in the gloom. He sat there, the remote in his hand, the power to change the channel a symbol of his dwindling control over his own fate. But as the night stretched on, the whispers grew louder, more insistent. He knew that soon, the past would catch up with him, the bodies would be found, and the hunt would begin anew.

With a heavy sigh, Marcus stood up, the girl's head rolling onto the pillow. He knew he had to go, had to leave before the whispers grew too loud to ignore. He gathered his things, the TV remote a silent witness to the brief connection he had allowed himself. He stepped out into the night, the motel's neon glow a beacon of the life he had left behind.

The stars above twinkled like a thousand accusatory eyes, but he ignored them, focusing on the road ahead. The whispers had become a constant companion, a reminder of the lives he had taken and the price he would pay. But for now, he had to keep moving, had to stay one step ahead of the inevitable.

The night was long, the miles stretching out before him like a black ribbon of uncertainty. The TV remote felt heavier with each step, a burden that weighed on his soul. But it was also a reminder of the power to choose, to rewrite his story. And so, he walked into the darkness, the whispers of his past a fading echo, the promise of a new dawn a beacon in the distance."
Tallah - Book 3 Chapter 5.3,HFY,1i9iuq7,2025-01-25 03:47:11,2,0.75,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i9iuq7/tallah_book_3_chapter_53/,C-M-Antal,OC,"[First ](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1djqfim/tallah_progfantasy_isekai_book_1_prologue/)| [Royal Road](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/79156/tallah-prog-fantasy-revenge-story) | [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/cmantal/membership)

Thunder crested the skies, impossible on the half-clear night. It swirled around the daemon and Tallah’s hair reacted to the static charge. A heavy, malicious presence spilled out of the figure, palpable its intensity even across the distance.

It aimed its arms down at the dragon and let loose the jagged spears of power.

*‘If it kills the critter, it may be better for us,’* Anna suggested. *‘It’s as dangerous to us as it is to them.’*

*It’s not killing it.*

Tallah knew this with cold certainty, the unease in her guts growing as the daemon’s lightning cut through the dragon’s flames. If they meant to kill the beast, the daemons would have mobbed, their full numbers enough to get the task done. A dragon could be made to bleed, and it could be killed with a monstrous cost of life.

But…

The way the more dangerous monsters held back. The halfhearted assault. The oddness of the mood on the air. And, most of all, that strange, talking daemon taking the initiative.

*‘This battle is not for you,’* its words resounded in her ears.

Lightning stabbed at the dragon, piercing its body as if the great armour wasn’t even there. Tallah knew from unpleasant experience that a dragon’s hide could shrug off a Titan’s Punishment with ease, treating it as nothing more than mild irritation. She’d seen the likes of the Adjunct running for her life after striking one of these walking calamities.

To see it pierced beggared the imagination. To see there was no blood or wound made it worse.

The daemon raised its arms to the sky and the jagged pulses of power coalesced into white, blinding light threaded around its fingers. More of the threads punched through the dragon’s back, neck, wings, and snaked across its body.

*Bindings.* The word came to her unbidden, but it made horrifying sense. It wasn’t trying to kill the thing. It was attempting domination.

The first net flew over the wall, a tight ball of iron that sailed at a precise arc over the battlefield and aimed towards the creature. It cast wide, the net opening and missing its pinprick of a target. Tallah cursed and launched her own fire at the daemon.

It shrugged it off as if it were of no concern and continued to wrestle with the dragon caught in its snare.

The great lizard thrashed and spat flames at its assailant. It tried to take to the air but its wings couldn’t lift it far enough. It was as if the luminous threads sapped its strength. Even its fire diminished heartbeat by heartbeat, its roar turning to a mewling growl. If dying or not was impossible to say from a distance, but something was definitely wrong.

*‘I’m here,’* Bianca whispered just as the next two nets flew overhead. Tallah followed them on tethers of force.

Bianca reached out and nudged the nets just enough to correct their trajectory. They hit the daemon in full. The first staggered it, and the second drew it down to the ground in a flailing mass. Its focus snapped, the threads of its spell shattering like glass. Two armies held their breath as the dragon shook its head and growled, the sound a low boom that vibrated even Tallah’s bones. It flapped its wings once and was airborne. A swish of its tail spun it around to face where the daemon had fallen.

It drew a great, loud inhale of breath. Then spat it down onto the daemon as a thick stream of jet-black flames. Tallah covered her face against the blast of super-heated air that exploded from the scene.

The ground itself ran like wax. It became red, then white, then melted into a puddle of overheated rock that would slag to obsidian. The beast’s fury could be felt from all the way up on the walls, the intense heat of its breath blasting the air.

“I don’t think it’s dead,” Tallah said as she wove her illum into a single lance. She fashioned a spear of phosphorus-white fire and held it above her head. The air sizzled with its heat as she waited for the dragon to finish its assault.

When the lizard finally dropped to the ground, panting with the effort, there was only a crater remained. It glowed like hearth embers, red and angry, the entire landscape around it warped by the heat of dragon’s fire.

The dragon sniffed and approached cautiously, tail swishing in anger, wings held open, head low.

Lightning errupted from the hole. It wasn’t quite quick enough this time, its target dodging out of the way with a swiftness and deftness that belied its terrifying size. It roared again in frustration and took to the air. If its annoyance couldn’t burn, then it was probably not worth fighting further.

The black figure climbing up from the cooling crater had not survived quite pristine. Tallah’s enhanced sight showed cracks in its black body, black curls of smoke rising out from shattered skin. The white mask of its face was ashen, red light glinting through heat cracks.

It staggered up the incline, slipped on the molten rock, and finally shot up into the night, almost too quick to see in the smoke-choked air. The angle of its flight was undeniable. It was chasing after the gargantuan shape of the dragon.

Bianca accelerated them forward to give chase. The lance of fire trailed like a comet behind their flight.

*‘This isn’t Grefe,’* Bianca said, urgency in her voice. *‘I don’t have a ceiling or walls to grab onto. We aren’t flying.’*

Tallah understood Bianca’s limitations in this scenario. It was worth being reminded before she committed fully to the chase.

But instinct urged her to try and get those two monsters separated somehow. Whatever the daemon was doing, it couldn’t be something in the Rock’s favour. That weave it had used was odd, radiating a malice that she’d never met before. Somehow, she assumed a creature of this magnitude of power could have killed the dragon much quicker than it had tried already.

Anna was the first to give voice to their fears. *‘A daemon-controlled dragon… Now that would be a lovely calamity to deal with.’*

Calamity was exactly what it would be. A dragon was dangerous enough on its own when unprovoked. Under control, it would be a terrifying weapon for whoever wielded it.

She had to leap across the forest and the things within were already braying for her blood. They jumped. Threw stones. Cast spears and loosed arrows. Tallah didn’t have the resources just then to counterattack, not if she wanted to keep sight of the two flying high above her ceiling.

Bianca dodged and slipped between the projectiles and the leaping hopefuls. She picked some from the sky and reversed their vectors. Monster howled in pain below.

Lightning cracked the sky again, outlined sharply against the kicked-up ashes on the wind.

The dragon screamed in agony. Tallah caught sight of it plummeting, wrapped in the web of light again.

With Bianca guiding their flight, Tallah took aim at the origin point of the weave. The daemon was straining. The dragon came out of its dive and rose back up high into the sky, bellowing defiance. It spat its blistering black breath.

The threads broke but lightning quickly remade them.

Tallah took careful aim. Poured all of herself into the weave and cast the spear.

It streaked across the sky like an inverse meteor.

The dragon circled the daemon. It belched flames. It roared and dodged the lighting bolts aimed its way.

The daemon did not pay enough attention. It turned a fraction of a heartbeat too late.

Tallah’s spear struck the black body. Night turned to day. The whole Cauldron shuddered with the violence of the explosion. Even the dragon remained hovering uncertainly, the force of the blast nudging it off its trajectory.

Smoke cleared. The daemon’s presence lingered in the air, oppressive and poisonous, like violated illum. It hadn’t been enough.

It turned its blank stare on her.

There it was, still hovering in the air, a single wing keeping it aloft. Half of it was simply gone. An arm. A leg. Almost half of its torso. Tallah doubted it was any less dangerous now.

“Blood and bile, it’s resilient,” she cussed as her hands and chest grew cold.

*‘Time to run,’* Bianca suggested and dropped them hard towards the ground.

Several beastmen jumped away as she dropped in their midst. Anna ripped the skins off them and flung the blood upward as needles to shatter against the thing’s hide.

Tallah had just enough time to crane her neck and see the thing descend upon her. The dragon followed it, still spitting flames. She had no more strength to do a second cast, but it had been a good enough attempt. The thing could be hurt.

And if it could be hurt, it could definitely be killed.

All she needed to do now was survive the chase. Easier said than done.

What a sight this would be. A dragon chasing a daemon chasing a sorceress across the corpse-strewn clearing. It would be comedic if not for the dual threat of death by either lightning or immolation. It would be quick at least.

Bianca yanked her hard towards the Rock. Cheers of encouragement echoed over the span of the Cauldron.

“Not the fortress, Bianca. The dragon will crash into it.”

*‘Then where?!’* The ghost sounded panicked even if her stores of illum were strong.

*‘Land among the corpses,’* Anna ordered. ‘*We’ll give them something to worry over.’*

Lightning chased her across the field. With only one arm casting it, the daemon was having trouble aiming while also dodging the flames bearing on its back.

“You should have listened.” The daemon’s words crashed into the back of Tallah’s head. “I can’t allow you to interfere more. You are needed alive.” A bolt of lightning vaporised a pile of daemon corpses ahead, missing her legs by an arm’s span. “You are not needed whole.”

Oh, she’d made it angry.

As she landed, skidding and slipping in the blood mud, she turned and raised two middle fingers towards the monster, imitating Vergil’s derision. Anna acted instantly and, in a heartbeat, Tallah was surrounded by naked clones of herself, blood-red, glistening in the moonlight. They stared up at the descending monster, sprouted bat-like wings, and shot up into the sky to crash against it.

“Why didn’t your dolls fly too?” Tallah asked in amazement.

*‘Into where? The ceiling?!’*

“Fair.”

They flesh dolls gathered in a great pile atop the daemon and tore ineffectually at it. A sweep of its remaining arm shattered three of them in a single hit, while the rest bit and clawed at its nearly impregnable hide.

They’d stopped it for just long enough. The dragon fell them all. It shattered the dolls and grabbed the daemon in a powerful clawed paw. It slammed it into the ground with the weighty impact of a meteor, their impact shaking the entire Cauldron.

Lightning arched into the air, missing the dragon’s head. It pressed down its entire weight on the captive creature, like a cat playing with a feisty mouse. Black flames poured over the daemon, again melting the stones beneath. The flames cut off suddenly and the dragon snapped down.

It pulled, muscles bunching on its neck and shoulders, until it ripped off the daemon’s leg with a sickening crunch. The lizard swallowed. It bit down again, lifted the still burning daemon into the air and snapped it up, its jaws working to break that impressive shell.

Tallah could do nothing but watch as Anna wove around her.

*‘It would be nice if that creature bled,’* the ghost said. *‘Would make killing it much easier.’*

Still, the ghost wove. More flesh dolls rose from the mounds of the dead, feral-looking things that barely resembled Tallah anymore. They all approached the dragon, closing ranks around it, waiting for the inevitable.

The dragon’s head slammed down into the ground, its jaw opening. The black daemon spilled out and rolled through the mud, shattered but not dead. Anna’s dolls pounced on it, cutting and stabbing and biting. They thrust their claws at the exposed black flesh that shone wetly on its stumps.

There, their claws found purchase. The more they stabbed, the more they managed to break off it, the harder it fought them off, its remaining arm lashing out with incredible force. No doll survived a single strike from the daemon, but together they were managing to wound it.

The dragon watched with animal curiosity, black flames billowing through the gaps in its fangs.

The ground rumbled and Tallah spun in place.

“Bugger me,” she whispered.

The forest had errupted into a mass of bodies rushing across the field of the dead, screaming and howling, waving weapons. The entire waiting threat came at them, braying for blood.

Vilfor’s archers darkened the sky with their arrows and the battle recommenced with a furious howl.

Tallah rushed to draw more illum in and weave another lance. She could kill the creature here and now, and be rid of its threat. If only she could amass enough strength.

The dragon turned in place from its victim and looked at the on-rush of daemons. It roared and charged at the encroaching army, its anger raw and red-hot. It barrelled through the front ranks, head lowered, goring an entire column of monsters in its charge. It snapped down, grabbed a mouthful of bodies, then took to the sky in one powerful flap of its wings.

“No!” the daemon screamed, the first sound out of it since threatening Tallah.

The sound staggered her. Arrows flew crooked. The dolls shattered and melted back into the foul blood that had birthed them.

It took to the sky as well, its flight uneven and ragged. Instead of chasing after the dragon as Tallah feared, it banked sideways and approached the Rock to a hail of arrows and stones cast at it. Vilfor roared up on the battlements, axes held out, challenging the monster.

It took no notice as it turned sharply and flew parallel to the wall. Lightning uncoiled off its remaining arm and struck the rock structure with the force of an unleashed Titan’s Punishment. Tallah’s knees bucked and she covered her ears to save her hearing.

Great slabs of wall collapsed inward. The ground shook. A whole section of ramparts fell to ruin with a deafening scream of shattering stones and mortar.

The Rock’s innards lay exposed to the vile night, its insides opened to the monsters of the Cauldron.

Tallah’s heart threatened to claw its way out of her at the sight of the great wound inflicted on the ancient fortress. It wasn’t enough to breach all the way to the inner courtyards, but it did open it to a more direct attack.

Daemons dropped whatever else they may have been doing and charged the breach. Even the greater monsters that had laid hidden in the forest now moved with purpose towards the Rock.

Tallah was faced with a choice: give chase to the wounded daemon and try to kill it off, or protect the Rock. It wasn’t an easy choice.

She made one nonetheless.

Bianca launched her into the air and angled her jump towards the daemon limping away as it tried to escape back towards the centre of the Cauldron. A fresh spear trailed her flight like a comet’s tail. It was nearly ready, but the cost proved dizzying.

After this she would be useless for the rest of the night at least, spent of all strength and teetering on the edge of true burnout.

Christina would rip her ears off. It was a concern for later.

Bianca drew them ever closer to their quarry, barely keeping pace with the daemon’s flight.

Gritting her teeth as all her strength poured into this final cast, Tallah loosed the spear up at the struggling daemon. It cut across the sky, aimed for the dead centre of what remained of the monster. A small target to hit, but not impossible.

Twin fireballs shot out from the forest, flew on an arc towards the daemon, and crashed into her lance. They saved the critter.

Tallah cursed under her breath and swung her gaze down at the forest. Several lances fired out in her direction. They would have hit her if not for Bianca’s vigilance. A hard mid-flight yank rattled her bones and brains, but avoided the attack.

The last Tallah saw of the daemon, it disappeared into a pocket of darkness and was gone. And with it, its terrifying presence dissipated. She could breathe again. Just in time to rush back to the defence of the walls. Morning crawled nearer but it would still be a bell’s strike at least until the first ray of sunlight.

For the night, they’d avoided a disaster but met a new one. Demons poured into the Rock through the gaping wound in its side. Those that breached wouldn’t be worried about the light once day broke.

Vilfor would handle that incursion.

Tallah crashed back on her platform, Bianca’s strength just barely enough to clear the wall again. She collapsed to her knees and gasped for breath. With the speed of the flight and the jerks and shudders of sudden acceleration, braking and dodging, every bone in her protested.

Anna retracted her power and Tallah’s eyesight darkened, the world going back to blurry outlines. It was getting worse with each effort.

Tallah lay for a terribly long time just like that, unable to move or find her feet, the weight of the world crushing her shoulders.

“Where's the boy got to?” she wondered distantly. The walls were deserted save for a handful of archers that tracked the skies above her.

All the other soldiers would be in the belly of the fortress, stemming the flow of monsters before they got a foothold into the city.

With an effort of will—and Bianca—Tallah climbed to her feet and stretched the kinks out of her muscles. She turned and regarded the black tide flowing towards the walls as if they hadn’t died by the score just a short while prior.

The dead were forgotten, eaten, or crushed into mulch. The dragon was gone. At least a disaster had been avoided with that small victory.

Looking into the distance, towards the Anvil she could only wonder of what went on in that distant fortress.

She aimed to find out. But first, the rats in the walls needed dealing with. Vergil was likely down there, trying to get himself killed.

*I should leave him to the consequences of his actions,* she thought glumly.

Nevertheless, her legs knew where they were needed. Still aching, she turned towards the stairs and went down to the first entrance into the bowels of the Rock. The boy had come to her aid earlier. It was only fitting she did the same.

If only she could manage, somehow, to walk straight."
Tell me how this isn't a pump n dump coin,AlchemyPay,1i9hbq6,2025-01-25 01:54:13,7,0.77,18,https://i.redd.it/elude89383fe1.jpeg,Batrah,Discussion 🧠,
3 weeks out from laparoscopic bisalp and couldn't be happier,childfree,1i9gv8c,2025-01-25 01:21:32,24,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1i9gv8c/3_weeks_out_from_laparoscopic_bisalp_and_couldnt/,Sad-Bowl-1212,FIX,"i got my bisalp on jan 3rd. literally feeling so beyond grateful to my surgeon and the fact that i booked that first consult with her literally the day after election day. lol 

quick (or not so quick sorry im rambly when my adhd meds wear off) summary of my whole experience below: 

initial consult: nov 7

i'd been thinking about getting sterilized since i was like 16 years old lol. i've known that i never wanted to birth children since i was at least 10. election day just gave me a sense of urgency that i couldn't shake and so i decided to book with a surgeon that i found here in the sub's list of doctors (Dr Annie Kim in NYC who i highly recommend) 

she was instantly so kind and calm and understanding. she just let me ramble about my reasoning and then thanked me for doing my homework and didn't question or comment on anything else. she told me about the risks of surgery and explained what the rest of the process would look like from there. she put me into her surgery calendar and got me booked in with her NP to sign the forms that NY state requires. no one in any part of that process questioned anything about my decision and that felt so awesome. 

i was even able to be open about the fact that i didn't want my parents to know the exact details of my surgery (specifically that it was for sterilization purposes) but i couldn't hide that i was having surgery from my parents and both of them insisted on being there to make sure i was okay (which i was grateful for but also nervous lol). Dr Kim assured me that she would let her team know and that i could also confirm that with them the day of surgery when i met them. 

surgery day: jan 3

i was instructed not to eat or drink after midnight the night before and to arrive at the surgery center at 9 am. i didn't sleep much but i got in a good shower the night before as well as the day of, and i was aching to chug water by the time we got to the hospital. my surgery was scheduled for 11:30 am but ended up being pushed to around 1:30 pm and i was Suffering from not being able to drink water 😭 

my parents drove me to the surgical center and my mom came with me to check in. no one mentioned the details of my procedure (which i really appreciated) and my mom overheard the admin asking me if i would like to pay the bill ($1075) or be billed and pay it later. i wanted to be billed because i knew i could fight it with my insurance, but my mom insisted on putting it on her credit card and refused to take no for an answer lol. 

the pre-op went fine, i met a bunch of people and they all asked me the exact same questions haha. during pre-op was the first time i had a slightly ""off"" experience in this whole process: an OR nurse was asking what procedure i was receiving, then looked down at my chart and said ""but you're so young!"" 🙃 at that point i was like i'm just surprised i got this far without being bingo'd lol so i just said ""yeah but i have zero interest in gestation"" lol and she let it go. 

the operation itself felt like it went so fast. before i knew it i was waking up to my surgeon telling me everything went well and that she would call my mom and that we would talk later haha. then i dipped in and out as i was rolled into the recovery room. 

i think i woke up pretty fast and kind of immediately from the anesthesia once i was in recovery. it felt like my mind was more alert than my body so that was weird but having experienced sleep paralysis, it was nowhere near as bad as that lol. i just lay there trying to raise my head and ask for water because my throat hurt pretty bad, and when the nurse finally noticed me she was like ""oh! you're awake! sorry!!"" and then grabbed me some crackers and water lol. 

i think the recovery room was probably the most uncomfortable part of the whole healing process! it burned so badly when i peed that i couldn't help but wince every time and it felt weird to walk around being so careful of my incisions. my throat also felt like sandpaper and it hurt so bad! 

recovery: 

this ended up being nowhere near as bad as i expected it to be, thankfully. i was given like 30 800mg ibuprofen and 5 percocet for pain management and ended up only taking the percocet for the first few nights to avoid discomfort while sleeping. i alternated with tylenol and ibuprofen otherwise, and i can't say i was ever really in severe pain. 

the gas pains did reach my shoulders at one point but walking did really help! and pooping for the first time (like 5 days post surgery, which, as someone who's super regular, was pretty uncomfortable and off haha) was super weird lol. i took some stool softeners my surgeon recommended and it ended up being fine! 

my mom stocked my fridge with homemade meals for like ten days which i was super grateful for. i did make my parents leave my apartment the same day as my surgery (they wanted to stay over lol) because the only other place i have to sleep in my apartment other than my bed is my pull out couch, and it's definitely not big enough for them and they refused to put me out of my bed. i didn't feel the need to really be watched over tbh i kept being like wtf am i superwoman. why do i basically feel normal but i wince every time i pee. lol 

i ended up spending most of the recovery on my own in my apartment and it was great! (aside from my douchebag neighbors who were extremely loud and disrupted my sleep multiple times 🥲) i was able to care for my cat just fine. my surgery was on friday and i took the monday and tuesday off, but resumed wfh on wednesday and went back to the office the following monday. 

i'm happy to report im completely back to normal now! the tape finally came off my bellybutton incision and all the incisions are healing fine as far as i can tell, no irritation or pain. i've resumed my grocery trips (carrying 40 lbs 1 mi home from trader joe's lol) and long walks and running up and down the subway stairs as usual and it's all been good! 

oh and the hospital refunded my mom the $1075! i got an EoB from my insurance and called the billing dept. they said it might take them 2-3 months to receive the EoB from my insurance company and issue a refund lol but i guess they received it early 🤷‍♀️

anyway this whole process went so smoothly for me and i am so beyond grateful. especially looking around at what the world has become in just the past 22 days. i think i can actually breathe easier and feel slightly more detached looking around at it all though because at least i know i will never bring a child into this crap. 💖

thank you for reading this if you did and also i apologize lol "

I was looking to find ways to make more cash back on my mortgage and utilities and such.  I'm hoping to find a way to use my double points card with some service to convert it to ACH and I was referred here.  

Their website isn't very good at conveying information.  What I gather is Bilt is its own credit card?    


Can it do ACH payments? 

Can I pay my BILT balance with a different credit card, or just my bank? 

How much cash back do I get from them?

What are the fees?  

  
Thank you so much!  Sorry for the 101 questions, but their own ""help"" section was tantamount to useless, and I couldn't get any deeper info without first making an account.  Also if there are other services to look into I would be deeply appreciative!  "
Red Tail - a child finds solace in an surprising face,CreepCast_Submissions,1i9exbw,2025-01-24 23:21:12,0,0.5,0,https://i.redd.it/exhcgw3sg2fe1.jpeg,ckjm,creepypasta,"""Careful child,"" the old woman sneered as she flicked the boy's face, eliciting a wince and a whimper from the adolescent. ""Bad children make a rich meal for the harpies."" She chided.

The boy had been playing with a peer two years his senior, stirring light mischief between the two in vulgar words and escapades. The older boy, Marcus, had a more seasoned repertoire of worldly sins, and James was captivated, having spent his short youth thus far embellished in astute godliness and obedient ritual. Marcus' experiences, real or not, were as gluttonous as sweets on Yule. But, despite their best efforts to remain hidden and, thus, free to indulge in their tales without consequence, the old hag could hear them plain as day around the aging walls of the cottage.

""And you,"" the crone hissed, ""those beasts most certainly have you in their sights. It's a disappointment that they haven't yet plucked your eyes from their sockets with their talons-""

""My dad says the harpies haven't been here since I was a baby."" Marcus interjected, defiance in his voice.

Her face twisted just to hear him. ""Your father's a drunk and a coward. What has he done to keep them at bay? And your mother was a whore. The birds ought to take the lot of you and ransack her grave."" 

Marcus' eyes welled with light tears at the mention of his mother. Her unjust death had driven his already alcoholic farther to further despair.

""Be rid of me, bastard,"" the woman scolded with a closed, bony fist, ""and stay away from James, lest you be privy to the birds’ nests and feed their malformed chicks with your flesh.""

Marcus took off sobbing, leaving James to endure the elder's now amplified anger. James knew that there’d be punishment for sharing company with such an uncouth member of their community. But James had loved Marcus, and youthful ignorance left him bereft of the judgement of his elders until this time.

Grandma Agatha, a prideful woman with swift punishment, reminded her brood that night that the village was once so fertile because the people hunted wretched beasts, which, in turn, blessed the righteous with prosperity in exchange for their efforts to purify the world. Their crops were fertilized with the black and rancid blood of foul monster spilled across the soil, and God above granted prosperity for their diligent hunts. 

The village, if it could be called such, was a small community of zealots thriving on their obscure beliefs and the frequency of traders passing through. It was once a hub for wheat and furs. Winters were harsh, but summers were lush, at least, they were lush. About the age that James was able to toddle through the family's meager home and follow his older siblings, the crops were inflicted with blight and the animals were plagued with frequent and ghastly mutilation. Times now, in the best of days, were lean, but more frequently they were wholly destitute.

""But sweet children, the monsters now fear our devotion, and we’ve forgotten that our own are also beholden to our righteousness."" She clutched the necklace around her neck, tracing the sacred shape with her bony thumb. ""We must purify. That's why the crops are barren. God requires blood as penance, and we’ve spared the wicked when we should have slain.""

""Grandmama,"" the youngest girl squeaked, the light of the fire obscuring her face in contrasted shadows of night, ""I thought there was one still? One more... monster?"" She spoke the name with a whisper, afraid that speaking it would form it to reality and it’d reach its gangly claws through the glass pane behind her matriarch. “Couldn’t we kill it? We can be righteous.” 

""We beckon it with disobedience."" Agatha warned before pausing. ""And you are all obedient, aren’t you?” She paused to observe each child, frowning longer at James. “Hush now children, and pray. Pray for the crops and pray for your souls.”

Winter was more cruel than usual, two children and one woman succumbed. Rumors stirred. The people whispered that the curse of the beasts now came after their offspring, others cried that God demanded innocent blood because they failed to kill the remaining beast, and others warned of hidden sins within the community. Panic set in rapidly and pulled at the loose communion they had formed and fingers were more quickly pointed. 

“Your mother laid with anything that looked at her, Marcus,” an older boy, Samuel, sneered. “I hear she spread her legs for beasts even.” He laughed, joined by the other boys.

“She was a whore. She’s the reason my baby sister is dead.” The boy’s ridicule turned to spite as he shoved Marcus into the mud and kicked at him.

Marcus shielded his face and looked towards James, who stood in the back of the small group of miscreants. 

“You don’t believe that, do you, James?” Marcus pleaded to his friend. “Somebody killed her,” his voice trailed off to a quiet drone as his eyes watched his friend with desperation.

“I hear she had been mutilated and naked.” James spoke sheepishly, averting his eyes. “And the timing all lined up…”

“That’s right,” the older boy kicked at Marcus again, interrupting James’ indecision and inaction. “Her sins brought the harpy. She got what she deserved, but now we have to clean up the mess she made!” 

Marcus wasn’t sure what stung worse: the swift kicks of the boy’s leather boots on his ribs or the fact that James stood back. He clung to his breath and his consciousness began to slip. He could see his mother, he remembered so vividly when he found her… Marcus’ father stumbled with ferocious, clumsy speed towards the fight, pulling Marcus back to his present emergency.

“Leave him be, devils!” Tom hurled his liquor bottle at the children, the last of the bitter brew splashing across Samuel as it widely missed his head. 

Samuel cackled and he and his kin brats ran away, readily outmaneuvering the intoxicated and worried father. “Whore mother, drunk father, fodder of the beast!”

“Marcusss,” he slurred. “Are you alright, boy?”

Marcus wiped a tear from his eye and swished the iron taste of blood in his mouth as his farther reached to console him, babbling incoherent curses and drunk concerns. His father’s cheeks were flushed and his hair unkempt, and Marcus hated how disheveled his father always looked. He hated how easily he affirmed his alcoholism. But most of all, Marcus hated the sour stench of booze that always followed Tom.

Marcus scrunched his face and he wailed, slapping his father’s hand away and fleeing the scene where he had been beaten, all the while his father cried behind him and promptly fell trying to chase after him before sobbing uncontrollably in the mud. 

“My boy, my only boy,” Tom howled until Marcus could no longer hear his father’s plea.


Marcus ran until he vomited bile. He hadn’t eaten that morning, perhaps days; there was nothing to eat. His ribs ached and stung, and as he clutched them he was acutely aware how pronounced they had become. 

He had climbed steadily up the slope of the surrounding mountains and now perched over the village. This far up the range, the ground was frozen and patches of snow clung dumbly. Spring was coming, but it was still winter on the cold mountain face. It was an appropriate place to weep alone, far from the judgement and painful blows of his horrid peers and the embarrassment that had become his father. 

Marcus was no stranger to death, and now more than ever he wish he could collapse into its embrace, that he could curl into the hillside and let his hunger and his sorrow and the cold overtake him. There was comfort in that possibility. The thought of his baby sister and his mother briefly brought him a weak smile but only made his heartache stronger as it faded. He cried harder. He was oblivious to the many eyes that now watched him. 

In a bramble blacker than a moonless night, the beast stirred. It revealed itself by the time Marcus ceased his hysterics and noticed it crawling before him. He shrieked and fell, trying to escape, but it snatched him quickly with its claws and pulled him back. 

Its eyes were milky white and sightless, but where its crown could not see, its wings observed keenly with a hundred black eyes protruding like glossy beetles amidst its feathers. Arched around the boy from every angle, it held both wings out like scythes and clutched Marcus by his chest with its talons, watching steadily. 

Cautiously, it pulled one wing back and, with its inhuman fingers, plucked a single feather from its breast. It rolled the feather’s shaft between the pads of its two fingers, gently waving it in front of Marcus, and slowly concealed the feather behind its wing. When it revealed its grotesque hand again, a juicy red apple had replaced the feather.

Coaxed by hunger, Marcus contemplated the last time he had tasted the pleasantries of an apple. He could smell it now. Only the ripest, sweetest fruit smelled so strongly. He figured if he was about to die, what harm would the apple do? He reached carefully towards the treat, and to his surprise, the monster pulled itself back gently and purposefully, allowing the boy space and freedom to eat.

He took a greedy bite while he eyed the monster. The creature’s head stared dumbly in an unimportant direction while the eyes on one wing, draped gracefully and arguably welcomingly, watched Marcus with adoring perception. 

This ritual repeated several days, and Marcus began to trust the monster with each reoccurrence. By the seventh or eighth day, he sat against the monster, his back resting against its body, as he happily gobbled the delicious treat it offered him. It quietly preened its black, dull feathers, paying careful attention to the nodules that were growing in the expanding bald patch by its breast. 

Marcus supposed that the monster would give him every part of herself if he asked, and he wondered why and how it could be so selfless in truth but so hated in story. He didn’t look for the answers too deeply in his thoughts, however, because at the end of the day he missed the comfort of his mother. This harpy was the most maternal thing he had known since her passing. He buried his face in her ragged feathers and he found his eyelids grew heavier as he absorbed her warmth. 

In contrast, sleep was cold. He could hear the echoes of his baby sister’s shrill laughter slowly fade to the sickly wheezes of her dying breaths as sickness took her. The clatter of glass bottles in conjunction with a mourning father. The anxious whispers of a stressed mother trying to hold a family together. And the curses of a broken man refusing to admit the vices that let him overlook the doings of the real monster when she was slaughtered. The sound fell silent to a stark visual as the pale image of his dead mother filled his memory, her naked body bare and stretched in anguished, defiling directions.

Marcus woke with a start, tears dripping from his clenched eyes. The harpy chirped and fussed with his hair, nipping lightly at his scalp. To his surprise, it offered him to suckle. And to his greater surprise, of which he could not understand, he accepted the gesture. He was too old for this, he thought, but he didn’t care.

Time flew effortlessly with the harpy, and Marcus had began to put on much needed weight once again, fed well on milk, fruit, and game. He had no friends nor diligent parents to notice his absence, and it was a blissful life in the shadow of the mountain with the beast. He would return to his familiar home only to keep appearances. His nightmares soon stopped under her protection.

Marcus approached the hollow where the harpy lived and found her waiting on him with a hare. She stood still, more so than usual, while he prepared the hare and gathered sticks to roast the meal. 

Without warning, she threw her head backwards. Her lower lips retracted and her mandible spilt. Her impossibly wide maw opened. Marcus was speechless, and she gagged and twisted her neck, regurgitating a mass coated in thick mucus and fleshy membranes. Marcus held his breath as a human face wriggled from the tissue until it stared back at him and blinked. To his horror, he recognized the face looking back, it was his mother’s. He burst into tears. 

The monster immediately recoiled the facial sac back into its throat and lowered its head in a timid gesture, but Marcus crawled away. It backed him into a corner, whimpering like a nervous dog and begging for attention. Its throat quivered and it began croaking somewhat like a raven, exploring pitches and tones until it settled on a crude human voice. 

“Marrrcus.” The voice was unsure and changed as the creature tweaked its presentation between chirps and submissive gestures.

Marcus swore it sounded like his mother. He hadn’t heard her in months, but how could he forget that melodic voice?

“Marcusss,” it now slurred as it copied the voice of Tom.

Marcus assumed the creature was one of mimicry, and could show any face or any voice, and that, perhaps, its intentions were pure despite how outwardly horrific they looked. Perhaps it only wanted to give Marcus what he missed most. 

“You - you can’t just do that,” Marcus sobbed. He realized how foolish it was to entertain forgiving this thing, but beneath its crude and alien affection he realized he had grown to love it too. He reached out to pet her face as she slowly revealed the facial sac once again. Marcus caressed his mother’s face, brushing aside the tendrils of spit that still clung to her satin skin, and he smiled when she smiled at him. The creature began to sing a lullaby that Marcus knew well, and cradled him in her wings. Marcus relented, eager for the love of his mother. 

Each day that James watched his former friend sneak away, he grew increasingly frustrated and curious… frustrated by whatever sins James could pin against his peer that required such secrecy, and curious that he was missing out on some grand opportunity that the bastard child of an alcoholic and whore certainly didn’t deserve. Whatever James thought it could be, he certainly had expected what he saw as had watched in silent horror the creature’s deranged mimicry. James had seen enough and finally screamed as hot piss trickled down his legs. He ran, wailing, and Marcus followed hot on his heels.

The boys ran down the mountain through thick brambles and forgotten forests, greedy branches pulling at skin and fabric alike. And when the opportunity presented, Marcus tackled James, pummeling him. 

Sticky blood erupted from James’ nose while the boys pawed at each other. Neither were fighters, but Marcus had been emboldened by blind ferocity to protect his secret, protect his mother. Marcus wasn’t sure what his ultimate plan was, but he surmised he’d do whatever was necessary; however, before he could accept that dark path, James lobbed a rock into Marcus’ temple, rendering him stunned and stupid on the cold earth. James continued running to his home. 

In the village, the elder Richard paused to hear the approaching commotion. Richard was a peculiar man. He had a wife and six children, all equally hushed through experience and all equally timid by Richard’s actions. And the raucous child that approached from a distance angered him more than it disturbed him. His blood boiled more to see Marcus tailing behind James and start another fight. The chaotic mess required discipline, he thought, and of course Marcus, son of the town’s least pious, was at the root of this. 

Richard marched towards the scuffle, fists clenched, muttering proverbs to calm his growing displeasure. 

“Elder! Elder! He is with the beast!” James cried.

“Shut your mouth! You’ll not hurt her!” Marcus screamed as he smothered James’ mouth.

Richard plucked the two boys, throwing Marcus back and eyeing James for serious injury. Before Marcus could run, the man grabbed the boy by the ankle. Marcus’ farther staggered to the scene, moving as quickly as his drunkenness would allow when he saw the boys fighting from a distance. The boys screamed while Richard chided, and soon Tom was screaming too.

“You!” Richard cursed, “your drunk sins have let this boy fall to the beast.” Richard shook Marcus by the shoulder, the boy winced at his grasp. By now several others had arrived.

“Grab him!” Richard screamed, pointing at Marcus’ father with his other hand. A flurry of unquestioning men obeyed, and Tom was readily restrained.

“Brother Thomas, you might not care to attend our communions in church, but your sins are obvious. Maryanne paid for her part in your wrongdoings, and as you continue to fail your child, he now beholden to the beast. He may still be cleansed and live on, but you… your blood will water our crops with that of the beast’s.”
	
Many hands made quick work to construct a primitive court in the sprawling desolation of the barren field. As the sun creeped closer to the horizon, Marcus had been restrained with thick cord by his wrists to two posts pounded into the earth, and his father had been bound before him, a sac secured over his face. 

Richard passed attention to Father O’Neil, priest of their backwards church, and a morbid sermon took place in the orange light of dusk. By the end of it, Richard pulled a dagger from his breast pocket and another man pulled the sac from Tom’s face, grasping him by the hair and exposing his Adam’s apple. 

Marcus struggled in his shackles and his dad stared pitifully at his son, but before he could utter any words of love or remorse, Richard dragged the dagger across his throat, splashing thick, red, arterial spray into the soil. Tom’s eyes when wide and he coughed, gurgling on the blood that poured from his neck and now filled his lungs. 

“DAD!” Marcus screamed and thrashed. 

The people watched. Some uttered prayers, others stood silent, other averted their eyes, but all accepted that this was what had to be. 

“DAAAD!!!” Marcus wept. 

Answering his pleas, ragged black wings rose from the horizon with a vengeful shriek. The monster heard the cries of the boy and rallied to answer. The villagers erupted in a flurry, women screaming and grabbing their children. Many fled to shelter as the monster approached. But Richard stood fast.

At some point prior to the slaughter, the community had rolled a catapult of sorts to the killing grounds, and set the iron bolt, ready to fly through the air at a command. Richard pushed the mechanism to aim at the monster now, and, with the beast closing in, released the sinister arrow. It flew through the air with a whistle and plunged straight through the bare patch on the creature’s breast. 

The bolt tore through its chest, shooting blood below the creature in a red arc. It threw its head back in agony, and as it did, a human face burst through its mouth, soon followed by thick tendrils of blood. Its milky eyes never changed expression, but its human face was wrought with anguish, pain, and mourning. It crashed to the earth without another sound or motion. Marcus screamed louder. 

In front off him, his father was now motionless too. His blood had pooled around him. Nearby where the monster fell, its blood had spilled and small sprouts shot through the soil. 

The people rejoiced and the sun began to set. Soon the sky would match the newly crimson soil. Marcus whimpered in his restraints. He had been forgotten as the community celebrated the bloodbath.

Richard stepped forward, cutting the binds around the boy’s limbs. Freed, he fell limp, and Richard pulled him to his feet with an unforgiving grasp. 

“You’re as tainted as your mother, boy,” Richard spoke, venom thick in his hushed words. “Your mother, when she drew her last breath, she was a pleasant thing. At least she had that much. You have her eyes, her mouth,” Richard smirked as he squeezed the boy’s cheeks to face his own. "

He didn’t look for the answers too deeply in his thoughts, however, because at the end of the day he missed the comfort of his mother. This harpy was the most maternal thing he had known since her passing. He buried his face in her ragged feathers and he found his eyelids grew heavier as he absorbed her warmth. 

In contrast, sleep was cold. He could hear the echoes of his baby sister’s shrill laughter slowly fade to the sickly wheezes of her dying breaths as sickness took her. The clatter of glass bottles in conjunction with a mourning father. The anxious whispers of a stressed mother trying to hold a family together. And the curses of a broken man refusing to admit the vices that let him overlook the doings of the real monster when she was slaughtered. The sound fell silent to a stark visual as the pale image of his dead mother filled his memory, her naked body bare and stretched in anguished, defiling directions.

Marcus woke with a start, tears dripping from his clenched eyes. The harpy chirped and fussed with his hair, nipping lightly at his scalp. To his surprise, it offered him to suckle. And to his greater surprise, of which he could not understand, he accepted the gesture. He was too old for this, he thought, but he didn’t care.

Time flew effortlessly with the harpy, and Marcus had began to put on much needed weight once again, fed well on milk, fruit, and game. He had no friends nor diligent parents to notice his absence, and it was a blissful life in the shadow of the mountain with the beast. He would return to his familiar home only to keep appearances. His nightmares soon stopped under her protection.

Marcus approached the hollow where the harpy lived and found her waiting on him with a hare. She stood still, more so than usual, while he prepared the hare and gathered sticks to roast the meal. 

Without warning, she threw her head backwards. Her lower lips retracted and her mandible spilt. Her impossibly wide maw opened. Marcus was speechless, and she gagged and twisted her neck, regurgitating a mass coated in thick mucus and fleshy membranes. Marcus held his breath as a human face wriggled from the tissue until it stared back at him and blinked. To his horror, he recognized the face looking back, it was his mother’s. He burst into tears. 

The monster immediately recoiled the facial sac back into its throat and lowered its head in a timid gesture, but Marcus crawled away. It backed him into a corner, whimpering like a nervous dog and begging for attention. Its throat quivered and it began croaking somewhat like a raven, exploring pitches and tones until it settled on a crude human voice. 

“Marrrcus.” The voice was unsure and changed as the creature tweaked its presentation between chirps and submissive gestures.

Marcus swore it sounded like his mother. He hadn’t heard her in months, but how could he forget that melodic voice?

“Marcusss,” it now slurred as it copied the voice of Tom.

Marcus assumed the creature was one of mimicry, and could show any face or any voice, and that, perhaps, its intentions were pure despite how outwardly horrific they looked. Perhaps it only wanted to give Marcus what he missed most. 

“You - you can’t just do that,” Marcus sobbed. He realized how foolish it was to entertain forgiving this thing, but beneath its crude and alien affection he realized he had grown to love it too. He reached out to pet her face as she slowly revealed the facial sac once again. Marcus caressed his mother’s face, brushing aside the tendrils of spit that still clung to her satin skin, and he smiled when she smiled at him. The creature began to sing a lullaby that Marcus knew well, and cradled him in her wings. Marcus relented, eager for the love of his mother. 

Each day that James watched his former friend sneak away, he grew increasingly frustrated and curious… frustrated by whatever sins James could pin against his peer that required such secrecy, and curious that he was missing out on some grand opportunity that the bastard child of an alcoholic and whore certainly didn’t deserve. Whatever James thought it could be, he certainly had expected what he saw as had watched in silent horror the creature’s deranged mimicry. James had seen enough and finally screamed as hot piss trickled down his legs. He ran, wailing, and Marcus followed hot on his heels.

The boys ran down the mountain through thick brambles and forgotten forests, greedy branches pulling at skin and fabric alike. And when the opportunity presented, Marcus tackled James, pummeling him. 

Sticky blood erupted from James’ nose while the boys pawed at each other. Neither were fighters, but Marcus had been emboldened by blind ferocity to protect his secret, protect his mother. Marcus wasn’t sure what his ultimate plan was, but he surmised he’d do whatever was necessary; however, before he could accept that dark path, James lobbed a rock into Marcus’ temple, rendering him stunned and stupid on the cold earth. James continued running to his home. 

In the village, the elder Richard paused to hear the approaching commotion. Richard was a peculiar man. He had a wife and six children, all equally hushed through experience and all equally timid by Richard’s actions. And the raucous child that approached from a distance angered him more than it disturbed him. His blood boiled more to see Marcus tailing behind James and start another fight. The chaotic mess required discipline, he thought, and of course Marcus, son of the town’s least pious, was at the root of this. 

Richard marched towards the scuffle, fists clenched, muttering proverbs to calm his growing displeasure. 

“Elder! Elder! He is with the beast!” James cried.

“Shut your mouth! You’ll not hurt her!” Marcus screamed as he smothered James’ mouth.

Richard plucked the two boys, throwing Marcus back and eyeing James for serious injury. Before Marcus could run, the man grabbed the boy by the ankle. Marcus’ farther staggered to the scene, moving as quickly as his drunkenness would allow when he saw the boys fighting from a distance. The boys screamed while Richard chided, and soon Tom was screaming too.

“You!” Richard cursed, “your drunk sins have let this boy fall to the beast.” Richard shook Marcus by the shoulder, the boy winced at his grasp. By now several others had arrived.

“Grab him!” Richard screamed, pointing at Marcus’ father with his other hand. A flurry of unquestioning men obeyed, and Tom was readily restrained.

“Brother Thomas, you might not care to attend our communions in church, but your sins are obvious. Maryanne paid for her part in your wrongdoings, and as you continue to fail your child, he now beholden to the beast. He may still be cleansed and live on, but you… your blood will water our crops with that of the beast’s.”
	
Many hands made quick work to construct a primitive court in the sprawling desolation of the barren field. As the sun creeped closer to the horizon, Marcus had been restrained with thick cord by his wrists to two posts pounded into the earth, and his father had been bound before him, a sac secured over his face. 

Richard passed attention to Father O’Neil, priest of their backwards church, and a morbid sermon took place in the orange light of dusk. By the end of it, Richard pulled a dagger from his breast pocket and another man pulled the sac from Tom’s face, grasping him by the hair and exposing his Adam’s apple. 

Marcus struggled in his shackles and his dad stared pitifully at his son, but before he could utter any words of love or remorse, Richard dragged the dagger across his throat, splashing thick, red, arterial spray into the soil. Tom’s eyes when wide and he coughed, gurgling on the blood that poured from his neck and now filled his lungs. 

“DAD!” Marcus screamed and thrashed. 

The people watched. Some uttered prayers, others stood silent, other averted their eyes, but all accepted that this was what had to be. 

“DAAAD!!!” Marcus wept. 

Answering his pleas, ragged black wings rose from the horizon with a vengeful shriek. The monster heard the cries of the boy and rallied to answer. The villagers erupted in a flurry, women screaming and grabbing their children. Many fled to shelter as the monster approached. But Richard stood fast.

At some point prior to the slaughter, the community had rolled a catapult of sorts to the killing grounds, and set the iron bolt, ready to fly through the air at a command. Richard pushed the mechanism to aim at the monster now, and, with the beast closing in, released the sinister arrow. It flew through the air with a whistle and plunged straight through the bare patch on the creature’s breast. 

The bolt tore through its chest, shooting blood below the creature in a red arc. It threw its head back in agony, and as it did, a human face burst through its mouth, soon followed by thick tendrils of blood. Its milky eyes never changed expression, but its human face was wrought with anguish, pain, and mourning. It crashed to the earth without another sound or motion. Marcus screamed louder. 

In front off him, his father was now motionless too. His blood had pooled around him. Nearby where the monster fell, its blood had spilled and small sprouts shot through the soil. 

The people rejoiced and the sun began to set. Soon the sky would match the newly crimson soil. Marcus whimpered in his restraints. He had been forgotten as the community celebrated the bloodbath.

Richard stepped forward, cutting the binds around the boy’s limbs. Freed, he fell limp, and Richard pulled him to his feet with an unforgiving grasp. 

“You’re as tainted as your mother, boy,” Richard spoke, venom thick in his hushed words. “Your mother, when she drew her last breath, she was a pleasant thing. At least she had that much. You have her eyes, her mouth,” Richard smirked as he squeezed the boy’s cheeks to face his own. "
"I'm a Police Officer. People are Dying in My Town, and I Don't Know Why (Part2)",u_Federal_Machine692,1i9ejud,2025-01-24 22:59:58,3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Federal_Machine692/comments/1i9ejud/im_a_police_officer_people_are_dying_in_my_town/,Federal_Machine692,,"[Part1](https://www.reddit.com/user/Federal_Machine692/comments/1i9eii5/im_a_police_officer_people_are_dying_in_my_town/)

*I took a careful step back, my eyes scanning the mill’s interior. The fireplace led to a chimney wide enough for a person to fit through, but there was no visible point of entry from the inside. Stepping outside, I began a slow walk around the perimeter, inspecting every inch for an access point.*

*Then I saw it—a section of the roof near the chimney in complete disrepair, with several missing tiles. It dawned on me that whatever was using the mill could easily climb up the chimney, slip onto the roof and through the gaps re-enter the building without being seen.*

*I now had a decision to make here. My first impulse was to climb to the roof, toss a grenade or two down the chimney, or at the very least empty my revolver into whatever was lurking below. But I hesitated.*

*Now that I understood how the deaths had occurred, my thoughts returned to the razor I had just touched. If the killings were tied to objects capable of tapping into and amplifying buried trauma, brute force would be useless against something so steeped in occult power. And if the entity lurking within operated on a plane beyond the physical, conventional methods of confrontation would likely be futile.*

*So I decided to stay another night at the mill, but this time, I would venture inside. I chose a hiding spot behind a large, sturdy table in the hallway with a vantage point that gave me a clear view of the fireplace and the section of the dilapidated roof above it.*

 

***Day4***

*More than ten hours had passed as I lay in wait, portions of the mill's interior being bathed in faint moonlight filtering through gaps in the roof. My body ached, but I remained still, every nerve on edge, waiting for something to happen. A lump formed in my throat when a sudden flash of light pierced the darkness.*

*At first, it was just a fleeting glimmer. As my eyes adjusted, I saw it—a sliver of light the size of a coin, hovering midair at the center of the mill, as if conjured from nothing.*

*Then I noticed movement. A head, barely discernible against the gloom, peeking through a hole in the roof. It moved down the wall with the unsettling precision of a lizard, its dark form easily blending into the shadows.*

*When it reached the ground, it rose to its feet, standing about five feet tall, cloaked in a dark robe that covered even its head. The creature’s back was to me as it extended a grey, bony arm toward the hovering orb of light above it.*

*The orb pulsed before merging seamlessly into the back of its hand. My breath caught when a mouth formed on the back of the creature's palm, and as it rotated its hand, two sets of eyes blinked open from its palm, staring intently back at its face.*

*Suddenly, the robe slid to the floor, revealing a grotesque form. Its body was covered in eyes and mouths, each blinking and gnashing in eerie, independent rhythms. A chill crawled down my spine as I hunkered further into my hiding spot, desperate to stay out of sight.*

*When the creature turned, its front revealed an even more unsettling sight—a face riddled with mismatched eyes and mouths, all opening and closing in unnerving disarray.*

*Every movement of its twisted features sent waves of dread through me, yet I couldn’t tear my gaze away. Bathed in the faint moonlight filtering through the broken roof, the creature seemed mesmerized by its own horrific, ever-changing form.*

*The creature’s gaze shifted next to its feet and the one remaining hand, the only parts of its body still devoid of eyes or mouths. Then, with unsettling purpose, it turned toward a cluster of objects lying in the corner of the mill. Draping its robe back over its twisted frame, it bent down, scooped up the razor and bottle opener, and quietly slipped out of the mill.*

*As the silence returned, a cold dread settled in my chest, and I felt a sickening certainty: somewhere in Ridgewater Creek, another death had just occurred.*

*I cautiously emerged from my hiding spot and began tailing the creature from a safe distance.*

*It was now moving toward the highway, keeping itself concealed within the shadows of a row of trees skirting the forest's edge. The creature walked for another mile before pulling up its hood and stepping into a quiet parking lot near a diner.*

*It casually discarded a couple of objects—the razor into the bed of an empty pickup truck and the bottle opener onto the seat of a nearby car. Moving through the rows of vehicles, it carefully peered into each one, its movements deliberate and methodical.*

*Finally, it reached an open car window, from which it retrieved a Zippo lighter and a small transistor radio from another. With these items shoved into its pocket, the creature turned and began its journey back toward the mill.*

*Staying out of sight, I crept over to the vehicles. Using a kerchief to avoid direct contact, I retrieved the razor and opener the creature had discarded, hiding them near a treeline for safekeeping. Then, I resumed following the creature as it made its way back to the mill, my heart pounding with every step.*

*When I reached the mill, I crept toward a cracked window and peered inside. The creature stood in the center of the room, holding the transistor in one hand while the other hovered above it. A low, guttural sound rumbled from its many mouths as its eyes blinked erratically in a chaotic rhythm.*

*I watched as the creature raised its upper hand, revealing the transistor encased in a shimmering bubble. Inside, tendrils of green liquid spiraled downward like a miniature tornado before merging with the object. The transistor began to glow with a deep crimson hue, pulsing ominously.*

*Without warning, the bubble popped with a faint hiss and the  creature released the transistor, letting it fall to the ground beside the Zippo. It then turned away, scaling the wall in complete silence, slipping back down the chimney to once again rest by the fireplace.*

*I got back in my car and drove straight to my Chief’s home to appraise him of what I had discovered. For the first time since the whole ordeal began, we now had the upper hand and were in a position to devise a plan of attack.*

*As I pulled up at his driveway, my stomach sank. Pete, our youngest cop, stood frozen in front of the Chief’s cruiser, its door hanging wide open. His expression said it all.*

*Inside, the Chief sat slumped in his seat, eyes and mouth locked in a vacant, lifeless stare.*

*Somehow, the little American flag keychain had made its way to him. Now, it dangled idly from the car key in the ignition, mere inches from where his lifeless body lay. The sight was too much for the department's 20-year-old rookie. Without a word, he placed his badge on the car's hood and walked away, leaving me as the last standing cop in Ridgewater Creek.*

 

***Day5***

*Realizing I was on my own, I adopted a lone-wolf mentality and decided to take matters into my own hands. Maybe it was for the best—I could tackle the situation on my terms.  Before heading to the mill, I paid Ruth another visit, hoping to uncover more about Jurupari and maybe even learn something useful on how to confront such an entity.*

*But it soon became clear that I knew more than she did, and there wasn’t much else she could offer. Something about the visit also unsettled me, though I couldn’t quite pinpoint why, so I kept my findings vague and made my exit.*

*By the time I reached the mill, the Sun was already dipping below the horizon, with probably just an hour of sunlight left. Since the creature loved objects, I brought one of my own and placed it in the center of the mill, right where it had stood the previous night. I also brought a ladder, setting it up out back to give myself access to the roof if needed. Armed and ready, I took cover and waited for darkness to set in.*

*An hour past midnight, I quietly slipped out of the mill and made my way to the treeline where I had hidden the discarded objects. Careful not to touch them directly, I gathered them and returned to the mill, tossing them onto the floor with the others before retreating to my hiding spot.*

*Seconds later, I heard the sound of something scrambling up the chimney and landing on the roof. Through a gap in the ceiling, I finally caught a clear glimpse of the creature beneath the pale light of the full moon. Its grotesque, twisted face peered inside with an almost childlike curiosity. As I had anticipated, it sensed the return of the cursed objects—but its attention quickly shifted to the veiled item at the center of the room.*

*Its eyes darted around, scanning for any sign of intruders, before it began a slow, deliberate descent down the wall. Once it reached the floor, it carefully pulled away the veil to reveal a life-sized mirror.*

*The creature paused, glancing around one last time, then let its robe fall to the floor. Transfixed, it stood before the mirror, completely absorbed by the reflection staring back at it.*

*In fact, the creature was so mesmerized that it failed to notice a flash grenade roll past its leg, and before it could react, a blinding burst of light erupted, filling the room with a searing flash and a deafening crack. The creature staggered back, shielding its eyes, before letting out an ear splitting shriek when it saw its leg locked in a bear trap.*

*I emerged from hiding, watching as it desperately tried to pry open the metal jaws in frantic frustration. I aimed my firearm at its head, and the eye closest to the muzzle ballooned in size, locking onto mine with unnerving intensity.*

*Before it could react, I fired at point-blank range. The bullet tore through the eye, sending its head jerking back, but it immediately snapped upright again.*

*I watched in disgust as one of its mouths contorted at a bizarre angle, as though reaching for the bullet lodged just beyond its grasp. It began to gnaw and chew, and then, with a tilt of its head, another mouth expelled the spent bullet from the back of its skull.*

*Then without warning, its hand suddenly stretched unnaturally, growing to twice its size as it seized my arm, and sent me crashing into the mirror. The force of the impact sent me sprawling to the floor. Even with the bear trap still clamped around its leg, the creature loomed over me, its face contorting into a gleeful, twisted grin.*

*The creature's grip tightened around my arm, its claws digging into my wrist. With a sharp twist, my wrist snapped, and I saw the gun fall from my hand, clattering out of reach onto the floor.*

*I immediately reached for the knife tucked in my pocket and lunged at the creature with my other arm, but it swiftly seized my swinging limb, its grip cold and unyielding. With disturbing precision, it slowly pried my fingers open, not removing the knife but twisting it in position until the blade pointed downward.*

*It then forced my hands to grip the handle, while also placing its own over mine.*

*Leaning in, the creature pressed its full weight onto my outstretched hand, heaving with relentless force. With each agonizing heave, the knife slowly descended, inch by inch. Its eyes and mouths swivelled erratically, yet all remained fixed on me, their gaze locked into an eerie grin.*

*Tears blurred my vision as I fought to endure the agonizing pain from my broken wrist, the knife edging dangerously close to my chest.*

*Straining with every ounce of strength, I made a final, desperate attempt to shift the blade with my other arm. The knife scraped painfully across my skin, blood spurting from the wound. But then something strange happened- the blood splashed across the creature’s face, and it seemed to scorch its skin. Its eyes bulged and then popped, releasing a sickening pus, and it let out a shriek of torment.*

*With renewed resolve, I straightened my arm like Spider-Man, causing blood to erupt from my forearm in frantic spurts, splashing all across the creature's face. Its skin began to swell and bubble, boils bursting open as pus leaked out from multiple pores, releasing a stench so foul it made my head spin and my stomach churn in revolt. For the first time, I felt its grip falter as it recoiled, desperately trying to avoid the blood.*

*Seizing the moment, I slashed my other arm across the blade, and blood now poured from both forearms in frantic jets, splattering across the creature’s chest like a grotesque fountain. My own shirt became drenched in blood as I continued to struggle against its grip. Then, something happened that made me freeze, my mouth falling open in shock.*

*The creature’s eyes and mouths began to align on either side of its body, from head to toe, jostling and shifting to create an empty space right down the middle. Suddenly, its skin split open, starting at the center of its forehead and tearing downward, exposing a dark, gaseous, formless entity that pulsed with an ominous energy.*

 *It felt as though the entity was being forcibly drawn toward me, as if being sucked right into my chest. My heart pounded so violently I thought it might burst.*

*The creature convulsed, its body fighting against the force with every fiber of its being. It finally released its grip on my arms, jerking itself backward to escape the pull.*

*In its desperation, it spun violently, the trapped leg twisting grotesquely in the bear trap before snapping free with a sickening crack. The severed limb remained behind as the creature collapsed onto the nearby floor.*

*For a brief moment, it lay still, then struggled back to its feet, limping and unsteady. Its many eyes fixated on me with a mix of rage and fear before it turned, climbed the wall with an unnerving speed, and disappeared through the roof, retreating back to its hiding place.*

*I sat up, clutching my chest, silently praying my heart wouldn’t give out from the strain. But my  hand as it pressed against my chest, felt something solid. Realization dawned as I reached into my pocket and pulled out the journal. The back binding was soaked through with my own blood, the crimson stain spreading across its worn cover. It was only then I realized how close the creature had come to almost trapping itself in the journal in my possession.*

 

***Day 5 Contind***

*I’m still here at the mill. I can’t leave, not while there’s a chance this thing could escape for good. I’ve done my best to bandage my arms and stop the bleeding, at least for now. But I’ve already lost a lot of blood, and staying fully alert is becoming harder by the minute. No matter what, I have to see this through to the end.*

*I’m preparing to climb up to the roof to face it again, to finish this once and for all.*

*The objects scattered on the floor? I’ve destroyed them. Rolled them in the blood I spilled, doused them in gasoline, and set them ablaze.*

*I swear I could hear that thing squirming inside the fireplace as the flames rose. I thought about throwing the severed limb into the fire too for good measure, but it’s already melted into some kind of disgusting goo, and stuck to the floor like tar.*

*So, this is going to be my final update. Hopefully, there won’t be the need for another one.*

*To my friend Ricky: wherever you are, see you when I see you.*

*This is Sergeant Henry Cross, signing off. Over and out.*

 

 

 

As I closed Sergeant Cross’s journal, I still lay in the bathtub, struggling to steady my trembling hands—not just from the revelations within its pages but from the ominous possibilities of what this journal might truly represent. But what got my heart truly racing was when I noticed the large bloodstain on the back cover beginning to fade, shrinking steadily until it vanished entirely, as though it had been absorbed by the pages themselves.

With my heart hammering in my chest I slowly reopened the journal. To my utter disbelief, new words began to form on the aged paper, flowing as if written by an unseen hand. They picked up exactly where Cross had left off—but this time, the ink was unmistakably his own blood.

 

 

 

*I don’t remember exactly how I fell down the chimney—just the sharp crack of my neck as the creature and I tumbled down toward the fireplace below. When I opened my eyes, everything was white. The creature was gone, but its presence lingered, faint yet heavy, like a low, constant thrum in the air.*

*It didn’t take long to understand: I was trapped. Inside my own journal, no less.*

*The creature was still here, somewhere in this endless blankness. I couldn’t see it, but I could feel it everywhere, like a shadow clinging to my back. Strangely, it didn’t bother me much. At times, I even wondered if it felt my presence too in the same way.*

*Time didn’t exist here—or if it did, it was meaningless. Moments bled together, days or years—perhaps even decades—dissolving into a formless void. When I closed my eyes, memories would surge forth in vivid detail, replaying the life I once lived.*

*On rare occasions, I thought of freedom, of escaping this endless expanse. But each time I did, the weight on my shoulders grew heavier, becoming an oppressive reminder that such thoughts were a weakness to be eradicated. So I forced them down, burying them deep, and returned to the solace of reliving the past—my triumphs, my failures, and everything in between.*

*Still, I couldn’t help but wonder: could the creature somehow sense this struggle within?*

*Then there was this one time I thought of Ruth. Where she might be, what had become of her and whether she was still alive?*

*And then shortly after, she appeared at the mill.*

*Did she intuitively heed to my calling? I couldn’t say for sure.*

*Her hair was gray, her frame frail, but I recognized her instantly. Decades had passed, yet her eyes were as sharp as ever. But what brought her back here?*

*I watched as she searched the mill, deliberate and focused. To my shock, she began uncovering cursed objects—things I’d never known the creature had kept safely hidden. She handled them as if she’d knew exactly what they were. I realized immediately I was right to be suspicious of her all along.*

*In that moment, I felt the weight on my shoulders grow heavier.*

*Since then, it hasn’t stopped. Each death in town brings a new burden. I now see their faces, their fear, their suffering even though I have never known or met any of them. But what haunts me the most is the growing realization that buried deep within my consciousness somewhere, I am beginning to find an odd satisfaction in watching it all unfold.*

*Which brings me to your situation Officer Harper, yes, I could read your nameplate when you came to inspect my remains.*

*I don’t think I can hold out much longer. So get ready, the ride is about to get bumpy.*

 

 

As I finished reading Sergeant Cross’s journal, I noticed a blotch of red ink begin to form at the final word. It slowly seeped down the page before dripping into the water of my bathtub. More streaks followed, trailing steadily, the crimson dye bleeding across the paper. My heart raced as I sat up, clutching the book, unsure what to make of it.

Suddenly, the ink exploded, splattering across my face as the pages began to rip apart on their own. The journal wrenched itself from my grip and plunged into the water. An invisible force pressed down on me instantly, jerking my body backward and pulling me under. Desperate, I summoned every ounce of strength, pushing against the suffocating weight to break the surface.

As I came up gasping for air, a chilling image flooded my mind—a seven-year-old girl pounding frantically on the inside of an old broom closet. Through a narrow slit in the door, her small hand reached out, trembling, while outside, her stepmother stared with cold indifference. The sight paralyzed me. Claustrophobia gripped my chest like a vice, freezing me in place. In that instant, the unseen force dragged me back underwater, swallowing me whole.

I thrashed wildly, refusing to surrender, forcing myself once again to the surface. But this time, when I broke free, I was met with the same horrific scene—only now, I stood inches from the closet door. My face slammed against the wood as if shoved by an unseen hand.

Inside the cramped, dark space, lifeless faces stared back at me—the victims from my cases. Their hollow, accusing eyes bore into my soul, their collective presence suffocating. The rancid stench of death filled the air, overwhelming me. Panic surged through my veins, but before I could react, the force dragged me back under, pulling me deeper into the abyss.

Submerged once more, my will to fight dissolved. The icy water enveloped me, offering an odd sort of comfort. A voice echoed in my mind, soft yet insidious:

“You’re fine now. At peace. This will soon end. Don’t fight it Evelyn”

A strange calm settled over me, and I began to relent.

The water filled my lungs, the pain dulling as an unnatural serenity took its place. I prepared for the end, but just as the quiet began to overtake me, a sudden jolt brought me back.

A hand plunged into the water, seizing me by the hair and yanking me back to the surface.

“Oh no, you’re not getting away that easy,” a voice snarled, sharp and commanding. “You’re going to fight this out. Come on, Officer. Fight!”

I couldn’t tell if my mind was playing tricks on me, but in that moment, my eyes locked onto a young man with dark, slicked-back hair and a thick moustache. His expression was unwavering, his gaze filled with pure determination. “You’re not done yet,” he said, his voice gruff and commanding, like an anchor pulling me back from the brink. His grip on my hair was unrelenting, his strength almost otherworldly. “Fight! Fight for your life!”

And then, as if ripped from reality, I was back in the broom closet. Even as I struggled to stay conscious, the oppressive stench of death invaded my nostrils again. The victims’ faces surrounded me, their lifeless eyes piercing my soul, their silent accusations bearing down on me like a crushing weight. The walls seemed to close in, squeezing the air from my lungs, as claustrophobia threatened to take hold.

But that voice—the man’s voice—cut through the suffocating fear like a lifeline. “Fight!” he commanded, his tone sharp and impatient. His grip on me tightened as though he could physically wrench me free from the nightmares clawing at my mind.

Summoning every ounce of willpower I had left, I fought back. My limbs flailed wildly, kicking and thrashing against the oppressive darkness. With a sudden crack, the walls of the closet split open, and a sliver of light pierced through.

A flicker of hope surged within me. Fuelled by desperation, I hurled my body forward, ramming through the opening. I burst free, breaking the surface of the water, my body slamming against the side of the tub before spilling onto the floor, gasping and choking for air.

As my breath came in ragged bursts, an ominous, shapeless figure loomed above, its piercing gaze cutting through the suffocating stillness. My limbs felt like lead, but fear jolted me back into action. I forced myself upright, slamming my elbow into the mirror beside me. Glass shards scattered across the floor, and I grabbed one, its jagged edge slicing into my palm as blood dripped steadily onto the tiles.

“Back off!” I shouted, holding the shard out like a makeshift weapon as I took a step toward it.

It hovered for a moment longer, studying me with cold intensity, before it vanished, slipping through the window and out of sight.

I dropped the glass as I sank to the floor, leaning against the wall, my eyes still fixed on the window.

 A hundred thoughts spun wildly in my mind. The creature was out in the open now and free. The killings will not stop. In fact it is only going to increase, and it is also highly unlikely the creature will go back to the mill.

Yet, for the first time, I felt a flicker of hope, especially after learning Sergeant Cross' findings.

But my first order of business would be to pay a visit to Ruth. She needs to be updated on how this story ends.

“But doesn’t it bother you to be more or less a glorified secretary for him?” Brady winced as he rotated his shoulder. It seemed odd for Captain Sherman to avoid the easy paperwork then throw himself into the labor of moving heavy and bulky equipment, but the past few hours had been exactly that. Despite the lower gravity it had been a chore to move all of the equipment, and the brutal pace that Sherman had set seemed likely to make up for his arrival delay. Unfortunately it also meant trying to move more through the dock than they should have - he had several bruises where one person or another had not been able to see and they’d collided mid-transport. The lowered gravity had certainly reduced the weight of the items they transported but not the mass, and those impacts had left uncomfortable reminders of that fact.

“Not really, if I’m being honest.” Amanda admitted as she tossed a tube of heatgel to Brady. “For one, Alex is known for being less than entirely precise. He has a tendency to round numbers up and down at random, to guess at things he’s not sure of, and will skip entire portions of the paperwork if he decides it’s not something he wants to do. Trust me when I say that it’s actually faster for me to do the work properly the first time than to try to correct the mistakes he makes when he does it.”

Brady rubbed some of the soothing gel on his battered arms, and winced briefly at the touch before the soothing heat dulled the aches. “But that’s exactly the point! How can you trust him to do a good job if he’s so haphazard? You can’t go through life cutting every corner without making all kinds of terrible mistakes!”

“There are disadvantages, yes.” Amanda admitted, but then cocked her head. “But there are advantages too. The rescue mission to farscope - by the time I could send off a message to TF to apprise them of the situation, we were halfway there. He doesn’t dawdle or delay so he can respond quickly to a changing situation. That’s one of his best qualities.” Amanda very nearly said ‘few’ best qualities, but she already knew the situation would be difficult for her brother as it was. No need to make it worse.

Brady continued to administer the gel while Amanda finished typing up the paperwork. She frowned and reached up to tap her visor. “Alex? It’s Amanda. I’ve just completed the ship transfer paperwork. Just need a few things from you.”

A tired voice answered immediately. “Whatever you need, can it wait until tomorrow? I’m beat.”

“It could, but I’d rather you not put it off endlessly.” Amanda chided him. “I’ve already done the hard part. I’m sending it over to your quickboard for review and signature.”

The line was dead for a minute, before a snort answered her. “Okay, got it. But what the hell, the ship is named the ‘Seattle’? That’s stupid.”

“It was built in commemoration of the designer’s hometown back on Sol.” Amanda mentioned, and though she couldn’t see him she knew Alex was shaking his head.

“Yeah, well it’s a stupid name and I’m changing it. Can we do that now or do we have to jump through hoops?”

Amanda glanced over at Brady, then down at the paperwork. “It’s doable, but is that really a priority right now?”

“It is to me. I spent hours coming up with a good designation for it.” Alex responded, and Amanda rolled her eyes with a sigh.

“Fine, I’ll get the process started on changing the registry. What did you want to name it?”

“The ISC Gyrfalcon.”

Amanda blinked at that. “Jurfalcon? What’s that?”

“It’s a species of bird from Terra - the largest falcon species.” Alex explained, and Amanda tilted her head as she pulled it up from the local net. An image of a light colored bird covered with dark spots appeared on the screen.

“So you want to name the cruiser after a bird?” Amanda bit her lip as she considered that. It wasn’t the worst idea Alex had by any means - just unnecessary.

“Yup. Despite being a cruiser, this isn’t going to be a regular warship. But we WILL be able to fight and I want her name to reflect that. I’ll have you know, I put quite a lot of thought into it.” Alex sounded inordinately proud, and Amanda rolled her eyes.

“Meaning you just searched the ‘net for something like ‘biggest falcon’ or ‘big bird of prey’ and picked one you liked.”

“I mean, yeah, but the other thing too.” Alex admitted. “Either way, I’m the one who took the job and got the ship so I’m in charge - so from this moment on we’re all on board the ISC Gyrfalcon.”

“Fine. Any other minutiae you want me to handle for you?” Amanda said with an exasperated sigh.

“Nope. Just send over the paperwork when it’s ready, and I’ll authorize it.” Alex said, and closed the connection with a soft chime.

“What’s he got you doing now?” Brady asked. “Something about falcons?”

“He wants to give the ship a new name. The ‘Gyrfalcon’.” Amanda began to tab through the list of available documents to find the right one to submit it.

Brady didn’t answer at first, mimicking his sister in pulling up the animal on his quickboard - though unlike her, he found himself actually liking the idea. It was a bit silly really but something about the name had a pleasant ring, and if they were going to be an ‘unofficial liaison’ with the Avekin it made a weird sort of sense to him. “And our… guests are alright with that?”

“They don’t take offense to being called bird-like, if that’s what you mean.” Amanda said distractedly. “Though aside from the feathers and wings they’re not even close to birds. They’re mammalian, they lack the ‘scaled’ legs, they have no beaks. The resemblance is fairly superficial.”

“Uh-huh. Well if they don’t mind… though I guess it’s extra paperwork?” Brady scowled as he realized he hadn’t considered the issue from his sister’s side.

“It’s actually fairly simple, if I’m being honest.” Amanda admitted, looking up at her Brother with a wry smile. “But I do my best to act like it’s a huge imposition even if it isn’t. It helps prevent Alex from dumping more on me than he has to, and if I really ham it up he’ll feel guilty about it for a while. Sometimes even gets me gifts and stuff when he feels really bad. Right now I’m too tired to go into a big dramatic act, but I’ll show you what I mean later on.”

Brady’s scowl deepened - now directed at his sister. “You manipulate your Captain like that?”

Amanda stifled a laugh. “Of course. He may be the Captain, but he’s an irresponsible jackass much of the time. You don’t expect that I would just sit here complacently and accept that without a little retribution, do you?”

“Of course I do!” Brady threw his arms up, then winced as one of the tired muscles protested. “He’s your CAPTAIN, you need to be straightforward and forthright dealing with him! Even if you can’t for whatever reason, it’s absolutely the wrong message to be sending to the rest of the crew!”

“The rest of the crew - including you, dear brother - will learn quickly enough that you’re not dealing with the norm.” Amanda said sweetly. “You can’t treat Alex like a military captain or even a reasonably formal civilian one. Professionalism isn’t his forte.”

“Then how can you expect him to lead us properly?” Brady shot back, and Amanda shook her head.

“Firstly because while he may be unprofessional he’s not stupid. Well, scratch that - he CAN be stupid.” Amanda sighed with frustration, and made vague gestures with his hands. “But he genuinely cares about the crew, and acts with their best interests in mind. He may be capricious and a maverick but he does so with the best of intentions.”

“The road to hell…” Brady muttered, and Amanda nodded.

“Being on his crew was never easy, but it works. At first skirting the rules led us to rich fields that TF was able to exploit. Then when they started sending him to anomalous regions, he lucked into plenty of resources, including a fully habitable planet that’s scheduled for colonization within a few years. And now with Perseus…”

Brady’s face soured. “If nothing else, he has the devil’s luck.”

“That’s unscientific and completely arbitrary.” Amanda teased her brother. “And entirely accurate. Being here with him isn’t going to be pleasant for you, I know - but I definitely believe that it’s going to be tremendously beneficial both for the company and for humanity. I know it’s going to be rough, but at least give it a try?”

“Hmph.” Brady straightened up at that. “I’ll do far better than ‘Try’. All I need to do is prove to him by action that working within the law and regulations produces superior results.”

Amanda slumped down and shook her head. “Yeah, good luck with that…”

—--

“Everyone stand for the Captain!” Brady said primly as he looked out amongst the crowd. The assembled crew was much, much smaller than a ship of this class should have by any standard, and the Captain’s assurances that ‘it will fill out’ were less than reassuring. Even so, the amount of people present was too much to fit in any of the available meeting rooms, and Brady had balked at the Captain’s suggestion they all gather up in the mess. Holding an all-hands meeting in the gym wasn’t much better but at least Brady had made it SEEM formal by dragging a podium and chairs in here.

The group shuffled to their feet with odd looks before Alex walked into the hold side by side with Sophie. He yawned as he walked up to the front of the group and stood at the front. “What’s everyone standing around for? Siddown!”

As the small crew took their seats, Alex glanced around at the familiar - and unfamiliar - faces. “Alright, we’re on a tight schedule and got a shitload to do so I won’t bore you with a big long speech. I’m the new Captain, nice to meet you all. I know that me joining up is kinda rushed and a shock to people but we got some circumstances we’re dealing with. Circumstances which we’re going over right now.”

“So I’m gonna assume everyone here’s already read up about the situation in Perseus. If you haven’t, get with Par. But just so we’re all on the same page, the Bunters are assholes, the Avekin are awesome, the Cetari and Fwenth are weird, and the Tanjeeri seem to want to kill us. Last time we were in the system, the Bunters were trying to blame the destruction of a space station by the Tanjeeri on Sophie, and they wanted to execute her for it.” Alex’s face hardened as he looked around at the newcomers.

“Now if you heard rumors about me and Sophie hooking up? They’re true. We’re a couple - doing the interspecies equivalent of dating. But even if we weren’t an item, I got a thing about capital punishment - so execution for just being in charge at the wrong moment ain’t something I was gonna just accept, so we booked it out of there and used this diplomacy trip as our excuse. Our goal was buying time, but sooner or later we woulda had to head back to Kiveyt. Trix is the ambassador that’s leading this mission, more or less, so delivering her home is the goal.”

“Now, this means that Sophie’s still wanted and last I heard they hadn’t dropped the charges or lightened the penalty. So rather than heading back in our ship, we got handed this one instead. Once we’re back, we’re pretending to be another part of the good will delegation from Sol and Proxima and most definitely are NOT sneaking back into the system with a wanted criminal. I’m gonna stress this heavily.” Alex’s eyes seemed to fixate on Brady. “Under absolutely no circumstances is anyone gonna rat out anyone else on this crew to the Bunters. Under penalty of you REALLY don't want to find out what I'm gonna do.”

“Now, for the other elephant in the room - yeah we’re light on crew right now. I’m going to be hiring before we leave, and I’ll have every station at least partially manned for the trip back to Kiveyt. When we get back there, we’re hiring more. That means this is gonna be a mixed crew. Get used to it.”

Immediately a hand shot up in the air and Alex blinked. “Uh, yeah?” He asked

“Why are we taking on Avekin crew members?” The woman who stood up was around Amanda’s height, with golden brown bob-cut hair. Alex squinted then recognized her as the head of Medical.

“It’s uhhhh….Julie, right? The reason is because our main goal is to build good relations with the Avekin. I’m biased as hell, obviously, but my personal goal is to bring our species together as friends. And I have a few irons in THAT fire, but one big one is showing that we can work together.”

“Now, obviously there’s a few big issues there. There’s a language barrier, for one - so visors are mandatory from now on. I know that’s gonna be annoying at first, but you’ll get used to it.” Alex said firmly. “Luckily there don’t seem to be many pathogens that can cross species, but we’re still gonna be careful as hell and unfortunately that’s gonna come down on you and your team.” He said to the woman who’d sat back down after asking earlier. “I know that’s gonna be rough, but the original plan would have been dealing with complete unknowns, and instead you get a full baseline to work with so that'll ease things up.”

“Food’s a bit of an issue as well. We share macronutrients between species, but they have a few vitamins we can’t process and none of their food provides many of the essential amino acids we need.” Alex’s eyes darted back and forth as he read that bit off from his own visor. It was info he knew, but always had trouble remembering the specifics of. “Here in Proxima Trix and Sophie have their supplements, and when we get to Kiveyt we’ll have to worry a bit more about our own nutrition, especially when we’re on-planet. Everyone keep that in mind. First person to get scurvy down there gets punished, once I figure out what the hell a reasonable punishment will be.”

“Next, relationships. This is gonna be one long-ass deployment, so it's natural that people will get antsy. I ain’t a prude, I know how people are, and I fully acknowledge that things will happen. If you hook up with other humans on the ship don’t let it screw with your jobs. And if you decide that I have the right idea… Well, the Avekin are monogamous and serious about ‘for life’. Don’t expect any casual hookups. If you want to find out if that’s right for you, be my guest. Just respect each other’s boundaries. And for those who don’t know… they don’t have the concept of homosexuality. That might disappoint some of you. Just behave like adults about it. Maybe things will change in the future,” Alex noted that Trix’s face showed SERIOUS doubt just now, “Then again, maybe not. Either way we aren’t gonna try to force anyone to conform to unfamiliar customs. We let them decide for themselves.”

“Lastly, right now the crew that has come with me to join this ship is taking senior roles. That ain’t a slight against any of you or your skills. It’s just me sticking with the people I know and work well with. I know that  you are definitely experts in your own fields and may resent working with someone over you who isn’t. That’s natural, and over time things’ll change as we all get comfortable together. Shit is rushed right now, sure, but we’re gonna have tons of time working together from here on out to actually socialize and get to know each other. Big thing though, if you have a problem you come to me about it. I know it might sound like I’m inviting you to go over your superior’s head on things, but that’s how I do things. Anyone got questions?”

Another hand shot up. The helmsman who had arrived late shot to his feet. “You said we aren’t going to be fighting, but what if we get attacked by the Tanjeeri?”

“We’re going to be with the convoy until we get to Kiveyt, and they’re sending along a couple batteships as escort.” Alex explained. “Once we get to Perseus, we’ll be sticking around the Avekin’s home system for a while as we get everyone trained up and comfortable in their positions. If we get attacked during that time, we run. I know this ship can fight, but I always consider that last resort only when we have a fully trained-up crew.”

The doctor stood up without bothering to raise her hand. “You said our main goal is to build up relations? Isn’t that a diplomat’s job? Why are we getting involved with that?”

“Good question.” Alex sighed, and leaned against the podium. “Problem is, our diplomats are divided. See, the Sol diplomats want to do what’s best for Sol and the Proxima ones put Proxima as a higher priority. So can we really trust either of ‘em to put the needs of either Humanity or the Avekin as a whole higher than the interests of the government?”

“I ain’t a company man, if you read up on me then you know that. TF knows that. Joining up ain’t something I’d do under any other circumstances, but the company and I both agree that good relations with the Avekin is more important than Sol or Proxima getting ahead of one another.” Alex straightened back up. “And you better believe that I’m holding each and every one of you to that as well. On this crew, you put the crew first, the species second, the government last. Any issues, you come to me and we work it out.”

Trix glanced over at the other helmsman who had joined the crew. “Uh, Alex. Who’s gonna fly the ship, me or him?”

“An excellent question.” Alex glanced down at the two. “Your name was… Cody, right? You read up on this assignment, I take it?”

“Every detail I could get my hands on.” The man proudly stated.

“Then you know that Trix there is my pilot. This whole ‘joint crew’ venture started with her and it’s been working out damn well for us thus far. It’s thanks to her we survived back when Farscope was attacked, and she kept us alive when those fuckheads in Sol hit us. But you,” Alex made a sweeping gesture, “Have a major advantage in that you’ve flown a battleship before. Trix has flown our old shuttle a hell of a lot, and the Arcadia - and this ship blows ‘em out of the water. We’re talking ten times as much mass, and a shitload of extra power.”

Both Trix and Cody glanced between each other, then back to Alex. He shrugged and gestured behind him, towards the bridge. “So what I’m thinking is that right now you two have the opportunity to get a head start on the rest of the crew. I told you that we’re gonna be a joint crew with members of both races working together, but only the Helm has members present from each race right now - so Trix, I want you to learn this new ship from an experienced teacher. Cody, I want you to get used to working alongside our new friends. We’re basically figuring this out as we go along, so let's work out the best way to handle this.”

Cody nodded in response. “But Trix isn't the only Avekin aboard. What about her?” He gestured to Sophie.

“Sophie’s my executive officer, and you better believe that I’m going to be drilling everything I know about commanding a ship into her head for the next god-only-knows how long. This isn’t favoritism or nepotism, it’s more akin to the way Avekin relationships work.” Alex gestured to Brady. “That said, Mister Teltsin over there will be working very closely with the two of us and will basically be one step below the two of us.” Alex paused, tempted to continue on with ‘Eventually we’ll get the stick out of his ass’ but decided against teasing the man too much.

“Any other issues for now?” He asked, and after a moment of silence nodded. “Alright. I’m gonna get busy on getting the rest of the critical positions filled, everyone else focus on making sure we’re prepped for the trip. At ease or dismissed, or whatever.”

—--

Kili couldn’t help herself as she paced back and forth in the waiting room. Time, and time, and time again she asked herself what she was doing here. Was this actually the right move to make? Would she even be considered for the position? The ad she’d seen had been so bare on details - if the residents at the Halfway House hadn’t pushed her, she wouldn’t have dared to even apply.

Once she did apply, though, she was dumbstruck once the details had appeared. A trip to Perseus with THE Captain Sherman along with the two Avekin that had dominated all newsfeeds for months. If she could - somehow - land this interview, she could be thousands of light years from Sol! Surrounded by actual Aliens, the sort of situation that she dreamt of so many times in the past!

That was the kicker of course - ‘if’. The Halfway House had been pounding knowledge into her head since she arrived in an attempt to land her some kind of job. They hadn’t been specific, and so she felt like she was under-qualified for a dozen plus different jobs. If she had known, she could have specialized, but that would have been impossible without knowing what the future holds, and that was just plain silly. Could she bullshit her way through this interview?

Of course, this was an opportunity that'd draw in dozens, hundreds... maybe THOUSANDS of applicants. She hadn’t seen hundreds or even dozens of others out there in the dockyard which was… Kili didn’t know if it was good or bad, really. What if the job was crap and everyone else had already withdrawn? It sounded so good on the listing, had she missed something with it? Or did they already fill the position and dismiss everyone? She pulled out her pocket board and checked - no notifications. Was that good? Was that bad?

The alert chime rang softly and despite herself she was startled and jumped at the noise. ‘No good. I have to calm down.’ She told herself as the screen lit up and an AI voice called out from the speaker.

“Applicant Kili Wagner, please follow the illuminated strip to Conference Room A.” The voice instructed her, and she moved out into the hall, following the guiding strip of light on the wall. As she walked into the room she immediately swallowed heavily with apprehension. She hadn’t expected one of the Avekin to actually be present for this interview, and she hadn’t brought a visor with her. The man in the middle, Captain Sherman, gestured to the seat in front of the table.

“Okay, gotta ask first - how do you pronounce your first name? I don’t wanna offend.” Alex’s voice sounded exactly like it did on the feeds, which somehow made him sound even larger than life.

“Uh, it’s pronounced ‘kill-ee’.”

“Gotcha. Kili Wagner - 34 years old, originally from Sol, applying for gunnery position.” Alex summed up her application, and leaned back in his chair as he regarded her. “Your resume’s pretty bare. No military experience, no prior work in any related fields. Not exactly the world’s most outstanding resume, if I’m being honest. So I absolutely gotta ask why you’re applying for this position in the first place?”

“I reviewed all available positions on your listing.” Kili tried to sound confident. “Of all the available positions, this seemed like the one I would be most suited for.” That wasn't ENTIRELY true, as she was a decent enough cook she could have applied to be a chef. It was only through the advice of her Halfway House counsel that she chose to apply to become a gunner.

“How can you say that exactly?” The young man sitting next to Alex spoke up. “You do realize what it entails?”

“Yes. I’ve done my homework. I know what the role entails. While it’s true that I don’t have any experience, I’m a quick learner. Give me time and I’ll get the experience you want.”

“Okay.” Alex spoke up and leaned in. The man next to Alex looked distinctly uncomfortable but didn’t say anything. “But by your own admission, you’re absolutely unqualified to join our crew in the position you applied for. You gotta give us more to go on than that.”

Kili’s heart sank immediately, and she tried to keep her voice from shaking. “I know I am unqualified, but I’m a hard worker. The first contact said this was an opportunity to learn and see the galaxy - I want to do both. And if you were just going to reject me… why am I being interviewed in person and not via a call?”

“Because while it’s true that you’re unqualified to be a gunner, it’s also true that I’m absolutely unqualified to be running this ship.” Alex said cheerfully, and gestured around him. “And because, well, if I’m being honest we kinda found ourselves in a bind. We need more crew. I traded up my ship and now I need people to fill it. Only, uh… I’m kinda lacking in resources right now. Maybe you heard the news but Sol basically bankrupted me, and now I gotta try to do the best I can with what’s available to me. So here’s the thing.”

Alex leaned forward over the table and tapped on the surface with his finger. “I’ve done my own homework and background check. From what I’ve seen you do seem bright and motivated. So I do think you could work on the crew. But at the same time, you’re lacking in skill and experience. So my offer to you is simple - you want to join the crew? Fine.  This is provisional as hell, but I've got a good feeling here. The kicker is I can’t pay you because you don’t have the skills the job requires. So while you’re with us, you get free room and board, as well as on-the-job training. I’m gonna be driving you pretty hard though. We'll revisit your compensation if you do well in the position.”

Kili’s jaw nearly dropped as she realized she wasn’t being denied. “I…”

“Before you answer, I want you to understand a few things here. First, this is gonna be a big deployment. We’ll a full month out from human territory - minimum. If anything happens back here, you won’t find out for at LEAST that long, realistically probably even longer. And if something does happen and you need to get back here?” Alex frowned and shook his head. “Chances are you won’t have a ride back with us - we’re planning on being out there for the foreseeable future. And it ain’t like we’ve arranged for regular trade just yet, meaning it could be six months to a year or more that you could be stuck out there.”

The alien next to the captain said something unintelligible and Alex nodded. “Also, while we’re gonna be avoiding fights, we’ve gotten into a tussle or two or three already. Joining up means you could get shot at. Joining up as a gunner means you’re gonna be the one doing the shooting back. I gotta know I can count on you if it comes to that. If you’re scared of either - now’s the time to speak up.”

Kili sat there as she digested that, then nodded. “Being away from everything is… that’s not an issue. I'm not a violent person, but I understand that I will be responsible for violent actions. That won't be a concern.”

Alex stared directly into the girl’s eyes, then slowly nodded. “Okay. If you understand exactly what you’re signing on for then I’m alright with giving you a chance. If you’re absolutely sure this is what you want, be here with your personal effects at 10 AM local tomorrow.”

Kili felt her heart leap up into her throat and fought off the urge to jump out of the chair. She merely nodded and stood up. “I can do that.”

“Alright.” Alex gestured to the door. “If you don’t have any questions, we’ll see you tomorrow.”

—--

“Captain, I have to protest in the strongest possible way. What in the world were you thinking?” Brady exploded almost the moment that Kili walked out the door, and Alex winced as the younger man yelled right in his ear. ”You barely spoke with her, asked her a bare fraction of the qualifying questions for a gunner, and handed her the job just like that? She’s absolutely and entirely unqualified for the role you’ve given her! And all that dreck about not having resources? You’re being bankrolled by TF, we absolutely can pay for someone who can DO the job well!”

“Okay, first off - remember what I said about how you won’t always agree with my decisions? So back off.” Alex reached up and scratched at his ear, then gestured out the door. “You’re right that she’s not qualified, but I see a bright kid there who could go far if someone gives her a chance. We’re gonna be that someone. I’m sure it’ll work out.”

“This is… utterly insane.” Brady stared aghast at the Captain. “What are you basing that on?”

“Intuition?” Alex said brightly, and Brady nearly reached out to shake some sense into him right there and then.

Alex studied the serious man for a minute, then deflated. “Okay, okay. I have more reasons than that. Truth be told, she actually has a fairly good recommendation.”

Brady relaxed - slightly - at that. “Can you be more specific?”

“Sure, but you know this is being told in confidence.” Alex glanced over at Sophie, who nodded. “Mother bailed us out big time back in Sol. I owe her big time, and when I put out the call about needing crew for the Gyrfalcon one of her local surrogates contacted us.”

“That girl’s here in Proxima because she fled Sol. A very, very unpleasant and abusive home situation. I won’t go into details - they aren’t relevant. But the situation was *bad*. Mother has a soft spot for those types, so when she arrived and was picked up by local security she got put in one of Mother’s project houses. They were working to get her self-sufficient and now they want to put her with a trustworthy crew.”

Brady had settled down a bit with that. “Alright. That’s not a terrible reason to bring her on board. But we could have put her in as a deckhand or something. Instead, you want to train her to be a gunner?”

“I feel like I'm repeating myself here, but I am NOT going to be going back to Perseus to get into fights!” Alex said perhaps a little too strongly. “I have a whole slew of good reasons though. For one, I’m hiring her basically for a position I really don't want to be actually used. Also this *does* give us more leeway on our budget. While yes, I do have the company behind me it has been not-so-subtly hinted at by certain relatives of yours that I should keep our costs down. And while my usual reaction to hearing that is usually to start buying expensive shit and charging it to TF, in this instance I found a way to make our overlords happy while also helping out someone who needs it.”

Brady started to object to the ‘overlords’ comment but Alex waved a hand in front of him. “Also the new PD specialist did a stint as a gunner on a corvette, and will be working with Par on the training. He wasn’t interested in the gunnery position, but he’s fine with training up someone else to handle it. With a little, y’know, grease on his palm.”

Brady whipped out a quickboard so fast Alex honestly wondered if he had some kind of spring hidden up his sleeves. After a rapid tapping, he pulled up the man's info. “That was… Evan? Harker?”

“Yeah. Back to Kili though - when Mother’s people contacted us we,” Alex gestured between himself and Sophie, ”sat down and started trying to figure out where to put her. Mother's people basically told us she could probably fit in just about anywhere on the crew - I wasn’t lying or exaggerating calling her bright and motivated. Also gunnery has been the position we’ve been struggling with the most. Less than three percent of the applications we got were for the gunnery position, and of those ninety percent were weeded out by Par in the remote interviews. We have exactly two other applicants moving forward, and if they don't work out out…”

“We spoke at great length with Kili’s caretakers.” Sophie joined in the conversation now. “Aside from the lack of experience and training, she seems like she would be an ideal candidate. They were incredibly encouraging about how quickly she picks up skills and both Par and Alex assure me that AIs do not over exaggerate. Another major advantage she has is that that the usual detriments of such a posting - being so far from home, without family or friends around, would not be a hindrance for her.”

“I mean, it’s entirely possible that we could hire her, get her trained up and find out she’s crap at the job.” Alex admitted. “We’re doing all this in a rush after all. Trying to fill twenty separate positions with twenty separate skillsets in as little time as possible, while also trying to prepare a new ship for an extended deployment alongside a massive good will convoy? Even for people with the skills, we could make mistakes.”

“But that's exactly my point.” Brady said as he digested everything he just heard. “We have to be extra careful because we're going about this in a rush, and can’t take an inexperienced, untrained crew out when we could potentially be flying into a war zone for all we know.”

“*Some* of the crew is untrained or inexperienced.” Alex admitted. “But that’s what the computer aides are here for. I may have flunked out of the navy but even I know that experienced, fully trained crews practice and use sims constantly to stay on top of their game. We have those same sims and training aides available to us, and we will be making full use of them. We won’t be without help when we arrive, and trust me when I say there’s going to be PLENTY of shit to do on Kiveyt for a good long while. I don’t see us going off on solo missions the moment we arrive. More than enough time to get everyone as comfortable as possible in their new positions.”

“Even if she doesn’t work out,” Sophie added, “we can move her to another position if necessary. Once we reach Kiveyt and start training up Avekin crew they can take over while we move her to another position - but it will mean losing an entire month of training, practice, and simulations.”

Alex nodded sagely and pounded a fist in his hand. “And lastly, those of us from the Arcadia have a fair amount of experience as it is. We just need to transfer that experience to unfamiliar systems, which is why we’ll have every member of the bridge crew sitting in with the training. Trix and Cody are already buried in the sims. Ma’et will be in every single EW training session and working with them as close as possible. Par will be learning the point defenses and Josh will be backing up Kili in gunnery.”

“What about you and I?”

“You, I, and Sophie you mean? Anything and everything the crew needs, we get to back them up.” Alex said a grim expression. “We aren’t expected to be masters of everything, but we’ll need to be able to fill in anywhere that help is needed. And not just the bridge - we’re gonna be learning basic engineering, damage control, medical, security... Par’s worked up a wonderfully spartan regime for us. And since I get to be put through the wringer learning all this shit, you two get to join me for all the fun.”

Brady just shrugged at that - hard work was nothing new. “I’m still dubious about the decision to have Kili be our gunner. It seems overly optimistic to think that we can simply fill such an essential position on the crew with an untrained, untested recruit you don’t know about simply because of a personal debt you owe to Mother. I would like to record my dissent on this decision in the official ship’s log.”

Alex blinked at that and nearly blurted out, “We have an official log?” before he caught himself. Instead he took a deep breath as he calmed himself and tried - very, very hard - not to burst out laughing hysterically.

“Alright, uh. Your position. Is absolutely noted and understood.” He fought to keep a straight face - obviously the younger man was dead serious about this. Sophie gave him a look and he bit his tongue to keep his face straight. “If the situation changes after interviewing the other gunnery candidates, I’ll let you know and we can revisit this. Otherwise, your uh… dissent is noted. The next interview is in an hour, and I would like to, uh. Confer with Sophie a bit about it. Perhaps you’d like to go get some refreshment while we do so?”

Brady nodded perfunctorily. “I’ll be back in forty-five minutes then.” The young man walked stiffly out the door and Alex watched closely until it closed - and sealed - before dissolving into laughter.

“You’re being extremely unkind to him, you know.” Sophie gave Alex a severe look, though the Captain was certain he could see the corner of her mouth curling up.

“I know, but… c’mon. Recording his dissent on the ship’s log?” Alex reached up to rub a tear from the corner of his eyes. “Who the hell does he think he's impressing with that? What kind of idiotic...”

Sophie covered Alex's mouth to stop him mid-rant. “Fine then. Do you think he has a point about Kili though?”

“Oh, absolutely. This is one hundred percent a gamble.” Alex leaned over against his lover and gestured at the door. “Even with good references the girl could still panic the first time we get shot at, or falter the moment she’s about to take a shot. The dossier we got said she has a solid education but gunners are a very, very specialized group. The training will be tough and the job’s even tougher.”

“Should we put her in a less sensitive position then?” Sophie wrapped an arm around Alex, followed by shifting a wing to press against his warm back.

“I dunno. I wanna give her a chance. It might not work well, but then again it might. My last gamble was with your niece, and that obviously turned out well. My gut says to give it a try.”

Sophie poked him in the side, and he jumped at the unexpected prodding - she caught him right in a somewhat ticklish spot. “I’m pretty sure that your ‘gut’ has been complaining about breakfast, and nothing more.”

“Nah, that’s just more of the usual language barrier. Once we’ve spent a few years together you’ll learn how to interpret it just as well as I have! But speaking of ‘breakfast’, maybe we should see about getting something to eat in here while Brady’s out?”

Sophie nodded, then sighed. ""We should, just please... no more of those 'salads'. No offense but they taste like eating grass.""

Alex laughed, and pulled out a quickboard to look at a local menu. ""In that case, my dear, let me introduce you to a human dish called 'Curry'...""

Introduction to Bank Churning - low effort money!,OnlineIncomeHustle,1i9cu0t,2025-01-24 21:25:21,2,0.75,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1i9cu0t/introduction_to_bank_churning_low_effort_money/,KrustyLemon,,"Bank account churning is the strategy of opening new bank accounts to profit from their sign-up bonuses and promotional offers. It’s similar to credit card churning, except bank account churning doesn’t have the potential hazard of lowering your credit score. This makes it a comparatively low-risk, high-reward strategy.

Every bank wants your business aka to hold your money. Banks make money by using the money they hold for you and investing it in various investment vehicles such as treasury bills, stocks, bonds... etc

For example - all banks take your cash and invest it into government bonds that payout 3-5% annually. They keep the the interest they make off of it. The more money the have - the more they're able to make off of it! This is why we see sometimes insane sign-up offers because over the long-term they still make money off of you. 

The strategy I use is I open the account, make an initial deposit, obtain the sign-up bonus, move it to my primary bank and close the account! I do this every year as they introduce new sign-up offers. I've made several thousand this way and the effort pays off!

Below are some churning opportunities, I highly recommend Chime to use as a main bank as it's popular everywhere and they have an easy to use interface.

No one returns from the jaguar,nosleep,1i9c9e1,2025-01-24 20:55:00,108,0.96,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i9c9e1/no_one_returns_from_the_jaguar/,Saturdead,,"My mother has lived a rough life. She lost most of her family to the eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in ‘85. She lost her first child, my older sister, in ’91 to a traffic accident. She lost my father, a civil servant, to a kidnapping gone wrong in ’99. I was only two years old when he died, so all my memories of him are held in faded pictures in flimsy frames.

But my mother swore to keep me and my younger sister out of trouble. She swore we would have a good life, and that we should keep looking ahead. She had this saying that her grandmother used to tell her, something that is rarely heard outside small rural communities. Hell, I don’t know, maybe it’s just our family that keep saying it. It goes;

*“No one returns from the jaguar.”*

It’s an idiom meaning ‘what’s gone is gone’. It means you have to let go, and to step away from what’s already happened.

 

I grew up in a small community south-east of Bogotá. We had a brick house painted a forest green, with these black diamond spots along the front steps. Just passing through, you could easily see where I lived. Mom was the manager at a trucking company, managing timetables, payment, and scheduling. It was a great job, and she often reminded us of how blessed we were.

There were only a couple hundred people living in that community, but it was peaceful, and we were close enough to the big city to get most modern amenities – if we could afford it. We didn’t have much, all things considered, but we were happy there. I would help my neighbor run a fruit stand by the northbound road. Tired husbands coming home from work would stop there to buy fruit on the way home. If you were friendly enough, they’d give you a tip.

When my younger sister Viviana was 15, she helped out at a hair salon up north. It wasn’t well paid, but it gave her enough to get a taste of independence. She was good at it, too. She usually helped out the younger girls who came in to get their hair dyed. You ever seen that rainbow-faded dye on TikTok? She did that years ago.

And through it all, mom kept us out of trouble. Our community stayed out of conflicts, and we kept our heads down. We were just something you passed by on your way to something important – no one cared to stop where we lived. It served us well.

 

But in the fall of 2016, Viviana disappeared.

My mom had been careful. We had tracking software on our phones, and we checked in once a day whenever we were out of town. But despite it all, Viviana disappeared. The last ping of her phone showed her heading east out of Bogotá, and then – nothing. I did everything I could. I asked everyone. I put up posters. I asked the authorities, and I called the police every day. But she was gone.

My mother mourned for months. I don’t think she ever stopped. She would cry herself to sleep, and she would talk with the priest every day. But she didn’t help me look, and she didn’t ask any questions. Whenever I asked for her help, she would recite that core tenet of her belief.

“No one returns from the jaguar.”

To her, Viviana was gone, and all hope was lost.

 

As an only child, there was a lot of pressure on me. I got my formal education in system development and an internship at a large telecom company in east Medellín, where I eventually moved. My mother didn’t want to go; she stayed in her green house, with the black diamonds. I would send her money out of my paycheck every month, and we would talk every week. To this day, she lives there. I think she runs the trucking company by now.

I had years to deal with the loss of Viviana, but it was difficult. I still light a candle on her birthday, and I keep her in my prayers. My mother dealt with it much better than I did; she could speak about Viviana openly. But I could never get over the *way* she talked about her – in the past tense. To me, not knowing what happened to her meant that we could never know for sure if she was gone. To hear my mother speak about her as if she was dead bothered me.

That is until late October, 2023.

 

We were called into a meeting in the early morning. I work in a team of 6, mostly in troubleshooting and monitoring telecommunication outages. We coordinate service teams to make sure the larger population centers retain the best coverage, basically.

My boss showed us a map of the south-eastern region of our service. There was mostly jungle there, but we still had spots of coverage. There was a red circle over the map, seemingly in the middle of nowhere.

“We’ve been getting complaints about this all day,” my boss said. “All last night, too. People are getting automated calls from this area.”

“What’s the source?” a colleague asked.

“They’re using spoofed numbers. We’re not sure what’s up, but it can’t be good.”

“They running a scam?”

My boss shrugged. He knew about as much as we did.

 

We got to work, and a couple of things didn’t line up. There were indeed calls going out, but there was never anything said, or sold. There was no one on the other end of the line.  All calls were coming from a general area, but not the same source. It’s as if there were hundreds, if not thousands of phones, in a concentrated area. They seemed to be moving as well; the sources were shifting to the south-west.

It didn’t take long for us to notice a worrying trend; the numbers used. They weren’t just one-time payphones, they were old and registered accounts that remained in our systems. We worked overtime trying to plug the holes and provide the authorities with information they needed to make arrests, but it was proving more difficult than anticipated. Not only was there not a single source to point at, but they were constantly on the move. And we still had no idea what was going on.

But things took a turn. The numbers being used belonged to people who’d gone missing over the past ten years. It’s as if they’d come back to life. There had to be a scam involved, but we couldn’t figure out what, or how. We had no idea how they got a hold of that many phones and accounts, and there was still nothing being sold.

I couldn’t help but to ask myself a painful question. I didn’t want an answer, but I had to seek it anyway. Turns out, Viviana’s number had been pinged in that area.

 

I had to do something.

My sister had an app to locate her phone installed, courtesy of my mother. It was one thing to get a ping on her phone, or her number, but if I could get a location from the app? That meant it wasn’t just someone spoofing her number – it was her *actual* phone. That meant that whoever ran this scam had, at one point, been in touch with her; or the people who took her.

It was hard to get a hold of the login information, and most of the software had devolved into outdated legacy versions, but we could get it to run. My colleagues helped me set up an emulator. And within a couple of hours, there I was; hunched over my keyboard at 1 am with a bag of choclitos, listening to the rain.

And it came back positive. I got a ping. It really *was* Viviana’s phone.

 

The next few days, I called everyone. I called friends and family. I called the authorities. And of course, I called my mother. I told her Viviana’s phone was active, and that we could find out what happened. I told her we wouldn’t have to wonder anymore. But of course, all I got was silence, and that age-old adage.

“No one returns from the jaguar.”

I tried to get in touch with the MPSU (Missing Persons Search Unit). Thing is, they weren’t touching this one. As long as it was considered a telecommunication hoax, or a scam, it was up to local law enforcement. But so far, there had been no crime reported – it was just empty phone calls. No one was selling anything. There were no threats. No one was pretending to be anyone - it was just noise over the airwaves.

Still, I wasn’t the only one who’d noticed that the numbers were familiar. We got calls from worried relatives of these missing people. I got a call directly to my work phone from a worried father, begging me to help him find his long-missing son.

 

We compiled a list of people who had relatives coming back online in that area. Over just three days, that list grew to about 35 families – and those were only the ones who identified themselves. And still, we couldn’t get the authorities to investigate. I know it’s a lottery; it all depends on who picks up the phone. But the authorities had been getting enough calls to turn their backs on it completely. Unless something urgent showed up, they wouldn’t lift a finger.

So I had to make a drastic decision. The way things were looking, the source was going to cross into either Peru or western Brazil in a matter of weeks – easily before the end of the rain season. So if I wanted answers, I would have to do something myself.

I took some time off work and called everyone on the list. I explained to them who I was, and that I wanted to follow the source and see for myself. A lot of people supported it, but others were skeptical. They thought this was part of the scam.

 

Still, a few people were as desperate as I. There was a man named Hader whose wife had gone missing four years ago, and he hadn’t been able to get over her. He was ready to do anything. There was also an older man named Brayan, who had an older brother who’d gone missing. He also knew an honest guide who could get us to that location.

It would cost a lot of money and time. You don’t want to travel during rain season, but we didn’t have a choice. It would last all November, and by the end of it, that source would have crossed the border. We had to act fast if we wanted answers.

There was also the talk of bringing weapons. I’ve never held a weapon all my life – my mom made sure of it. Hader didn’t speak a lot about it, but he seemed to have some live combat experience. He also had some weapons stashed away. He brought along two handguns.

 

After a few days of preparation, the three of us met up just south of Bogotá. Brayan had gotten us a proper offroad vehicle. Hader had weapons, food, and water. I brought tracking equipment and GPS.  Brayan was almost 50 years old, but you couldn’t tell – he had this youthful appearance. The only thing that gave it away was his thousand-yard stare, and half a dozen gray hairs on his chin. Hader was just a couple of years older than me. He had this long wild hair and thick glasses that looked like telescope lenses. He was a full head taller than me, but was thin as a stick. He could easily be mistaken for a geek, but he was probably the one with the most violent past.

We could get pretty close to the source with a 12-hour drive. I don’t think a lot of people realize just how large the Colombian countryside is, and we were going to a specific site. We couldn’t just chase the target, we had to get ahead of it, so we followed my calculations.

 

I’m not going to bore you with the drive itself. We offered to take turns, but Brayan wouldn’t have it. It was his car, his music, and his responsibility to get us there. He wouldn’t have it any other way. I ended up chatting with Hader most of the time. He told me all about his wife Luciana, and how great she’d been. How he hadn’t given up on finding her after all these years.

“Stars don’t disappear from the sky,” he argued. “There’re just clouds in the way.”

If anything, he was excited. This was the answer to his prayer, and me reaching out to him was a gift. Even if she was dead, at least he’d have answers.

 

The further south you go, the bigger the potholes get. You have to be ready for anything. The roads would turn into a muddy sludge. You might lose a couple nuts and bolts along the way, but help is never far away. I’ve yet to see the country folk turn their back on a broken-down car. But this time, we were lucky. We made our way through the rain unscathed.

We came to the end of the road and parked in a clearing. Our guide was already there; a man named Andrés. He usually worked with tourists, which you could sort of tell from the way he spoke. He’d throw in the occasional English word to sort of make a point of things. He was younger than me, full of energy, and was nothing but excited. I think he was putting on a bit of a show. Most of that faded about an hour in.

So we made our way into the jungle. We were on schedule and set to intercept the source of the signal in about 18 to 26 hours, depending on the weather.

 

When people think jungle, they think of explorers with sand-colored hats chopping down bushes and saplings with machetes. Real life is very different. Now, I didn’t have a lot of experience in that environment, but I knew what to do and not to do. There were paths to follow, and there were things to look for. You don’t need to take out the machete for everything; it all depends on who’s in front. And with Andrés taking point, we were in good hands.

Despite being dressed for the rain, everything gets wet. You’ll get water in your boots, so your feet start to blister. The rain will bring the sweat down from your brow and into your eyes, stinging you with the salt. Sure, there will be less bugs, but they’ll still be around.

Most of the trails we followed were from illegal farmers who occupied parts of the jungle back in the 80’s and 90’s, but most of the old campsites were abandoned and overgrown. But we would still find little spaces where we could stop to rest, or set up camp for the night.

 

We stopped for the night at one of the campsites. We set up tents and ate canned goods. Andrés had picked something up along the way, but I didn’t quite have that kind of confidence in him to eat what he offered. You don’t wanna get sick out in the middle of nowhere.

Luckily I got a good tent, and not the cheap stuff. I didn’t have to worry about ants or mosquitoes. Still, the rain continued well into the night. It was deafening. Lying there, I loaded up my tracking equipment and, just as expected, we were on schedule. Even now, the source was moving. At all hours of the day, they were moving. And even now, somehow, they were making calls. How the hell could they do that, on such a scale?

I fell in and out of sleep that night, imagining noises outside. I pictured eyes in the dark, considering what to do with me. There was wilderness an arms’ reach away. It could be anything. While jaguars aren’t as much of a threat as they might once have been, that didn’t make my mother’s words any less true, in a sense.

“No one returns from the jaguar.”

 

The next morning, my muscles ached. It’s one thing to walk along a paved road, but following old trails challenges every part of your body. Still, we had to keep going if we were to make it on time. Checking the tracker, the source had moved all night. If we kept a good pace, we would meet them either late at night, or early the next morning.

We had a couple of dry hours, so we made the most of it. We ate on the go and kept our heads down. No chit-chat. Andrés would stop to make a few videos, but considering his price we let him do pretty much whatever he wanted. He still kept a good pace, even though he couldn’t wipe that stupid smile off his face. The man was obsessed with his phone, and always kept it on.

I did see a couple of things that hinted at the history of the path. Overgrown, unmarked wooden crates. A couple of plastic barrels. And, at one point, a jeep.

 

I think it was a government vehicle. It’d been stripped of its seats and wheels, and it didn’t have a license plate. It didn’t have any identifying traits at all. It’d probably been stranded there for well over a decade, and had become the home to a spider the size of my hand. I did notice a couple of strange things though, like a laptop charger on the passenger seat. Andrés got a couple of good pictures of it.

“Military?” Brayan asked.

“No,” said Hader. “Corporate.”

“How can you tell?”

“It’s too well-made.”

That got a chuckle out of Andrés.

 

By the afternoon, the rain was back. We followed a small river to get out of the vegetation. Andrés cut us some heart of palm for a midday snack. I could tell they were all excited to see what was waiting for us at the end of the line. Hader could barely keep his mouth shut, and Brayan seemed to get grumpier and grumpier. And me? Well, I couldn’t stop looking ahead. I felt like there was always something waiting around the corner.

At one point, Andrés stopped us. His smile faded, and we huddled around him. He had to raise his voice to be heard over the rain.

“We can keep going straight, but it’s tough ground,” he said. “Or we go around.”

“What about the river?” Brayan asked. “Can’t we cross it?”

“Not in the rain,” Andrés said. “What do you want to do?”

We looked at one another, shaking our heads. We couldn’t break the schedule.

“We keep going,” I said. “We trust you.”

Andrés grinned at us and nodded.

“Lot of wasps up ahead, keep the lights off.”

 

The ground turned muddy, and the trees grew taller and closer. The bushes were thicker, and we had to step over fallen logs and branches with every step we took. We would trip, cut ourselves, and get our feet drenched. There were no trails to follow, but we were still making good time. The rain would come and go hour by hour, and at times it’d be so much rain it looked like we were walking into a wall of water.

It also gets real dark, real fast. It’s hard to explain how dark it gets. But we had to keep going, and we had to keep the lights to a minimum. There are these yellow paper wasps that go straight for the light and end up stinging you in the face, but the few I noticed had this vivid shade of red. Andrés didn’t have a lot to say about them. With the lights off, they left us alone.

By the end of the day, we were miserable. The source had picked up speed, and was slowly moving away. If we didn’t want to run into them in the middle of the night, we had to make camp again. If we did, we could get there before lunch the next day.

 

We made camp again and ate in silence. The rain came and went in waves all night long, but all I saw was the light of the tracker. I was getting some interference, but that was only natural; we were way out in the middle of nowhere. I checked our updated logs, showing outgoing calls.

Viviana had made a call. A *single* call – to my mom.

It stung my heart. My mom might seem cold to an outsider, but she cares more than anyone. It is one thing to go your entire life saying how important it is to let things go, and another thing to have that thing call on your phone. I would have to talk to her when I got back.

All night long, I kept hearing this one bird. It was large and must’ve had a nest right above us. It had this call like a stalling engine and a hysterical laugh. I couldn’t help but think it was mocking us; like it knew what was waiting up ahead.

 

The next morning, we were in a hurry. We were anxious to get answers. Hader double-checked his weapons and handed the other one to Brayan. Andrés looked nervous, but didn’t object. We ate breakfast on the go, using the last of our pre-filled water bottles along the way. The rain clouds were weighing heavy overhead. I could feel the thunder in the air, like a physical presence. It was just a matter of hours before we’d be back in the pouring rain.

We were following an old trail. We’d diverged from the river and  went up to more elevated ground; the tracker was pointing at a nearby hill. We could almost see it. It really started to sink in that this was real. Someone there had to know something, and we were going to get answers. But it worried me just how far Hader and Brayan were prepared to go to get these answers. They seemed like nice guys, but you don’t really know people until you’ve seen them under pressure.

So we made our final effort, up the hill. The trees spread out, as if to make way.

 

Two hours later, we were just around the bend. There was a circling path up the hill. The tracker had stopped, showing our target wasn’t moving anymore. Hader was getting ready, hiding his pistol under his rain jacket. Brayan had stuffed it down his belt. Andrés had lagged behind a bit, giving us the space to move ahead. He didn’t want to get involved. The trees eventually opened into a small glade ahead. This was it.

Someone had clearly been there recently. There was a large metal generator connected to a kind of radio antenna, or mobile tower. It’d been placed in the middle of the glade for the best reception.

“They have to come back for this soon,” Hader mumbled. “This is expensive equipment.”

“You know what it is?” I asked.

“I think it’s a range extender,” he said. “For troops to retain communication in remote areas.”

“But it’s not on,” added Brayan. “The generator is off.”

It was strange. According to my tracker, this thing was on. And not only that, but there were dozens, if not hundreds of signals coming from this area. Something was off.

 

We waited for the better part of an hour, and the rain started to come down again. I got a closer look at the electronics. Now, I’m no expert, but a couple of things weren’t lining up. First of all was the generator. It didn’t have any fuel, and there was no direct connection between the generator and the antenna.

The antenna was about ten feel tall, with two satellite dishes on top. There were four metal rods holding them up, with support of criss-cross welded supports. It looked homemade, if anything, but professional still. It was clearly built to a specification, but I couldn’t tell for what purpose. There were no wires reaching down from the satellite dishes. There was no power being run through it. I couldn’t figure it out. The only thing that made any kind of remote sense was the idea that they hadn’t finished installing it.

But if that was the case, how could something still be transmitted from that area?

 

Brayan was furious. He was circling the glade, looking for tracks. Hader was pacing back and forth, looking at me for answers. Andrés stayed on the trail, waiting eagerly to start the walk back to the car. It wouldn’t take long now that we knew where to go.

“It has to be here!” Brayan called out. “They wouldn’t just leave it!”

“Maybe they’re hiding!” Hader called back. “Maybe they saw us!”

“That’s not it,” I said, shaking my head. “It’s still transmitting.”

“Then where are they?!” Brayan yelled. “Where are the phones?! How the hell do they move this thing?!”

 

It was a good question. The generator had wheels, so it could be rolled, but there were no tracks leading up to it. It’s as if they’d carried it there, which must’ve been a hassle and a half. That thing easily weighed 150, maybe 160 pounds. And that wasn’t counting the ten feet tall transmitter.

We spent some time just going through the glade and anything near it. Brayan didn’t find anything in particular, but then again, he was barely looking. He was pissed, and he made no intention of hiding it. Hader, on the other hand, went a bit further. He couldn’t find anything either. Well, except for a cool patch of flowers he wanted to show.

“They kinda look like sunflowers,” he said. “But blue.”

 

The answers had to be right there, staring us in the face. Looking a bit closer at the generator, I find pieces of a logo etched on the side. It looked like the head of an axe. I’d never seen it before, and neither had the others. Finally, Brayan had an idea. He had to yell it out to overpower the increasing rain.

“Let’s just move it!” he said. “We move it, and they’ll come looking!”

It was as good an idea as anything. Hader took point, grabbing the generator like a wheelbarrow, while I looked at unscrewing the antenna.

 

Hader came to a sudden stop. He’d barely nudged the generator, and it was stuck. There was a pair of thick cables running on the underside of it; digging into the ground. All three of us just stopped for a while, looking down.

“There’s something there,” I said. “Something buried.”

“I didn’t bring any shovels,” Andrés added. “No one said we’d be digging.”

“We’re not,” said Brayan. “Fuck that. Let’s just cut the cables and take it.”

Hader agreed. I wasn’t so sure.

 

Hader cut the cables using a machete, and we rolled the generator away. We decided to come back for the antenna later. Brayan was on high alert as we made our way back down the hill.

“We’re staying one more night,” Brayan said. “If we don’t see them in the morning, we’ll burn this to the ground.”

“It’s gonna cost extra,” said Andrés. “I have a schedule.”

“Fuck your schedule,” added Brayan. “I’ll pay whatever you want, but I don’t want any fucking stories.”

“Fine,” nodded Andrés. “You’re the boss.”

 

We rolled the generator down the hill. By the time the rain eased up, we had cleared a new campsite. We covered the generator in some palm leaves and set up our tents; doing our best to keep the lights low. We didn’t want them to come wandering into our campsite; we wanted them to expose themselves.

We were going to keep watch, all three of us. We were expecting company, but we didn’t know from what direction. Andrés wasn’t in on it. In his words, he was there to get us in and out; that was it. I couldn’t blame him; he had no idea how far we were ready to go. Still, the way Brayan waved around his gun, it was starting to look more like a mission of vengeance rather than information.

I had first watch that night. I sat upright in my tent, looking at the tracking screen. The interference was worse than ever, but I could still see it. The transmission was still active. How could that be? The generator was gone.

I turned off my phone to save some battery – we were gonna be here longer than expected. Brayan took my place in the middle of the night, and I went down like someone had turned the power off. I wasn’t expecting anything to happen that night, but I still had this uneasy feeling weighing down my gut.

But the wilds were still waiting there, just outside my tent. And that night, it had something to say.

 

I woke up in the middle of the night. I didn’t know why, and at first, I didn’t even realize I was awake. There was no rain, but plenty of birds and insects singing their hearts out. And yet, I could feel something was different. The sounds were different. Colder.

I peered over at the tracking device. Turns out, the transmissions had moved. They’d made a sharp turn back east, down the hill.

The same way we’d went.

 

There was a loud groan coming from the jungle.

You know the way when you move something heavy across a floor, and it makes that hacking sound? It was something like that. Like something heavy and metallic was dragged across a rubber floor. It was loud, like an instrument. Rusted equipment, swinging in the wind.

Then, a gunshot.

 

I rushed out of the tent, barely dressed. Hader was already up, gun in hand. I caught Andrés peeking out of his tent, but he wasn’t getting out anytime soon. There was no sign of Brayan.

Throwing caution to the wind, Hader turned on a flashlight. I followed suit. We scanned the treeline, but there was nothing there. I checked the ground, only to see a patch of warm blood. It was spread out in an angle, indicating a hit, or movement. I pointed at it, only to see Hader looking up.

Turning my head up, I could see the antenna. It was rising out of the jungle, towering above the trees. It looked at least 5 to 10 feet taller. It was swaying in the wind, making a low, metallic, groaning noise.

 

“They moved it,” Hader whispered. “Why’d they move it?”

“There’s no one here,” I whispered back. “Who did this?”

Looking around, we saw no one. No people. No tracks. No footsteps.

Then the antenna moved again. This time, it didn’t just sway in the wind; it was being pushed closer to us.

 

Hader turned the flashlight towards it. I only saw it for the blink of an eye, but the image imprinted on my mind.

There was a mess of dirty cables. There were solar panels spread out like a blooming flower, with glass shards in the middle. Industrial-grade wires tangled into the mockery of a bush. Hundreds of old phones, still bright and active, lining the sides like the scales of a lizard. Little pieces interconnected in an unnatural web. It looked like a kind of body, still covered in mud from being buried.

It was carrying the antenna on its back like a massive shark’s fin. The main body was at least seven feet tall. Halfway up that antenna was Brayan; his stomach and throat split open. His eyes were still flicking back and forth, trying to function without oxygen. He’d been stuck to solid pieces of rebar poking out of the antenna. He looked like an insect in a web, or a fish on a drying rack.

He was still bleeding.

 

Hader raised his pistol, but it was too late. I heard something whip out, and there were three loud taps; like stones hitting a rotten log. Hader didn’t get the time to pull the trigger before he’d been pushed to the ground and then dragged into the jungle.

I sat down and turned my flashlight off. Crawling along the ground, I made my way back to my tent. I tried to keep a low profile. The metallic groaning grew louder as more weight was put on the antenna.

I held my breath, waiting for that thing to go away. You can’t just run into the jungle, that’s insanity. You have to keep your cool. I couldn’t have my mom lose all her children. I had to stay quiet, and lucky.

 

There was another spatter of rain on my tent, but it didn’t sound right. Looking up, it looked too dark. It took me a couple of seconds to realize it wasn’t rain, but blood. That thing was moving through our camp; passing by my tent as it went.

There was a bright flash of light as a hundred, maybe a thousand, of phones lit up all at once. A cacophony of ring tones blared, like an electronic belly roar. And as it died down, a single ring tone remained; Andrés’ phone. I’d heard it once or twice since we met him. I could hear him complaining as he desperately tried to turn it off. He never could keep his hands off that thing.

There was a moment of silence. Then the groaning began anew.

“No!” I heard. “No, I have nothing to do with this! I have nothing to-“

Plastic was torn apart. One long scream of primal pain going higher and higher up in the air. You’ll never forget a sound like that. It’s not like in the movies, or the games. People don’t care how they sound when they die; it’s not cool, or manly. It’s desperate. It’s high-pitched. And when it ends, it doesn’t come back.

 

There were sounds coming from the phones. Confused voices answering random calls. They were waking up, dazed and confused, not knowing what to say.

“Hello?” someone said. “How did you get Candas number?”

“Alejandro? But… but how can you-“

Dozens of others. Name, after name, after name. Tears. Anger. Screaming. And finally, a voice I would recognize anywhere; my mom.

“Viviana?” she said. “It can’t be you. Please tell me it can’t be you.”

 

I had to bite my tongue to keep quiet, but a sob escaped me. I was shivering. My body wasn’t getting enough oxygen, and my heart was beating out of my chest. I’d laid down on the ground of my tent, curled up in a fetal position. I tried to make myself small and invisible.

Something poked at the tent. A steady pressure pushed through, breaking the top open. A long machete-like blade descended, poking around next to me. Probing, testing. Then it touched the screen of my tracker; and pushed down.

It was like spearfishing. It pierced straight through the tracker and pulled it up. All the while, I could hear my mother in a sea of voices. The light from the phones lit up the night like a torch, casting a long shapeless shadow into my tent.

I didn’t stand a chance. I had to stay quiet.

 

Then the phones turned off. All but one. Another number ringed as the dial tone struggled to connect. The sharp blade retracted, as something heavy moved around the camp. It was looking for me.

The call went through, and someone answered. I almost choked on my own spit. It was *Viviana*. She sounded older. More confident. But I could tell it was her even now, all these years later.

“Come out,” she said. “*Please* come out.”

The antenna groaned as the thing bent down, tearing Brayan’s tent apart.

“It wants to know how you found us,” she continued. “It has questions. It means no harm.”

It groaned again, and was followed by a meaty thud. Someone must have slid off the rebar, and their body hit the ground hard. Dead meat on the jungle floor – a feast for the ants in the morning.

“Last chance, mijo,” she said. “You’re making it angry.”

 

I grabbed my bag and turned on my phone. I held my fingers against the speaker to quiet the start-up noise. But as soon as it went on, I was getting calls from unknown numbers. It was probing for me; looking for directions.

So I got up, reached my hand out of the tent, and threw my phone into the jungle.

There was a rush of activity. It was like a car driving through camp, running over and breaking anything in its path. Finally, I let my heart go wild. I slapped my boots on, grabbed my bag, and got out of the tent. I didn’t even look back. I just headed the other way, as fast as I could. Running blindly into the dark.

 

I made some ground, but it was coming back my way. I had to slow down, and stay low. I had to sneak in the dark, doing my best not to brush up against anything brittle. It was almost impossible, but thankfully, that thing made more noise than I did.

Then; the rain. It came back gradually. My first thought was that things couldn’t possibly get any worse, but after a moment of hesitation, I realized something. The rain was masking my movement. If I was careful, I could move faster, and further away. It couldn’t hear me.

The last thing I heard was that metallic groaning as the antenna moved back and forth. And somewhere in the distance, still, I heard Viviana’s voice. Cursing at me. Begging for me to come back. Questioning me. She was throwing everything at me, hoping to get me to turn back. I’ll never forget the last thing she said.

“You’ll never know what happened. You’ll *never* know!”

And of all the things said that night, that was the most true.

 

I didn’t sleep. I barely even saw the sun coming up. I only noticed by the songbirds sounding different, and there being less mosquitoes. I’d found a trail, but I didn’t recognize it. I was lost in the jungle, with only a vague direction to follow.

I got lucky that day. Mid-afternoon, close to dinner time, I ran into a group of tourists led by a man who looked a lot like Andrés. I broke down completely. I barely remember what I told them, but one thing kept coming back to my mind.

“Don’t go looking for them,” I begged. “Don’t go looking. *Please*, don’t.”

I took the man’s hand, looked him in the eyes, and said what I’d been told so many times.

“No one returns from the jaguar.”

No one asked me any questions. No one came looking for them.

 

Today, the calls are still coming in. We still get the pings on our trackers. But we all know not to go looking. Maybe some knew all along. People who call to complain are moved to a special line, and then they get cut off.

Brayan’s number is on the list now. Hader’s and Andrés’ too. It calls me with their numbers sometimes, just to see where I am. A couple of times, it even speaks. It uses their voices.

“Come back,” it begs. “Come back to us.”

 

But I came home to my mom. I held her, and I cried. When she asked where I’d been, I didn’t have the heart to lie.

“I went looking for her,” I admitted. “I went to see her.”

“What did you find, son?”

 

I searched my heart for the answer, and it was right there. It was there all along.

“I found the jaguar.”"

"$14 ACH fees from Discover, but Discover can’t see them on their end. Help!",personalfinance,1i9bwli,2025-01-24 20:36:33,1,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1i9bwli/14_ach_fees_from_discover_but_discover_cant_see/,Speakinginflowers,Other,"So this may be a little long winded, TL;DR at bottom 

So I have a debit account with my credit union (CU) and a credit account with Discover. I make my Discover payments from my CU account.


On 1/10 I attempted to pay my Discover bill early and pay above the minimum (attempting $150 payment). Unfortunately, 1/10 was a Friday and I didn’t realize the payment wouldn’t be taken out until Tuesday, when I only had $145 my CU account (which I didn’t realize).

- Discover attempted to take the payment out 3x on Tuesday, resulting in three charges of $14 apiece from “Overdrawn ACH Discover” which brought my account to $103. 

- I bought groceries that night from my debit account for $59 which brought my account to $44. 

- Wednesday Discover attempted 4x to get the payment, so 4 more $14 “Overdrawn ACH Discover” charges, bringing my CU account to -$12.  Discover then stopped attempting to get the payment and this reflected on my Discover account which showed my bill was not paid.

- I called my CU to figure out what the $14 charges were from since I thought at this point that my Discover payment had gone through, and realized my mistake. 

- It was indeed MY mistake so I deposited $129 into my account on 1/21 to rectify it, and then paid my Discover bill (the minimum payment of $92).

**This brings us to yesterday/today**

Which is also the :

#TL;DR

- So yesterday, 1/23, my $92 payment to Discover went through.

- After the payment was taken from my CU account, my CU balance reflected a balance of $25

- After the payment went through, there were three more $14 charges marked “Overdrawn ACH Discover” which has left my account at -$17.

My CU says these charges are from Discover attempting to collect the payment an additional 3x after the bill was paid, Discover claims that it wasn’t them. 

I don’t know what to do, and desperately need advice. The $25 in my account was all that I had, and the CU says there’s a fourth attempt pending (which will result in another $14 fee leaving my account at -$31). I don’t even want to know if this will continue tomorrow.

I talked to Discover twice today, three different people as my CU advised to talk to a supervisor at Discover as maybe they could see the -$14 charges. The supervisor at Discover claimed they *never* charge fees for returned credit card payments, which now has me wondering wtf the original seven $14 “Overdrawn ACH Discover” payments are. 

These ten total $14 “Overdrawn ACH Discover” charges have cost me $140, but there seems to be no one from my CU or Discover that knows why I am incurring these fees, the CU says its Discover and Discover says it’s my CU.

Each time these charges happened, there was money in my CU account- but when these charges were made, the charges themselves overdrew my CU account.

Please help, or just explain what’s going on thank you! "
Concern About Missing Pay Stubs from First Job During OPT for H-1B Filing,h1b,1i9bueq,2025-01-24 20:33:19,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/h1b/comments/1i9bueq/concern_about_missing_pay_stubs_from_first_job/,luckys7rik3,,"Heyo! 

My current employer is filing my H-1B petition this year, and the immigration lawyer has asked for all of my pay stubs from my OPT period. I started my first job on July 11th and left it on August 2nd, then began my current job (which is sponsoring my visa) on August 5th, 2024. Both jobs are listed on my I-20, but here's the issue: I don't have pay stubs from my first job (I worked there for 23 days). I was paid via ACH for that position, and I do have all the pay stubs from my current job.

I'm a little concerned that the lawyer is asking for pay stubs from the entire OPT period since I don’t have a pay stub from my first job. I’m wondering if this could pose a problem for the H-1B process. Would love to hear any expert opinions on this!"
Got Surefooted @ Whistler,skiing,1i98gt3,2025-01-24 17:53:37,137,0.88,37,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i98gt3,Az636,,"My 4th and hopefully last for some time pair of boots - been on a snowboard for 15 years and 4 years ago switched over to skiing (this is season 5) - 

Since transitioning I’ve battled ski boots - gotten new, molded, punched, you name it, the pinky area in the left foot kept adding pressure and aches. Powered through and last season I just had enough. 

My brother got his pair the year I switched over and swore by them, so I took the plunge! $1,100 USD later, I have boots that don’t cause me ANY pain and I’m beyond stoked! Post scan, my left foot measured half size bigger than my right and 6mm wider - which would explain the pains.

I will say, I got them fitted and assembled the first evening I arrived, and had 2 adjustments the following day to release some tension in the toes on said left foot - but since then were smooth sailing. I know people say it’s just an upsell, they work on commission, but I’ll pay $1,100 to not have pain in my feet and enjoy my ski days anytime! Their service was top notch coming back for adjustments as well. 

Their new liners come prelined with heaters so if down the road I ever decide to go the heated boots route, I can pick up a set of their batteries but haven’t had the issue of cold feet yet. "
A  Different Perspective on Theology—Heretical or Biblically Based?,theology,1i97ej7,2025-01-24 17:06:39,0,0.47,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/theology/comments/1i97ej7/a_different_perspective_on_theologyheretical_or/,bohemianmermaiden,,"
I wanted to share a perspective I’ve been developing over the years. For context, I was a biblical studies minor in college and went deep into Calvinism during that time. At first, Calvinism gave me clarity—a black-and-white framework that made more sense than Arminianism or other theological perspectives. It felt logical, structured, and coherent in a way that provided a fresh lens through which to view scripture.

But as time went on, I found myself disillusioned. There was something about it—something just beneath the surface—that didn’t sit right. It wasn’t immediately clear, but over time, I felt weighed down, like I was missing something vital. It felt like a theology built to explain God, but not necessarily to reflect His heart as revealed through Jesus. The more I sat with these ideas, the more I felt disconnected from the spirit of the gospel and the joy of following Christ. It left me with a sense of clarity, but also with a deep, nagging ache that something about it didn’t fully fit.

That disillusionment eventually opened the door for me to explore scripture and theology in a new way. And let me be clear—these thoughts haven’t come from a desire to simply make myself feel better. They’ve come from years of study, reflection, and exploration. I’ve delved into philosophy, theology, psychology, and world religions. I’ve listened to countless podcasts, explored the history of Christian thought, studied patterns across cultures, and returned to the Bible with fresh eyes. Through all of this, I’ve arrived at a perspective that has not only brought me peace but has also deepened my understanding of the gospel and the heart of Jesus’ teachings.

My Key Tenets:
	1.	Salvation is Transformation, Not Transaction
Salvation isn’t about fulfilling a cosmic transaction; it’s about transformation. Jesus didn’t come to settle accounts with God on our behalf—He came to free us from the cycles of fear, shame, and judgment that keep us from experiencing the fullness of life. His life, death, and resurrection were not just acts to “pay for” sin but a demonstration of how to live free of sin’s destructive power.
	2.	Sin as Shame and Projection
Sin isn’t just breaking moral rules—it’s living in patterns of shame, self-rejection, and projection. From the story of the Garden of Eden to Jesus’ ministry, we see sin as something that distances us from love—not because God withdraws, but because we withdraw. Jesus came to break the cycles of shame and help us reconnect to love.
	3.	Judgment as Self-Imposed
Judgment isn’t God inflicting punishment on us—it’s the natural consequence of rejecting love and light. To “perish” is not eternal torture but a state of being lost, separated from love, and trapped in the cycles of sin and shame that Jesus came to free us from.
	4.	The Old Covenant Was for the Jews; The New Covenant Is for All
Much of the confusion in modern Christianity comes from trying to mesh the Old and New Covenants. Jesus didn’t come to abolish the Old Covenant for the Jewish people; He came to fulfill it and establish a New Covenant for all. The rituals, sacrifices, and rules of the Old Testament served their purpose for their time, but they were never the ultimate point. Jesus showed us a better way.
	5.	Grace Is Freely Given and Freely Received
We don’t have to earn God’s grace through repentance or good works—it’s already freely given. Repentance isn’t a prerequisite to mercy; it’s a natural response to encountering the kind of love that Jesus embodied.
	6.	Jesus’ Mission Was Relational, Not Legalistic
Jesus didn’t come to “satisfy” God’s wrath or settle legal debts. He came to show us what God is like—a God who eats with sinners, touches the untouchable, forgives the unforgivable, and offers life to the fullest.

I know many of these ideas are controversial. Some might call them heresy, and that’s okay—I’ve spent years studying these concepts deeply, exploring scripture, Greek translations, and historical context. I believe they’re not only biblically sound but also bring us closer to the heart of Jesus’ message.

I’d love to engage in respectful discussion here. If you have questions, challenges, or insights, I welcome them. I just ask for grace and respect as we dive into these topics together."

The worn wood floor is sticky as ever, men and women both, shoulder to shoulder tonight. As a female patron sways, the foam of her ale spills over, nearly missing my shoe and mixes with the other lost beverages.
There are a few new faces tonight. Some eagerly wait for a dancer to cross their paths, while others stand near the edge of the crowd, fine with living vicariously through the braver patrons before spending their own coin on such attention. 
My wrist is tugged back, pulling my body with its force. I land upon a warm lap, my back pressing against a large belly. I manage a giggle at the end of a small shriek that leaves my lips at the sudden invasion. Regulars know not to handle the dancers this way. 
I shift towards the man’s knee while tugging the hem of my skirt down to mid thigh, hoping to gain some space between our bodies. “If you’re wanting to touch, there are private rooms in the back that you may request and pay for at the bar.” I flash my teeth, shooting a look that I hope comes across as friendly, but firm.
I let my eyes wander over my current seat. I don’t know who this man is, but his clothes are fine. Gold embroidery running along the seams tells me he cares about his appearance and is happy to spend money on such things. His facial hair is trimmed short, while his brows are long and unruly. There’s a large black stone set on a gold band on one of his fingers that lays at my wrist. I’d bet on him opting for a private dance. 
His grip stays tight on my wrist, his other hand coming up to brush a loose white curl from my face. I fight the urge to grimace as his breath wafts to me when he speaks. 
	“Are ye’ offering to take me back to one of the rooms?” His eyes shoot between my mouth and chest. His white coated tongue licks across his lips. 
I squirm my arm from his grasp, the release sending me off his lap. I feel my skirt soak at my hip as my hand slaps against the sticky, wet floor. Droplets fly up, some landing on my face. Before I can move, a patron steps backwards, crunching my fingers beneath their boot. “Fuck!” I yell, pushing at their calf. 
The man whose lap I just fell from scoffs at me before turning in his chair and careening his neck, his eyes bouncing through the crowd. The boot leaves my hand, the patron giving a slurred apology before stepping through the crowd away from me. My fingers feel stiff as an ache grows with the rush of blood pumping through them again. A few drops of ale and who knows what else fall from my limp hand. More curses leave my mouth. People step around me, someone catching my shoulder and knocking me back down when I just managed to get my good hand under me to stand. 
I’m about to lay down and accept being trampled to death by drunkards when two hands grab me firmly by the armpits and heave me up. The hands don’t leave me until both my feet are planted on the ground. The familiar sweet cologne hits me right before my eyes register who rescued me. 
“I’m sure there are comfier places to rest, Celeste.” Noah leans towards me so I can hear him over the chorus of voices and music around us. A small smile on his face.
“Ha. Ha.” I level a look at him before breaking out into a smile. “I appreciate the lift.” My hand hovers between us as another ache shoots through my fingers, preventing me from touching his shoulder like I would any other time he came in. He runs a hand through his light brown hair, his smile falling as he takes in my hand, and then surveys the rest of me. As his eyes fall to my waist, I feel a trickle slip down my leg, pooling around the strap at my ankle. “If you’re wanting a dance tonight, you’ll have to wait a bit while I go clean up.” I say, motioning to my sodden attire.
	He nods and leans closer, his breath warm against my ear. “I’ll reserve the same room. Take your time.” He steps around me, leaving room between our bodies as he does. 
The heavy pulse in my fingers scream louder every time I use my elbow to push my way through the crowd to the dancer’s private bathroom upstairs.

Company not taking responsibility for payroll error; how should I proceed?,personalfinance,1i94izn,2025-01-24 15:02:49,2,0.67,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1i94izn/company_not_taking_responsibility_for_payroll/,PFQ_TA_112358,Other,"I am a freelancer with several different income streams, one of which is working as a 1099 contractor for a particular company. For my last paycheck/direct deposit of 2024 from this company, I was overpaid by about $2000. A few weeks later, an HR rep emailed me saying the money would have to be returned. 

(Some additional info that is probably not directly relevant but might provide helpful context: for the last few years I have actually been working for a smaller/more local company, and I have good relationships with the managers and owners at that original company. But last year, a few months before this payroll error, this original local company was acquired by a much larger national conglomerate-- so while I still interact and work with the managers/owners from the original company, they are no longer in charge; the HR reps I'm now corresponding with are from the larger company, and I have no previous relationship with them)

The HR rep said that I would have to return the money by mailing a check to their offices, which I would prefer not to do, but when I asked if they could just reverse the incorrect portion of the ACH transfer she said that wasn't possible because the 2024 tax forms have already been processed. (I realize that the 'mail us a check' part has a slight scam/fraud ring to it, but I am all but certain this is not a scam).

The bigger issue is that when I asked how this will affect my 1099, she said that my 1099 will be incorrect and I should ""consult with a tax professional"" about how to handle that. I use FreeTaxUSA, so 'consulting with a tax professional' would incur a significant extra cost, one that would be necessary only because of an error the company made that I had no control over. I don't understand why they can't issue me a corrected 1099; I seem to remember other companies I've worked for doing this in the past. 

Can anyone offer advice on how I should handle this situation? I feel strongly about not wanting to pay any additional money (either in taxes or to a CPA) solely because of the company's mistake, but the HR rep is making it seem like I will have to. The only other option she gave was that we could ""explore the possibility"" of deducting this discrepancy from future earnings. Does anyone have input on the merits of this option? I don't love the idea, although I suppose technically speaking it offers a small benefit to me in terms of earning interest-- the work I do for this company is seasonal, so I don't expect to have any meaningful income from them until the spring or summer. 

Also, I don't have that much experience working/interacting in this kind of corporate setting, so if anyone has additional advice about what kind of tone or tenor is appropriate in communicating with these HR reps, I am open to that too. I am annoyed about the situation and willing to convey so, but it is also my hope that this company will continue to employ me going forward.

Thanks for any input.

Another Poorly Written Anthros Chair Review,OfficeChairs,1i91it1,2025-01-24 12:56:44,2,0.75,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/OfficeChairs/comments/1i91it1/another_poorly_written_anthros_chair_review/,TheMagicalKitten,,"Some details:

* Have had the chair for 1 month
* Have done extensive communications with their support
* Have sampled HM Embody, own a Leap V1 and Secretlab TItan for comparisons
* I have the faux leather white version. It's not the most cat resistant - I already notice one small mark, but I'm making heavy efforts to keep her off. I've never tried their fabric to compare. The leather is very comfortable even on bare skin

About a year ago (2023 Black Friday Sale) I ordered an HM Embody. It was quite comfortable, but ultimately - when combined with a couple qualms like feeling the top corners dig into shoulders and not liking the squeaks - I had decided it was too similar to the chairs I already had to warrant the massive price.

I'd been eyeing the Anthros since before then, buying into the marketing from Ahnestly and other reviewers from pretty early on, only it was even more expensive.

Due to frequent lower back pain (especially concerning as I am < 30) and the claims that this chair was excellent for that, plus spending too much time here and getting egged on by all the braggers, I finally caved.

First impressions were great and very comfortable. I had a very minor complaint, but reached out to support as I felt entitled given the price paid. They responded quickly and concisely and didn't mind as I pivoted around topics. My first question was about some noise from the seat cushion only on the very edge, which has since worn in and is no longer an issue. Then we had many back and forths trying to determine what the return policy would be as a Canadian customer should it come to that.

It did come to that. It wasn't terrible, but same as the Embody it felt like it wasn't perfect and it should be for the price. I noticed myself shifting to avoid the pelvic support digging into my back even if I adjusted it to be gentler.

I called their phone number and was quickly in discussions with a top level (C suite) employee to assure the lowest costs for both of us on my return. I was willing to drive to the US to avoid some fees, and they were willing to work with me on that front. It was a nice process since they only stand to lose from the deal, and the videos on the site for disassembly and how to re-box were great.

Then, the twist. In the 2 days between packaging and getting ready to take it to the shipper, I was back between my two chairs (secretlab titan, leap v1). Actually having to sit in them a full day again I realized I was making a blunder.

The anthros had some back ache while seated, and occasional shifting around. Both other chairs had slightly less pain while seated but left my back absolutely SCREAMING at days end worse than ever. And I was constantly sliding forward or otherwise adjusting to worse postures in both. I quickly sent an urgent email to cancel my return shipping pickup and reassembled the anthros.

It is still not perfect. Hopefully I'll adjust and get more used to it, but even if I don't I've learned how much better it is for me than the other options for my comfort and pain.

But that's not even the best part. The best part is how much more focused I am at work. Something about being forced to sit upright and fidget less is just doing miracles for my normally easily distracted self.

Here are other highlights I love:

The adjustability - as a tall and slender person, I found most other chairs didn't support me enough (I'd be touching the back with my arse, but my lumbar would curve away from my spine) or would be way to aggressive and absolutely dig in hard (looking at you, jarvfaljeet)

The right to repair - Every single piece is separable from the others. Both arms remove, the seat and back cushions are replaceable, the base and piston are easily replaced. I can rest assured that if I have a warranty issue it won't be wasteful, and if down the line the piston or cushion wears out (or the cat gets to it..) faster than the frame, I need not purchase a whole new chair. Note that I haven't investigated how part ordering actually would work, though.

The people and process - their support was great, I appreciated the posture consult even if what can be done over video is limited, and the assembly instructions and documentation was fantastic. We're certainly paying a hefty premium for these, but at least that money is going somewhere

To close on a downside, the arms are much too wide for me. Even at their narrowest setting, their centers are 21"" apart. Standing arms at my side, me elbows are 15"" apart. Not great armrests for the slender. Supposedly they are working on an upgrade that should resolve this, but that is TBD."

Just recieved notice of intent to deny for insufficient bonafide marriage evidence (arrived on ESTA, they want proof that I didnt have prior intentions). They state that we submitted:

\-A Form I-130, Application for Alien Relative. 

\-A Form I-130A, Supplemental Information for Spouse Beneficiary. 

\-A copy of your Social Security card. A copy of your Ohio Certificate of birth.

\-A copy of your U.S. passport. 

\-A copy of the beneficiary's UK Provisional driving license. 

\-A copy of the beneficiary's legal name change court document. 

\-A copy of you and the beneficiary's Cobb County Marriage License. 

\-A copy of you and the beneficiary's Aetna health insurance card. 

\-Vacation photos for you and the beneficiary. 

\-Passport pictures for you and the beneficiary.

  
""After reviewing the evidence our records indicate that the beneficiary is not eligible for the requested benefit sought for the following reason(s): The petitioner must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the marriage was legally valid and bona fide at its inception, and “not entered into for the purpose of evading the immigration laws.” See Matter of Laureano, 19 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (BIA 1983). Although evidence to establish intent at the time of marriage can take many forms, some of those forms include: “proof that the beneficiary has been listed as the petitioner’s spouse on insurance policies, property leases, income tax forms, or bank accounts; and testimony or other evidence regarding courtship, wedding ceremony, shared residence, and experiences.” Id. When there is reason to doubt the validity of a marital relationship, the petitioner must present evidence to show that the marriage was not entered into for the purpose of evading immigration law. See Matter of Phillis, 15 I&N Dec. 385, 386 (BIA 1975). To demonstrate that the purpose of the marriage was not to evade the immigration laws, a petitioner may submit documentation showing, for instance, joint ownership of property, joint tenancy of a common residence, commingling of financial resources, birth certificates of children born to the union, and sworn or affirmed affidavits from third parties with personal knowledge of the marital relationship. See 8 CFR 204.2(a)(1)(iii)(B). The beneficiary must be eligible for the benefit sought at the time the petition was filed. See Matter of Drigo, 18 I&N Dec. 223 (BIA 1982). A petitioner must establish eligibility at the time of filing a petition; a petition cannot be approved at a future date after the petitioner becomes eligible under a new set of facts. See Matter of Katigbak, 14 I&N Dec. 45 (Reg. Com. 1971). A petitioner may not make material changes to a petition that has already been filed in an effort to make an apparently deficient petition conform to USCIS requirements. See Matter of Izumii, 22 I&N Dec. 169 (BIA 1998).""

And that these weren't enough. A lot of things have changed since this submissions, but I just want to create a list with you guys to ensure I cover all grounds when I resubmit.

They want joint checking savings etc and joint leases, now I currently work on an unpaid internship as a machine learning engineer, so I dont have my name on the house/bills etc as I dont have a financial income for the duration of this internship. My name is however on the HOA updates for the new house we moved into this month, it's probably on the AT&T account etc as I setup all the utilities, but the bills will again be under her name only. We also just both moved to T mobile so we have a joint phone contract with 2 lines under one account, so I can show that. I have a georgia driving license (however the address on the physical card is for the previous address as we just moved house and I have to go into the dmv physically to change it as online changing requires US citizen). I have infinite texts between me and her referencing like 'oh take the bins out' etc etc if they are relevent? I'm confused about the finances part as we both just use her card - we currently airbnb the basement in the new house and i manage it (Im as coowner on the app so i can show that) so what we do is i manage the airbnb for her, and the money goes to her bank account, and then if i need something i just pay on her card so i dont have proof of anything financial in my name. My name isnt on the new house because I personally didnt put any money into it so I asked for my name to not be on the house - she earned it so its only fair its hers. I'm on her car insurance, I'm on her dental and health insurance through her work (which i already submitted but will submit again). We dont have a will or trust etc or anything like that setup, we are both only 25 years old. 

  
So ill give you guys a rundown of our life, I'm a (somewhat) relevent online gamer, and im (somewhat) known in a gaming community for being a top player. We had known eachother for a while online, and I would help her learn the game and get better etc until we got very close and she flew out to the UK to meet me in person. It went amazing and we, as cheesy as it sounds, instantly fell in love. We then spent the next few months either her flying to europe or me flying to USA to see eachother, in which she then lived with me in the UK for 1 month, which went brilliantly, we were both very happy together. Then after I graduated i flew back to USA to see her (about 8 months after the initial trip) and we were so crazily in love that we just said let's go get married, we both wanted to spent the rest of our lives together. I arrived on an ESTA with no intention of this, we were just feeling so good that we went and made the decision to get married. I only had with me 1 single check in bag whch contained about 4 outfits and my PC (because we wanted to game together at her house), proving that I only intended to stay a short while. My flight was also a return flight, which I later had to cancel the returning flight. Is this enough proof that we had no intentions of marriage prior to me landing here? anyway since then, I have been living with her and doing everything with her. I now have my advanced parole paper and my EAD work permissions, and I apply to jobs all day every day (but the tech market is pretty harsh rn). She says she doesn't want me to get a minimum wage job for the sake of helping her with income, but she would rather me spend my all trying to get my tech job instead of wasting time on a basic job - so thats what i do. Outside of this I am her personal handyman and I help fix up repair etc anything and everything around the house. - yet again the bills for this will be under her name so I cant really prove that. But yeah we moved into the new house - I organised the whole moving process and setup utilities as i said etc, setup the airbnb, organised for AC vents to be cleaned, dryer vent cleaning for insurance purposes, built shelves and drawers around the house etc etc i can go on. We are very very happy, I drive us down to her family (6 hour drive SW to her parents, 5 hour drive S to her sister) many times, once a month on avg. I attend every holiday event with her family (thanksgiving, 4th july etc etc). We just live a normal life together - but now obviously im super panicked and overthinking about the NOID and would love to build a list of everything possible that i can submit just to ensure that i get to spend the rest of my life with the person i love. -I also had no prior intention of EVER moving to the USA before her, I quite liked the UK and I miss my family a lot, but I love her so much that I left everything behind for her. We were actually deciding whether she moves to the UK instead initially, but as I was a fresh grad university student, and she had a VERY good stable job in USA, we decided that USA was the best - and I'm better at emotionally handling being away from my family, so I was willing to take the bullet on that one so that she can be the happiest version of herself. 

  
Anyway I rambled quite a lot, but yeah im very stressed about this whole NOID situation and would love if we could mock up a list of absolutely everything I can submit to ensure that they believe our intentions were for love.

Feel free to ask ANY questions etc and i appreciate any help.

  
List so far: (will edit as we go on, anything with question bullet means unsure)

?- (resubmit wifes passport, SSN, birth cert etc?)  
?- (go and get more passport pics and submit again?)

\-HOA emails to me

\-Joint T mobile account

\-AT&T joint permissions (any any other utility where I'm added as an admin etc)

\-joint gym accounts (old gym, and new gym?) in which we go almost every morning 

\-My GA driving license with old address (or I can go tuesday morn and update address to the new house and photocopy the paper they give for temporary license whilst it comes in the mail?)

\-airbnb joint ownership of our basement, and screenshots of both of me replying to clients (saying that i will bring them sugar downstairs right now etc) which proves i was in the house?

?-(medical papers from when i went to the ER for ct scan for stomach ache? it atleast proves i went to the LOCAL ER to my new house)

?-(i have MANY photos of us doing things over the past 6 months, should i upload all of them? or is that too much)

?-(I do sometimes pay for things for her using my UK bank card (it gets 0% conversion fees under 1k a month so i use it for gifts, date nights etc etc). Show this or no?)

?-(copy of my many resumees which all include my USA addresses, and my linkedin page which shows i live in USA?)

?-(i could get her parents and my parents to write letters explaining their experiences with us, could you advise a general structure in what they should write?)

?-(I could show that i ordered her xmas gift (400$ handmade japanese cooking knife) to her parents address, as we were spending xmas at her parents house? or is this going to confuse them as it being a random address?)

do they want this marriage proof or am i looking at this all wrong and they just want proof that i married without prior intent of marriage upon entering?"

"Help, I think im giving up on life now. I want the world to know how truly sorry I am.",SuicideWatch,1i8yut5,2025-01-24 11:06:41,6,0.88,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1i8yut5/help_i_think_im_giving_up_on_life_now_i_want_the/,CaterpillarFun9438,,"I don’t really know how to start this. The very act of trying to find the words feels too overwhelming, as if just making the effort is too much to bear. But every day, it scares me—this constant regret of all the things I never said, now lost forever, drifting away with every passing moment. I don’t know if I can make this right, but maybe I should at least try, just once. Maybe trying is the only way to find peace in all of this.

It’s taken me so long to even begin, let alone continue. Every day, I’ve watched myself avoid these feelings, these unsaid words. I’ve paused too many times writing, made too many excuses just to run away from the pain, from the truth that I need to do this—not just for you, but maybe for myself also. I can’t keep hiding from what I owe, to both you and me. It’s been hard, getting here, facing everything I’ve tried to avoid. But somehow, it feels right, in a way. To let myself be vulnerable again, to open this wound I created and tried to hide for so long. Maybe it’s not about healing—it’s about learning to live with what happened. Maybe this time, I can finally let myself face the truth without running.

My room feels darker than it truly is, lit only by the faint, flickering glow of my monitors. The hour has long passed, its midnight, and the cold has begun to run into my skin, going deep into my body as the night passes. I’m growing used to this feeling again—the routine of doing nothing, just sitting here, staring at these screens as if they hold the answer to the emptiness I’m trying to outrun. I’ve called off the search for my soul, I put them on hold again, telling myself its impossible, when in truth, I know I’ve just given up on finding it.

I feed myself with endless distractions, each one a momentary attempt to numb the pain inside, a way to escape the weight of what lingers beneath. They offer temporary relief—small bursts of satisfaction that fade almost as quickly as they arrive, leaving me empty again, like an empty room that refuses to be filled. And yet, I keep chasing them, as if one might finally make me forget, might silence these thoughts that has been creeping me, ones that burn like a fever, searing through me as if I’m burning alive. Thoughts about what’s really happening. Thoughts about what’s already happened.

The silence around me feels heavy, pressing down harder with every passing moment. It’s the kind of silence that amplifies everything I’m trying to escape. And though I know this cycle leads nowhere, I let it continue, because facing the truth feels harder than this endless loop of distractions.

It’s so late, isn’t it? I’ve lost track of time, but somehow, that doesn’t seem to matter anymore. The hours slip away without me even noticing. I feel like I’m drifting, lost, floating through these moments with no real direction. I wake up thinking of you, and when I fall asleep, it’s the same—your presence lingers in my mind, always there. Every thought is haunted by you, even when I try to push it away, as if you’re woven into the very fabric of my consciousness. How is it now that somehow you’re a stranger, but you were mine just yesterday? I don’t know how we got here, but it feels so different now. Everything has shifted, and I find myself standing in this strange, unfamiliar space, trying to remember what we once had. I don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t know how I ended up here, in this place of endless questioning. All I know is that somewhere, in the middle of all this confusion, I failed. I lost. And that’s the hardest part: admitting it to myself. It feels like the truth is something I can’t outrun, something I can’t hide from anymore, no matter how hard I try. It sits with me, heavy and undeniable. I’m afraid to say it aloud, but deep down, I know it’s true. I’ve failed, and I don’t know how to fix it. It feels too late, doesn’t it? Too late for anything to be what it should have been. Did I crossed the line?

I don’t blame you. You can’t save me. No one can, but myself. You were trying your best, trying to fill the gaps in the empty void within me. And I can’t imagine how much that must have taken from you. I see it now, in everything we’ve become. I mean, look at where we are now.

You took charge of something you were never supposed to, and that wasn’t fair to you. You’re just human, a precious being with your own emptiness to handle. I treated you like an extension of me, like something that could make me feel alive again, and that feels so wrong. It feels like I forced you to carry a burden that wasn’t yours to bear. And I hate myself for making you feel like that, for making you believe you were a failure, that you weren’t enough, that you were just a decoration. You were trying to fix something that was never meant to be fixed, because it wasn’t meant to be fixed by anyone else in the first place. It was my brokenness, my weight, and I made it yours.

It all makes sense now, doesn’t it? The way we fell apart, how the silence between us grew, how the distance stretched until it became an insurmountable divide. I should have let you be who you were, not something I could cling to in order to make myself feel whole. But now, in the quiet of these empty moments, I finally see that. I realize I failed to understand you, failed to see that you were struggling just like me—that you too got tired, got angry, became anxious, and overthought everything. I was too caught up in my own mind to truly listen to yours, and now I’m left wondering if I could have done something differently.

Could we have still been something, if I hadn’t acted the way I did? If I had been more patient, less selfish, maybe more understanding of your own battles? Or was this always the way it was meant to unfold? I keep asking myself these questions, replaying them over and over in my mind, but all I’m left with are doubts and regret. And the memories—always the memories—is the only thing that remains, the only thing that still holds the weight of what once was. It reminds me of everything I’ve lost, of every chance I took for granted. It's the only constant in this aftermath, the only piece of you that I can still hold on to. But even that feels like it's slipping away, like everything else I’ve lost in the wake of it all.

And now, my room feels emptier, in a way that’s hard to explain. It’s always been empty, but now, it’s as if something I once had here is gone. I don’t know what it is—it’s like a ghost, or maybe a memory, a presence that was here, but now it’s simply vanished. It started to fade months ago, little by little, like sunlight dimming behind thick clouds, the sky growing heavy, the clouds turning darker, and a storm quietly gathering on the horizon. And now, it’s completely gone. It’s like the feeling of you, of us, slipping through my fingers, like trying to hold onto sand that falls no matter how tightly I grip. I reach for it in the air, hoping some trace will remain, but it slips away, dissolving before I even understand what I’m losing. The air feels heavier, quieter, as if it’s closing in on me. Every small sound echoes longer in the silence, reminding me of how empty everything has become. I try to fill it with something—anything—but nothing stays. It feels like the silence itself is swallowing everything whole, taking everything with it. And yet, it’s not just the room. It’s me. I can feel myself emptying, piece by piece, the weight of missing you pulling everything else away, leaving only a fragment of me. I don’t know how to stop it, or if I even can.

I started doing things again—old habits I had forgotten about, things that used to come naturally. They all welcomed me back, as if they had been waiting for me, patiently holding space for my return. But there’s something off about it, something unsettling. I feel dissociated by these welcomes, like I’ve been pulled back here because I’ve done something wrong, something I can’t quite put my finger on. It’s strange to be in this place again, doing things I once did without a second thought. It feels familiar, but also foreign, like I don’t belong here anymore. I keep wondering if I missed something, if I did something wrong, if all of this—this emptiness, this disconnect—is somehow my fault. The thought lingers, heavy in the back of my mind, like a question I can’t answer but can’t stop asking.

The music means so much more to me now. It speaks in ways I never paid attention to before. It’s like you gave me a warning, a foreshadowing I couldn’t hear then. You planted those seeds, and now, I remember the songs we shared—the ones I used to listen to without thinking deeper. Now, they tell me everything. They hold meanings I was too blind to see, messages I should have heard before but didn’t. It’s like each note carries the weight of everything unsaid, the beauty of your subtleties and unspoken truth. It’s as though I can hear the echoes of your soul in every song, the way our hearts are quietly pierced through by something from the melody of our past, leaving a wound that never fully heals—a cut that always bleeds.

I didn’t pay attention to the lyrics back then, the subtle words you left me, the quiet signs you showed me. You were tired, weren’t you? You told me more than I ever realized—through your words, through your actions, through everything. But I only focused on the beat, on the sound, on the noise. I was so caught up in my emotions, my insecurities, and my own self-centeredness. I didn’t see what you were trying to say, not fully. And now, those lyrics have become truths I can’t ignore. They haunt with your pain, your weariness, and the love you tried so hard to hold on. It’s a love that I only now realize was never truly mine to claim, yet it was a gift I could have treasured. And in my ignorance, they all faded away.

Sometimes, I sit and wonder what it must have felt like for you—to carry that weight alone, to leave quiet signs in the hope that I’d notice, only to see me stumble blindly past them. Now, carrying the heavy longing in my arms, I feel the weight of everything I didn’t see, everything I didn’t understand. It feels heavier than I ever thought possible, pressing down on me with the realization of what you must have endured. I didn’t know that I had it all, and nobody warned me before the fall. And I’m wasted. I wish you didn’t leave, I just needed a wake-up call. And now I’m facing the greatest loss of them all.

But trying to see from both perspectives, I understand the gravity of everything. I realize how beautiful things were, how beautiful they could’ve been, for both of us. The moments we shared, the connection we had, everything—so much of it was real. But it feels like too much time has passed. Too much has been lost for it to ever be what it should have been.

What if I had understood then, had seen the depth of your silent struggles? Could I have done something differently? Could I have spared myself from this weight of regret? It’s a question I will never know the answer to, a path that has disappeared behind me, a place lost in time—where I once saw you, where you, my loved one, stayed. to a place I can no longer go back to.

And I just find myself crying without warning—no reason, just tears. It’s the music. The songs we both listened to, or the ones you played. I can’t help it—they pull me back, tugging at threads I thought I had buried. They bring up everything: the memories, the moments, the pain, the love. Each note feels like a doorway, opening to a place where I still thought there was time, where we still believed that what we had could last. It’s like the music keeps us alive, even when you’re not here anymore. And In some moments, I think of you when I am sad and down, when the silence makes me cry, when it’s hard to try, and all I can do is simply fall back into you. Those songs remind me of the pieces of us still scattered in the corners of my heart, and I can’t help but let myself be pulled into them, pulled back to you.

I’ve placed so many emotions in the lyrics of the songs we listened to, each one wrapped in memories that refuses to fade. The regret, the longing, the guilt—they all live in those songs now, stitched into every melody. They’ve become a part of me, just as you are. And when I hear them, it feels like I’m hearing you again, like your voice is hiding between the chords, calling me back to something I’ll never touch again. A glimpse of us—not the us we are now, the one distant and separated by time. The us from before, when everything felt possible. When everything felt more safer, and the world was full of promise, and we could pretend that nothing could ever tear us apart. That version of us feels more closer when the music plays, as if I could be there again, if only I could reach far enough, but the distance between now and then is too vast, too final. The past, once vivid, is fading into a place I can’t revisit, a place where you still held my hand and we still believed in something worthwhile. A place where no storm could break us, that time would be kind to us. But now, all that’s left are fragments, memories wrapped in a melancholic tone that plays on, reminding me of who we were—of who I thought we’d always be. And every note brings me back, just for a moment, before reality pulls me further away, leaving me with nothing but the silence after the song ends.

I wish I could go back, even for just a moment, to hear you sing those songs again, to feel the way your voice carried emotions I never fully understood—how every note told a story, every lyric a piece of your soul. We were doing nothing, yet it felt like everything, as if our souls were trying to speak to each other without a single word. I long to see us again, together, lost in the music, wrapped in the warmth of the moment, before everything began to slip away.

I cherish what we had, even though it hurts, and the weight of it sometimes feels unbearable.

"Help, I think im giving up on life now. I just want the world to know how truly sorry I am for everything.",depression,1i8yt1e,2025-01-24 11:04:40,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1i8yt1e/help_i_think_im_giving_up_on_life_now_i_just_want/,CaterpillarFun9438,,"I don’t really know how to start this. The very act of trying to find the words feels too overwhelming, as if just making the effort is too much to bear. But every day, it scares me—this constant regret of all the things I never said, now lost forever, drifting away with every passing moment. I don’t know if I can make this right, but maybe I should at least try, just once. Maybe trying is the only way to find peace in all of this.

It’s taken me so long to even begin, let alone continue. Every day, I’ve watched myself avoid these feelings, these unsaid words. I’ve paused too many times writing, made too many excuses just to run away from the pain, from the truth that I need to do this—not just for you, but maybe for myself also. I can’t keep hiding from what I owe, to both you and me. It’s been hard, getting here, facing everything I’ve tried to avoid. But somehow, it feels right, in a way. To let myself be vulnerable again, to open this wound I created and tried to hide for so long. Maybe it’s not about healing—it’s about learning to live with what happened. Maybe this time, I can finally let myself face the truth without running.

My room feels darker than it truly is, lit only by the faint, flickering glow of my monitors. The hour has long passed, its midnight, and the cold has begun to run into my skin, going deep into my body as the night passes. I’m growing used to this feeling again—the routine of doing nothing, just sitting here, staring at these screens as if they hold the answer to the emptiness I’m trying to outrun. I’ve called off the search for my soul, I put them on hold again, telling myself its impossible, when in truth, I know I’ve just given up on finding it.

I feed myself with endless distractions, each one a momentary attempt to numb the pain inside, a way to escape the weight of what lingers beneath. They offer temporary relief—small bursts of satisfaction that fade almost as quickly as they arrive, leaving me empty again, like an empty room that refuses to be filled. And yet, I keep chasing them, as if one might finally make me forget, might silence these thoughts that has been creeping me, ones that burn like a fever, searing through me as if I’m burning alive. Thoughts about what’s really happening. Thoughts about what’s already happened.

The silence around me feels heavy, pressing down harder with every passing moment. It’s the kind of silence that amplifies everything I’m trying to escape. And though I know this cycle leads nowhere, I let it continue, because facing the truth feels harder than this endless loop of distractions.

It’s so late, isn’t it? I’ve lost track of time, but somehow, that doesn’t seem to matter anymore. The hours slip away without me even noticing. I feel like I’m drifting, lost, floating through these moments with no real direction. I wake up thinking of you, and when I fall asleep, it’s the same—your presence lingers in my mind, always there. Every thought is haunted by you, even when I try to push it away, as if you’re woven into the very fabric of my consciousness. How is it now that somehow you’re a stranger, but you were mine just yesterday? I don’t know how we got here, but it feels so different now. Everything has shifted, and I find myself standing in this strange, unfamiliar space, trying to remember what we once had. I don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t know how I ended up here, in this place of endless questioning. All I know is that somewhere, in the middle of all this confusion, I failed. I lost. And that’s the hardest part: admitting it to myself. It feels like the truth is something I can’t outrun, something I can’t hide from anymore, no matter how hard I try. It sits with me, heavy and undeniable. I’m afraid to say it aloud, but deep down, I know it’s true. I’ve failed, and I don’t know how to fix it. It feels too late, doesn’t it? Too late for anything to be what it should have been. Did I crossed the line?

I don’t blame you. You can’t save me. No one can, but myself. You were trying your best, trying to fill the gaps in the empty void within me. And I can’t imagine how much that must have taken from you. I see it now, in everything we’ve become. I mean, look at where we are now.

You took charge of something you were never supposed to, and that wasn’t fair to you. You’re just human, a precious being with your own emptiness to handle. I treated you like an extension of me, like something that could make me feel alive again, and that feels so wrong. It feels like I forced you to carry a burden that wasn’t yours to bear. And I hate myself for making you feel like that, for making you believe you were a failure, that you weren’t enough, that you were just a decoration. You were trying to fix something that was never meant to be fixed, because it wasn’t meant to be fixed by anyone else in the first place. It was my brokenness, my weight, and I made it yours.

It all makes sense now, doesn’t it? The way we fell apart, how the silence between us grew, how the distance stretched until it became an insurmountable divide. I should have let you be who you were, not something I could cling to in order to make myself feel whole. But now, in the quiet of these empty moments, I finally see that. I realize I failed to understand you, failed to see that you were struggling just like me—that you too got tired, got angry, became anxious, and overthought everything. I was too caught up in my own mind to truly listen to yours, and now I’m left wondering if I could have done something differently.

Could we have still been something, if I hadn’t acted the way I did? If I had been more patient, less selfish, maybe more understanding of your own battles? Or was this always the way it was meant to unfold? I keep asking myself these questions, replaying them over and over in my mind, but all I’m left with are doubts and regret. And the memories—always the memories—is the only thing that remains, the only thing that still holds the weight of what once was. It reminds me of everything I’ve lost, of every chance I took for granted. It's the only constant in this aftermath, the only piece of you that I can still hold on to. But even that feels like it's slipping away, like everything else I’ve lost in the wake of it all.

And now, my room feels emptier, in a way that’s hard to explain. It’s always been empty, but now, it’s as if something I once had here is gone. I don’t know what it is—it’s like a ghost, or maybe a memory, a presence that was here, but now it’s simply vanished. It started to fade months ago, little by little, like sunlight dimming behind thick clouds, the sky growing heavy, the clouds turning darker, and a storm quietly gathering on the horizon. And now, it’s completely gone. It’s like the feeling of you, of us, slipping through my fingers, like trying to hold onto sand that falls no matter how tightly I grip. I reach for it in the air, hoping some trace will remain, but it slips away, dissolving before I even understand what I’m losing. The air feels heavier, quieter, as if it’s closing in on me. Every small sound echoes longer in the silence, reminding me of how empty everything has become. I try to fill it with something—anything—but nothing stays. It feels like the silence itself is swallowing everything whole, taking everything with it. And yet, it’s not just the room. It’s me. I can feel myself emptying, piece by piece, the weight of missing you pulling everything else away, leaving only a fragment of me. I don’t know how to stop it, or if I even can.

I started doing things again—old habits I had forgotten about, things that used to come naturally. They all welcomed me back, as if they had been waiting for me, patiently holding space for my return. But there’s something off about it, something unsettling. I feel dissociated by these welcomes, like I’ve been pulled back here because I’ve done something wrong, something I can’t quite put my finger on. It’s strange to be in this place again, doing things I once did without a second thought. It feels familiar, but also foreign, like I don’t belong here anymore. I keep wondering if I missed something, if I did something wrong, if all of this—this emptiness, this disconnect—is somehow my fault. The thought lingers, heavy in the back of my mind, like a question I can’t answer but can’t stop asking.

The music means so much more to me now. It speaks in ways I never paid attention to before. It’s like you gave me a warning, a foreshadowing I couldn’t hear then. You planted those seeds, and now, I remember the songs we shared—the ones I used to listen to without thinking deeper. Now, they tell me everything. They hold meanings I was too blind to see, messages I should have heard before but didn’t. It’s like each note carries the weight of everything unsaid, the beauty of your subtleties and unspoken truth. It’s as though I can hear the echoes of your soul in every song, the way our hearts are quietly pierced through by something from the melody of our past, leaving a wound that never fully heals—a cut that always bleeds.

I didn’t pay attention to the lyrics back then, the subtle words you left me, the quiet signs you showed me. You were tired, weren’t you? You told me more than I ever realized—through your words, through your actions, through everything. But I only focused on the beat, on the sound, on the noise. I was so caught up in my emotions, my insecurities, and my own self-centeredness. I didn’t see what you were trying to say, not fully. And now, those lyrics have become truths I can’t ignore. They haunt with your pain, your weariness, and the love you tried so hard to hold on. It’s a love that I only now realize was never truly mine to claim, yet it was a gift I could have treasured. And in my ignorance, they all faded away.

Sometimes, I sit and wonder what it must have felt like for you—to carry that weight alone, to leave quiet signs in the hope that I’d notice, only to see me stumble blindly past them. Now, carrying the heavy longing in my arms, I feel the weight of everything I didn’t see, everything I didn’t understand. It feels heavier than I ever thought possible, pressing down on me with the realization of what you must have endured. I didn’t know that I had it all, and nobody warned me before the fall. And I’m wasted. I wish you didn’t leave, I just needed a wake-up call. And now I’m facing the greatest loss of them all.

But trying to see from both perspectives, I understand the gravity of everything. I realize how beautiful things were, how beautiful they could’ve been, for both of us. The moments we shared, the connection we had, everything—so much of it was real. But it feels like too much time has passed. Too much has been lost for it to ever be what it should have been.

What if I had understood then, had seen the depth of your silent struggles? Could I have done something differently? Could I have spared myself from this weight of regret? It’s a question I will never know the answer to, a path that has disappeared behind me, a place lost in time—where I once saw you, where you, my loved one, stayed. to a place I can no longer go back to.

And I just find myself crying without warning—no reason, just tears. It’s the music. The songs we both listened to, or the ones you played. I can’t help it—they pull me back, tugging at threads I thought I had buried. They bring up everything: the memories, the moments, the pain, the love. Each note feels like a doorway, opening to a place where I still thought there was time, where we still believed that what we had could last. It’s like the music keeps us alive, even when you’re not here anymore. And In some moments, I think of you when I am sad and down, when the silence makes me cry, when it’s hard to try, and all I can do is simply fall back into you. Those songs remind me of the pieces of us still scattered in the corners of my heart, and I can’t help but let myself be pulled into them, pulled back to you.

I’ve placed so many emotions in the lyrics of the songs we listened to, each one wrapped in memories that refuses to fade. The regret, the longing, the guilt—they all live in those songs now, stitched into every melody. They’ve become a part of me, just as you are. And when I hear them, it feels like I’m hearing you again, like your voice is hiding between the chords, calling me back to something I’ll never touch again. A glimpse of us—not the us we are now, the one distant and separated by time. The us from before, when everything felt possible. When everything felt more safer, and the world was full of promise, and we could pretend that nothing could ever tear us apart. That version of us feels more closer when the music plays, as if I could be there again, if only I could reach far enough, but the distance between now and then is too vast, too final. The past, once vivid, is fading into a place I can’t revisit, a place where you still held my hand and we still believed in something worthwhile. A place where no storm could break us, that time would be kind to us. But now, all that’s left are fragments, memories wrapped in a melancholic tone that plays on, reminding me of who we were—of who I thought we’d always be. And every note brings me back, just for a moment, before reality pulls me further away, leaving me with nothing but the silence after the song ends.

I wish I could go back, even for just a moment, to hear you sing those songs again, to feel the way your voice carried emotions I never fully understood—how every note told a story, every lyric a piece of your soul. We were doing nothing, yet it felt like everything, as if our souls were trying to speak to each other without a single word. I long to see us again, together, lost in the music, wrapped in the warmth of the moment, before everything began to slip away.

I cherish what we had, even though it hurts, and the weight of it sometimes feels unbearable. I relive the good moments over and over, clinging to them like lifelines, but they only make the ache sharper. I fight the guilt that always seems to follow me—the regret of what I did, what I didn’t do, and all the ways I fell short. It’s a battle I’m slowly losing, as if every memory chips away at me, piece by piece.

I hate myself for how it ended. I hate myself for the words left unsaid and the ones I shouldn’t have spoken. For the times I let you down when all I wanted was to hold us together.

*Vilantian-Hurdop Trade Cooperative offices*

Undersecretary Ah'nuriel was having a very odd day. Of course, odd days were becoming almost normal of late. Her husband had sent her a long message detailing how much he missed her scent. She'd gotten fairly good at guessing what wasn't being said over the past few years. Messages with hidden meaning were only meaningful if you knew how to read them. And what was being said was difficult - most of their contracted work was going to the Sword of the Light Gods, however the Terrans were beginning to hire companies of their own accord. That was the reason for the meeting today. A Terran who appeared to be wearing subtle joint braces underneath a very oddly fashioned suit - it covered the entirety of his body, with a few cloth decorations. The entire thing was black save for a white shirt. His sunglasses were unusual, and not just because he only had two eyes. They were square and very dark, making his entire hatchet-looking furless face somehow more off-putting. Old instincts were warning her that this Terran brought danger to her door.

The undersecretary took a breath, remembering that somehow this species was a formidable one – and one of her tasks was to find out why. Still, the Terran was polite enough and allowed himself to be sniffed first. His scent was cloying, and almost resembled a Minister's in some ways – there was an honest deception to him, as if he expected things to be withheld.

She took a breath, considering her first move. ""So how can the Trade Cooperative assist you today...""

The man smiled easily. ""Smith will suffice. Agent Smith, representing Skunkworks Insurance. We'd like to investigate an opportunity for trade. If you're not familiar with us, our business is risk assessment at the core. We assess risk and set a price on assuming a worst-case scenario for that risk. In dangerous times we may refuse to do business in an area entirely. But now with the peace accords, the risk is substantially lower. We'd like some assistance from the Trade Cooperative.""

And there was the deception wrapped in a smooth voice. Or at least the first one. Their business wasn't entirely risk assessment, but something else. The undersecretary kept her fur low with an effort. ""Well, our business is the trade of goods, so there may be areas of overlap. But I'm not certain what more we could commit to without specifics.""

""Well, multiple Terran companies have expressed interest in forming permanent partnerships here and paying well for their partnership. Worlds like yours and Hurdop Prime are rare – high gravity, atmosphere conducive to our life forms, and land that's good for many crops. Not Terran, of course; your gravity would kill most of our plant life. But, as a manufacturing center, many things that you can make here are far more expensive to make on other worlds. In addition, there are Terrans who would come here to train physically - athletes training their muscles in higher gravity would make exceptional leaps over those that don't. In return, economic prosperity and perhaps unique items of our own that can withstand this environment. We'd like assurances that this peace is a binding one, and that honoring our contracts won't leave us at a loss.""

Ah'nuriel cocked her head slightly. ""Perhaps that is a question better answered by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.""

""Come now, Undersecretary. A meeting with the Foreign Affairs department would leave me with bland reassurance no matter the truth in addition to my already aching knees. I seek the honesty that only comes from a balance sheet. In addition, I understand that you have something of a personal stake in continued peace.""

Her fur flared almost of its own volition. ""That information is...accurate. But not quite relevant.""

""On this, we must agree to disagree - risk assessment requires accurate information, and a great deal of detail. With that said, here is some information that I have from Terran companies."" Agent Smith slid a small datapad over. ""Those are the companies willing to invest, and the amounts they are willing to pay at this time. They are substantial, and with assurances of security could grow. Which would mean the amounts they pay us would grow, and everyone goes home happy. Of course I would ensure my superiors knew your name in my reports. So, information for information. There's no reason to say yes or no right now - my superiors are arranging a conference at our offices in New Casablanca in a few months, and we are making an attendee list right now. Purely speculative for the moment, but I'm sure if I polled your co-workers right now there would be several interested parties. With the right voices in the right ears, a great deal can change. A captain could have a name, for example.""

Ah'nuriel nodded reluctant agreement. ""Information for information, then.""

*Homeplate*

Gryzzk's life had never been so busy. There had been a few days of respite as his ship and crew had celebrated and enjoyed a fine night at Sparrows, and then began the process of correcting and implementing new things that their victory had allowed the company to purchase. Inertial dampeners, a secondary shielding system, some additional systems for weapons, new paint, and what may have been most important, a new coffee maker for Engineering. For himself and the bridge team, however, it meant exceptionally long days in a command simulator, where they'd been run through multiple engagements and tactical sequences. After each engagement, the proctors from the 7th would go over everyone's errors in excruciating detail. The proctors were dark magicians at finding errors - even when they'd run through simulated exercises perfectly, there was still a detail that had been overlooked, a way it could have been done better. He'd lost the entire ship on several occasions, which unnerved him as the proctors went over every failing he'd had during those engagements. It was disheartening until O'Brien had finally told the proctors to give them the room. In the conference room over tea, coffee, and foul language they finally were able to gain a sense of what was happening; each simulation was meant to test a specific aspect of their skills, and in the portions they were looking at, Gryzzk and the rest of the crew had performed admirably. Within the rest of it was dressing for them to find mistakes and play headgames - O'Brien pointed out two specific instances where Gryzzk had done something, been called out for it, and then did as they suggested and still merited a chewing out. Things seemed to go better somehow after that, with them acting and reacting to things with a bit less tension.

All of that meant precious little time with his wife and children. He'd had a chance to watch the news a bit more, and it seemed as if every day there was something new that made him feel as if his company was falling behind on a tally sheet that existed only in his mind. Even the Swords of the Light Gods had taken on a successful job – a passenger escort run between New Casablanca and Vilantia. It nagged at him until after three weeks he sent a terse voice message to the Major advising that he was going to stand the company down for a week to assess their next steps prior to their next job.

The reply message was a soft chuckle and a ""Your company, your rules.""

His delivery of the news at the morning briefing was met with relief and cheers from the crew. As much as they would have kept going for a few more weeks if he'd asked, Gryzzk had observed the Terrans seemed to believe that making time for family and new friends was important – perhaps that was one of their secrets.

They finished up the day's work and Gryzzk found himself on the couch at the end of the day as the children all took spots, with Nhoot staying close to Gryzzk and Gro'zel staying closer to her mother, while the twins took their place in the middle of all of them. Gryzzk frowned a bit as the mercenary news of the day was a re-enactment of the Sword's second engagement - a battle against a Throne's Fortune base which left Gryzzk talking to the wallscreen - only to have his opinions confirmed by the commentators. The Swords seemed to be taking every opportunity to simply overwhelm with force and then destroy even when it would have been more profitable to disable and take the ships whole; particularly since the Hurdop government had formally disavowed the Throne's Fortune as a renegade element and confirmed that there would be a bounty paid for proof in the form of letters of marque.

One of commentators was blunt. ""It's like they're a bully who got beaten and tries to prove they aren't weak by picking on the ones they know don't have a shot. If this is an advert for their skills, I dunno who's buying...""

The one bonus of the arrival of the Swords was that more Vilantian shows were available; the family sat and watched a few classic comedy shows and smiled appropriately, but something seemed off about them. Perhaps it was the time, but the jokes didn't make either of them laugh like they used to.

Still, they went to bed and the next day they took one of the shuttles to New Casablanca. Not the bar district, but the more family-friendly shopping district, filled with temporary stalls dotting the more permanent structures where a dazzling array of goods from Terra could be purchased. While Gryzzk only kept his rank tab on himself for emergency communications, the girls had refused to leave until their purple berets were on their head with their rank proudly placed. Grezzk took the lead, finding a small area of shops that had started to stock items from the Vilantian homeworld. Grezzk took the opportunity to pay a shameful price for some foodstuffs and a few small items that reminded them of home.

Once outside, several Vilantians were waiting, their scent an undisguised disgust. They wore the gold and black uniforms of the Swords company with ranks that designated them as senior staff – all in all this did not bode well.

""Nameless captain, step forth. We do not wish to harm you. We bear a message from the Minister of War.""

Gryzzk closed one pair of his eyes for a moment. ""I recall Commodore A'Drapir's message quite well, friends - may the dead gods treat him well.""

""I do not recall Commodore A'Drapir being named Minister of War. The Minister himself has an offer. He sees that you have become something unexpected; and with that he offers his voice in Restoration and a role within the Swords of the Light Gods. Your own ship, your own crew consisting of the finest Vilantians from Clan Aa'Porti. Picked soldiers to do your bidding – if you do his bidding. The Clan Way calls to you. Your Great Lord calls to you. The Minister would have your voice in the future of Vilantia. Answer yes with your full voice, and all this-"" there was a vague gesture to their surroundings ""-can be a forgotten memory.""

There was a pause ""What future would that be?""

""A future where the Clan Way is made truth and the worlds of this sector are held to it.""

Gryzzk closed his remaining eyes, knowing that what he was going to say would probably condemn him in the eyes of at least three Ministers. ""Not long ago, the Clan Way was the only way I knew. But there is a better way. Clans built not by a birth more than thirty generations past, but choice. My clan is young, built on those the Clan Way would have us cast aside, ignore, and condemn. If we win victory, we learn. If we are defeated, we do not pretend it didn't happen. This offer would have suited me once. But it does not suit me now. When I walk from the twilight, it will be on my own feet with a clan of Vilantians, Hurdop, and Terrans at my side.""

The disgust and fury in their scent made the girls recoil behind Grezzk, and finally one of them spat at the ground. ""None who dwell in the twilight may pass judgment on those in the light. Minister Aa'tebul will lend his voice to more worthy causes. We will not fight this day."" So saying, they spun and walked away with precision.

Grezzk swallowed, and both Gro'zel and Nhoot came out from behind Grezzk. Grezzk had a slight smirk on her face.

""Lord A'Gryzzk, we must make another child soon."" She leaned into him warmly for a moment before they began walking to the shuttle with their purchases.

""I'm no lord. I just do what's best for my family and those under my command.""

""And those under your command would call you a Lord.""

""You realize that would make you a Lady, correct?""

""It would – but only because you shine so brightly.""

Gryzzk shook his head. ""I don't like it. A Lord is born a Lord, and I was not born such."" Still, there was anxiety. He'd effectively become a lord by the acclaim of those he commanded, and even prior to that with managing Lord A'kifab's household. But to become a lord seemed almost insulting in some way.

There was a bit of consideration and silence before Gryzzk caught a familiar scent and turned to call out. ""Edwards?""

Edwards stepped from around a market stall – she was wearing a set of hooded grey robes that covered her almost head to toe. She looked a bit embarrassed, but smiled. ""Gonna have to wear perfume next time. Ugh.""

""Why?""

""Hiding my scent, obviously."" She shrugged. ""So what'd those bumblebees want?""

""They wanted me to come work for them.""

Edwards blinked. ""Oh. You, ah, thinkin' about it?""

Gryzzk shook his head. ""No. I have a clan already, as you recall.""

Edwards seemed relieved. ""Okay, cool. Yeah, that must have been hard.""

""Not as much as I thought it would. I have something meaningful here, and we have agreed to things. Together. They did not wish to include anyone else. But we have a conundrum of sorts."" Gryzzk paused to consider how to couch the question. ""Titles are important to us. Lead Servant, Lord, Greatlord, things like that. Does Terran or Hurdop culture have a title that fits this situation that we're in?""

Edwards chuffed softly. ""Whatcha mean?""

""Well essentially a commoner in what is traditionally a noble position.""

""Oh yeah, your captains are...but not really for the Hurdop...sorta."" Edwards' eyes unfocused as she seemed to be reading a tablet from her memory and she started thinking out loud. ""But...Samoan - Matai, no. Feudal Japan - Jizamurai, maybe but we'll keep going...Nordic - Jarl - nah too close to earl and they'd call me out for playing too much Skyrim again..."" Finally she snapped back to reality. ""I'll have to think about it. I'll talk to Engineering but we might just need to invent a new word for you, Cap.""

""Indeed. If it comes to that let me know. Now, to the other question I have – why were you following me?""

Edwards looked like a child about to get disciplined for marking the walls. ""Well, respectfully Cap, you've made some enemies. Bad Moon's put money on the board for an asskicking with you as the recipient, and few of the Swords were making noises about bringing you into the light according to Reilly.""

""How does Reilly know?""

""She bought 'em a couple drinks. Apparently we all look alike to you.""

""Remind me to compensate her.""

""She said she'll trade the drinks for a refresh on her roots from Mama Grezzk."" Edwards smirked a little.

Grezzk seemed taken aback slightly. ""Mama?""

There was a nod. ""Mmm-hm. On the ship Nhoot calls him Captain Papa, so Mama just kinda grew out of that.""

Grezzk's fur flickered. ""I. I hadn't considered that. Of course, we'll be here whenever she wishes."" She paused for a moment. ""Let her know that tonight we're having a garlic chicken recipe for dinner.""

They shuttled back to the company area and split off; Edwards heading to her room in the barracks and Gryzzk leading his family to their quarters. Gryzzk settled in on the couch with the boys and checked his tablet while the girls ran to their room to play with their new toys. Grezzk began marinating the chicken and preparing the rice before settling in on the couch.

""You don't like the idea of being a Lord, do you?""

Gryzzk shook his head. ""It feels wrong, somehow.""

She leaned into him gently. ""Whatever they call you, you will always be my handsome hand.""

For a long moment, there was a bubble of peace as the universe shrank to a small officer's quarters with girls playing and giggling, two boys cradled between their parents, and the parents enjoying the opportunity to stare at a hologram of a Vilantian sunset.

The silence couldn't last forever, and there was a chime at the door. It was Reilly, grinning happily with a small case filled with hair colors. Gryzzk put the boys in their beds as Grezzk lowered the gravity to match the ship standard before opening the door. Reilly came in and was promptly greeted by Nhoot and Gro'zel who simply had to show off their new toys. There was some general laughter and amusement as Reilly nuzzled Grezzk's neck briefly and then sneezed.

Reilly was bouncing a little bit and seemed to almost be everywhere at once, dipping a finger in the marinade and pronouncing it to be 'zippy', and then looking at the twins and ooh'ing and sniffing them delicately so as not to wake them. After that she was teaching the girls to dance. Oddly. Finally she flopped on the couch and tapped on Gryzzk's tablet.

""You didn't read the message I sent, Cap?""

Gryzzk quirked at her. ""I didn't yet.""

""Stuff's happening. Got a lead on a new job outta Hurdop Prime, and the news is going to be interesting tonight.""

The new information was accepted casually, and Gryzzk took his tablet back for more information on the job. It appeared to be a specific request from a new Hurdop trading company called the Great Triangle of Hurdop. The job itself seemed simple; escorting a pair of ships from Hurdop Prime to Terra Prime, then to Vilantia prime, and finally a return to Hurdop Prime. It seemed simple enough, but at the same time it was concerning. He looked at the pay for the job before forwarding it to Rosie with an inquiry if they could add about five percent more and stipulate payment for hazards and combat.

Rosie agreed, and they sent an amended version of the request back to the Great Triangle.

Dinner was a raucous affair, as Reilly told jokes and stories about how Gryzzk was aboard the ship. Finally as they cleaned up, the twins began to stir for their food, and Reilly was polite enough to wait that out while they watched the news. The mercenary-focused section was as interesting as Reilly had promised.

""...and in new stand-ups, we've got a few. Bad Moon Company has announced the formation of a new associate company, the Foreign Legion of Terra. This comes on the heels of Swissguards press release regarding their own Terran Legion of Foreigners and - oooh, here's a little outside the box thinking - Polar Bear Company's rolling out the Foreign Terran Legion. Funnily enough, they're all rocking shades of purple for their colors. Great marketing teams out there."" The announcer shook his head and turn to his co-anchor for more commentary while Reilly began laughing so hard tears were forming.

""Oh. My God."" Reilly wheezed. ""This is awesome.""

""I'm not sure I understand."" Gryzzk tried to focus on the commentators, who seemed pessimistic - they agreed that the 7th Cavalry had caught some manner of lightning in a bottle with the 'OG Terran Foreign Legion', but whether that success could be replicated was an entirely different manner.

Reilly giggled a little bit more before gathering herself and quoting from a movie that Gryzzk vaguely remembered. ""It's like that thing - 'Are you the Judean People's Front?' 'Fuck off! Judean People's Front. We're the People's Front of Judea!' It's hilarious, we're so good we've already got knockoffs.""

Grezzk finally got the twins resettled and changed for bed, and came out to get Reilly's hair color refreshed properly. It was an odd thing to watch, as Grezzk and Reilly chatted amiably about things - Reilly was enthralled by certain aspects of Vilantia, and made casual allusions to shore leave and possibly even vacationing there when the chance came. Finally with her hair color re-purpled and ends re-done, Reilly took her leave.

""I do believe we're going to have to ask your bosses to look at the applications you forwarded sooner rather than later."" Grezzk smiled softly.

""Mmm. Probably. We'll need to avoid damage on this next job.""

""Worry about that on the next job. I would have my handsome hand warm our bed tonight.""

Gryzzk smiled a bit himself as he led his wife to a good night's sleep."
Paying Vendors,smallbusiness,1i8xeif,2025-01-24 10:04:08,0,0.5,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1i8xeif/paying_vendors/,dwhit110,General,"I just became a small business owner a couple months ago and I'm reaching a point where I'm going to need to begin paying vendors. Some of them accept checks, but others want ACH payments. I'm not a merchant who will be taking or making regular transactions. Maybe 10 or so times a year I'll need the ability to make an ACH payment. Sadly, the business checking platform that I went with doesn't offer ACH payments. 

As I research, I feel like there are two options. Does anyone have advice for me?

1. Get a payment processor like Stripe, Square or Clover. Using that I should be able to pay vendors directly when checks aren't preferred. 

2. Signup with a different business checking platform like AMEX Business which offers ACH payments. Link it to my existing business checking which I can sunset over time (there are a couple of clients who make ACH payments to me through that, so it's not simple to immediately shut down and switch everything over to AMEX). 

Seems like AMEX is the easier solution. But am I missing anything?

Be Very Wary of Certain Massage Parlors....,nosleep,1i8vtim,2025-01-24 08:50:55,41,0.93,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i8vtim/be_very_wary_of_certain_massage_parlors/,Puzzleheaded-Day3916,,"I’ve never been one to indulge in self-care. Life as a young professional in a bustling city left little room for such luxuries. But after months of grueling hours at work, my body ached for relief, and my mind desperately needed a break from the chaos.

So, when I heard about Elysium Touch, the new massage parlor that had opened just down the street, I was intrigued enough to give it a try.

As I stepped inside, the receptionist greeted me with a warm smile, and a delicate aroma of essential oils wafted through the air. 

Instantly, it felt as if I had entered another world—one where stress simply melted away.

Minutes later, I was introduced to my masseuse, Nina. She was strikingly beautiful, tall, with an athletic build that suggested she took great care of herself. .

Her long, dark hair fell in soft waves down her back, glistening under the parlor’s gentle lights, accentuating her high cheekbones and delicate jawline.

As she led me to the massage room, her captivating green eyes sparkled with warmth and kindness, instantly putting me at ease. 

The deep tissue massage I’d chosen unfolded like a carefully choreographed symphony.

Every movement of her hands was deliberate, soothing, expertly targeting the knots that had lodged themselves deep in my muscles. The oils she used filled the room, their aroma wrapping around me like a warm embrace, drawing me deeper into relaxation.

The rhythmic, melodic music in the background was almost hypnotic. Time seemed to disappear as my worries dissolved, replaced by a serenity I hadn’t felt in years.

Soon, I became a regular at *Elysium Touch*, visiting at least once a week. Each session felt like a mini escape from reality. I even took advantage of their enticing discount packages, and on my last visit, I received nearly 75% off—a deal that made no business sense to me, but who was I to complain?

However, when I visited Elysium for the fourth time, I had no idea what awaited me that night. 

The management called my number, offering a complimentary massage as a reward for my loyalty, saying I only needed to pay for refreshments. In hindsight, that should have set off alarm bells in my head, but all I could think about was Nina.  
  


Over the weeks, I had begun to feel an unexpected connection with her. 

Nina listened, laughed at my terrible jokes, and even shared snippets of her own life. Nina’s also the curious sort; she likes to learn more about her clients, and I for one am always happy to share. I told her about where I worked, what I did for a living, and that I had no family to speak of and lived alone, not far from here. 

Sometimes, I even seriously considered asking her out on a date so that I could get to know her better. 

But that night, something was off. Really off. 

As the massage began, everything felt familiar at first—her touch, the soothing oils, the gentle music. But this time, the oils had a stronger scent, almost overwhelming. A strange fuzziness started to creep over me. 

I tried to stay awake, to focus, but the effort felt ultimately futile. My grip on consciousness was slipping, and before I knew it, I was being pulled into a deep, inescapable sleep.

When I finally woke up, bright white lights hurt my eyes, and a coldness seeped into my bones. Panic clawed at my throat as I tried to move.

I realized quickly that I was strapped to a cold, metal operating table. 

My heart raced, pounding against my chest like a caged animal. The last thing I remembered was Nina’s touch, her smile. 

Where was she now?

And who were all these people?

I looked around, my pulse quickening as masked figures surrounded me, their faces obscured by surgical masks. A deep, unsettling chill settled in my gut as I tried to comprehend the situation.

 “Ah, you’re awake,” a voice said, smooth and eerily calm.

 It belonged to a man dressed in scrubs—his eyes gleamed with a sadistic glint. “Welcome to my operating table. My name is Dr. Harrow, and I’ll be your surgeon today.” 

My mind raced. “What... what’s happening? Let me go!” I screamed, but my voice sounded weak and distant.

Dr. Harrow picked up a scalpel, holding it delicately between his fingers, letting it glint menacingly under the bright lights. 

“This little tool will help us acquire what we need from you, Alex. Thanks to your sacrifice, you'll save a lot of lives and also help us make a lot of money,” he said, as those gathered around him—also dressed in scrubs—nodded in unison, their eyes fixed on me.

“Do you want to know what we’re going to take from you Alex?” he continued, smiling as he slowly traced the blade over my body—lingering over my kidneys, lungs, heart, throat, and finally resting just above my eyes.

At that moment, the horrifying realization hit me—I had just fallen victim to an organ trafficking ring. 

I recoiled in terror, frantically trying to free myself, but my hands and feet were bound tightly to the table.

“Now, let’s get you ready, shall we?” Dr. Harrow spoke, signaling to one of his assistants, who approached me with a syringe in his hand. 

I recognized it was anesthesia. They were going to put me to sleep again.

 Fear clawed at my insides as I thought of being trapped in this filthy, makeshift underground clinic.

 The reality of what was happening—that my body was about to be sliced apart for its organs—hit me like a sledgehammer. 

My heart pounded in my chest, the weight of my own impending death pressing down on me.

Just as the needle pricked my skin, I heard a loud bang from outside the room.

 The doors of the operating room suddenly flew open, and a group of police officers stormed in.

“Police! Hands in the air!” they shouted, guns drawn. 

Panic swept through the room. Dr. Harrow reacted quickly, yanking my head back and pressing the scalpel to my throat. “Stay back, or I’ll slit his throat!” he yelled, his voice cracking, his eyes wild.

I could barely breathe. The cold edge of the scalpel dug into my neck, and every muscle in my body froze. 

Then, in a flash, a single gunshot rang out. Harrow’s body jerked violently, his head snapping back as blood sprayed across my face. He crumpled on top of me, his dead weight pressing me into the table.

I screamed, choking on panic as gunfire erupted in all directions between the police and the remaining goons. 

The operating table jolted, tipping over, and I crashed to the floor. The impact knocked the wind out of me, and before I could process what was happening, everything went dark.

When I opened my eyes again, I was in a hospital room, a warm blanket draped over me. Officer Reed sat beside my bed, relief softening the lines on his face.

“You’re safe now, Alex,” he said, his voice steady. “We got there just in time. They were about to operate on you, steal your organs.”

I blinked, trying to process the whirlwind of events. “The massage parlor… Nina… was she part of this?”

Reed shook his head. “No, Nina’s an undercover agent. We’ve been investigating Elysium Touch for weeks. They specifically target individuals who live alone and have no close living relatives. It’s a massive organ-smuggling ring. They research their clients, choosing those who fit their profile. That’s how they’ve stayed under the radar for so long. You were almost their next victim.”

His words sank in slowly. “So Nina… she …saved me?” I asked.

“Yes,” he confirmed. “Her undercover work brought us to you just in time.”

The weight of betrayal still settled heavily on my chest even as I learned the truth about Nina.

 “I thought she cared… I thought she was different.” I said finally. 

Reed’s expression suddenly  softened as he let out a deep sigh. “Nina did what she had to in order to maintain her cover. You’re lucky to be alive, Alex. These are dangerous people, constantly moving to avoid detection. They’ve gotten away with it for too long, but this time, we’ll make sure they face justice.”

I spent a few more days in the hospital, my body slowly healing, but my mind remained trapped in that cold, sterile operating room. Nightmares plagued my sleep—visions of Dr. Harrow looming over me, scalpel in hand.

Despite the lingering fear, I forced myself to return to some sense of normalcy, pushing through the unease that clung to me now like a second skin. 

I had been given a second chance, and I wanted to make it count even though it was difficult to find peace in the chaos.

Then, one evening, I saw her—Nina—walking along the sidewalk. For a moment, I hesitated, unsure of what to say. But gratitude pushed me forward.

""Nina,"" I called out, my voice a little shaky.

She turned, her eyes meeting mine. ""Thank you, for saving my life"" I said.

She gave a small nod, her face softening just slightly.

After a beat, I blurted out, ""Would you… maybe want to grab coffee sometime?""

She paused, considering, then nodded. ""Sure,"" she replied, her voice calm but sincere.

A brief, tentative smile passed between us, and for the first time, I felt a flicker of hope. 

Maybe this was the beginning of healing. Maybe, despite everything, I could find a way to move forward with a happy ending, no pun intended.

Blockfi reported my 1099-B income utterly and completely wrong in 2021 and 2022. Did this happen to anyone else?,blockfi,1i8volv,2025-01-24 08:43:59,8,0.9,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/blockfi/comments/1i8volv/blockfi_reported_my_1099b_income_utterly_and/,CUDAcores89,Discussion,"on 1/22/25, I received a CP2000 letter from the IRS stating they believed I owed $4000 in federal taxes and penalties. I freaked out. We'll it turns out Blockfi had not reported my cost basis to the IRS, so the IRS saw a $30K gain, and no losses.

Should I have saved my 1099-B from the year 2022? Yes. Did I? No. Because Blockfi never mailed me a 1099-B for the year of 2022. So I didn't know I had taxes to pay. I did report my tax burden from Blockfi (that I believed I owed) based on my 1099-B form from 2021.

As many of you know, getting ahold of old transaction records from Blockfi now that they have gone bankrupt is nearly impossible. I ended up using [perplexity.ai](http://perplexity.ai) to scrub through the blockfi court case and find every single mention of the defense lawyers names present on the case. I then emailed every single one of those defense lawyers (to their personal email at their respective law firms) to ask for transaction records, 1099-Bs, or anything else they might have on them from the discovery process.

A very nice lady at Haynes Boone was able to send me a full CSV of my transaction history from 2021 to 2024. I was able to use this CSV to calculate my real, actual tax burden. I was also able to line up all my ACH deposits and withdrawals amounts and dates into and out of my personal bank account from the CSV.

After spending all night attempting to match transaction records with this CSV statement, not only did blockfi report interest income earned in stablecoins in 2022 that should've been reported in 2021, they reported transactions that, as far as I can tell, ***didn't exist.*** There is a $3499 transaction on my 1099-B that does ***not*** match up with any records anywhere else. And taken by itself, does not line up with the total ACH deposits and withdrawals from my bank account. Nor did my account have enough of a balance in it to earn $3499 in the form of a single interest payment at any given time.

So how much was my actual, short-term capital gain for those two years? $806. $309 for the year of 2021 (because Blockfi did not report my 2021 income correctly), and $497 for the year of 2022.

I now have to send off this 20+ page detailed explanation to the IRS Because Blockfi ***basically pulled transaction dates and values out of their ass.*** I now have a CSV file and matching banking records to prove my case. And I can make the argument that trading transactions converting one stablecoin to another were inappropriately categorized as income, and income earned in the form of stablecoins should be treated similar to bank account interest issued on a 1099-INT.

***This is Bullshit. Even if I HAD done everything right and reported to the IRS what I believed I owed based on my 2021 1099-B FROM THEM, it STILL would have been wrong.***

Are we sure this company was ""registered and regulated""? Because to me, it seems like an army of monkeys was doing the accounting and reporting.

  
EDIT: Apparently others have also received a CP2000 from the IRS. If this has happened to you, here is my suggestion: 



Your goal should be to find any possible records you have, anywhere, of business that you did with blockfi. This could include transfers of USD or crypto into your account from other exchanges/banks to prove your cost basis. This could include reaching out to the respective law firms involved in the case to obtain CSV files like I did. This could include digging through the trash to look for old 1099 forms. Or this could include simply explaining to the IRS how stable coins work, and how transactions into and out of them by their very nature are not capital gains. You need to show the IRS ***anything you can possibly come up with*** to prove your cost basis. If you have your transactions written on the back of a napkin from 2 years ago, send that in. You have nothing to lose."
Cloud Run to receive webhook from Stripe.com and send me an email,googlecloud,1i8vg3k,2025-01-24 08:32:11,2,0.67,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlecloud/comments/1i8vg3k/cloud_run_to_receive_webhook_from_stripecom_and/,SaltyyDoggg,,"Hi all, I’m trying to DIY & create a solution. 

Stripe offers customers to pay by ACH.  Stripe does not communicate this to the account owner and recommends use of webhooks to do so.  

Cloud Run looks cheap/free enough and with GPT I’m sure I can get the code to make a webhook service that can receive signals from Stripe (“customer has initiated an ACH transfer”).  

What I’m unclear about is how I will use Cloud Run to send an email notifying the email recipient that “customer ___ has initiated an ACH transfer.”

To my great lost love (sadly he did not respond),BreakUps,1i8tbkl,2025-01-24 06:29:24,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1i8tbkl/to_my_great_lost_love_sadly_he_did_not_respond/,CaterpillarFun9438,,"I don’t really know how to start this. The very act of trying to find the words feels too overwhelming, as if just making the effort is too much to bear. But every day, it scares me—this constant regret of all the things I never said, now lost forever, drifting away with every passing moment. I don’t know if I can make this right, but maybe I should at least try, just once. Maybe trying is the only way to find peace in all of this.

It’s taken me so long to even begin, let alone continue. Every day, I’ve watched myself avoid these feelings, these unsaid words. I’ve paused too many times writing, made too many excuses just to run away from the pain, from the truth that I need to do this—not just for you, but maybe for myself also. I can’t keep hiding from what I owe, to both you and me. It’s been hard, getting here, facing everything I’ve tried to avoid. But somehow, it feels right, in a way. To let myself be vulnerable again, to open this wound I created and tried to hide for so long. Maybe it’s not about healing—it’s about learning to live with what happened. Maybe this time, I can finally let myself face the truth without running.

My room feels darker than it truly is, lit only by the faint, flickering glow of my monitors. The hour has long passed, its midnight, and the cold has begun to run into my skin, going deep into my body as the night passes. I’m growing used to this feeling again—the routine of doing nothing, just sitting here, staring at these screens as if they hold the answer to the emptiness I’m trying to outrun. I’ve called off the search for my soul, I put them on hold again, telling myself its impossible, when in truth, I know I’ve just given up on finding it.

I feed myself with endless distractions, each one a momentary attempt to numb the pain inside, a way to escape the weight of what lingers beneath. They offer temporary relief—small bursts of satisfaction that fade almost as quickly as they arrive, leaving me empty again, like an empty room that refuses to be filled. And yet, I keep chasing them, as if one might finally make me forget, might silence these thoughts that has been creeping me, ones that burn like a fever, searing through me as if I’m burning alive. Thoughts about what’s really happening. Thoughts about what’s already happened.

The silence around me feels heavy, pressing down harder with every passing moment. It’s the kind of silence that amplifies everything I’m trying to escape. And though I know this cycle leads nowhere, I let it continue, because facing the truth feels harder than this endless loop of distractions.

It’s so late, isn’t it? I’ve lost track of time, but somehow, that doesn’t seem to matter anymore. The hours slip away without me even noticing. I feel like I’m drifting, lost, floating through these moments with no real direction. I wake up thinking of you, and when I fall asleep, it’s the same—your presence lingers in my mind, always there. Every thought is haunted by you, even when I try to push it away, as if you’re woven into the very fabric of my consciousness. How is it now that somehow you’re a stranger, but you were mine just yesterday? I don’t know how we got here, but it feels so different now. Everything has shifted, and I find myself standing in this strange, unfamiliar space, trying to remember what we once had. I don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t know how I ended up here, in this place of endless questioning. All I know is that somewhere, in the middle of all this confusion, I failed. I lost. And that’s the hardest part: admitting it to myself. It feels like the truth is something I can’t outrun, something I can’t hide from anymore, no matter how hard I try. It sits with me, heavy and undeniable. I’m afraid to say it aloud, but deep down, I know it’s true. I’ve failed, and I don’t know how to fix it. It feels too late, doesn’t it? Too late for anything to be what it should have been. Did I crossed the line?

I don’t blame you. You can’t save me. No one can, but myself. You were trying your best, trying to fill the gaps in the empty void within me. And I can’t imagine how much that must have taken from you. I see it now, in everything we’ve become. I mean, look at where we are now.

You took charge of something you were never supposed to, and that wasn’t fair to you. You’re just human, a precious being with your own emptiness to handle. I treated you like an extension of me, like something that could make me feel alive again, and that feels so wrong. It feels like I forced you to carry a burden that wasn’t yours to bear. And I hate myself for making you feel like that, for making you believe you were a failure, that you weren’t enough, that you were just a decoration. You were trying to fix something that was never meant to be fixed, because it wasn’t meant to be fixed by anyone else in the first place. It was my brokenness, my weight, and I made it yours.

It all makes sense now, doesn’t it? The way we fell apart, how the silence between us grew, how the distance stretched until it became an insurmountable divide. I should have let you be who you were, not something I could cling to in order to make myself feel whole. But now, in the quiet of these empty moments, I finally see that. I realize I failed to understand you, failed to see that you were struggling just like me—that you too got tired, got angry, became anxious, and overthought everything. I was too caught up in my own mind to truly listen to yours, and now I’m left wondering if I could have done something differently.

Could we have still been something, if I hadn’t acted the way I did? If I had been more patient, less selfish, maybe more understanding of your own battles? Or was this always the way it was meant to unfold? I keep asking myself these questions, replaying them over and over in my mind, but all I’m left with are doubts and regret. And the memories—always the memories—is the only thing that remains, the only thing that still holds the weight of what once was. It reminds me of everything I’ve lost, of every chance I took for granted. It's the only constant in this aftermath, the only piece of you that I can still hold on to. But even that feels like it's slipping away, like everything else I’ve lost in the wake of it all.

And now, my room feels emptier, in a way that’s hard to explain. It’s always been empty, but now, it’s as if something I once had here is gone. I don’t know what it is—it’s like a ghost, or maybe a memory, a presence that was here, but now it’s simply vanished. It started to fade months ago, little by little, like sunlight dimming behind thick clouds, the sky growing heavy, the clouds turning darker, and a storm quietly gathering on the horizon. And now, it’s completely gone. It’s like the feeling of you, of us, slipping through my fingers, like trying to hold onto sand that falls no matter how tightly I grip. I reach for it in the air, hoping some trace will remain, but it slips away, dissolving before I even understand what I’m losing. The air feels heavier, quieter, as if it’s closing in on me. Every small sound echoes longer in the silence, reminding me of how empty everything has become. I try to fill it with something—anything—but nothing stays. It feels like the silence itself is swallowing everything whole, taking everything with it. And yet, it’s not just the room. It’s me. I can feel myself emptying, piece by piece, the weight of missing you pulling everything else away, leaving only a fragment of me. I don’t know how to stop it, or if I even can.

I started doing things again—old habits I had forgotten about, things that used to come naturally. They all welcomed me back, as if they had been waiting for me, patiently holding space for my return. But there’s something off about it, something unsettling. I feel dissociated by these welcomes, like I’ve been pulled back here because I’ve done something wrong, something I can’t quite put my finger on. It’s strange to be in this place again, doing things I once did without a second thought. It feels familiar, but also foreign, like I don’t belong here anymore. I keep wondering if I missed something, if I did something wrong, if all of this—this emptiness, this disconnect—is somehow my fault. The thought lingers, heavy in the back of my mind, like a question I can’t answer but can’t stop asking.

The music means so much more to me now. It speaks in ways I never paid attention to before. It’s like you gave me a warning, a foreshadowing I couldn’t hear then. You planted those seeds, and now, I remember the songs we shared—the ones I used to listen to without thinking deeper. Now, they tell me everything. They hold meanings I was too blind to see, messages I should have heard before but didn’t. It’s like each note carries the weight of everything unsaid, the beauty of your subtleties and unspoken truth. It’s as though I can hear the echoes of your soul in every song, the way our hearts are quietly pierced through by something from the melody of our past, leaving a wound that never fully heals—a cut that always bleeds.

I didn’t pay attention to the lyrics back then, the subtle words you left me, the quiet signs you showed me. You were tired, weren’t you? You told me more than I ever realized—through your words, through your actions, through everything. But I only focused on the beat, on the sound, on the noise. I was so caught up in my emotions, my insecurities, and my own self-centeredness. I didn’t see what you were trying to say, not fully. And now, those lyrics have become truths I can’t ignore. They haunt with your pain, your weariness, and the love you tried so hard to hold on. It’s a love that I only now realize was never truly mine to claim, yet it was a gift I could have treasured. And in my ignorance, they all faded away.

Sometimes, I sit and wonder what it must have felt like for you—to carry that weight alone, to leave quiet signs in the hope that I’d notice, only to see me stumble blindly past them. Now, carrying the heavy longing in my arms, I feel the weight of everything I didn’t see, everything I didn’t understand. It feels heavier than I ever thought possible, pressing down on me with the realization of what you must have endured. I didn’t know that I had it all, and nobody warned me before the fall. And I’m wasted. I wish you didn’t leave, I just needed a wake-up call. And now I’m facing the greatest loss of them all.

But trying to see from both perspectives, I understand the gravity of everything. I realize how beautiful things were, how beautiful they could’ve been, for both of us. The moments we shared, the connection we had, everything—so much of it was real. But it feels like too much time has passed. Too much has been lost for it to ever be what it should have been.

What if I had understood then, had seen the depth of your silent struggles? Could I have done something differently? Could I have spared myself from this weight of regret? It’s a question I will never know the answer to, a path that has disappeared behind me, a place lost in time—where I once saw you, where you, my loved one, stayed. to a place I can no longer go back to.

And I just find myself crying without warning—no reason, just tears. It’s the music. The songs we both listened to, or the ones you played. I can’t help it—they pull me back, tugging at threads I thought I had buried. They bring up everything: the memories, the moments, the pain, the love. Each note feels like a doorway, opening to a place where I still thought there was time, where we still believed that what we had could last. It’s like the music keeps us alive, even when you’re not here anymore. And In some moments, I think of you when I am sad and down, when the silence makes me cry, when it’s hard to try, and all I can do is simply fall back into you. Those songs remind me of the pieces of us still scattered in the corners of my heart, and I can’t help but let myself be pulled into them, pulled back to you.

I’ve placed so many emotions in the lyrics of the songs we listened to, each one wrapped in memories that refuses to fade. The regret, the longing, the guilt—they all live in those songs now, stitched into every melody. They’ve become a part of me, just as you are. And when I hear them, it feels like I’m hearing you again, like your voice is hiding between the chords, calling me back to something I’ll never touch again. A glimpse of us—not the us we are now, the one distant and separated by time. The us from before, when everything felt possible. When everything felt more safer, and the world was full of promise, and we could pretend that nothing could ever tear us apart. That version of us feels more closer when the music plays, as if I could be there again, if only I could reach far enough, but the distance between now and then is too vast, too final. The past, once vivid, is fading into a place I can’t revisit, a place where you still held my hand and we still believed in something worthwhile. A place where no storm could break us, that time would be kind to us. But now, all that’s left are fragments, memories wrapped in a melancholic tone that plays on, reminding me of who we were—of who I thought we’d always be. And every note brings me back, just for a moment, before reality pulls me further away, leaving me with nothing but the silence after the song ends.

I wish I could go back, even for just a moment, to hear you sing those songs again, to feel the way your voice carried emotions I never fully understood—how every note told a story, every lyric a piece of your soul. We were doing nothing, yet it felt like everything, as if our souls were trying to speak to each other without a single word. I long to see us again, together, lost in the music, wrapped in the warmth of the moment, before everything began to slip away.

I cherish what we had, even though it hurts, and the weight of it sometimes feels unbearable. I relive the good moments over and over, clinging to them like lifelines, but they only make the ache sharper. I fight the guilt that always seems to follow me—the regret of what I did, what I didn’t do, and all the ways I fell short. It’s a battle I’m slowly losing, as if every memory chips away at me, piece by piece.

I hate myself for how it ended. I hate myself for the words left unsaid and the ones I shouldn’t have spoken. For the times I let you down when all I wanted was to hold us together. I miss you so much that some days it feels impossible to breathe, like the world is caving in around me. Knowing I can’t turn back time, that I can’t rewrite what’s already written.

Every tear I shed feels like a reminder of what I’ve lost, of the emptiness that’s taking place. And every time I cry, I wonder if it will ever stop— …"
To my great lost love,offmychest,1i8spql,2025-01-24 05:47:54,6,0.88,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i8spql/to_my_great_lost_love/,CaterpillarFun9438,,"I don’t really know how to start this. The very act of trying to find the words feels too overwhelming, as if just making the effort is too much to bear. But every day, it scares me—this constant regret of all the things I never said, now lost forever, drifting away with every passing moment. I don’t know if I can make this right, but maybe I should at least try, just once. Maybe trying is the only way to find peace in all of this.

It’s taken me so long to even begin, let alone continue. Every day, I’ve watched myself avoid these feelings, these unsaid words. I’ve paused too many times writing, made too many excuses just to run away from the pain, from the truth that I need to do this—not just for you, but maybe for myself also. I can’t keep hiding from what I owe, to both you and me. It’s been hard, getting here, facing everything I’ve tried to avoid. But somehow, it feels right, in a way. To let myself be vulnerable again, to open this wound I created and tried to hide for so long. Maybe it’s not about healing—it’s about learning to live with what happened. Maybe this time, I can finally let myself face the truth without running.

My room feels darker than it truly is, lit only by the faint, flickering glow of my monitors. The hour has long passed, its midnight, and the cold has begun to run into my skin, going deep into my body as the night passes. I’m growing used to this feeling again—the routine of doing nothing, just sitting here, staring at these screens as if they hold the answer to the emptiness I’m trying to outrun. I’ve called off the search for my soul, I put them on hold again, telling myself its impossible, when in truth, I know I’ve just given up on finding it.

I feed myself with endless distractions, each one a momentary attempt to numb the pain inside, a way to escape the weight of what lingers beneath. They offer temporary relief—small bursts of satisfaction that fade almost as quickly as they arrive, leaving me empty again, like an empty room that refuses to be filled. And yet, I keep chasing them, as if one might finally make me forget, might silence these thoughts that has been creeping me, ones that burn like a fever, searing through me as if I’m burning alive. Thoughts about what’s really happening. Thoughts about what’s already happened.

The silence around me feels heavy, pressing down harder with every passing moment. It’s the kind of silence that amplifies everything I’m trying to escape. And though I know this cycle leads nowhere, I let it continue, because facing the truth feels harder than this endless loop of distractions.

It’s so late, isn’t it? I’ve lost track of time, but somehow, that doesn’t seem to matter anymore. The hours slip away without me even noticing. I feel like I’m drifting, lost, floating through these moments with no real direction. I wake up thinking of you, and when I fall asleep, it’s the same—your presence lingers in my mind, always there. Every thought is haunted by you, even when I try to push it away, as if you’re woven into the very fabric of my consciousness. How is it now that somehow you’re a stranger, but you were mine just yesterday? I don’t know how we got here, but it feels so different now. Everything has shifted, and I find myself standing in this strange, unfamiliar space, trying to remember what we once had. I don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t know how I ended up here, in this place of endless questioning. All I know is that somewhere, in the middle of all this confusion, I failed. I lost. And that’s the hardest part: admitting it to myself. It feels like the truth is something I can’t outrun, something I can’t hide from anymore, no matter how hard I try. It sits with me, heavy and undeniable. I’m afraid to say it aloud, but deep down, I know it’s true. I’ve failed, and I don’t know how to fix it. It feels too late, doesn’t it? Too late for anything to be what it should have been. Did I crossed the line?

I don’t blame you. You can’t save me. No one can, but myself. You were trying your best, trying to fill the gaps in the empty void within me. And I can’t imagine how much that must have taken from you. I see it now, in everything we’ve become. I mean, look at where we are now.

You took charge of something you were never supposed to, and that wasn’t fair to you. You’re just human, a precious being with your own emptiness to handle. I treated you like an extension of me, like something that could make me feel alive again, and that feels so wrong. It feels like I forced you to carry a burden that wasn’t yours to bear. And I hate myself for making you feel like that, for making you believe you were a failure, that you weren’t enough, that you were just a decoration. You were trying to fix something that was never meant to be fixed, because it wasn’t meant to be fixed by anyone else in the first place. It was my brokenness, my weight, and I made it yours.

It all makes sense now, doesn’t it? The way we fell apart, how the silence between us grew, how the distance stretched until it became an insurmountable divide. I should have let you be who you were, not something I could cling to in order to make myself feel whole. But now, in the quiet of these empty moments, I finally see that. I realize I failed to understand you, failed to see that you were struggling just like me—that you too got tired, got angry, became anxious, and overthought everything. I was too caught up in my own mind to truly listen to yours, and now I’m left wondering if I could have done something differently.

Could we have still been something, if I hadn’t acted the way I did? If I had been more patient, less selfish, maybe more understanding of your own battles? Or was this always the way it was meant to unfold? I keep asking myself these questions, replaying them over and over in my mind, but all I’m left with are doubts and regret. And the memories—always the memories—is the only thing that remains, the only thing that still holds the weight of what once was. It reminds me of everything I’ve lost, of every chance I took for granted. It's the only constant in this aftermath, the only piece of you that I can still hold on to. But even that feels like it's slipping away, like everything else I’ve lost in the wake of it all.

And now, my room feels emptier, in a way that’s hard to explain. It’s always been empty, but now, it’s as if something I once had here is gone. I don’t know what it is—it’s like a ghost, or maybe a memory, a presence that was here, but now it’s simply vanished. It started to fade months ago, little by little, like sunlight dimming behind thick clouds, the sky growing heavy, the clouds turning darker, and a storm quietly gathering on the horizon. And now, it’s completely gone. It’s like the feeling of you, of us, slipping through my fingers, like trying to hold onto sand that falls no matter how tightly I grip. I reach for it in the air, hoping some trace will remain, but it slips away, dissolving before I even understand what I’m losing. The air feels heavier, quieter, as if it’s closing in on me. Every small sound echoes longer in the silence, reminding me of how empty everything has become. I try to fill it with something—anything—but nothing stays. It feels like the silence itself is swallowing everything whole, taking everything with it. And yet, it’s not just the room. It’s me. I can feel myself emptying, piece by piece, the weight of missing you pulling everything else away, leaving only a fragment of me. I don’t know how to stop it, or if I even can.

I started doing things again—old habits I had forgotten about, things that used to come naturally. They all welcomed me back, as if they had been waiting for me, patiently holding space for my return. But there’s something off about it, something unsettling. I feel dissociated by these welcomes, like I’ve been pulled back here because I’ve done something wrong, something I can’t quite put my finger on. It’s strange to be in this place again, doing things I once did without a second thought. It feels familiar, but also foreign, like I don’t belong here anymore. I keep wondering if I missed something, if I did something wrong, if all of this—this emptiness, this disconnect—is somehow my fault. The thought lingers, heavy in the back of my mind, like a question I can’t answer but can’t stop asking.

The music means so much more to me now. It speaks in ways I never paid attention to before. It’s like you gave me a warning, a foreshadowing I couldn’t hear then. You planted those seeds, and now, I remember the songs we shared—the ones I used to listen to without thinking deeper. Now, they tell me everything. They hold meanings I was too blind to see, messages I should have heard before but didn’t. It’s like each note carries the weight of everything unsaid, the beauty of your subtleties and unspoken truth. It’s as though I can hear the echoes of your soul in every song, the way our hearts are quietly pierced through by something from the melody of our past, leaving a wound that never fully heals—a cut that always bleeds.

I didn’t pay attention to the lyrics back then, the subtle words you left me, the quiet signs you showed me. You were tired, weren’t you? You told me more than I ever realized—through your words, through your actions, through everything. But I only focused on the beat, on the sound, on the noise. I was so caught up in my emotions, my insecurities, and my own self-centeredness. I didn’t see what you were trying to say, not fully. And now, those lyrics have become truths I can’t ignore. They haunt with your pain, your weariness, and the love you tried so hard to hold on. It’s a love that I only now realize was never truly mine to claim, yet it was a gift I could have treasured. And in my ignorance, they all faded away.

Sometimes, I sit and wonder what it must have felt like for you—to carry that weight alone, to leave quiet signs in the hope that I’d notice, only to see me stumble blindly past them. Now, carrying the heavy longing in my arms, I feel the weight of everything I didn’t see, everything I didn’t understand. It feels heavier than I ever thought possible, pressing down on me with the realization of what you must have endured. I didn’t know that I had it all, and nobody warned me before the fall. And I’m wasted. I wish you didn’t leave, I just needed a wake-up call. And now I’m facing the greatest loss of them all.

But trying to see from both perspectives, I understand the gravity of everything. I realize how beautiful things were, how beautiful they could’ve been, for both of us. The moments we shared, the connection we had, everything—so much of it was real. But it feels like too much time has passed. Too much has been lost for it to ever be what it should have been.

What if I had understood then, had seen the depth of your silent struggles? Could I have done something differently? Could I have spared myself from this weight of regret? It’s a question I will never know the answer to, a path that has disappeared behind me, a place lost in time—where I once saw you, where you, my loved one, stayed. to a place I can no longer go back to.

In a new country and I think I am in a flair. I’m terrified.,MultipleSclerosis,1i8rvqj,2025-01-24 04:46:50,37,0.97,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/1i8rvqj/in_a_new_country_and_i_think_i_am_in_a_flair_im/,Slayorwhateva,Advice,"Hi all! 

I(20F) just moved to Wales for a semester abroad from Canada. I haven’t been in a flair for over two years. I have RRMS. I am on a DMT I get every 6 months so I was planning on flying home to get it while I’m over seas. Anyway, I went to Paris to solo travel last week and I pushed my body way too hard. I stayed in a hostel, barely slept, and went on a crazy night out. I smoked cigarettes, and I drank my body weight in wine and cocktails. It’s like when I was in Paris I totally forgot I had MS. I acted like a regular 20 year old on vacation, and treated my body like it could handle that. 

Now, I am in my dorm in Wales on my death bed. I have pink eye, sore throat, pounding head ache, weakness, fatigue, brain fog. Old symptoms like numb legs and hands are coming back. I am definitely in a flare. And I am definitely sick. It’s very bad. I called my neurologist and she said either come back and get treatment back in Canada or go to the hospital here and get treatment. I have travel insurance, but it will still cost a good amount. 

I feel so dumb. I totally messed up and I am now paying the price. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and not only has my MS ruined it for me, but my own actions. I’m heartbroken. I couldn’t really afford to be here and am using my scholarship money and years of savings to be here. It’s like it’s all down the drain for one week of fun in Paris. I want to go out and meet people but I’m stuck in bed disgustingly sick, and crying. Im heartbroken. I feel so defeated and I just want to curl up and ignore life.

"Years of chronic head fogginess, dizziness, daytime hypersomnia, insomnia, and still no diagnosis or treatment in sight.",AskDocs,1i8qfn5,2025-01-24 02:54:18,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1i8qfn5/years_of_chronic_head_fogginess_dizziness_daytime/,ziggysmoonage,,"I can't remember exactly when my symptoms started, but I confidently know they date back to at least 2018. They've gradually been worsening, now to the point of being debilitating, and doctor after doctor has left me feeling disheartened. Recently I've been very extremely symptomatic and miserable and completely hopeless in regard to finding a diagnosis and treatment. It's only getting worse by the day.

In this post, I am going to lay out every bit of information about my affliction that I think could be remotely useful in understanding it. And know, it's A LOT.  Medicine is pattern recognition, and so far none of my medical professionals have had any ideas as to what it could be. If anybody could provide advice as to what it might be, what diagnoses I should look into, or what tests I should bring up with my doctor next, please let me know. I'm so tired of running around to specialists, running out of money because of the medical expenses, and only rapidly getting worse as I wait months for appointment after appointment. I just want any ounce of help or advice that I can receive. 

I list these things in this order:

Overview of my symptoms

Steps toward a diagnosis

Extra notes

20TM (AFAB) 5'4"", 118 pounds. The only medication I currently take is weekly intramuscular injections of 0.5 mL of Testosterone (started Nov. 2023). I'd say that I eat well, three balanced meals a day, I drink PLENTY of water, I don't drink alcohol or smoke, and I don't work-out consistently but I do like to keep on my feet and I enjoy going on walks/bike riding. I don't consider myself to be a stressed or anxious person by any means. I'm very mentally sound and very inherently content and at peace.

**Overview of my symptoms:**

Every day, I experience what I call ""head fog"". It is a state of extreme discomfort in my head. I might even refer to it as ""tension."" It feels like it's originating in the back of my head at the base of my skull, and it extends to the rest of the inside of my head. In a more metaphorical sense, it feels like my mind is becoming hazy and cloudy. It causes difficulty concentrating and often can coincide with dizziness, unprecedented depressive episodes, episodes of extreme tiredness in which I sometimes fall asleep wherever I am, and episodes of insomnia in which I cannot fall asleep. I do NOT get headaches or much associated PAIN. It's almost always some sort of discomfort, which is really not any better than pain. 

Nowadays, the head fog occurs nearly every waking moment, getting better and worse throughout the day, but rarely ever fully relieving. If it does relieve, it's only very brief. It used to only be episodes, but throughout the years the episodes got more frequent, stronger, lasted longer, and I've developed many more symptoms that associate themselves with the head fog, particularly in October of 2024 and moving into 2025. I've drastically changed my own lifestyle over the years to accommodate not doing things that exacerbate the symptoms. 

**Symptoms:**

**""Head Fog"":** The head fog is the typical symptom. Usually, the other symptoms present themselves as the head fog worsens and becomes more uncomfortable, although recently many of the symptoms have been present without the head fog. As I said, it's a physical discomfort that coincides with difficulty concentrating. It can sometimes get bad enough that it feels like my brain is under the pressure of 100 rubber bands. It can make me unable to think clearly, dizzy, uncoordinated, and confused.

**Dizziness:** Usually occurs when the head fog worsens. I've been asked before ""What kind of dizziness: Spinning dizziness, light-headed dizziness, or disoriented dizziness?"" The completely honest answer is that I experience all three at different times, and throughout the years have unintentionally attributed my own names to each type. When I am ""dizzy"" it will feel as though the room is spinning around me. When I am ""woozy"", I'm completely uncoordinated and wobbly and I become very clumsy, oftentimes even becoming unable to hold myself upright. When I am ""light headed"", it feels very similar to blood-loss symptoms. I've become very light-headed from blood loss before, and with my affliction, I experience that exact same light-headedness at times. 

**Aching in neck and shoulders:** Aching sometimes occurs; it is usually only mild and occurs in my neck and shoulder muscles. Sometimes I also feel discomfort in my spine and find it difficult to find a comfortable posture. Because of my symptoms over the years, I've developed pretty healthy posture, so I would be hesitant to attribute these aches to posture. 

**Abrupt tiredness/inability to stay awake:** I can become unable to stay awake. I've had moments while driving of needing to pull over and rest because I could not stay awake. I've fallen asleep while sitting upright. I've fallen asleep in parking lots in my car, on my bathroom floor, on the floor at several other people's houses, etc. I don't necessarily fall over, but I will become so exhausted that I can only think ""I'm just going to lay down for a moment."" and I will fall asleep on the floor. I've experienced this regardless of how much sleep I got the night before. Sometimes, I will quickly become abruptly exhausted directly after waking up from a full night's rest. It does not feel the same as sleep deprivation. It is much more intense and sudden and forces me to sleep in a way that I don't experience even when I am sleep deprived. In a way, regular tiredness feels as though my brain is gently asking for rest, even when I've gone a long while without sleeping– whereas this abrupt tiredness feels as though my brain is completely seizing on me and is shutting down. 

**Insomnia:** I have a very consistent bedtime routine (particularly because using my phone in bed has always exacerbated my symptoms). I do not lay down in my bed unless I have intention to immediately sleep, and I do not use my phone in my bed. Because of my precise routine, under normal circumstances, I fall asleep within minutes of tucking myself in. However, often when my head is foggy and I can feel the tension in my head and my neck, I become incapable of sleeping. Laying down feels uncomfortable in my neck, and if I do manage to start to drift to sleep, I will abruptly snap back awake. I often get stuck in this state of drifting and snapping back awake and being very extremely dizzy for hours on end. The only way I've found to relieve this is to get up out of bed and move around. I'll get out of bed and move my shoulders around. Sometimes it takes hours for the insomniatic symptom to relieve and I'll spend that time doing chores or working on projects in the dead of night– and sometimes just getting up and moving my shoulders clears it enough for me to go right back to sleep properly. This symptom is always associated with a discomfort– a tension– in my head, so I often know when I'm not going to be able to sleep. Unfortunately, sometimes this symptom coincides with my inability to keep myself upright, so I will lay down and be very uncomfortable but unable to do anything about it for hours.

**Muscle weakness:** This is a new symptom only recently developed as the problem rapidly worsened in 2024. In tandem with head fog, I can often experience muscle weakness. It frequently gets bad enough that I can hardly lift something as light as my phone. It particularly affects my arms, and it makes my biceps feel uncomfortable and ""tickly"" when I try to lift something. 

**Pressure behind my right eye:** When the head fog worsens, it can coincide with a feeling of extreme pressure behind my right eye. It has only ever been my right eye.

**Unprecedented depressive episodes:** I've not ever struggled with my mental health outside of when I am severely symptomatic. For several years, these episodes happened when the head fog, dizziness, and discomfort in my neck and shoulder was severe. I would suddenly become very panicked and upset in a way that is unnatural for me. It would sometimes cause me to sob, though it seemed that the way in which I contract the muscles in my neck when I sobbed brought some relief to all of the symptoms. In 2024, I had an episode one evening that lasted until the next evening in which I experienced a depressive episode like I've never felt before. I've never struggled with mental health afflictions, so when I suddenly experienced an intensely abnormal and severe depressive episode, I searched for a cause. None of my typical problem solving and self-soothing worked as it ought to have. In the midst of doing so, I became too foggy-headed and dizzy to communicate with my loved ones who were helping me pin-point a cause for how I was feeling, and I began to panic. Massages have been known to help relieve my head fog, so to relieve the head fog and dizziness, my dad massaged my neck. Not only did it immediately relieve the head fog, but the depressive feeling that had been severe for almost 24 hours instantly was relieved at the same time. This was a shock to me, as I hadn't realized until then that the mental anguish was related to my head problems. I have not had as severe an episode since that one, but a similar depressive feeling now often resurfaces in association with the other symptoms and relieves itself with the other symptoms. 

**Significant crackling/popping in ears:** This is a new symptom as of 2024. It seems to occur most often when the other symptoms are starting to relieve. Movement in my throat elicits crackling and popping in both of my ears, especially the right one. The crackling sounds like cracking a glowstick. The popping is much louder and can be heard outside of my own head. I've had several people telling me they can hear it. The popping is associated with a physical feeling in the inner-ear area, towards my throat. It feels like something is flicking or moving deep within my ear. 

**Unbalanced/Clumsiness:** As of recently, walking and keeping my balance can become much more difficult when I am foggy headed, and I can become very clumsy. When I am foggy, I often stagger or have to catch myself from falling. I also find myself bumping into things, dropping things, and knocking things over more often. I sometimes can't walk or have to hold onto things to walk myself short distances. 

**Urination hesitancy:** The more severe the head fog is, the more I have to concentrate on peeing. I don't experience any hesitancy or struggle to pee when I'm not symptomatic. If I'm very foggy headed, it can take minutes before I'm able to pee and requires extreme concentration. I am not sexually active and cannot have an STI.

**Difficulty talking:** Along with head fog, I now often have episodes of finding it extremely difficult to communicate and talk. I end up responding exclusively with “mhm”s. This can often be relieved very instantly with other symptoms with a neck and shoulder massage. 

**Itchiness/tingling:** I've started experiencing itchiness on various parts of my body, often my upper arms and back, that feels as though it's under my skin and I cannot scratch it. It most often happens when the other symptoms are worse. I sometimes experience random tingling in various parts of my body, particularly in my left foot, upper arms, fingers, and lips. 

**Inability to cry:** Similar to the urination hesitancy, I find myself unable to cry when I am symptomatic. No matter how upset I become or how much I dry sob, I can't seem to produce tears. It's been very emotionally taxing, as I find crying to be very cathartic. 

**Delirious episodes:** I get episodes wherein I am, in a way, struggling between consciousness and unconsciousness. Usually, what happens is I will lay down because I am foggy and dizzy, and I will start to feel that the room is spinning around me. I won't be able to sleep, but I also won't be able to get myself back up. I'll stay tossing and turning and writhing for hours on end. I'll feel pretty awful mentally, I'll become delirious and not fully coherent, and the time seems to pass very strangely quickly. Often, this coincides with muscle weakness, so if I try to get myself up, I simply fall back over. 

**Exacerbators (that worsen the symptoms)**

What exacerbates/relieves the symptoms is so inconsistent, it's difficult to note it precisely. But these things I've found to be at least somewhat consistent:

**Looking down:** This is the most immediate, obvious, and consistent exacerbator. Looking down for even a moment will immediately make me very foggy headed and symptomatic. This has heavily impacted my lifestyle. I've been holding my phone up in front of my face to look at it since 2019. I can't look down at things on desks, such as classwork, writings, books, drawings, paintings, etc. This makes class hell. I've had several exams recently that I became so foggy trying to look down at the paper that I nearly fell asleep. I ended up bringing a clipboard with me to my classes to keep my work upright. I have to keep everything I do upright. I've only been able to read, write, and draw all of these years by keeping things upright.

**Rolling the shoulders forward:** I suspect that the position of my shoulders exacerbates my symptoms. For instance, typing on my phone (even with it in front of my face), driving, typing, reading, painting, drawing, sweeping/mopping/cleaning, all of these things involve using my shoulder muscles with my arms forward, and they all can worsen my symptoms no matter how upright the activity is. 

**Keeping my head fixed:** No matter what position, it seems, keeping my head, neck, and shoulders in a fixed position for a prolonged period of time exacerbates the symptoms. Watching a movie is very difficult to do without becoming foggy.

**Slouching:** If I don't keep very upright posture, I will become foggy. Of course, I've had decent posture for years now and still struggle. But slouching will immediately make the symptoms WORSE than they already are. 

**Laying on my back:** I can't lay on my back without getting dizzy. It's extremely uncomfortable for me. I can only sleep on my sides. 

**Laying down:** SOMETIMES laying down worsens the symptoms. For years, it seemed that relaxing and laying down were the things that worsened my symptoms. Nowadays, as of 2024, it seems to have flipped and now more often I am forced to lay down and I become a lot clearer in my head the moment I lay down.

**Using my phone while laying down:** Along the lines of rolling the shoulder forward, I've not been able to use my phone while laying down for so many years now without becoming very symptomatic and uncomfortable. Hence why my bedtime routine is so precise and I fall asleep so quickly. 

**Sleeping in:** Whenever I slept for too long (more than 9 hours), I would wake up with head-fog, stiff and aching neck and shoulders, and I would quickly develop the abrupt tiredness. I would be foggy-headed and achy for the rest of the day. I don't sleep in like that anymore, but I will start to feel these symptoms if I stay in bed for too long.

**Sleeping**: Recently it's seemed that SOMETIMES, the further away from sleeping I get, the less symptomatic I get. I'll often feel the least symptomatic in the dead of night, a long while after I woke up in the morning, after having been symptomatic all day. This is not entirely consistent, though. 

**Sleeping through my alarms:** SOMETIMES it seems helpful to me to wake up to the first alarm rather than sleeping through several alarms. I suspect that something about snoozing my alarms causes me to tense up and roll over in my sleep, and this tension causes me to wake up with head fog and dizziness. 

**Relievers (that help to relieve the symptoms):**

**Moving:** Before 2024, it was very consistent that my symptoms were much worse on days that I was not very active. I'd found that my symptoms would be much lighter when I woke up in the morning and hopped out of bed for commitments rather than slowly rising and lounging at home. It sometimes seems that moving around and being active helps nowadays. When I'm symptomatic, sometimes I'll go run an errand and it will help. Other times, this makes things worse. When I get foggy headed at my computer desk, sometimes the simple act of getting up to make myself some tea helps to relieve my symptoms. On occasion I found dancing to help relieve my symptoms. In the summer of 2019, I remember I would wake up foggy headed and I would play a standing video game on the VR headset that involves quite a bit of physical excursion of the arms in order to help clear my head. 

**Moving my throat muscles:** Talking, laughing, dry-sobbing, chewing/swallowing– these things all seem to be relievers. On a day that I was experiencing very bad head fog, I tried to relieve it by going to the gym. It wasn't a relief whatsoever, but talking to my friend on the phone afterwards brought me lots of immediate relief. 

**Neck/shoulder massage:** These massages bring the most IMMEDIATE and noticeable relief. My dad, my sister, and my physical therapists have all brought me relief with massages. The most relief comes from massaging below my ears, on my jaw, my temples, the base of my skull, the sides of my neck, and the tops of my shoulders. Sometimes the relief these massages brings lasts for hours. Other times, my head will clear during the massage but then become instantly symptomatic again after the massage. Sometimes it clears my symptoms tremendously, while other times it clears them just a little. Either way, these massages consistently change my symptoms immediately. There have been several times that I became incapable of talking because I was so symptomatic, to which my sister offered to massage my neck, and I instantly was able to start talking again. 

**Release:** The physical therapist managed ONE TIME to do a release on my neck at the base of my skull that brought me tremendous mental clarity for just a few hours. But a few hours of clarity is significantly more clarity than I've had in years. She has not been able to repeat that since. There have been a few times that the releases have CAUSED dizziness rather than relieved it. There is instant relief when my head is tugged, I presume from releasing pressure. But the moment it is let go again, the symptoms come right back just as before, if not worse than before.

**Hot drinks:** I recently discovered that hot drinks help relieve the symptoms slightly. I often drink hot tea to help my head. 

**Laying down:** Although laying down used to seem to make my symptoms worse, as of recently, it seems that I gain a lot more clarity from laying down. Recently I had a few occasions where I layed down on my left side, felt my sinuses clear, and my head suddenly became much clearer. When I wake up now, I often feel much worse after getting out of bed. 

**Pressing down on the top of my head:** If I press on the top of my head, I feel a slight relief in my symptoms, which only come right back after I let go. 

**Steps toward diagnosing the problem:**

I've seen so many doctors throughout the years. I've done many tests. Still, I haven't found an answer. I've wasted a lot of doctor's visits for the doctor to tell me things like ""It's general anxiety."" or ""You just need to get some rest."" and similar such phrases to brush off my affliction and then charge me.

**Pediatrician:** When I was about 14, I would get consistent headaches. The pediatrician told me to stop looking down at my phone so much. I listened, and the headaches went away. I've been holding my phone up to my face ever since. I don't get headaches anymore. 

**GP prescribed cyclobenzaprine:** They did not help. They just made me tired.

**GP did lab work:** I can't remember the exact labs. It was for the standard things, like vitamins and whatnot. They all looked normal. This ruled out that I might be anemic or vitamin deficient. 

**Chiropractor 1:** The first chiropractor was doing adjustments on my spine every week with the gun-tool-thing. It changed nothing. They kept having me come back and pay for adjustments without any clear goal. I stopped going to them. They had, at one point, used a machine that detected the heat along my spine and found that my neck area was the hottest. 

**Chiropractor 2:** The second chiropractor was much more honest with me. They tried adjustments on my spine, and told me that if it was a spinal fluid issue, I would've felt relief from the adjustments. I never felt relief. They tried cracking my neck with their hands, and still, I did not feel relief. They eventually said that my problem was not one that they would be able to solve and referred me to a neurologist.

**Neurologist 1:** 

EEG: Came back normal

MRI of the brain and cervical spine W/WO contrast: 

* No acute infarct is seen on diffusion weighted images
* Bilateral basal ganglia and thalami are unremarkable
* Corpus callosum, sellar and suprasellar regions, and skull base are normal
* No midline shift, no acute intracerebral hemorrhage
* Posterior fossa, brainstem and cerebellum are unremarkable. Skull base arteries demonstrate normal flow void.
* No abnormal enhancement is seen following administration of contrast.
* Images are compromised due to ferromagnetic susceptibility artifact emanated from the braces (This is referring to the hooks on my teeth for my Invisalign)
* Impression: NORMAL MRI BRAIN

So, I was sent back to my GP.

**Second GP:** My regular GP shrugged when I went back to ask where to go next. So, I tried seeing another GP for a second opinion of where to go next but was told my problem was general anxiety (I do not have anxiety and for several reasons that you can discern in my list of symptoms, that is NOT even remotely the problem). He told me to do stretches when I wake up in the morning and nearly sent me away without any more advice. I insisted and asked if the stretches didn't work, where should I go from there. He said he could write me a referral for physical therapy, which I insisted he go ahead and write for me. I took the referral and did not return to that doctor.

**Physical therapy:** I did consistent weekly visits with them for a few months. Their work would sometimes elicit brief, temporary fluctuations in the symptoms, particularly the releases on my neck at the base of my skull, but did not result in any long-term relief. I experienced more relief getting neck massages at home. I stopped going after a few months.

**ER:** I became so severely symptomatic and dysfunctional and concerned for the health of my brain that I went to a walk-in clinic. They told me that none of the tests they had would be of any more help to me, and if I couldn't go about my day normally, I should go to the ER. I certainly could not function normally, so I went to the ER. 

* Basic metabolic panel was normal
* Head CT W/WO contrast was normal

They referred me to see another neurologist.

**CTA Neck W/WO contrast:** After reading my symptom list, my original GP ordered a CTA in the meantime

* No hemodynamically significant abnormality in the neck arteries
* Incidental right lobe thyroid nodule, recommend ultrasound correlation

**Neurologist 2:** The second neurologist read through this list and considered it. 

* He ran a test involving asking me questions, having me do mental math, and testing the resistance of my hands. This test came back normal. 
* Was unconcerned about the thyroid nodule previously mentioned.
* Asked if it could be an environmental factor, which we ruled out very confidently
* Said it is not a neurological problem, and referred me to both an ENT and ordered a sleep study

**ENT:** 

* Checked my hearing, said my hearing is great.
* Did neurodiagnostic testing: I haven't gotten the results back, but none of the tests they did caused symptoms, which seems to be what they were monitoring. 

**Sleep study:** 

* Has yet to happen, but I get a feeling it could reveal SOMETHING. 

**Notes:**

I spoke with a family friend who is a sleep doctor and he was very intrigued to hear about my symptoms. He felt that a sleep study is the right move. He also asked me a question I'd never been asked before and that I was extremely shocked to hear, ""Do you ever get hallucinations when you first wake up?"" I was shocked to have this asked of me because, yes, I do often get visual hallucinations when I first wake up. I get them especially badly when I'm symptomatic. I never once considered these hallucinations to be part of my affliction. I had only just realized before he asked me that question that hallucinations like that were abnormal. I also have had visual hallucinations when I become symptomatic while driving and I am struggling to keep myself awake. I've had times where I hallucinated a car driving in front of me that wasn't there at all. I also get audio hallucinations when I am symptomatic, particularly when I am delirious, dizzy, and confused. I just recently had an instance of being very dizzy and confused and hearing knocking and I struggled to discern if it was at my door or in my head. 

I suspect that I struggle with sleep apnea. I don't think that I snore, but I do think that I stop breathing in my sleep. I also know that I clench my jaw very hard in my sleep, and I've not been able to stop doing so. I tried a retainer that's meant to help with clenching/grinding many years ago, around 2018 or 2019 I think, but it did not help. I just clenched down onto it. 

I've discussed these things with doctors, but we've certainly ruled out things like: Environmental factors, how many hours of sleep I get, what I'm eating, stress, allergies.

I obviously have been symptomatic for far longer than I've been taking testosterone weekly. I don't suspect that my symptoms are being exacerbated by the testosterone because my symptoms had been exponentially worsening for years before I started on testosterone, and the rate didn't seem to change when I started taking it. I took careful note if there were fluctuations in my symptoms before and after each weekly injection because I was very worried about how it would react with my head problems, but I never noticed a correlation. The second neurologist considered that testosterone thickens the veins and so thought about ordering an MRV, but decided not to order it after considering my age (20) and small likelihood of that being the cause.

I hear 'narcolepsy' proposed very frequently. 

  
The only head trauma I ever experienced was when I was 3-years-old. I hit the back of my head on the edge of a brick and it resulted in stitches. Other than that, I've not experienced physical trauma or car accidents that could have been the catalyst of my symptoms. 

**End Note:**

Any bit of advice in regard to anything I've said is appreciated. I don't expect Reddit to diagnose me. I just feel pretty helpless. I keep getting more and more miserable with my symptoms, I keep wasting money and time on appointments, and I often am haunted with the thought, ""What if I don't wake up?"" before I go to bed. It might seem dramatic, but the symptoms I experience truly make me feel like death. I'm so symptomatic all of the time now that I can't work, I can no longer go to class, I can rarely indulge any of my many hobbies, and I can hardly socialize. I'm surviving on the money I had saved at this point, but I'm running out. If America HAS any accommodations for people like me, I certainly have not been provided any yet. If it's possible to receive accommodations as a Florida resident, I would appreciate somebody pointing me toward how to receive them. I'm tired mentally, emotionally, and literally. Please feel free to ask questions or engage. Even if it's just for your own curiosity, I am happy to provide more information. "
The dilemma of leaving Art,islam,1i8q9qo,2025-01-24 02:41:28,3,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1i8q9qo/the_dilemma_of_leaving_art/,doner_shawerma,Seeking Support,"Hello,

This has been on my mind, ever since I learned about the controversy of art ( drawing, comics, people, animals life) in Islam. I knew about that in 2019-2020? and the waves of opinions and absence of civilized, clear, and understanding is frustrating me.

I have read previous reddit posts about this matter, it got me confused even more. As a desperate mortal, who doesn't want to extent her misery in afterlife too.

I do digital illustrations, I am into drawing comics and willing to learn animation. I did study computer science and know how to program, but this market haven't been working in my favor and there are many red flags from in Islamic perspective if i were to work in a company that feasts on users' data, questionable banks transactions, or work an agency i am obliged to code or build apps for any brands with questionable business. In Lebanon, there isn't an Islamic friendly standards in corporate.  On the other hand, TBH, i hate working in CS fields, its the new blue-collar jobs in misogynistic environments that are unislamic as well. it isn't for me, i am intrested in game dev, did couple of games but i know the headache coming with it islamicaly :)) (music, characters, animations..etc)  
  
Moreover, the Islamic NGOs that i work with are Islamic in every aspect, except in paying fair salaries, on time, and without gender discrimination. But that's just anywhere, right? but what confuse is, these Islamic NGOs, who invite for Following Allah and his Messenger (PBUH) ,they commissioned me to do ""Super Hijabi"" comics, or a comic panel for a gift shop that exchanges gifts for how much verses a child memorized, and a logo of hijabi girl. These projects has people in it, directed to people like you and me to relate and interact with. A teacher i take halqa with told me it is ok, as long as your intentions isn't to compete with Allah, and the drawings are cartoony not hyper realistic.

My riziq is coming through drawing, i have hard time finding a job even in Graphic Design, many nights i pray Qiyam and ask Allah to give my rizq in the ways he likes to be, in the ways he is ok with, not explicitly mentioning how, but deep down i don't want to work nasty, soul draining jobs, Can't a man work from something he likes?? do all jobs have to be miserable to stay in the halal lane. and after these nights i got 3 drawing projects ( the giftshop panel, stylized portrait, and game art for a steam banner ( a girl with a witch hat that cooks telepathically :3 , all modest tho! )) and here i am confused even more.   
  
 I am literally seeking Allah's Guidance, and i get these projects. Not even much of money due to the inflation and the economic crisis we live in. but it is pocket money that i am **\*desperate\***  for. Are these my tests? waving goodbye to projects commissioned by people who understands the value of art and communication?

The only Halal job i got (that checks what people say) was being a Design and ICT teacher, doesn't involve teaching arts. i worked in an a prestigious international school that claims to be islamic and fear Allah in their employees, spoiler alert: they don't. Underpaid salary, Health withdrawal, psychological issues still suffering from, toothaches, unpaid overtime, toxic management, **classism** in addition to be teaching over 10 classes as a junior teacher. Wallah it was too much, i was paid 700$ for 12 months, all that either went to debt, house management,  paying my medical bills, emergency, and upgrading my clothes to modest ones. I have nothing saved.

That being said, i needed to vent off... i am currently registering in a WordPress workshops with a secular NGO. hoping to gain connections to find a job that pays me well and give me peace of mind even if had to work in misogynic environments and quit being a human being, the norm . Keeping drawing comics a hobby for myself i don't benefit from, but it will always ache my soul the forms of arts, is impassively forbidden, with all grew up with ( animatic shows, comics, stop motion..etc)  perhaps even based our personalities on and  what a baby first do while picking the pencil and paper. l

PS: drawing backgrounds and objects are fun and have potential for storytelling, but it will be eventually used to insert people in it even if i don't draw them myself."
CO poisoning?,SuicideWatch,1i8pt8r,2025-01-24 02:07:19,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1i8pt8r/co_poisoning/,burned_out_medic,,"15 years in ems as a medic. Married 11 of those to a woman with a terminal illness who has been given roughly 9 ish more years to live. 

She’s sick off and on, so I’ve always took the brunt of the workload. I’ve worked 100 hours a week (in shifts of 24 hours) for the past 11 years. 

It’s what I had to do to provide a lifestyle above poverty. We have a household of a constant 5, with 1 more coming and going part time. Shit ain’t cheap. 

Anyhow. 11 years of hell. You name it, weve experienced it in our marriage. Stealing, lying, cheating, addiction, domestic violence, child protective services, cops, jail…..seriously. We must be the most toxic couple ever. 

This is what “there is no such thing as divorce, no matter what” got us. 

4-5 days ago I walked up to her, and she had no idea I was there. She was texting another guy. All the things happened. The yelling. The fighting. The denial. The gas lighting. She left. From that point forward, she had disappeared off the radar every night between 10pm and 6am. She says she’s working. As a CNA. But her shifts are actually 2pm-10pm. She says she picks up extra shifts because she doesn’t want to listen to me bitch. 

Her exact words were “the more you bitch, the more I’ll do it”. 

That was the final straw. I prepared the divorce paperwork. 

Then she reminded me. She’s worked part time our entire marriage. She has a terminal illness. She will take me for every penny she can get, and I’ve had an income of 110k for at least the last 3 years. Which means the court will consider that my “normal” income and use it to set child support and alimony. Even if I kept the home, I’d be so broke I’ll lose it. 

I could pack my shit and walk out. Disappear and never look back. My dad did that. I swore I’d never be him. It took me years of therapy to understand it wasn’t me and my sisters that made him do that. Still, I could never do that to my kids. 

What I can do though. I have life insurance. A 2 million dollar policy that is over 2 years old. And I’ve confirmed they pay out 100% for suicide after 2 years. 

I have the opportunity to both solve my heart ache, depression, anxiety and also make sure they are set in life financially. And I intend to make that happen. 

After 15 years of seeing suicides, I know what works and what doesn’t. Guns are great, for a closed casket. Though the failure rate is higher than comfortable. 

Cutting is painful and slow. Even the carotid arteries (which is a simple Nick) can take a while to pass. Though, you’re unconscious for most of it. There is a high risk of someone finding you too quickly, and not being successful. 

Pills lead to vomiting a lot. And choking on your own vomit sounds like a horrible way to die. No thanks. 

Hanging. Well there’s that. But again, you’re awake for quite some time. Though not “painful” your brain is comprehending the feeling of not breathing for longer than comfortable. 

Overdose by heroine/ fentanyl. This seems pretty good. Lots of people have done it. But of course, when you work side by side with the cops, it’s not easy to find. Like I don’t know anyone I can call to get dope. 

So that leads me to CO poisoning. Car, in garage. 30 minutes and I’m fast asleep. 1 hour and I’m for sure taking a dirt nap. And I think I can get that 1 hour while the kids are at school and she is gone doing god knows who. I think the car would run out of gas and die before the kids get home. We don’t park in the garage, so they wouldn’t know to look there (garage is detached). So kids won’t find me. 

I have some things to do before I go. Like writing a will. Changing life insurance beneficiaries so my cheating wife gets nothing. And taking the time to drop thank you’d to the great people in my life. 

This world sucks. And I don’t wanna live here anymore. "

It's weird how thirsty you get when you start drinking electrolyte based water,healthyeating,1i8peow,2025-01-24 01:39:01,0,0.2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/1i8peow/its_weird_how_thirsty_you_get_when_you_start/,EdmontonPhan82,," For those that go Hard into something health related.. don't just start drinking something like pedialyte, or Gatorade all the time. 

Most know there's a balance in water, no electrolytes dehydrate you, can cause swelling & will actually make you More thirsty & flush your body of nutrients because you're not holding on to the water.. Too much, you get heart issues, swelling, whole other tonne of health issues. 

There are many different Types of electrolytes as well, salt, potassium, etc. 
I personally notice, tap water would never, & does not do it for me. I get headaches, stomach aches, go to the bathroom more often. But distilled does the same, tastes better, but not nessecarily better for me. Also in the meantime I found out I was allergic to fluoride, body aches, feeling ill, etc

I always thought bottled water was stupid, you pay so much for ...water ..until I had some of a specific kind someone got, all my issues went away, well water also did the same if I was anywhere that had it. I would bottle that sht like it was the last drop. 

Just, regular non fluoride spring water.. spring water usually has some sort of electrolytes naturally, but each spring would have its different type, depending where it was from ..some do better with me, some don't but it was Amazing the difference. For health and hydration

If you want ro recreate this but don't want to buy all the time. You could invest in a remineralizer -deflourinator combo to attach to your sink.. 
You'd also want ro invest in one of those zero water readers so you know when to change.. 

In smaller version, I guess you could use zero water with mineral rocks in it.. but zero water always hurt my stomach made me feel weird for some reason.. 

Too little electrolytes, you can get swelling ..even brain swelling, dehydration, lack of nutrients staying in your system, constant thirst, urination (me personally) fatigue

To much ..you Have all the health problems that come with too salty, or sugar foods.. 

It's amazing the balance you can get from Just drinking water.. won't solve all your problems just like eating one salad a week doesn't make you vegetarian, but having No salad is substantially worse. 

Tldr. You get thirsty because your body actually starts absorbing the water, & tells you you need more. When you've had enough, it stops. Unlike tap or distilled, non fluoride spring water was what worked for me"
To my great lost love,heartbreak,1i8p5jt,2025-01-24 01:21:35,16,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1i8p5jt/to_my_great_lost_love/,CaterpillarFun9438,,"I don’t really know how to start this. The very act of trying to find the words feels too overwhelming, as if just making the effort is too much to bear. But every day, it scares me—this constant regret of all the things I never said, now lost forever, drifting away with every passing moment. I don’t know if I can make this right, but maybe I should at least try, just once. Maybe trying is the only way to find peace in all of this.

It’s taken me so long to even begin, let alone continue. Every day, I’ve watched myself avoid these feelings, these unsaid words. I’ve paused too many times writing, made too many excuses just to run away from the pain, from the truth that I need to do this—not just for you, but maybe for myself also. I can’t keep hiding from what I owe, to both you and me. It’s been hard, getting here, facing everything I’ve tried to avoid. But somehow, it feels right, in a way. To let myself be vulnerable again, to open this wound I created and tried to hide for so long. Maybe it’s not about healing—it’s about learning to live with what happened. Maybe this time, I can finally let myself face the truth without running.

My room feels darker than it truly is, lit only by the faint, flickering glow of my monitors. The hour has long passed, its midnight, and the cold has begun to run into my skin, going deep into my body as the night passes. I’m growing used to this feeling again—the routine of doing nothing, just sitting here, staring at these screens as if they hold the answer to the emptiness I’m trying to outrun. I’ve called off the search for my soul, I put them on hold again, telling myself its impossible, when in truth, I know I’ve just given up on finding it.

I feed myself with endless distractions, each one a momentary attempt to numb the pain inside, a way to escape the weight of what lingers beneath. They offer temporary relief—small bursts of satisfaction that fade almost as quickly as they arrive, leaving me empty again, like an empty room that refuses to be filled. And yet, I keep chasing them, as if one might finally make me forget, might silence these thoughts that has been creeping me, ones that burn like a fever, searing through me as if I’m burning alive. Thoughts about what’s really happening. Thoughts about what’s already happened.

The silence around me feels heavy, pressing down harder with every passing moment. It’s the kind of silence that amplifies everything I’m trying to escape. And though I know this cycle leads nowhere, I let it continue, because facing the truth feels harder than this endless loop of distractions.

It’s so late, isn’t it? I’ve lost track of time, but somehow, that doesn’t seem to matter anymore. The hours slip away without me even noticing. I feel like I’m drifting, lost, floating through these moments with no real direction. I wake up thinking of you, and when I fall asleep, it’s the same—your presence lingers in my mind, always there. Every thought is haunted by you, even when I try to push it away, as if you’re woven into the very fabric of my consciousness. How is it now that somehow you’re a stranger, but you were mine just yesterday? I don’t know how we got here, but it feels so different now. Everything has shifted, and I find myself standing in this strange, unfamiliar space, trying to remember what we once had. I don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t know how I ended up here, in this place of endless questioning. All I know is that somewhere, in the middle of all this confusion, I failed. I lost. And that’s the hardest part: admitting it to myself. It feels like the truth is something I can’t outrun, something I can’t hide from anymore, no matter how hard I try. It sits with me, heavy and undeniable. I’m afraid to say it aloud, but deep down, I know it’s true. I’ve failed, and I don’t know how to fix it. It feels too late, doesn’t it? Too late for anything to be what it should have been. Did I crossed the line?

I don’t blame you. You can’t save me. No one can, but myself. You were trying your best, trying to fill the gaps in the empty void within me. And I can’t imagine how much that must have taken from you. I see it now, in everything we’ve become. I mean, look at where we are now.

You took charge of something you were never supposed to, and that wasn’t fair to you. You’re just human, a precious being with your own emptiness to handle. I treated you like an extension of me, like something that could make me feel alive again, and that feels so wrong. It feels like I forced you to carry a burden that wasn’t yours to bear. And I hate myself for making you feel like that, for making you believe you were a failure, that you weren’t enough, that you were just a decoration. You were trying to fix something that was never meant to be fixed, because it wasn’t meant to be fixed by anyone else in the first place. It was my brokenness, my weight, and I made it yours.

It all makes sense now, doesn’t it? The way we fell apart, how the silence between us grew, how the distance stretched until it became an insurmountable divide. I should have let you be who you were, not something I could cling to in order to make myself feel whole. But now, in the quiet of these empty moments, I finally see that. I realize I failed to understand you, failed to see that you were struggling just like me—that you too got tired, got angry, became anxious, and overthought everything. I was too caught up in my own mind to truly listen to yours, and now I’m left wondering if I could have done something differently.

Could we have still been something, if I hadn’t acted the way I did? If I had been more patient, less selfish, maybe more understanding of your own battles? Or was this always the way it was meant to unfold? I keep asking myself these questions, replaying them over and over in my mind, but all I’m left with are doubts and regret. And the memories—always the memories—is the only thing that remains, the only thing that still holds the weight of what once was. It reminds me of everything I’ve lost, of every chance I took for granted. It's the only constant in this aftermath, the only piece of you that I can still hold on to. But even that feels like it's slipping away, like everything else I’ve lost in the wake of it all.

And now, my room feels emptier, in a way that’s hard to explain. It’s always been empty, but now, it’s as if something I once had here is gone. I don’t know what it is—it’s like a ghost, or maybe a memory, a presence that was here, but now it’s simply vanished. It started to fade months ago, little by little, like sunlight dimming behind thick clouds, the sky growing heavy, the clouds turning darker, and a storm quietly gathering on the horizon. And now, it’s completely gone. It’s like the feeling of you, of us, slipping through my fingers, like trying to hold onto sand that falls no matter how tightly I grip. I reach for it in the air, hoping some trace will remain, but it slips away, dissolving before I even understand what I’m losing. The air feels heavier, quieter, as if it’s closing in on me. Every small sound echoes longer in the silence, reminding me of how empty everything has become. I try to fill it with something—anything—but nothing stays. It feels like the silence itself is swallowing everything whole, taking everything with it. And yet, it’s not just the room. It’s me. I can feel myself emptying, piece by piece, the weight of missing you pulling everything else away, leaving only a fragment of me. I don’t know how to stop it, or if I even can.

I started doing things again—old habits I had forgotten about, things that used to come naturally. They all welcomed me back, as if they had been waiting for me, patiently holding space for my return. But there’s something off about it, something unsettling. I feel dissociated by these welcomes, like I’ve been pulled back here because I’ve done something wrong, something I can’t quite put my finger on. It’s strange to be in this place again, doing things I once did without a second thought. It feels familiar, but also foreign, like I don’t belong here anymore. I keep wondering if I missed something, if I did something wrong, if all of this—this emptiness, this disconnect—is somehow my fault. The thought lingers, heavy in the back of my mind, like a question I can’t answer but can’t stop asking.

The music means so much more to me now. It speaks in ways I never paid attention to before. It’s like you gave me a warning, a foreshadowing I couldn’t hear then. You planted those seeds, and now, I remember the songs we shared—the ones I used to listen to without thinking deeper. Now, they tell me everything. They hold meanings I was too blind to see, messages I should have heard before but didn’t. It’s like each note carries the weight of everything unsaid, the beauty of your subtleties and unspoken truth. It’s as though I can hear the echoes of your soul in every song, the way our hearts are quietly pierced through by something from the melody of our past, leaving a wound that never fully heals—a cut that always bleeds.

I didn’t pay attention to the lyrics back then, the subtle words you left me, the quiet signs you showed me. You were tired, weren’t you? You told me more than I ever realized—through your words, through your actions, through everything. But I only focused on the beat, on the sound, on the noise. I was so caught up in my emotions, my insecurities, and my own self-centeredness. I didn’t see what you were trying to say, not fully. And now, those lyrics have become truths I can’t ignore. They haunt with your pain, your weariness, and the love you tried so hard to hold on. It’s a love that I only now realize was never truly mine to claim, yet it was a gift I could have treasured. And in my ignorance, they all faded away.

Sometimes, I sit and wonder what it must have felt like for you—to carry that weight alone, to leave quiet signs in the hope that I’d notice, only to see me stumble blindly past them. Now, carrying the heavy longing in my arms, I feel the weight of everything I didn’t see, everything I didn’t understand. It feels heavier than I ever thought possible, pressing down on me with the realization of what you must have endured. I didn’t know that I had it all, and nobody warned me before the fall. And I’m wasted. I wish you didn’t leave, I just needed a wake-up call. And now I’m facing the greatest loss of them all.

But trying to see from both perspectives, I understand the gravity of everything. I realize how beautiful things were, how beautiful they could’ve been, for both of us. The moments we shared, the connection we had, everything—so much of it was real. But it feels like too much time has passed. Too much has been lost for it to ever be what it should have been.

What if I had understood then, had seen the depth of your silent struggles? Could I have done something differently? Could I have spared myself from this weight of regret? It’s a question I will never know the answer to, a path that has disappeared behind me, a place lost in time—where I once saw you, where you, my loved one, stayed. to a place I can no longer go back to.

And I just find myself crying without warning—no reason, just tears. It’s the music. The songs we both listened to, or the ones you played. I can’t help it—they pull me back, tugging at threads I thought I had buried. They bring up everything: the memories, the moments, the pain, the love. Each note feels like a doorway, opening to a place where I still thought there was time, where we still believed that what we had could last. It’s like the music keeps us alive, even when you’re not here anymore. And In some moments, I think of you when I am sad and down, when the silence makes me cry, when it’s hard to try, and all I can do is simply fall back into you. Those songs remind me of the pieces of us still scattered in the corners of my heart, and I can’t help but let myself be pulled into them, pulled back to you.

I’ve placed so many emotions in the lyrics of the songs we listened to, each one wrapped in memories that refuses to fade. The regret, the longing, the guilt—they all live in those songs now, stitched into every melody. They’ve become a part of me, just as you are. And when I hear them, it feels like I’m hearing you again, like your voice is hiding between the chords, calling me back to something I’ll never touch again. A glimpse of us—not the us we are now, the one distant and separated by time. The us from before, when everything felt possible. When everything felt more safer, and the world was full of promise, and we could pretend that nothing could ever tear us apart. That version of us feels more closer when the music plays, as if I could be there again, if only I could reach far enough, but the distance between now and then is too vast, too final. The past, once vivid, is fading into a place I can’t revisit, a place where you still held my hand and we still believed in something worthwhile. A place where no storm could break us, that time would be kind to us. But now, all that’s left are fragments, memories wrapped in a melancholic tone that plays on, reminding me of who we were—of who I thought we’d always be. And every note brings me back, just for a moment, before reality pulls me further away, leaving me with nothing but the silence after the song ends.

I wish I could go back, even for just a moment, to hear you sing those songs again, to feel the way your voice carried emotions I never fully understood—how every note told a story, every lyric a piece of your soul. We were doing nothing, yet it felt like everything, as if our souls were trying to speak to each other without a single word. I long to see us again, together, lost in the music, wrapped in the warmth of the moment, before everything began to slip away.

I cherish what we had, even though it hurts, and the weight of it sometimes feels unbearable. I relive the good moments over and over, clinging to them like lifelines, but they only make the ache sharper. I fight the guilt that always seems to follow me—the regret of what I did, what I didn’t do, and all the ways I fell short. It’s a battle I’m slowly losing, as if every memory chips away at me, piece by piece.

I hate myself for how it ended. I hate myself for the words left unsaid and the ones I shouldn’t have spoken. For the times I let you down when all I wanted was to hold us together. I miss you so much that some days it feels impossible to breathe, like the world is caving in around me. Knowing I can’t turn back time, that I can’t rewrite what’s already written.

Every tear I shed feels like a reminder of what I’ve lost, of the emptiness that’s taking place. And every time I cry, I wonder if it will ever stop— …"
Help I don’t know what to do,DogAdvice,1i8p2w8,2025-01-24 01:16:35,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/1i8p2w8/help_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,Odd-Animal9488,Advice,"Hello everyone I appreciate everyone’s insight in advance. 
So my small chihuahua of about 9 years suddenly started vomiting later on Tuesday night, started off as normal colored vomit from the food she ate that day. Before this she was completely normal hyperactive self. All Wednesday she continued vomiting, clear fluids mainly. She was still pretty normal, she was drinking more water, didn’t eat, but would vomit almost immediately after drinking water every time. I figured she had a tummy ache and decided to wait a little longer before taking to the vet. She didn’t vomit anything but this morning she continued vomiting this time more foamy and brown substance. So we walked into an ER at 8:00 this morning. They did an X-ray, didn’t find anything. Then they did an ultrasound, didn’t find anything. Then they did blood work and found super elevated *something * sorry I don’t remember the exact words Doctor used. Basically told us she was in kidney failure and she would only get worse. They told us only option is to hospitalize and continue running more test with no real hope of them actually helping her. They mentioned it would be about $12,000 to start. Unfortunately I don’t have that kind of money, so my wife and I went home and thought of either going into pretty crushing debt, or try to put her down. I’m doing research and I’m reading that acute kidney failure like that would have to come from toxic stuff she ate. I started going through everything here at home and I’m 100% certain she didn’t eat anything like that for her to change within a few hours. I really don’t know what to do, I’m debating paying for the hospital treatment, or maybe getting a second opinion? There’s too much emotion that is it hard for us to make a decision. She’s the first dog my wife and I have had she’s been with us for almost 10 years now. Any advice is truly appreciated. "
To my great lost love,letters,1i8p22g,2025-01-24 01:15:06,127,0.98,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1i8p22g/to_my_great_lost_love/,CaterpillarFun9438,Exes ,"I don’t really know how to start this. The very act of trying to find the words feels too overwhelming, as if just making the effort is too much to bear. But every day, it scares me—this constant regret of all the things I never said, now lost forever, drifting away with every passing moment. I don’t know if I can make this right, but maybe I should at least try, just once. Maybe trying is the only way to find peace in all of this.

It’s taken me so long to even begin, let alone continue. Every day, I’ve watched myself avoid these feelings, these unsaid words. I’ve paused too many times writing, made too many excuses just to run away from the pain, from the truth that I need to do this—not just for you, but maybe for myself also. I can’t keep hiding from what I owe, to both you and me. It’s been hard, getting here, facing everything I’ve tried to avoid. But somehow, it feels right, in a way. To let myself be vulnerable again, to open this wound I created and tried to hide for so long. Maybe it’s not about healing—it’s about learning to live with what happened. Maybe this time, I can finally let myself face the truth without running.



My room feels darker than it truly is, lit only by the faint, flickering glow of my monitors. The hour has long passed, its midnight, and the cold has begun to run into my skin, going deep into my body as the night passes. I’m growing used to this feeling again—the routine of doing nothing, just sitting here, staring at these screens as if they hold the answer to the emptiness I’m trying to outrun. I’ve called off the search for my soul, I put them on hold again, telling myself its impossible, when in truth, I know I’ve just given up on finding it.

I feed myself with endless distractions, each one a momentary attempt to numb the pain inside, a way to escape the weight of what lingers beneath. They offer temporary relief—small bursts of satisfaction that fade almost as quickly as they arrive, leaving me empty again, like an empty room that refuses to be filled. And yet, I keep chasing them, as if one might finally make me forget, might silence these thoughts that has been creeping me, ones that burn like a fever, searing through me as if I’m burning alive. Thoughts about what’s really happening. Thoughts about what’s already happened.

The silence around me feels heavy, pressing down harder with every passing moment. It’s the kind of silence that amplifies everything I’m trying to escape. And though I know this cycle leads nowhere, I let it continue, because facing the truth feels harder than this endless loop of distractions.

It’s so late, isn’t it? I’ve lost track of time, but somehow, that doesn’t seem to matter anymore. The hours slip away without me even noticing.

Only problem is that I use Zelle a lot and most of the time sending thousands at a times to Sub Contractors. Is there any way you guys have gotten around this or just switching back to check and ACH transfer only ? My business is very online so I won’t be handling cash and really only take payments through QuickBooks. 

Next question is, does Amex support some type of no fee payment processing service? Where I can send links to people to pay."

However, the cash options are oddly disappointing. You can only add 1 bank, and many banks aren't supported (Including Fidelity! one of the largest). ACH seems to be very slow, with no ""instant"" availably as with almost every other brokerage. No early direct deposit as with most banks now. No debit card, no checks. The interest rate is good, at least for now.

  
It's unfortunate, since I'd be so happy to move most of my finances to M1 if the cash features weren't so bad. Even just allowing multiple bank accounts would be a big step, I see no reason why they can't do that. Hell, I'd write the code myself."

Now we’re going to get to see if he was right. Let’s briefly recap his claims. 

* An elite sniper team was assembled by Howard Hughes at the behest of Richard Nixon, to kill Castro and Che Guevara 

* Plan fails, Nixon leaves office

* Kennedy gets elected, doesn’t know anything about the assassination team, and pisses off Howard Hughes and political enemy Allen Dulles, when he apologizes to Cubans for the Bay of Pigs

* Kennedy tries to squash the beef with Nikita  Khrushchev, but this scares the shit out of Dulles, who believed we needed nukes for use against China in a possible future war

* Dulles redirects the hit team to go after Kennedy instead because they viewed him as an American traitor for wanting to give up all our nukes 🤯

* Bush Sr. knew in advance as it was happening

That summarizes like 3 hours of Danny rambling 😄. You’re fucking welcome. Now, if it turns out that this checks out- we should all pay a LOT more attention to this guy. 

Leave a comment if I missed anything- it’s a lot of Sheehan to sit through."

How to use AI in copywriting from a 15 year veteran,copywriting,1i8k7ia,2025-01-23 20:45:33,149,0.82,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/copywriting/comments/1i8k7ia/how_to_use_ai_in_copywriting_from_a_15_year/,Hoomanbeanzzz,"Sharing Advice, Tips, and Tricks","In this post I want to share with you my experience working with two kinds of companies doing two kinds of direct response copywriting.

1. A $150M+ health supplement company writing only short form content (social media ads), which is 100% cold traffic.
2. A $700M+ financial publishing company where I've only ever written long-form content for backend promotions (promotions that go out to people who have purchased something before, not cold traffic).

I'll start with the health supplement company because this is the role where I use AI the most.

# How We Use AI For Short-Form Ad Writing

So at this company every copywriter is encouraged to use AI.

When I first came on board with them I was very apprehensive to rely soo heavily on it.

To me it was somewhat of an insult.

Sure, I had used ChatGPT here and there since it first came out, but I didn't find it very useful (but then again I really didn't understand how to get the most out of it).

But very quickly something became glaringly evident -- **I had no choice.**

Because the workload at this company is so intense that it is IMPOSSIBLE to stay up to task WITHOUT AI.

You see, the pervasive use of AI at this particular business hadn't saved everybody time or gotten rid of copywriters, all it did was increase everybody's output.

In the same amount of time it would take a copywriter to put out let's say 3 well constructed ads a day, now we were pumping out 10 to 15.

Essentially we have this GIGANTIC catalogue of content built up over the course of years and years.

We are constantly referring to that content -- what got really good ROAS in the past. What hooks can we re-use and re-engineer. Captions, headlines, images...etc.

Can we take a TOF (Top of Funnel) ad and adjust to a BOF (Bottom of Funnel) ad. Can we take a Mother's Day promotion and adapt it to a Valentine's Day promotion.

The sheer volume of copy is so large that it becomes more useful to upload into categorized projects on tools like...

\* **Perplexity**  
**\* Claude**  
**\* GPT**  
**\* Jasper**  
**\* Reddit Answers**

That's my stack, in any case. And yes I pay for the premium version of each.

We plug these large volumes of content into these projects to have a library from which these tools can pull from in order to ideate and write new copy.

**Sometimes I will use AI to write 80% of an ad other times I will use it to write 0% and it's only there for research.**

In fact often I find that the output from AI tools becomes repetitive ad this especially problematic when we need to find some new angle to work with because ads are getting stale and angles are reaching a wall with their scaling.

**Other times it is actually more time-consuming for me to try and engineer copy using any one of these tools than it is for me to simply write it because the idea is so strong in my mind already that it would waste my time trying to get AI to do it.**

So in this role it's a constant back and forth.

Some days I am writing everything myself.

**Other times I will hit a ""wall"" where I'm not sure what new angle I can use and so I begin asking myself questions.**

In the past I would need to google these questions and weed through constant garbage content and listicles to find quality answers.

Now -- with **Perplexity and GPT my research is 10x more streamlined and have completely replaced Google for research.**

Here is what I have found for this role...

\* **Perplexity - Best overall for research, fact checking, and ""Unique Mechanism"" generation.**

So let me give you an example of this really quick.

We had been using a certain angle to explain why women over 50 experience aching hips.

Basically lowering estrogen causes a breakdown of tendons, this can cause a deep, radiating pain that makes it difficult to just do normal things (like sleeping on your side).

But this angle -- although incredibly effective -- was getting played out a bit.

So I used Perplexity for ideation.

One of the things it helped with was analyzing the ingredients in our product and finding studies related to synovial fluid.

Essentially another driver of these hip aches after 50 is the depletion of synovial fluid which lubricates and cushions joints.

Thinning of synovial fluid and breakdown of hyaluronic acid is helped by the ingredients in our product as backed up by a variety of studies, and this served as fantastic ideation.

In the past, coming up with an angle like that would have taken much, much longer and I would have needed to scour through mountains of other research.

\* **Reddit Ask -- best for market research, real life stories to mirror or adapt, and to understand how people feel / think about certain pain points**

Not much more to be said there -- this tool is new and incredibly invaluable. Although I also use Perplexity to look up ""chatter.""

\* **GPT**

I've found that GPT is good for generally summarizing large amounts of information and getting quick information and insight out of big piles of data I upload.

\* **Claude / Jasper**

For ACTUAL copy my opinion is that these tools are best.

Often what I will do is use Perplexity / Reddit Ask / GPT for research and mechanism ideation.

Then when I've REALLY pinned down the exact direction I want to go, I create very detailed instructions for Claude and Jasper with specifically tailored research documents I put together.

And I treat it almost like these are my ""junior copywriters"" -- I have to provide  a lot of input in order to steer the copy in the direction I want.

But I've found that often Claude and Jasper can write ENTIRE ads which require minimal tweaking.

And other times? Completely useless **and I'd be better off doing it myself and even going through the process of trying to use the tools was a waste of time.**

It's hit or miss. But when it hits often I will receive an output that is an ""ah-hah"" moment where I had thought to explore an angle that particular way.

Again -- it's like having my own little junior copy team. Sometimes they come back with gold, other times I just have to go and fucking do it myself.

**MY CONCLUSION FOR AI THIS ROLE:**

Completely invaluable. My job at this point would be impossible without AI tools especially since due to their use, our workload and expected output has skyrocketed.

However YOU STILL HAVE TO KNOW WHAT'S GOOD.

You can't simply expect to put in the research and tell these tools to spit out good copy.

You MUST know what good copy is to begin with otherwise you will generate garbage.

And honestly these tools almost never just spit out something acceptable from the first go around.

And after several rounds of revisions, I still have to put the final touches on everything.

# How I Use AI For Long-Form Backend Promotions

Whereas I am heavily reliant on AI tools to do research AND copy generation for short-form copy they play a significantly smaller role for large backend projects.

I have personally seen these backends pull numbers like **$30 million** over the course of a year.

We just had a backend make **$8 million in three weeks.**

The sales pitch for these products can be anywhere from **10,000 to 20,000 words.** And in video format last anywhere from **45 minutes to 2 hours.**

In addition to the sales promotion (as in the sales letter / VSL / webinar) you also have to create ""hot list"" builds. You need to create premiums to give away.

There are email sequences leading up to the event, then post even emails, cart abandon emails.

There's a bunch of moving parts involved not to mention re-heating campaigns, updating, creating evergreen versions, transforming a backend to a frontend offer and so on down the road.

In this situation the AI tools are great for **research, ideation, and helping come up with little sections, sub headlines, subject lines...etc.**

So for example let's say you've written a section, but you're unsure of how to segue and transition into the close -- that could be something helpful to bounce off of with AI tools.

Or you want to create 3 variations of the headline.

Or you have written the whole rough draft, but you're still not sure of what your ""unique mechanism"" is going to be that's tied in throughout the whole thing, you can provide these tools the full draft and help with ideation and research.

So the tools are still HUGELY helpful with research and ideation, but not so helpful in actual copywriting -- although they can aid in small parts of the copy or small sections.

They can't help you write 80% or so of the entire ad like in very short form copy.

# Final Thoughts

AI has made my job far easier and more streamlined than it ever was in the past. I cannot operate without it now.

It reminds me of how I grew up reading paper maps or using MapQuest (where you printed out the map and followed the directions) and then when I could just use Google maps on my phone I could not even conceive of how I got along before.

Or how back in my middle school and early high school days we'd still have to go check a Thesaurus or a dictionary or look things up in an encyclopedia to do research for a paper.

That was so ""normal"" to me then, but at this point there is no way I could operate doing that.

Going back to ""Googling"" for information and manually combing over tons of articles and papers and books and studies to collect snippets of information in order to form into copy seems absurd to be now just a couple years after the advent of LLMs.

**In addition to making my job ""easier"" it's also been balanced out with an expectation of higher output and faster turnaround.**

Do I think it's going to replace my job?

No, but I do think you can no longer be a clueless junior. You have to come in with a higher level of awareness and more skills (like an understanding of consumer psychology, direct response, CRO, sales funnels, and more).

Because that ""entry level"" role is kind of filled by AI tools at this point.

For jobs that DON'T involve heavy selling, marketing, and constant testing -- I'm not sure.

Because I don't really operate in the content marketing world like blog writing, SEO, web copy, and stuff like that.

But as far as the **direct response copywriting industry** AI is a great companion, but I don't see how it's going to put a dent in your ability to earn money, copy demand, or anything else.

For example the two organizations I work with are not ""downsizing"" their copy teams, they're on a hiring spree.

And as I pointed out, AI has only INCREASED output per writer, but with that increased output comes adaption and a ""new normal"" which just requires more writers.

Hope that helps answer the big AI question. Happy to help with any other questions you may have about AI in the industry right now (as far as direct response is concerned)."
[FN] The Vessel of Ropav,shortstories,1i8jju5,2025-01-23 20:13:00,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1i8jju5/fn_the_vessel_of_ropav/,Mi-Fort_Cheddar,Fantasy,"“Do you have it?”

“Yes,” he replied, for what seemed like the hundredth time that morning.

The two men—one young, one old—marched in step with the other commuters, blended in with their dark suits and even darker overcoats.  They walked onto the train platform, scanned the crowd that formed along the thick yellow line that ran parallel with the track.  The old man smiled when he thought how ridiculous it seemed to have nothing but a swish of bright paint act as a barrier; as though there was an unseen force field preventing commuters from pressing too close to the tracks.

Or jumping.

It would have made his task more difficult, he acknowledged.  Difficult, but not impossible.

He gestured at the younger one to take the agreed-upon place near the yellow line and walked over to the public pay phone.  He could hear the distant chime of the train bell and willed his arthritic knees to move faster.  He lifted the receiver and punched in the three numbers.

“911. What is your emergency?”  Odd, he thought, that the voice should sound so cheerful.  Perhaps she knew.

As the train approached, the tracks sang as though they heralded a new day.

“The Vessel has been filled.”

“I’m sorry, sir, could you repeat that?”

“The Vessel has been filled.”

He dropped the receiver and it swung like a pendulum from the metal coil.

“Sir? Sir? Hello?!”

There was no time to waste now.  He pressed his way through the crowd, ignoring the obscenities shouted by angry business people.  Breathless, his ancient knees aching, he reached his young friend.

Here, the edge of the concrete platform gave way to gravel and sporadic patches of grass.  The train would enter the station at top speed, making this location ideal.  And, of course, the telephone.  It was petty, he knew, but he wanted the higher powers to know they were bested.

The old man had no doubt the message would be conveyed.

He stood next to the younger one, made no eye contact.  It would be dangerous for anyone to associate them.

“You know what to do, yes?”  He spoke so only the younger would hear.  It wasn’t a question, really, it was confirmation.  Confirmation for an old man who knew there was only one chance to change the world.  That such a sacrifice could be made only once.

The young man gave an imperceptible nod as he moved his hand across his loose overcoat—over the small lump at his chest—and brushed away a non-existent speck of dirt.  The old man closed his eyes and murmured a chant.

“Blessed be, my son.”  And the old man stepped off the platform into the rushing path of the 06:07 morning train as horrified rush-hour commuters looked on.

As the 911 dispatch received dozens of calls from eye witnesses to what was later ruled a suicide, one other phone call was made.

“My lord, the Vessel of Ropav is now filled.”

There was a pause before a deep voice replied.

“Prepare for battle.”"

# Back to the Dark Ages

***Prologue:***

Vichyssoise Charmcaster was a philanthropic genius who brought the world into a utopian era with the help of his clones Vici and Vick. When Vichyssoise disappeared and Dr. Vick was captured by the men in black, there was no one left to prevent Vici from building the (obviously dangerous) Oracle Machine. Unlike Vichyssoise, Vici lacked the common sense to consider the moral implications of his inventions.

When Aino and her siblings visited their Great-Uncle Vici, he turned the machine on, and it spat out the prophesy: ""In 21 days the world shall end. It is inevitable. Thank you, have a nice day!"" before folding itself out of existence. Aino and her siblings, Aada, Annikki, and Aamu, went on a quest to save the world.

Their sleuthing led them from danger to danger, culminating in a showdown that they knew they may never come back from. They all somehow miraculously survived, and thought they had saved the world - with only a few hours to spare before their 21 day time limit was up!

To celebrate, Aino and some of her family decided to dine at a medieval themed restaurant in Windenburg. The faux-castle had been built by an eccentric millionaire who had run out of money before it was completed. He had sold it, and it had become a trashy tourist trap.

Aino and Annikki were sitting in the carpark of the mock castle when they heard a strange gunshot-like noise with a deep rumble. Leaping to the roof of their car, Aino strained her eyes to see a mushroom cloud in the distance, was that a nuclear explosion? Looking in the other direction Aino could just make out dark storm clouds with intense bolts of lightning - it looked like it was out near Henford-on-Bagley.

Jumping to alert, they noticed a commotion nearer at hand - sims were fleeing, screaming, and being captured and hauled away by a horde of servo bots with glowing red eyes. Quickly Aino grabbed the printed prophecy out of her pocket, frowning down at it. She turned it over and noticed some words that surely weren't there before:

""I told you it was inevitable.""

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

After S.T.A.R's successful debut of the AI ""Wonder Servo"", an unexpected problem arose - Servos were truly intelligent, independent beings, clearly demonstrating personhood and thus were entitled to the same rights as any other life state. Which meant it would be unethical to expect Servos to provide free labour. Seeking an ethical method of forced labour, S.T.A.R set to work on developing Artificial Non-Intelligence.

They succeeded in creating a ""near-lifeform"" - a robot which was incapable of feelings or independent thoughts, and was barely more than a glorified computer with limbs. The development team warned them that there was still work to be done, but the higher-ups said ""Eh, good enough. Just slap a pricetag on it and let the customers work out the bugs.""

Those immortal words would soon lead to disaster, as the new wave of service robots lived up to their unintelligent status. Soon customers began to realise that, once programmed, the robots weren't able to be reprogrammed, and would carry out that programming to the letter.

Chef-bots starving their owners after being told they wanted to go on a diet.

Gardener-bots guarding the gardens and not allowing their owners to harvest the plants.

Fleets of security-bots rounding up sims for any crime no matter how small. This one was particularly problematic as one parent had instituted a curfew of 6pm, and that curfew had somehow made it's way into the shared database of ""laws"" that the security-bots were tasked with enforcing. Soon the streets were empty of any creature that could not evade thermal scanning.

In these empty streets, we find a pocket of survivors...

***1. Aino Charmcaster***

It was a normal day at the popular medieval theme park when the alarm sounded. The staff lowered the portcullis, and from that day on, every sim inside the mock-castle grounds became a community.

Aino and Annikki had made it inside before the gates closed, but were separated in the rush. The frantic crowd made it impossible to locate anyone, or even to be heard by the person right next to you. Her attempts to locate her family were replaced by her newfound focus to stay on her feet amongst the chaos. Her eardrums felt like they were going to burst, and she was being jolted around. If she fell, she would surely be trampled to death.

A piercing whistle silenced the crowd, and they all turned to see Dylan Sigworth standing on a table and gesturing for everyone to calm down. He held out his hands and, despite the panic of the crowd, managed to get everyone to sit down and more or less be quiet. Dylan Sigworth ordered the theme park staff to take a headcount, and began working on reconnecting separated loved ones.

Now that things were more under control, Aino spotted her husband Reuban in the dining area. He had with him their daughter Benita, and her nieces Beibi & Bekka. There was no sign of her other family members.

When everyone there had found their family, (or been taken crying into the next room as they discovered their loved ones weren't inside), Dylan gave a rousing speech about pulling together in such troublesome times. Everyone, all of the staff, visitors, and market stall holders, offered up whatever useful items they happened to have with them.

Aino and Reuban knew how lucky they were that their little family was all together. Aada and Aamu were old enough to look after themselves, and the children were all here and safe. They turned their full attention to Dylan, although Aino felt slightly amused at his unexpected ability to take charge. She had always thought that Jess had the backbone in that family.

It was soon discovered that;

They had no internet or mobile phone service, so were unable to contact the outside world.

They had a functional kitchen and well established garden, so food would not be an issue.

They had no electricity, but the theme park ran mostly off-grid anyway, and they had a well which provided them with fresh clean water.

There were some rather luxurious bedrooms on the top floor of the castle, built by the eccentric first owner, and some hostel-style bunk rooms on the floor below, as the new owners had initially planned to turn the castle into a hotel.

For the time being they would be safe and comfortable, with the ability to be self sustaining for as long as needed. Dylan Sigworth pointed out that with signs of other problems, such as the supposed ""nuclear explosion"" some guests had witnessed, it was unlikely that they would be rescued anytime soon. He suggested they all turn in early for the night, and reminded them they should be thankful that their situation wasn't as bad as it could be.

\*\*\*

The next morning was grey and overcast as the theme park guests congregated in the dining room. Some were clearly anxious & excitable, others were sluggish and showed signs of a restless night. To Aino's surprise, Dylan Sigworth again showed his leadership skills that morning. He and the staff had been working for hours to provide a big hearty breakfast for everyone. The delicious aroma roused everyone's appetites and their morale.

The morning was peaceful as they set to work combing the castle for useful items. They had discovered a stash of good quality costumes which would come in very handy - especially as the days got warmer. Everything was proceeding cheerfully, but trouble began later that day when Annikki got into an argument. It turned out she had mentioned the oracle's prophecy, and how it was bad luck that the apocalypse they had prevented hadn't been the only one scheduled for that day. Aino was almost as stunned by her sister's stupidity as she was by the violence of the crowd now dragging Annikki through the castle, with the clear intention of throwing her out.

Almost as quickly as it had begun, it was over. Dylan Sigworth, yet again, was the voice of reason. He listened to both sides, and declared that really they couldn't blame the Charmcaster siblings for their current situation, but it was a shame that the four hadn't bothered sharing this information with anyone else, as perhaps someone else would have found a way to prevent this apocalypse.

Dylan's face twisted up in deep thought and the crowd stood breathless, captivated by his charisma. Finally he suggested that maybe Annikki could show repentance by giving up her comfortable bed for one of the bare cots (which just so happened to be located in the dungeons). Aino's disgruntlement with this turn of events landed her on a cot in the dungeon too, although Reuban and the kids were allowed to remain in the bunkroom with the other families.

The crowd seemed to really vibe with Dylan's leadership, and everyone was happy to follow his suggestions. When future disagreements arose, they often turned to him to mediate.

Luckily the others couldn't focus on their grudge against the Charmcasters, as they were too busy adapting to a self sufficient lifestyle. There were plants to be tended, goats to be milked, sheep to be shorn, and chickens to be fed. Those with good cooking skills were officially dubbed chefs, and those who could hold a tune spent the evenings entertaining the whole gaggle of survivors. There was a castle's worth of cleaning to be done, and that unthankful task fell to the Charmcaster sisters. Despite having other skills to offer, any attempt Aino made to change tasks was met with scorn and animosity.

\*\*\*

Even in that first week, Aino began getting used to being treated poorly by the other survivors. They called her ""out of touch"" and ""entitled"" because she grew up in San Sequoia, the heart of the Utopia. She got used to hearing people speak disparagingly of her great-grandfather Vichyssoise. They called him a failure because he never managed to make his utopia world-wide, pointing out that it barely spread past the borders of San Sequoia before he disappeared and progress slowed, then stopped entirely. Those who lived further away held an extra grudge against her family - some of her relatives used their wealth, resources, & connections for their own gain. They built themselves mansions and ""allowed poor folk to starve"".

It made a tough situation even harder, but she held her head high and did her best to maintain her dignity.

\*\*\*

At the end of the second week, Aino collapsed into bed and thought about the hectic events of the past fortnight. She couldn't believe how thoroughly life had changed in such a short timeframe. She thought also about Dylan Sigworth.

When they first met months ago in Strangerville, Aino had immediately labelled him a coward in her own mind. Even when he showed his surprising leadership skills, she had secretly expected him to fail at the first hurdle. But he had held his own. She finally admitted that not only did he have what it takes to be a leader, but he was also thoughtful, generous, and had a strong magnetising effect on those around him.

With a groan she lifted her aching body up from the dubious comfort of the dungeon cot and made her way to the top floor of the castle. She paused with her hand raised to knock on the wooden door in front of her. Aino had thought to go comfort Dylan, as he was no doubt worried about his wife and daughter, but now she suspected that he had already moved on - if the noises coming from his bedroom were any indication. Deciding that his companion was clearly giving him more comfort than she was willing to, Aino returned to her dingy dungeon room and tried to get some sleep.

Surviving was more exhausting than she could have imagined.

\*\*\*

After almost a month of dull drudgery & subtle social exclusion, Aino was just thinking things couldn't get any worse.

So, of course, fate had to prove her wrong.

As she & the other cleaners were dealing with the aftermath of dinner, the nearby music and laughter turned to shrieks and screams. Carefully peering around the staircase which divided the dining room from the bar, Aino saw Jared Miyamoto in the middle of the dancefloor, bathed in the light of the full moon. He appeared to be undergoing a painful transformation.

Abandoning her dish cloth, Aino began dodging the fleeing crowd to reach her daughter. She grabbed the toddler, and looked around for her husband. Jared let out a howl, now unrecognisable in wolf form. Finally Reuban appeared at her side and she handed Benita to him, shoving him through the doorway that led down to the dungeon. There were still some scared sims trapped, with a rampaging werewolf between them and the grand stairs. Doing her best not to draw the wolf's attention, Aino contrived to pull those last few stragglers towards the dungeon doors. As they fled down the passageway, Aino pulled the door closed and locked it, moments before the big beast's claws reached her face.

Although there were no casualties that night, Aino would always consider it a tragedy. It had sparked a toxic fear and hostility against all occult beings, which forced them into hiding. Jared was ultimately given the choice between being let outside the castle walls to fend for himself, or living in the dungeon peacefully. He chose the dungeon, for better or for worse.

If there were any more werewolves in the castle, they managed to live quietly and without being found out. No other occults were discovered in Aino's lifetime, except for herself and her sister who were of course spellcasters. Although everyone who hated them knew they were spellcasters, Dylan Sigworth's newly formed council declared that spellcasters would be tolerated, as long as they never used their powers.

Aino put her head down and silently accepted this, just as Jared the werewolf had done.

\*\*\*

With the changing of the seasons, Aino realised that her circumstances were not changing. The hatred towards the Charmcaster family never subsided. Although it wasn't always apparent, there was a constant undertone of hostility towards them. Whenever Aino or Annikki got too complacent, the other survivors would harshly remind them how unpopular & unwanted they were.

When she decided to seek Dylan Sigworth's advice on the matter, he listened, and then with a kind face, suggested that she give up her pride and accept that she cannot change people's minds. He also gave her some unsolicited parenting advice - he told her that if her daughter and nieces kept the Charmcaster family name, they too would eventually face this sort of ""friction"". He suggested that she ""stop being selfish"" and think about what's best for the children.

Although Aino had stormed out of his room, slamming the door in his face, she couldn't get his words out of her head. As distasteful as it was, she knew he was right. The best chance for any Charmcaster in this castle would be to hide their lineage.

After talking to her husband, Aino brought her precious daughter to the chamber where Dylan and his council of staff were meeting. With silent tears she announced that her daughter would be taking Reuban's last name. Dylan placed a comforting hand on her shoulder and told her she was doing the right thing.

That night Aino cried herself to sleep.

\*\*\*

As the years passed, the survivors of the castle began settling in to their lives. Perhaps because they were all the sorts of nerds who go to medieval theme parks, most of them enjoyed the freedom of simple living. The community soon had both official and unspoken rules governing every aspect of life. A unique culture began to develop, with it's own customs and even proverbs. ""Save it for a rainy day"" came to mean the opposite of it's usual meaning - here rainy days are the good days where there is no fear of robots, and you can go outside and have fun and relax. Sunny days are dull as you must stay inside the castle and do indoor activities, often boring chores like knitting or canning vegetables.

They had turned the mock castle into a home, with a common nursery on the top floor between the luxury bedrooms, a children's schooling & indoor play area, and a bar with a bustling nightlife. After the first death they had built a cemetery.

When Aino died, she would not be buried there, as she had refused to change her last name and the council was ""concerned about vandalism"".

***2. Benita Kondo***

Seeing the hatred her mother endured, Benita vowed to live her life quietly enough to avoid conflict.

She enjoyed working in the gardens, and she adored tending to the animals of the petting zoo. But what she loved most of all were the quiet nights when she could slip away to meet Kris at the stables.

Kris was a punk, but he could see the value of harmony in their fragile situation. So when the theme park's costumes were handed out (as the only source of clothing available to them), he donned a full suit of armour rather than shave his mohawk.

When they were alone together and he removed his helmet, Benita always felt like she was seeing a private sight - like some endangered animal in its natural habitat. Benita loved his mohawk. To her, it symbolized Kris' indomitable spirit and his self-control.

The freedom they found in each others arms gave them the strength to endure their less-than-tolerant fellow survivors. Their marriage was blessed with two daughters, Cajsa and Cwen.

***3. Cajsa Richard***

While Cwen took after their parents and worked outdoors, Cajsa preferred to make herself useful inside the castle. She learned to knit and mend clothing, and as a teenager she took up a post in the nursery, where she could knit blankets while watching over the precious children of the castle.

Though Cajsa wanted children of her own, she had trouble finding anyone who took her fancy. Those who were interested in her, she found unattractive. And those she found attractive treated her badly due to her Charmcaster family line. One day when she was returning a mended blanket to the werewolf locked up in the dungeon, she came across a young man that she'd never seen before. He seemed to be about her age, but had an air of maturity which belied his appearance.

He introduced himself as Jacobo Ruiz. He was a nectar maker, working underground in the cellar. He explained he followed a strict diet, so he chose not to join the household for dinner, instead he traded with the fishermen - nectar for freshly caught fish and frogs. Once he told her he had been a baby when the castle gates closed. Something about his story seemed a bit off, and he was very cagey about his exact age and parentage. He always seemed to have an answer for everything, yet nothing he said could be verified. Cajsa didn't really care that much though. She was happy to ignore the inconsistencies, and their relationship blossomed.

Their first child was a beautiful little girl, and the couple hoped they would soon have another. However, fate had other plans. Not only were they unsuccessful in their further attempts to have children, but little Ditte became a sickly child. Her pale skin was often cold to the touch, and she struggled to keep down food. Becoming fearful for her child's safety, Cajsa took her to Calle Sigworth, the medicine man. Calle gave Ditte a tincture, which tasted bitter and made her violently ill, but soon she began to grow stronger, her cold skin became less so, and Ditte transformed from a sickly waif of a child, into a strong energetic bundle of joy.

As Cajsa aged, she was filled with wonder that her husband Jacobo still looked to her just as young and handsome as the day they first met. He reassured her that, despite her greying hair and obvious signs of aging, she still looked just as young and beautiful to him too.

After Cajsa reached the end of her long life, Jacobo disappeared without a trace. He was last seen leaving the castle on a sunny day, but there were no signs of him after that. Some people pointed to the pile of ash in the courtyard and asserted that he must have somehow caught fire and died. Others speculated that the robots must have gotten him despite the solid castle walls, and they became even more fearful of the outdoors.

***4. Ditte Ruiz***

Though Ditte's parents were always badgering her for grandchildren, Ditte knew the family line would end with her. She simply wasn't interested in men at all. She was far more interested in Deanna Thurman, the buxom barmaid who blushed so easily when Ditte flirted with her. At their wedding, Ditte's parents wished them the best, and quietly gave up hope of ever having grandchildren.

On their wedding night, in the intimacy of the boudoir, Ditte discovered that Deanna had a secret. A big secret. Deanna was an alien! Anxiously, Deanna looked into Ditte's eyes, praying that she would forgive her for keeping such a big secret until now. Ditte of course understood entirely. The castle's society had a strong anti-occult belief, caused by fear and hatred. Ditte knew that her wife wouldn't be safe if anyone knew her true alien identity. She understood that keeping it a secret from her hadn't been a personal slight, merely an act of self preservation. She thanked Deanna for trusting her and becoming her wife.

The two spent their honeymoon days in marital bliss, and returned to their normal worklives with reluctance. How wonderful it would have been to just lay in each other's arms forever and ignore the rest of the world.

However things started going south for the couple when Ditte began showing signs of a mysterious illness. At first she thought it was a simple cold or flu. The frequent nausea which became worse after breakfast, the swelling of her ankles, tenderness in various body parts... She went to the medicine woman, and was shocked when she was told she was pregnant. Believing it to be a rather hilarious mistake, she told her wife all about the ""quack"" doctor's diagnosis. But Deanna didn't laugh. She couldn't make eye contact as she sheepishly admitted that pregnancy was indeed possible - of her species, women were the impregnators.

Ditte's mind reeled as she took this in. Deanna acted like it was no big deal, but to Ditte it was an extreme betrayal. If she had known this... if she had been aware of the pregnancy risk... she would never have had unprotected woohoo with Deanna. Ditte felt sick to her stomach. Her own wife, who she loved so deeply, had purposefully withheld vital information which prevented Ditte from being able to give informed consent.

Disgusted and furious, Ditte told Deanna she needed space, and stormed off to be alone with her thoughts. She visited the medicine woman again, asking if there was anything she could do to undo the pregnancy, but she was too far along.

Their relationship became strained and her pregnancy did not go unnoticed. In order to avoid revealing Deanna's secret alien identity, Ditte could not tell the truth about her pregnancy. She was also unwilling to make false claims against any of the men of the castle. And so she was forced to claim she had slept around and didn't know who had gotten her pregnant.

This scandalous announcement made her the subject of castle gossip as everyone tried to guess who she had slept with. Many men began claiming they slept with her, bragging that they had been the one to ""turn her straight"", but all of them conveniently claimed it was long before she became pregnant and thus they couldn't be the father. With her failed marriage and her pregnancy to an ""unknown man"", she was labelled a promiscuous adulterer and shunned by most of the castle inhabitants. ""But what more could anyone expect of a Charmcaster?"" they whispered to each other. Even her parents were embarrassed to associate with her, despite how badly they had wanted grandchildren.

Her blood boiled when her ex Deanna was treated with sympathy, as though Ditte was the one in the wrong! Although Deanna tried to stop the rumours, she was unable to without explaining the true circumstances and putting her own life at risk. From Ditte's point of view, Deanna was accepting the sympathy and casting Ditte as the villain, when all along Deanna was the one who had wronged HER!

Their relationship never recovered.

\*\*\*

Ditte gave birth to twins, which she had to raise alone. The castle had an established naming system; a child takes the father's last name, never the mother's. In cases where the father was unknown, the child would be named after the season they were born in.

She could never give them Deanna's last name, and so her children were given the last name ""Autumn"".

The older twin, Eja, was a full alien and the youngest twin, Elvii, was a full human who had inherited Ditte's spellcasting genes. Elvii could simply avoid using magic, in order to hide her occult identity. However Eja would have to live in disguise just as her mother had.

Despite Ditte's hatred for Deanna, she would have liked for her children to know their other mother. Especially little Eja, who was cut off from her species and culture. But that was impossible. As far as everyone else was concerned, the twins had nothing to do with Deanna at all, so for Deanna to be involved with the twins would raise suspicion and increase the general animosity towards Ditte. After all, how callous it would be to cheat on your wife with several men, and then constantly rub your illegitimate children in her face!

\*\*\*

Ditte had thought her life was completely ruined by Deanna's betrayal and her unexpected pregnancy, but one fateful day she realised just how much she still had left to lose.

One day Eja's disguise slipped.

Right there in the middle of dinner, in front of practically everyone, Eja was revealed to be an alien. It was too sudden and too public to control the damage, and Eja was seized before Ditte could grab her and whisk her away to safety. She was burned at the stake, while Ditte was restrained and helpless to save her daughter. The discovery of an alien in their midst sparked an alien-hunt. Three more aliens were discovered and put to death. Elvii was suspected but quickly cleared. Ditte was held captive as they tried to force the name of Eja's father out of her. No one ever suspected Deanna.

Ditte had endured years of mistreatment, but Eja's brutal death & the resulting torture pushed Ditte over the edge and the medicine woman declared she was insane. Ditte died under mysterious circumstances. Deanna died of heartbreak shortly after.

But life goes on, and no one dared speak up against the status quo. They turned away from the horrible things that occults were suffering in the castle, and found ways to rationalise them, like; ""If they hadn't been so deceitful, they wouldn't have been punished."", ""Sure it's a shame they were killed, but aliens aren't really people, they don't feel things like we do."", and ""Sometimes sacrifices have to be made for the greater good.""

***5. Elvii Autumn***

During the alien-hunts, Elvii was put through tests to prove she wasn't an alien, and once she was cleared, she was more or less left alone. No grandparents, no parents, and no siblings. No one who claimed responsibility for her or took over as her care-giver.

Still, Elvii managed to flourish into a sensible young woman. She made a good life for herself as a fisherman. The soothing rain, the long hours of meditative silence, the complete indifference of other fishermen. It was perfect for her.

She never cared much for dating or romance, having been jaded by her mother's failed marriage and the mysterious circumstances of her birth. Instead she enjoyed the platonic company of the other fishermen. On nice rainy days they would fish in near-complete silence. On days when the weather prevented them from fishing, she and the other fishermen would retreat to the dungeons for sabacc and drinking.

During a particularly nasty bout of weather (sunshine and clear skies that lasted over a week!!!) Elvii was approached by one of her coworkers. Enji Takagi was a straightforward older man whom she admired quite a lot. He told her about his prospects and lifestyle, and asked her to marry him. She thought it over, and decided why not? He was a quiet reflective man not given to excessive socialisation, and an accomplished fisherman who dabbled in furniture building. He seemed like a good match for her, and so they were wed the next day.

***6. Fiia Takagi***

Raised by two fishermen, young Fiia was left alone on rainy days when the fishing was good, and spent sunny days fetching drinks for the gambling fishermen.

The fishermen drank and played sabacc in the dungeon as the stench of fish made them unwelcome in the regular bar upstairs. Fiia grew strong enough to move kegs up and down the dungeon stairs, and she became adept at moving quickly without spilling drinks.

Eventually the elderly barkeep, Dea Okada, took notice of her. She saw great potential in Fiia. She was quiet and mature, while the other barmaids were prone to giggling with the customers and giving away drinks to the men they fancied. Fiia would make a great barmaid, and could be the successor Dea was looking for as she neared retirement.

Fiia accepted the apprenticeship and discovered she had a natural talent for drink mixing. She was popular with the customers, but never neglected her work to socialise. The regulars loved her, and she quickly began getting her own regulars, who would stop by any time they saw her working. It's safe to say that Fiia was living up to Dea's expectations.

Her favourite, and also least-favourite, regular was Fidan Sigworth. She admired his quiet confidence and friendly attitude, but she always groaned when he came in because she knew that she would have to work harder. All her coworkers would be too busy trying to flirt with Fidan to tend their other tables, so she would inevitably have to pick up the slack or risk an entire bar full of disgruntled customers.

The bar was a popular place to meet potential spouses, so while most of the bar patrons would try to dress nicely, some took it even further and dressed as though they were attending a fashion show. Fidan did not. He was a physical labour with a mild disdain for frivolity. His work clothes were good enough, and he wore them until they were worn out. Why bother owning fancy clothing that he couldn't even work in? Despite his worn clothing, his friendly-but-distant attitude and muscular physique were irresistible to her giggling coworkers who constantly fawned over him.

Fiia also developed a crush on him, but for her the attraction was less physical and more about his personality. He was kind and patient; she often saw him playing with the castle children, swinging them around with his strong arms. He was generous and had strong morals; she remembered a time when one of his coworkers was killed in an accident, and he convinced all of his coworkers to give part of their income to the widow and her children. His never drank to excess, or made inappropriate comments to the barmaids (even though some would have welcomed them).

Fidan began coming to the bar every day, and he would always ask for her to wait his table. He told her that he liked her quiet manner, and once said she must have strong integrity. Fiia blushed at these little compliments, even though she was sure there was no romantic intention behind them. It made her giddy to be recognised by her crush amidst a sea of his admirers, but she didn't know how to show him she was interested in him.

She confided in her coworker Fabia, and asked for advice. Fabia took pity on the naive girl, and told her that the best way for a barmaid to show her interest in a man was to give him free drinks. She pointed out a nearby barmaid, Faye, who was doing so right now. The barmaid strutted over to a young man and handed him a drink, she said something to him and he pulled her close and began whispering in her ear. She was giggling and tossing her hair. Fabia called her over and asked what was going on, Faye giggled (yet again) and confided that they had just made plans to meet up after she finished her shift.

Fiia was doubtful, to say the least. That didn't really seem like what Fiia wanted. What she really wanted was a quiet and wholesome romance, not just a fling. But after all, Faye was far more experienced with men than she was, so maybe it was worth a try?

\*\*\*

One day Fidan came into the bar early, and drew Fiia to a small nook away from the already crowded tables. He smiled warmly at her and handed her a small wooden dragon that he had sculpted himself. She admired it cheerfully, and was shocked when he told her she could have it. Seeing a chance to put her coworkers' advice into action, she brought him a mug of ale and tried out a coy smile as she told him it was in exchange for the sculpture.

Fidan was disappointed by this for two reasons; firstly he had thought Fiia had too much integrity to steal from her boss like that, and secondly... he had given her a gift and now she was paying him for it? Was she rebuffing him after all these months of courtship? What had he done wrong to lose her affection? Was it because he wasn't harsh enough when he rejected the advances of other girls?

His face was a mixture of confusion and some negative emotion that Fiia couldn't place. Her heart stammered as she wondered if he was about to mock her attempts at flirting. He was always cheerful when one of the other girls flirted with him... Was she really that unappealing? She had no time to find out though, as her boss angrily called her over. Dea accused Fiia of giving away free drinks, and thoroughly chewed her out over it.

\*\*\*

Having been let off with a warning, Fiia was too embarrassed to face Fidan again, and began avoiding him. This was more difficult than she had expected. Suddenly it seemed that whenever he came in, none of the other barmaids were willing to wait on him. When Fiia asked about it, Faye tossed her head with a derisive snort and informed her that Fidan was a jerk. Previously he had been polite but friendly when they flirted with him, but now he was outright rude in his rejections. Eventually even Fabia refused to serve him, and Fiia was forced to approach the man she had been avoiding.

She placed a drink in front of him and twirled around to move away as quickly as she could, but Fidan followed her back to the bar and asked her to please talk to him. She was stunned as he confronted her, asking her what had happened between them. His voice sounded a little pained as he spoke. She couldn't believe her ears when he told her he liked her. That he knew they had never outright spoken about it, but he thought that they had a comfortable understanding.

Seeing the look of bewilderment on her face, he suddenly felt like a fool. Had it all been in his head? He had been courting her for months now, was it possible that she didn't realise it? Did she ever even like him that way, or was his ego so inflated that he had just assumed she did? He wanted to hide from the world, but it wasn't in his nature to give up without even trying. So he finally put the unspoken into words, and confessed that he loved her, and did she return his interest at all?

With much stammering and embarrassment, the two finally managed to clear the air and they officially started a (real) relationship. Decades later they would look back on this and laugh about Fiia's obliviousness, and Fidan's assumptions. Their courtship was sweet and wholesome. Fidan went back to being friendly with the other barmaids, and Fiia never tried to give away another free drink.

As time passed, their lives continued on a happy trajectory. Dea Okada retired and Fiia became head barkeep. Fidan was promoted to leading his own team of physical labourers. Following his promotion he proposed and the two were married. When they had children, Fiia took them to work in the daytime, tying them to her apron strings to keep them from wandering off. When Fidan's workday was done and Fiia's workday was just about to get busy, he would take over care of the children.

They led a happy life together.

# Continued in Part Two.

1. I Don't Know What This Is. Yes, I like this one.
2. My Side of the Story. Wow, that's good.
3. I Give Up! Well, no, that's not true, is it? No, definitely not true.
4. Living with Multiple Personality Disorder. No, no, no, too long. Ugh.
5. Magick and Divorce. Nope.
6. How I Met Aleister Crowley. Yes, that's the one!

Well, whatever the title, welcome! Here we are, I guess. I know, I know, I'm copying Miranda Hart, but in all honesty, I thought the way she started her book was brilliant. It gave me great inspiration and initiative to start my second book because my first was a flop in others' eyes (not including my wife's opinion because she loved it). Although it's not been fully released, I will continue to work on it. Anyway, let's carry on.

So, where to start... The adoption? No. The divorce? Maybe, but let me explain that part and how it came to be.

When I was around sixteen or seventeen years old, my brother Tom brought home a young lady named Em. She was traveling home with him on the bus from college, and they apparently got intimate on the bus, though I'm not sure about that. I've looked into it, and it's very much a ""he said, she said"" situation.

Em entered the living room and made her way upstairs, following Tom in front of her. I was in my room watching iZombie on Netflix before they removed that show from the app (such a sad moment for me). Anyway, they made their way across the landing towards Tom's room, and as Em walked past, I felt a very strange, familiar energy. So, I proceeded to open my bedroom door. Keep in mind, I had no idea anyone was coming over, and I couldn't hear anyone walking upstairs because I had a headset on. I just followed a feeling.

 I opened my bedroom door and almost immediately bumped into Em. We both froze, the energy between us growing stronger. The look of complete shock on our faces mirrored the intensity of the moment, with the energy now coursing through my veins.

I saw a vision in my mind, but it was blurry, and I couldn't make out where I was and I could only hear distorted music that felt familiar, but before I could place where I'd heard it, the vision abruptly ended, and I found myself back in the room.

""Hi, I'm Em. Tom didn't tell me he had a sister. Why didn't you tell me?"" Em asked.

""I did tell you I had a sister,"" Tom replied.

""Um, no you didn't. Well, it's nice to meet you anyway."" Said Em.

""It's nice to meet you as well. And yeah, that sounds like something Tom would say. He hates me, lol."" I replied.

Em glared at Tom for a moment, then proceeded to enter his room. The door shut, and I returned to my own room.

A few hours later, there was a knock at my door.

""Come in,"" I said with a raised tone. The door slowly opened, and it was Em.

""Is it okay if I come in? Your brother is irritating me."" Said Em

""Sure, come sit on the bed if you want. I'm just rolling a spliff."" I replied 

""Nice, what type?"" Asked Em

""Star dog,"" I replied.

We spent the evening chatting, smoking, and watching YouTube. Later, Em went back to Tom's room, and I wrote in my diary about how cute I thought Em was.

We dated for three months, despite my brother's attempts to be with Em. Em disapproved of how Tom treated me, as he was often crude and angry towards me for no apparent reason. I wish I had an explanation for his behavior, but I suppose I never will.

 (Writer's Note)
Tom and I now have a good friendship and talk regularly.

I hated living in my childhood home, so I decided to move in with my birth mother, whom I found and contacted through Facebook. However, living with her didn't work out because she was an alcoholic. As a result, I left her home and spent the next three years living in various hostels. Unfortunately, I eventually ended up on the streets.

So three years later, I traveled by bus to Cornwall to see Em, now known as Nathan James. Interestingly, we discovered that Nathan James was also the name of three pedophiles in the area, which we found quite amusing. We hadn't seen each other properly in around three years, so I was extremely nervous and tired from the long journey.

I arrived at the bus stop in Bodmin and saw Nathan sporting a black shirt, green hair, a beanie, blue jeans, and thick black eyeliner. Their appearance was striking—the vibrant green hair peeking out from under the beanie, and the black eyeliner making their eyes stand out even more. Their worn, faded shirt contrasted with the fresh, vivid color of their hair, giving them a unique, edgy look. I got off the bus and sat on a yellow wooden bench with them. Despite not having spoken in so long, we behaved just like we used to. Honestly, it felt like we were in a ""Life is Strange"" game, and we were the main characters. I wondered what our game would be called—""Life is Strange: The Unexpected Journey""? I don't know; it doesn't matter to me anymore now.

We began to walk and made our way to the front of a Victorian-style small town hall. The building, with it's peeling paint, cracked windows, and overgrown ivy creeping up its walls, looked as though it had been forgotten by time. ""That's where they accused the witches,"" said Nathan. ""Jesus, you can feel horrible vibes coming from there,"" I replied the taxi That Nathan ordered pulled up to the small brick road. And yes, Bodmin is that old. Google Bodmin Cornwall town hall—it's creepy. And of course, all the names, conversations, and places are real. I'm not leaving anything out.

We got into the taxi and traveled towards the countryside, which was absolutely gorgeous. I must say, the air was noticeably fresher the higher we went, as Bodmin is a valley town.

Once we arrived at the small, dirty old council house, we made our way inside. The walls were covered in mold, and there was barely any visible floor due to the clutter piled on top of itself. The air was thick with the smell of damp and decay, and the ceiling had water stains and patches of mildew. The windows were so grimy that barely any light could filter through. It looked like a set from a horror movie, I swear.

We went straight upstairs, and I noticed a small door on a very tiny landing. There was barely enough space to walk, and Nathan had to give the door quite a shove to open it.

The room was so small that it was impossible to walk through it; one had to jump directly onto the bed. We spent almost a week together, but Nathan was very ill. As a result, we mostly played *Life is Strange* and ate junk food. Nathan dressed me up like an anarchist, giving me a pink denim patch jacket adorned with handwritten patches, which I absolutely loved, being with Nathan was so refreshing but unfortunately I had to go.

Shortly afterward, I traveled up north, and Nathan and I did not see each other for a few years. During that time, I ended up in the hospital after a regrettable and unsuccessful attempt at self-harm. While in the hospital, I met Wolf, a kind and lovely transgender man. He was very supportive, and we spent a lot of time together. I developed strong feelings for him but respected our friendship too much to let it become romantic. 

Nathan and I had lost touch until I managed to log into an old social media account and discovered a message from them, stating that they were homeless, having left their mother's house, and were now staying at Laura's, sleeping on the floor on a long pillow, Laura was Nathan's best friend of eight years.

Immediately concerned, I sprang into action and replied, asking if Nathan was safe and urging them to call me as soon as possible. Despite our estrangement, I could not bear the thought of Nathan being homeless, even if they were temporarily staying with Laura. I provided my number, and the next day, we spoke on the phone. Subsequently, I made secret plans to leave the hospital in Barrow-in-Furness and travel to Bodmin, I left barrow within a few days.

Carrying all my belongings, I took a train from Barrow to Preston and then boarded a bus to Bodmin. I was now homeless at the time as well, and it seemed more prudent for us to face the challenges of homelessness together rather than alone. We pitched a tent in the woods near Bodmin Beacon, choosing companionship over solitary struggle.

It took Nathan months to reveal their secret to me, as they feared my reaction to their past life. In hindsight, I'm grateful for the timing of their disclosure and my understanding of the situation. Had I not learned everything when I did, I might not have made the decision to leave, and this book might never have existed.

After a few weeks of getting to know each other again we survived in the woods.

On a cold Monday morning We woke up in the woods, changed our clothes, and had a quick smoke before heading down the woodland path to Laura's house. 

Being part of this small coven of quiet rebels felt empowering. But in my honest opinion, both Nathan and I were more powerful than Laura, though Nathan's strength was comparable to mine only in the astral realm. If you are unfamiliar with this concept, I encourage you to learn more about witchcraft.

I enjoyed visiting Laura's house because it meant I wasn't left alone with Nathan, who could be difficult at times. I was losing hope, so we decided to get engaged, which initially brought some positivity into our lives and strengthened our relationship.

""After a year of enduring the relentless rain, mud, and cold while living in a tent, we eventually decided to move to Birmingham. 

The city was vast and unfamiliar to us, so I had to resort to using magic for our survival. Upon disembarking the bus from Bodmin to Birmingham, I cast a spell to locate a safe haven, as we had not slept in some time and Nathan was becoming irritable. I followed the energy trail conjured by my spell, leading us toward several old factory buildings. The first structure we approached had a large blue door adorned with graffiti, and the padlock was missing. Pressing my hands against the door, I sensed that only one person was inside the building and on the top floor.

""Are you sure it’s safe?"" Nathan inquired.

""Absolutely, there’s only one person inside, and they are asleep,"" I reassured.

Nathan's face displayed a mixture of wonder and concern as we proceeded to enter the building.

Just behind the door, there lay what appeared to be an old barricade, seemingly used to prevent entry. As we ventured deeper into the building, the floors were littered with mould, burn marks, and needles. The walls were covered in graffiti, profanities, and warning signs to stay out. One particular piece of graffiti caught my eye, bearing the words ""Stay out of the Luna Tunnels""—whatever that meant, I still don't know.

We ascended the dirty, wet cement stairs, littered with broken glass everywhere. At the top of the second floor, a long hallway stretched out before us, with many shattered windows and lots of evidence of previous occupants. We walked into the hallway and sat on a wooden sheet that had been ripped off the wall. Despite the foul smell, the broken windows allowed for a slight influx of fresh air.

We dropped our bags and began to survey the room.

""It's so cold. We need to find a warmer room after we have a smoke,"" Nathan remarked.

""I'll look for a better room while you roll the smoke,"" I replied.

I made my way toward the cement stairs and ascended to the third floor. There were many rooms in the building, most of them flooded and unsuitable for sleeping. 
I continued my search and discovered four or five rooms near the front of the building. One of them seemed decent; it wasn't wet or filled with mould, and there weren't too many windows. It appeared safe, so I made my way back to the stairway.

Nathan remained seated, smoking as the air around us began to warm slightly. The biting cold that had earlier pervaded the room was now somewhat alleviated. Gathering our belongings, we prepared to leave the building. As we stepped outside, the crisp air greeted us, and we made our way toward the city area.

The streets were bustling with activity, filled with the distant hum of traffic and the occasional chatter of passersby. The city lights began to flicker on, casting a warm glow on the pavement. We navigated through the labyrinth of buildings, our footsteps echoing softly against the concrete.

The city area ahead promised the comforts and conveniences that were Absent in our previous surroundings, we moved forward with a sense of anticipation, eager to find a place that offered warmth, security, and a sense of normalcy. After a short walk, we entered the Birmingham Bullring Shopping Centre. The bright lights and lively atmosphere welcomed us, providing a stark contrast to the desolate building we had just left behind.

Birmingham presented a daunting atmosphere, characterized by visible homelessness and unwelcoming security personnel. During our visit, we stopped by an outdoor gear shop and purchased a few items of clothing and a tent.

After a long day of exploring the city and taking in the sights, we returned to the room we had previously occupied.
 After pitching a big four man tent and having something to eat it was getting dark so we decided to watch some Netflix and then go to bed
It wasn't warm but it wasn't cold 
I fell asleep very quickly and then all of a sudden

 I found myself in a grand, dimly lit room, the air thick with the scent of incense. The walls were adorned with intricate tapestries, and the flickering candlelight cast eerie shadows. Suddenly, I realized I was in a Victorian house, far removed from my familiar surroundings.

In the center of the room stood a man with wild eyes and an intense demeanor. It was Aleister Crowley, his presence both commanding and unsettling. He was muttering to himself, scribbling furiously in a leather-bound book. His words were a jumble of arcane phrases and cryptic symbols, making little sense to me.

As I watched, a woman appeared beside him, her delicate features framed by an elegant hairstyle reminiscent of a bygone era. She was dressed in a flowing gown, her eyes filled with a mix of sorrow and determination. It was Rose Edith Kelly, though I didn't recognize her at first.

Crowley turned to her, his eyes blazing with a manic energy. ""Rose, the spirits are speaking to me! Aiwass is here, guiding us!"" he exclaimed, his voice trembling with fervor. Rose looked at him with a mixture of concern and resignation, as if she had witnessed this madness before.

I felt a chill run down my spine as Crowley continued his frantic scribbling, his words becoming more incoherent and frenzied. The room seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy, and I could feel the weight of unseen forces pressing down on me.

Rose stepped forward, placing a gentle hand on Crowley's arm. ""Aleister, you must calm down. We need to understand what is happening,"" she said softly, her voice steady despite the chaos around her.

Crowley paused, his eyes darting around the room as if searching for something unseen. ""Yes, yes, you're right,"" he muttered, though his hands still trembled with the intensity of his thoughts.

The scene began to blur, the edges of the room dissolving into darkness. I felt myself being pulled away, the voices of Crowley and Rose fading into the distance. As I awoke, the memory of the dream lingered, leaving me with a profound sense of unease and curiosity about the strange encounter I had witnessed. 

I couldn't shake the image of Rose’s face from my mind. There was an eerie resemblance that unsettled me deeply. Her features seemed to echo my own, and the realization filled me with a mix of fear and fascination.

That morning, I confided in Nathan about my dream but chose to only mention the physical resemblance between Rose and me. I felt uneasy about revealing the full extent of the delusion I had witnessed between Rose and Aleister. Hiding such details made me feel dishonest, but I felt it was necessary. Nathan had been acting strangely lately, and I didn't want to risk provoking them further.

All I know about Rose is that she was born on July 23, 1874, at 78 Cambridge Terrace, Paddington, Middlesex, England. She was the eldest of three children in her family.
She was an alcoholic unfortunately and that definitely wasn't her fault.

While writing this book, I've been visited by Rose herself. She keeps telling me to be careful for some reason, and I can probably guess why. I hate to mention the words I'm about to say next: The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. If you know them, then I'm glad I don't have to explain. If you don't, strap yourself in for a complicated ride.

The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, founded in London in 1888, was a secret society dedicated to the study and practice of occult Hermeticism and metaphysics. The Order was renowned for its intricate rituals and teachings, which encompassed elements of Qabalah, astrology, tarot divination, and geomancy. Despite its dissolution in 1903, the Golden Dawn's influence on Western occultism has been profound, inspiring many contemporary traditions such as Wicca and Thelema.

That's all the information I will be sharing about them for now, just to stay on the safe side.

I will say I feel as though the Golden Dawn has been following me in a spiritual sense. Items such as a ring, book, or necklace frequently appear in my life, and I only discover their connection to the Golden Dawn after researching them out of interest. For instance, I recently purchased a pentagram from a witch shop, and it turned out to symbolize the Golden Dawn. It's quite eerie how these occurrences keep happening.

Now back to the story. After spending a long six months in the abandoned factory in Myona, we decided it was time to return to Bodmin. At this point, I was struggling with Nathan's behavior, and we both missed Laura dearly. So, we booked bus tickets and left. To be honest, I did consider leaving Nathan in Birmingham, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. They would have stayed there and possibly died. So, I waited much longer, ensuring Nathan and I were safe before making any plans to leave them.
Stepping off the bus in Bodmin felt like a breath of fresh air. We gathered our belongings and walked back to Bodmin Woods, setting up our tent in our old camping spot. It was incredible to be home again. We quickly settled into our familiar routine, watched some Netflix, and drifted off into a well-deserved sleep.

As I dozed off, I found myself fading into another dream. This time, I saw two figures arguing in a Victorian flat.

Aleister's frustration simmered beneath the surface as he paced the living room, his voice trembling with restraint. ""Rose, we need to talk about this,"" he said, his tone edged with controlled anger. ""We can't keep avoiding the issue.""

Rose sighed, her arms crossed defensively. ""Aleister, I know it's important, but I'm just not ready to make a decision yet."" Her voice quivered slightly, betraying her fear.

Aleister stopped, clenching his fists, then took a deep breath. His voice, though strained, was gentle. ""I understand that, but we need to consider our future. We can't keep putting this off.""

Rose looked away, her eyes filled with uncertainty. ""I just... I don't know if I'm ready to have a baby right now. There's so much going on in our lives."" Her hands trembled as she spoke, clearly scared of the implications of their conversation. ""And I don't want our baby to have the same powers and abilities as me. It could be dangerous.""

Aleister's eyes softened as he took a step closer. Despite his anger, his words were tender. ""I get it, Rose. But we need to communicate and figure this out together. We're a team, remember?""

Rose nodded slowly, her resolve wavering. ""You're right. We need to talk about it and make a decision together,"" she whispered, her fear still evident in her voice.

The dreams were growing darker, more intense. Each night, I was consumed by haunting visions that left me restless and uneasy. My thoughts about Aleister were a tangled web of confusion and longing, an inexplicable connection that tugged at my heart.

And then there was Nathan. The feelings of betrayal and anger toward him were overwhelming, crashing over me like a relentless wave. The pain was raw, a searing ache in my chest that I couldn't understand or explain. I found myself questioning everything, lost in the turmoil of my emotions, desperately seeking answers that eluded me.

Nathan and I found ourselves in a spot of trouble because we were constantly harassed by the Bodmin council to move our tent and leave the village. We were told that camping was prohibited anywhere in the woods or in Bodmin at all. Nathan's behavior was becoming unbearable, filled with anger and frustration.

In the midst of this chaos, Nathan convinced his mum to let us move into the brick shed behind their house. I had mixed feelings about it because from what Nathan had told me about his family, I really didn't want to move in. When I tried to talk to Nathan about my concerns, he had a huge meltdown, and that was the end of that conversation. The situation was overwhelming, and I felt trapped by Nathan's anger and the uncertainty of our living arrangements.

Our routine was straightforward. Nathan and I would wake up in the old shed where we lived, have a couple of smokes, and then slowly get dressed. We would then walk to Laura's house and spend two to four hours there. Sometimes, we would pay Laura to let us use her shower, which we didn't mind given the rising costs and inflation. 

One day, Nathan came back from the local shop around the corner and placed his backpack on the bed. He then made his way to the toilet just behind the bed, as the room was very small, with the bed pushed against the wall that had the toilet behind it. I waited a few seconds, then slowly opened the backpack and grabbed my wallet, removed the bank card, took a phone charger along with my phone, and a pair of shoes. I didn't have time to put my shoes on; I just left the building and ran down the road.

I called the police, claiming that I had fled domestic violence. After breaking down in front of the officers, they took me to Bodmin train station and wished me well on my new life. I walked to the front desk, explained my situation, and they let me ride the train for free. As I traveled to Preston, I got in contact with my friend Wolf, who let me stay at his place. And that's it for now—that's my journey and my escape from domestic violence. That is how I met Aleister Crowley."
Question about a crossroads in my life as a young woman.,TwoXChromosomes,1i8bnkd,2025-01-23 14:26:50,12,0.76,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1i8bnkd/question_about_a_crossroads_in_my_life_as_a_young/,Obvious-Ship-6230,,"Currently within university and it’s made me feel disillusioned about the path I’m currently on. Any happiness or excitement I had towards what I was studying has almost disappeared completely. 

I have very few friends who are often too busy to see me or don’t speak to me often, I don’t really have a family so don’t have much support in that sense. My parents are lovely, but emotionally unstable and reactive to most things, things were turbulent when I was growing up with them, so I have often kept a lot of my emotions and true feelings away from them. 

Deep down I want to start a family. That’s all I’ve ever truly and consistently dreamt of ever since I was young. The thought of holding a baby and giving them all the love in the world, raising them and watching them grow, it’s one of the only thoughts that give me any warmth in my heart. My life now in comparison to those dreams feels purposeless and bleak. 

I understand how difficult, emotionally and financially draining raising children is. A couple of my friends are mothers, I’ve seen them at their best and worst. I know it’s not going to be a walk in the park, it’s tough being a parent. Despite in knowing that, and having seen those tough times myself, having had experience in childcare previously and seeing the issues that can arise, it’s still the only thing that I ever envision myself being happy doing. 

Finishing university and getting my degree, it feels like accomplishing the goals my parents have for me. I didn’t want to go into further education that much, but my parents would urge me to apply saying it would open a world of possibilities for me. Since joining I’ve felt my world get smaller and sadder, even though it is a subject I adore and have always been fascinated in, I don’t think it’s right for me. 

It feels bad saying that, it sounds ungrateful and crappy. But it’s how I truly feel. If I drop out to start a family with my partner, I’ll feel relieved in a sense that I don’t feel like I’m doing something that was never truly my idea. In another sense, I’ll feel like I’m closing a chapter that could have potentially led to me getting a career in something I love. But the possibility is never always there. Many people get a degree, go on to do a masters, and end up working in a field they didn’t study for in the first place. Many people drop out and end up doing really well for themselves. 

I’ve never seen myself being rich, or working in a high flying career. Never wanted loads of money or a big house or a fancy car on the drive. But I’ve always wanted a fairly comfortable life, doing a job that I can get on with and pays the bills, have a bit of money for a nice day out here or there, a happy dog with a waggy tail and a baby (or two). Just a proper little family life. I don’t mean to sound like one of those trad wife people, because I’m not. I believe that women should be able to do whatever they want, whether that’s living a fast paced go getting lifestyle or a laid back slow paced life, or, if they choose, a family life. For me, I’ve always wanted to be a mum. I really do see being a mother to a loving family as the dream for me. 

If I choose to finish my degree, I feel like I would have wasted time I could of been starting a family and actually doing what I want to do deep down. 

If I choose to start a family, there’s the judgement of others saying I threw it all away. That I could have waited a bit longer. But I’m so so tired of waiting. The longer I wait for my longing to be a mother, the more my heart aches and my life feels emptier and emptier. I’m tired of feeling so empty. 

It’s like whatever I choose I’ll feel like a failure in some sense. Deflated with a degree, or making a start on my own happiness but letting my parents, and I guess in a sense myself, down. 

I have posted this to a few subreddits since yesterday, and a few people have reached out to me offering advice. It’s my decision at the end of the day, I understand that completely, but it’s still hard due to the uncertainty I am feeling. I would really appreciate some responses and advice from you guys. 

I just wish that things could be easier for me, stuck in two minds and not a clue on what I should do. Whatever choice I make, will it ever be the right one? 

Edit: thank you to those of you who have left a response. I think the general consensus amongst you all is to finish my degree. That’s a fair point, thank you all for your honesty and advice. Well wishes! "
Settlement?,WorkersComp,1i8bgen,2025-01-23 14:18:33,0,0.33,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkersComp/comments/1i8bgen/settlement/,throwaway-tripped,Oklahoma,"Daycare Teacher and this is a long post but trying to get in every detail I can: 

In October of 2023 I tripped over a child at my place of work, in an effort not to fall on the child I flipped and injured my wrist, knee, and back. I was forced to finish out the remaining hours left in my shift and drive myself to get checked out when this happened. Initially all that hurt were my wrist and knee, but as I sat, my back began to ache and get stiff as could be. I went to our urgent clinic (that generally deals with claims) and their xray was down so then had to take myself to the ER. (Background, I worked in manufacturing previously and a workplace injury has always been a full stop, go get checked out immediately and someone goes with them.) Wrist and knee were and are okay.

Bulging disc at L5 was what the ER originally diagnosed. Initially my direct boss tried to get me to go and get myself checked out outside of the work comp system and cleared to return to work. I refused and explained to her how work comp works and I could not just do that, there was some push back from her because of my injury leaving them short staffed (not my fault, we were short staffed prior to my injury). I was put on restrictions for lifting, bending, and twisting, my work would not allow me to return to work with any restrictions. 

The back is what I was treated for and am still continuing to have issues with.

I had and MRI to get more conclusive results beyond the CT the ER did. I was sent for physical therapy 1 month, did nothing to help pain and back spasms and was given muscle relaxers and no pain medication. Physical therapy worked on a few things but one of the main things was that my right hip is higher than my left and out of alignment, I did not report this to my work comp agent at the time because I told my doctor and assumed it was in the PT notes. It was not written down by anyone apparently and now past the point that work comp will handle this.

After 8 weeks work comp stopped paying my claim (they have since back paid the time I was unpaid). During the time of me being unpaid my yearly training was do to be completed my boss was pressing me to do my training from home on my own time knowing that work comp was currently not paying me and I could easily go into the facility, clock in, and do my training. Knowing that her boss the actual administrator was getting all my updates from Work Comp and that work is not supposed to force you to work unpaid while on leave, I stopped communicating directly with my boss. Training is something we generally do while on the clock at work on the laptops provided there, unless you are working on a degree and choose to do so on your own time. She removed me from our app we use to monitor daily activity, I see this as intent to fire me (this point may be moot by the time I finish tho). Both the training incident and removal from the app happened in January of 2024. My boss was aware of me not receiving a claim during that time because I had attended our staff party in Dec of 2023 and informed her of such asking if there was anything she could do, again, to accommodate my restrictions. She said there was not and also made a snide comment about her having a similar back issue and just popping a pill and coming to work anyway. Which she was not under restrictions and certainly not under a work comp claim.

Shortly after this the doctor I was seeing an Orthopedic neurologist sent me to get an injection in the disc to help relieve my symptoms in hopes this would help me. Not only did this injection make thins worse, it was curiously done between the L3 and L4 vertebrae? Work comp did start paying my compensation claim again.

After another month of little to no progress physical therapy the doctor decided to move forward with a spinal disc decompression (also done between L3 and L4). I had surgery in April 2024 (a week before my son's  birthday). I was told post op not to drive (I have never been told I could resume driving since then by my doctor). I was also told to report any numbness.

Numbness is the first post op complications I experienced beyond the pain. It was positional to start off, I could not lay on my right side. Then sitting upright, after a few minutes my right leg just goes numb. I called the doctor was told this was normal and just to call if it got worse or talk about it at my next appointment. Well, it's gotten worse and worse and been ignored by my doctor at every turn. My right leg is numb about 80% of the time if not more. There is occasional weakness in it and I'm terrified to drive because of this. I feel it's a liability and dangerous. Not only that, I also have pinprick pains randomly down it, chills down just my right leg, not full body, and my right leg is significantly colder than my left leg. My right toes and foot often feel like ice. All of these things I told my doctor just went in one ear and out the other!

I told my work comp agent I wanted a second opinion. She finally convinced me to hold on to the doctor I was seeing for another month of PT that he had set me up with and yet again it did noting but he finally relented to do a post op MRI with contrast. There is scar tissue attached to my nerve. I still have a daily pain rate (he has done nothing to treat) and rely daily on muscle spasms medication to just do the simplest of things to not be writhing in pain with back spasms. On top of the numb leg he has been ignoring. This was October 2024 and he discharged me from his care saying ""nothing more we can do"" with permanent lifting and pulling restrictions.

I called my agent, told her this and demanded my second opinion. While she got me into a second opinion in Tulsa (4 hour drive away) for the end of November 2024, she did inform me that they were going to stop paying my compensation. The day after Thanksgiving one week before my appointment, I step up only my sons' bunk bed to grab him something and my right leg gives out on me and I go down on my left ankle spraining it, severely. Prior to this the weakness in my right leg had only caused some minor stumbling. I call my agent the following Monday (every time I call her she seems to be on vacation and she is my second agent). She was out of the office on vacation. I finally talk to her on Thursday while I am on my way to my appointment (as a passenger) told inform her of this. She said she would handle it. Great I just needed to fill out a form where I got checked out and they'll handle this additional injury, I honestly didn't care if they did just that someone is finally listening to me about the severity of what I am dealing with in regards to my right leg!

Appointment seemed to go okay and I finally felt like this doctor heard me. But I guess not, January 2025 had rolled around. Work comp sent me a big direct deposit for the time I was not being compensated for from the time of my initial 8 weeks ending to then I received the injection to my spine. She said the second doctor had said there was nothing more they could do for me, she said that the first doctor could not find significant weakness in my right leg to cover my left ankle sprain (how barely rouching my right leg once every 3 months in his office when I am straining my hardest and putting myself into pain to push against his hand and have tears in my eyes is a good measure of that, while simultaneously never touching left one is a good judge of that I don't understand), and has now started talking to me about a settlement. 

One thing I mentioned was the original diagnosis from the ER was at the L5 vertebrae, the post op MRI still showed that were is damage at my L5 vertebrae as there has only been direct treatment done between the L3 and L4. I can't read an MRI but I can read and MRI report and that is consistent on both my MRI reports.

So to me being put on permanent restrictions I cannot go back to my job. I am getting a partial disability thing with my claim, which I don't understand (if someone can explain that). The 1st doctor says that the injury is only a detriment to 6% of my whole body. Which is like a slap to the face. She said they would double that and through talking are barely offering me what would be a half a year's worth of income. The biggest problem is that this injury as a whole has taken over my life, it's taken over a year of my life away, I can't do the simplest things without having back spasms (making dinner, sitting down and building legos with my kids will trigger back spams). What jobs are in my background are rarely available in my area already hard to get, which led me to were I was working. Factor in the permanent restrictions and retail jobs the most common in my area are no longer available to me. Add in that if and when I do find anything if it is full time I then have to pay for child care for my own to children where this was free at my job while I was working there.

I expressed that I needed time to think about the settlement offer and my agent had told me I could come back with my own number and we could discuss that. However, I wonder if at this point I just need to get a lawyer and go that route. 

An additional factor that could be important, the child I tripped over is handicapped, we are not a handicapped accessible facility and this child would crawl up the stairs. I tripped over him at the top of the stairs while carrying his hand crutches. While there is an elevator in another part of the building there are still stairs this child would have to use to get to were we were going and the longer walk to and from the elevator exhausted this child. Not to mention trying to take a class of 22 kids (occasionally more when they had me over ratio...) on an elevator. I also had another child who was running ahead and around a corner which is why I had tripped in the first place. Trying to catch up with them to make sure he went to my classroom and not down the hall or elsewhere in the facility. I truly loved all of the kids I had in my class and miss them all immensely. I still see the child I tripped over on occasion and he still lights up and yell ""Miss my name!"" And I make my way over to hug him. I hold no ill will against him for my injury, just thought it important to add this information as it could be a liability against my workplace."

Doppelgänger… a normally unseeable replica of every man, bird, or beast that stalks them from birth to death, a double of their soul, a wraith that stares back at you in the mirror.

To meet one’s double is a sign that one’s death is imminent.

I had readied my heart to see a new face in the mirror, one I couldn’t recognise. I was prepared to feel like I had really become a different person.But I couldn’t be prepared for this, not to see ‘myself’ when I looked in the mirror.

An uncanny copy of myself that was just… wrong. It felt like I was looking at my double in the mirror. This body’s appearance didn’t change when I took over, Solly wouldn’t have recognised it if it had. So Millar looked like me from the start. He was basically my doppelgänger… no, that’s wrong. I am the doppelgänger.

I was fatally injured after the earthquake, I died in the OR… and I showed up here. I was a wraith. And I met my double, and Millar met his doppelgänger…To meet one’s double is a sign that one’s death is imminent.

Was I really put into an already dead corpse, or did Millar die because I replaced him?

I pushed back these thoughts for a bit as I focused on the present first.  
The room had a medium sized bed that looked… alright. I’ve seen worse. It also had a chair and a table. There was a tiny bathroom attached, and I was shocked to see a toilet with a flush, a little sink, and a tap with a bucket.  
Honestly, it was miles above what I expected, and once again I wondered how they could have such advanced technology but still use swords and leather armour, it made no sense!

I opened the tap to fill the bucket, I desperately needed to clean up before anything else… and the tap didn’t work. Turning one way or the other did nothing, and I thought it was broken, which was odd because it all looked pretty clean. (I took off my shoes at the room door, just for information.)  
Taking a step back to check the sink, water suddenly started flowing from the tap.

I reached out for the tap again and it stopped, but started working again when I got far enough away. Of course! Magic! So they replicated some technology with magic, that’s interesting. How did it work?  
Jesus, I didn’t even know the first thing about magic in this world and I was already distracted by the minutiae of how they used it in plumbing…

Letting out a sigh, I double checked the floor and walls, it looked like polished stone, rather than ceramic tiles. It was waterproof enough.  
There was a bucket, a mug, some soap, and a picture of a frog wearing a nun's habit hanging behind the bathroom door… everything I needed for a basic bath.

…

Finally clean, I stepped into the main room with nothing but a towel. I felt like a new man after that… Well, I felt like I wasn’t dying at least. It felt great to wash out my injuries without fearing running out of water or anything!

Staring at myself in the half-length mirror, I took a moment to finally look at my new body… Millar’s body, in proper lighting. I made sure the window was closed before fully inspecting myself.  
The wound on my upper right arm was already substantially healed, and the wound on my left thigh was properly closed and there wasn’t too much risk of it reopening. That was some remarkable recovery rate.

And then the smaller differences… I was about 173 cm (5’9”), which was a little shorter than I used to be, at 180 cm (6ft). I wasn’t particularly muscular, but I was definitely in shape, with no excess fat. I didn’t have the scars I had on my old body, but I had new scars… as well as a substantial one on my back. I couldn’t see it too well but it didn’t seem recent.

My shoulders were a bit narrower too, now that I thought about it, and I still had the exact same mole under my mouth to the right that my old body had… huh.

That was it. Once I learned everything I could, I laid down in the bed and just enjoyed the comfort.I mentioned it earlier, but it wasn’t the best bed. However, I slept on the ground last night, so this was a big step up.

So, this was it, wasn’t it?  
I lost everything… It was just a repeat of all the questions I asked myself barely a day ago when Milvarr died.

Why did any of this have to happen?

My mind felt like a sludge of doubt and confusion. I didn’t know what to do… so I just focused on my current goals.

I wanted to give Milvarr and Millar their rites, and I already told Solly, so she would help with that.  
I wanted to return the staff and bag of holding to Oromar Witechere’s family.I wanted to learn more about Millar and find his routes and return his sword to his family.  
I wanted to return home.

Returning home wasn’t likely a short term thing, if it was possible in the first place.I needed to learn more for that, I needed income to sustain me and fund my search… Being alone would make living a secluded scholar easier, but I wasn’t the loner type. It would be nice to find friends who I could rely on for help. Important information tends to be hidden behind big people and needs connections to reach… so I needed to head out and talk to people.

Step 1, talk to the guards about Oromar’s death and the items.  
Step 2, find a feasible way to make a living in this world.  
Step 3, learn about the merchant nation Lariatne. It’s where Millar’s from.  
Step 4, start learning about magic.  
Step 5, find people I can trust.

And hanging over all of this right now, I needed to make sure I avoided the Priest of law, Soliaras. It was the monk who attacked Millar and Milvarr, but she was there too and suspect number two in my eyes.  
Milvarr claimed she wanted the sword, and given how sharp she was, I’m inclined to believe her. Coming across the priest now could lead to my death. Antimagic might have saved my life quite a few times, but all it takes is a competent fighter with a sharp stick to kill me.

And there was the small point of if I could avoid being recognized as Millar… as far as I knew, I still looked like him, and there wasn’t anything I could do unless I just covered my face with a hood, which wasn’t practical.  
I considered leaving the sword behind if it was important to the priest, but I wasn’t sure I could trust a random inn’s security or ethos, especially if this sword was valuable enough to kill two people over.

Well, there was no point in wasting more time, so I threw on a beige shirt, blue pants, took a brown cloth and wore it like a bandana to cover some of my hair. Then I wrapped Millar’s sword up with a cloth and headed out. I no longer had any spare clothing.

After crossing paths with the angry cat lady who glared at me on my way out, I beelined towards the guard house.I drew a lot fewer eyes as I made my way through the streets, though the fancy staff did draw some interest… there was nothing I could do about it, I just didn’t have the material to hide it.

Looking around, the people here seemed to have a fairly muted sense of colours, both for clothing and buildings. I’ve heard that bright colours attract wild animals, so that does make sense. Not many people would like to get shanked by a double snake everytime they leave their house.

And one person who stood out to me amongst all of these mostly regularly dressed people was someone wearing a worn grey hooded cloak. It was drawn forward to cover their face, make them ‘inconspicuous’... but it really did make them stand out like a sore thumb.

This person looked suspicious. I need to reiterate, they look like some stereotypical thief with how conspicuously they’re covered up. And that hood.  
I decided to ignore them as they stood there staring at some shop… \*grumble\* but I could clearly hear their stomach growl in hunger as I walked past them.  
My mind went back to that old man I couldn’t help… I’ve been a fervent believer in charity since then, and it just wasn’t in my nature to leave someone to suffer when I had a chance to help.I glanced at the shop she was standing in front of, and it was a bakery.

“Are you alright? Do you need help?” I asked, and the hooded person jumped a bit at that before turning to look at me.  
Despite the shadows, I could see bluish green skin and red eyes staring up at me under the hood. This person was about 152 cm (5’1”), and I’m about 80% sure it was a girl.

“Ah, n-no, don’t worry, I was just moving on…” she stuttered out, awkwardly turning to step away. Being wary of strangers is good. “You’re hungry, right? Do you want to sit down for lunch with me?”

I didn’t know this woman’s situation, but I can sympathise with how difficult it can be when you can’t afford food. I’ve seen it plenty when I volunteer at the Franziskustreff.  
I understood I wasn’t in the best situation to hand out money without having an income myself, but if putting emotions first makes you stupid, that’s what I am and I accept that.

“A-are you sure?” the figure stopped and asked back. “Yeah, don’t worry about it. I’m horribly lost and need to hear about this place too.” Not coming off as a dominant figure was important to ease her nerves, but I couldn’t let myself look like an easy target. Some people can’t help themselves if they see an opportunity.

It took a few moments to calm her down, but before long we were sitting on a bench in an alley with a few meat buns between us. The total cost was about 6 marks.  
So far, I spent 16 marks for 2 meals and a night stay at an inn.he cost of living was more or less on par with the 15 marks Solly mentioned. It seemed she gave me the estimate for a traveller and not a townsperson who’d have a place to stay and cook a few meals themselves.

“I’m Armin Fischer. What’s your name?” I asked the hooded girl who was already scarfing down a meat bun. Wow, she ate it with so much enthusiasm that it made me hungry.  
“Awh, shovy.” she gulped, nearly choking. “I’m… K-kanako. It’s nice to meet you.”

“Kanako… that’s a nice name.” I said. It sounded japanese, but I didn’t have any context for what people were called here. Millar, Milvarr and Soliaras seemed like western names, but none of them were local, and I never heard Solly’s proper name.

“T-thanks. My mother named me… and are you really okay with this?” she asks, having a half eaten bun in her gloved hands. I nodded, and she took another bite of the bun, then just sat there staring at it in silence for a few seconds. “Thank you… um… are you an adventurer or a mercenary?” she asked, glancing at the staff and the cloth-covered sword.

“Well, I’m on a bit of an adventure,” I couldn’t help but chuckle, “but no, not exactly. I’m a doctor, and I’m a long way from home now. I found this staff on a corpse and I’m taking it to the guards so it can get to the next of kin.”

“O-oh I see!” she replied, though she sounded a bit hesitant. It felt like she was about to ask something, but eventually dropped that thought. “So, you’re new around here? I am too! I just reached the island three days ago, but getting here was such a pain. You weren’t on the same boat, were you? I think I’d recognise you because you have such pretty eyes.”

Well, wasn’t she the chatty sort? This did bring up the question of if I was going to keep the same story as I told Solly or not. Weighing my options, I could dress things up to make conversation easier.  
“No, I wasn’t on the boat.” I replied. “I don’t honestly remember how I got here, I just woke up in some ruins. It’s not the weirdest story I’ve heard involving magic, but it is a bit inconvenient.”

“Oh, so you… were you kidnapped? Or was it a scroll of teleportation? I’ve heard of people using them by accident and ending up on the other side of the world! Are you alright? Do you know how far from home you are?” She asked a dozen questions a minute, but it was refreshing to talk to someone like this again. She reminded me a lot of Anneliese… ah, Anneliese… my girlfriend, soon to be fiance, and another person I might never see again.

“A-are you alright? I’m sorry, I’m asking too many questions, aren’t I?” she asked awkwardly. “I just haven’t had a chance to talk to someone so much in a while…”

“No no, it’s fine.” I replied, waving a hand as if to brush off her worry. “You just reminded me of home for a moment… Honestly, I’m not too sure right now, it’s all a bit of a haze. But don’t worry about that, I’m sure I’ll figure something out.” I laughed. Honestly, it **was** a big issue, but I didn’t need to trauma dump on someone I just met.

“Right now, my first goal is to find a new job. Once I have a bit of security I can look for information on how to get home.” I explained. “What about you?” I asked.  
“I…” she hesitated a bit, “I’m looking for a new place to call home. I had some trouble back where I’m from so I’m here now. I’m looking for a job too… my dream is to become an adventurer, but I can’t do that without money, and I don’t have much left so I’m trying to be careful with spending it… ” she was being vague, but I couldn’t entirely blame her. I wasn’t being very truthful or any less vague either.

She didn’t seem to let her guard down even a bit while we were talking, regardless of how emotive she was being. Being vague wasn’t much of a problem, but I felt uncomfortable with how she acted and the dissonance between that and her very suspicious attire.

‘Adventurer’… I’ve been saying it pretty casually so far because it was a very common term in many fantasy stories, but they exist here, don’t they? This basically is a fantasy world. There are people who dive into dungeons that could be filled with traps and monsters, where there are dangers I couldn’t even imagine with what little I knew…  
Osomar was an adventurer. Milvarr as well. Millar might have been one too… and all three of them met their end in that filthy temple.

That was something this woman aspired to be?  
“Adventurers… there weren’t any of those where I’m from. I’ve only heard stories, but what are they exactly?” I asked. I wasn’t keen on risking my life for money, but it was an option I needed to look into if it helped me earn money and travel to different places while studying about magic.

“They don’t have many adventurers in my country yet, but… how do I explain this?” she asked, tapping the bench with a finger as she continued eating. “Okay, so there’s this big organisation called the Adventure’s Association. They get a lot of jobs from a lot of places. And then there are guilds that come together to distribute these jobs, and guilds are just permanent groups of adventurers.” She explained.

Concise and easy to understand. So Adventurers form guilds and do work for the Association.  
“I’ve heard stories of adventurers hunting monsters and going into dangerous ruins… is that all they do?” I asked. This was important, because if it was, then I had no interest in being one.

“No, they do all sorts of things. They do work like gathering various materials and ingredients, exploring areas, hunting criminals, doing guard duty, investigating things the guards don’t… basically anything. Some adventure guilds also double as mercenary guilds, and there are plenty of adventurers who just get the minimum qualifications and learn other trades with the connections they get.” Kanako excitedly explained. “Unless you get tied to a big guild, adventurers can go anywhere!”

“Interesting… I should look into that if I get the chance then.” It sounded like it could be ideal. Being a doctor somewhere would tie me down and make it harder to gather information, but being a doctor in a guild would give me a lot more options… ah, but if healing magic exists, then there’s not much use for a doctor, is there?  
“How common is healing magic, by the way? There was almost none of it back home.” I asked. “If it’s not someone from a church or temple, it’s pretty rare. Most adventurers just rely on guild doctors. Healing potions are great too, but they aren’t perfect.” she replied.

That was good news for me. I just had to get qualifications, however that was done here, and I’d have a chance. I could also learn more about alchemy and making potions, which could prove very useful.

“I see, thanks for the information.” I finally said, “I was feeling a bit lost, but you’ve given me some direction.”  
Kanako turned to look at me and hesitated a bit, before just giving me a smile. “I’m glad I could help somehow… Where are you going from here?” she asked.I wasn’t sure, honestly… but it was probably… “Lariatne, the merchant nation… I think that’s where I need to go.” I answered. There was probably something where Millar came from that could help me. That was my gut feeling, and a gut feeling was better than nothing.

“That’s where I’m planning on going too!” Kanako exclaimed, almost jumping from the bench. What a coincidence… I might have found an interesting travel friend…

As soon as I thought that, my mind flashed back to Milvarr. Her life had come to such a sudden end, just like that, all because of my mistake… if I had another companion, could I even be useful? Could I even be sure that I wouldn’t fuck up so royally!?  
My mind was just filled with these murky thoughts like I was drowning in a swamp.

In this murky torrent, Kanako’s enthusiasm seemed like a distant glimmer. I genuinely wanted to trust her, she just had that sincerity in her words, but I didn’t want to rush to a decision… I couldn’t.

“Ah, sorry, I didn’t mean to get excited like that…” she said, sitting back down. I didn’t get too good a look at her because of the hood, but I’m fairly sure she’s close to twenty? She’s a pretty cute kid.

Despite being curious, I decided to not pry much more, because that would draw more questions in return. I’m sure she wanted me to ask questions or bring up travel plans, but I left the topic and just quietly ate alongside her.

When we finally finished, I stood up, ignoring my aching thigh and arm. “Well, it’s been nice meeting you Kanako.” I simply said, ready to leave. “E-excuse me… Fischer… ah, no, I mean Armin. D-do you need someone to travel with? I’m a really good scout.”  
A scout… silent movement, information gathering, possible trapping skills… interesting, but they weren’t exactly subtle so far.

And besides that… “I’m not really much of a fighter, so that doesn’t mean much to me, sorry.” I have no context for what that even means.  
“T-that’s fair…” she replied, deflating a bit. I genuinely felt bad about pushing back like this… I guess I’m a bit of a sucker that way. However, I didn’t want to rush to a decision.

Unlike sympathy, you can’t be quick to throw around **trust**. It’s something that has to be earnt.

“I’m pretty suspicious… aren’t I?” she asked, letting out a sigh as she looked down at herself.  
“I won’t lie, you are.” I answered. I didn’t want to pry, but if she had a reason to cover up like that, I would like to know. “Y-yeah… there’s a reason. I just can’t tell you… yet… sorry.”

\*Sigh\* She seemed like a good kid from what little I talked to her, but she was too suspicious.  
“Listen, I understand that you want a travel companion, but I don’t even know you yet.” I decided to stop being subtle and say what I wanted to say outright.

“We’re two strangers who just met and have no reason to trust each other. While I would be grateful to have a travel companion, I can’t trust my back so someone I just met. Maybe we could decide on this matter at a later time, if we come to understand each other to some extent?”

“Y-yeah, you’re really trustworthy though…” she replied after a few seconds.  
Excuse me? I just told her not to trust me? I mean, I did lie a bit to her about where I’m from and my circumstances.  
“A liar doesn’t tell people to not trust them.” she pointed out. While that was true, the logic was… underbaked. “Sorry, I’ve not met a person as nice as you in a while… alright, if you can’t decide on if you want to travel with me yet… can you help me do some work to get money?” she asked.

“What do you mean?” I didn’t get the sudden twist. Was this a scam she was trying to get me in?  
“I… I’m really suspicious, so I can’t just walk up to people and ask for work. But I’ve been listening around, and the local apothecary wants someone to help find some herbs, but the people she usually hires are up north in the town right now. I want to do the job, b-but I can’t just walk up and talk to them…” she replied, awkwardly shifting.

Ah, so she was scared to talk to strangers… but that wasn’t just it. There must have been a reason she couldn’t remove her hood. Either some disfigurement, branding, or unique features that people don’t like. Those were my guesses. I didn’t believe she was a wanted criminal… no, she could have been, but I decided to discount that possibility.

“I see…” I could use the money as well, and learning more about herbs would be very helpful if I wanted to pick up alchemy. When I glanced at the potion recipe earlier, it did strike me as very similar to chemistry, which figures, and I learnt quite a bit about pharmacology in the course of my studies and practice, so it shouldn’t be impossible to learn.  
“Alright, that sounds good.” I replied. It would also be a good way to learn more about Kanako and if I could trust her. “Really!?” she asked, grabbing my hand with both of hers, surprising me. She moved incredibly fast.

“Thank you so much! I can’t wait, let’s go immediately and-” I had to cut her off, “Please wait. Let me drop this off first and finish a few other things. I’ll meet you back here in… an hour, maybe? Or is there a better place to find you?” I replied, gesturing at the staff.  
“Ah, sorry. Here’s good. I don’t really have anything I can do around here right now..,” she replied. \*Sigh\* I didn’t think I’d have to deal with a kid so soon after waking up in another world.

This long day was going to get longer…"

Fidelity CMA - Bill Pay vs Auto Payments,fidelityinvestments,1i863k3,2025-01-23 10:37:44,2,0.67,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/fidelityinvestments/comments/1i863k3/fidelity_cma_bill_pay_vs_auto_payments/,neouser9,Official Response,"Hi, I am planning to switch my checking account to CMA and my queries are related to the payments from CMA.

Currently, all my payments (credit card, mortgage, utility, etc) are done through auto payments enabled in respective vendor websites. (Eg. credit card payment is enabled for auto pay on their website based on their billing cycle by entering the routing+checking details).  

I saw posts related to Fidelity fraud getting triggered (causing amounts / payments to go on hold) when we try to pull money from the account (mostly, ACH transfers).  

1. So, to avoid similar situation, do I need to use Fidelity bill pay to make all payments and disable my autopay everywhere?  

2. are those fraud HOLD triggers only for ACH pull and NOT for ACH debits for payments initiated by vendors or companies? 

3. Also, many of the payment receivers doesn't share their routing/ account details. As per my understanding, in those cases Fidelity will send a check to them (which doesn't give me any assurance in payments made on time since checks once dispatched from fidelity is out of their control)? Not aware of any alternatives from Fidelity end.

3. Read somewhere about a situation where CMA debit for few cents from a billing company was rejected since it was not more than a dollar. And in that case, the user was mentioning that CMA can't be used as checking account.

Would appreciate clarifications or experience sharing."

Andrew Ironclaw scowled at the mirror as he, once again, tried to make his hair somewhat neat. Two years ago, he tried to use mousse to make his hair all stylish like some of the superstar heartthrobs some of his classmates were swooning. He went through two whole jars with the only result being his usual messy hair but now tacky and smelling of citrus. Such is the life of a werewolf it would seem. But Andrew wasn’t just any werewolf, he was the son of the alpha. And with that came a lot of responsibilities, and it sometimes terrified Andrew.

But werewolf duties would have to wait for typical teenager duties. After one last futile attempt at hair maintenance, Andrew went down his stairs, grabbing his backpack that he always hung on the ground newel of the stairs. He turned the corner to grab a quick apple from the kitchen when his father grunted as a way of greeting. 

“Morning,” Andrew replied, placing the apple into his pack. 

His father, Titus, glanced over his copy of the *Veronaville Gazette*, seemingly studying his son before asking, “Football practice tonight?”

Andrew nodded. “Yeah, right after school. Coach is probably going to push us hard to get ready for the upcoming game with the Wildcats.” Hopefully, mentioning that it’ll be a rough practice could convince Titus to postpone any werewolf-related jobs tonight.

Titus grunted again in acknowledgment before adding, “Then be home by eight. We’ve got work to do.” 

Yeah, figures. 

Andrew sighed but knew better to argue. He instead just nodded and made his way out the door. Andrew understood why his dad was strict about these duties, he really did. But maybe his dad was too strict? He could allow Andrew just one night of leisure, right? Yeah, fat chance. Sighing once more, Andrew hopped onto his bike and peddled down the hill and into the morning mist.



After a few minutes navigating the windy roads downhill, Andrew reached the Veronaville Diner. The light of its neon sign cascading through the mist beckoned to Andrew like a lighthouse to a lost ship. With his stomach grumbling, Andrew made his way in, the diner already buzzing with early morning regulars. The smell of greasy bacon and hot coffee enveloped Andrew like a warm blanket. This must be what heaven is like. Do werewolves even go to heaven? Andrew knew better than to ponder existential questions like this on an empty stomach, so he slid into an open stool at the counter.

“Morning, Reggie,” said Andrew. Reggie Finch, the enigmatic owner of the diner, glanced up as he filled a coffee pot. Wearing his usual mismatched attire of a white dress shirt, black slacks, a tie with strange designs on it (everyday there was a new tie) and his mismatched socks, Reggie wouldn’t look too dissimilar to one of the hipster friends Andrew’s older brother, Caleb, had made while living in Seattle. The only thing holding him back from fitting in entirely was his age. 

“Morning Andrew. You’re looking like someone carrying the world on his shoulders again. Coffee or cocoa?”

Andrew smirked. He always appreciated how attentive Reggie was. It didn’t hurt that Andrew came by to the diner at least twice a week. “Cocoa thanks, I’ve got enough energy for now.” 

Reggie nodded and slid an already prepared steaming mug toward him, along with a plate of scrambled eggs and toast. “Big day?” 

Andrew shrugged. “Same as always. School, practice, then… family stuff.”

Reggie’s eyes seemed to gleam, “Ah, family stuff. Funny how that can mean so many things to so many people.”

Andrew looked at Reggie puzzled while the eccentric man went to refill coffee mugs. He didn’t have much of a chance to ask him to clarify when he noticed the time and immediately wolfed down his breakfast, left cash for the bill, and bolted out the door.



Andrew pedaled as fast as he could, jumping off as he reached the school and barely managed to lock his bike and dart into the building by the time the first bell rang. He quickly stashed his backpack into his locker and bolted to class, just managing to slip into his seat by the time the final bell rang. His teacher, Mr. Hardy, looked unamused at the young werewolf.

“Nice of you to join us, Mr. Ironclaw.”

“Sorry,” muttered Andrew as he sank into his seat. For some reason, he always felt that Mr. Hardy had it out for him.

Class went on while Mr. Hardy droned on about the numerous European conflicts in history, but Andrew’s mind drifted elsewhere. His muscles still ached from last night’s werewolf training, and he knew that tonight’s training along with football practice will practically leave him in a vegetative state tomorrow. But what will he and his dad be doing tonight? Maybe snooping on some vampires? Andrew had overheard his dad mention something about the vampires making a move. Was the Vampire-Werewolf War finally making its way to Veronaville? Andrew didn’t know what to make of that. Some action to break up the monotony would be nice, but could he fight in a war?

“Andrew,” Mr. Hardy’s voice snapped Andrew out of his thoughts. “Care to enlighten us on the significance of the Treaty of Westphalia?”

Andrew blinked, his heart sinking as the rest of the class turned to him, eagerly waiting for the inevitable crash and burn. “Uh… something about ending a war?” Mr. Hardy sighed while a few of Andrew’s classmates snickered. Assholes. 

“It ended the Thirty Years’ War and established the concept of state sovereignty,” said Mr. Hardy. “Pay attention.”

Andrew nodded, his cheeks burning from embarrassment as he ducked his head, pretending to take notes on the “riveting” subject matter.



Lunch finally came and Andrew quickly grabbed his apple from his back and made his way to the cafeteria where he knew Zane and Elias would be waiting. All three were members of the school football team but their bonds were deeper than that. Zane was Andrew’s closest friend who also happened to be human. Elias was a member of Andrew’s pack, more or less being his younger cousin. He eagerly anticipated the ribbing and teasing that will be had at their table.

But before he could enjoy his break, Andrew was stopped by his science teacher, Ms. Wheeler.

“Andrew,” she called, stepping out of her classroom and waving him down. “Got a minute?”

Andrew sighed internally but forced a polite smile. It’ll just be a minute, it’s fine. Zane and Elias aren’t going anywhere.

“Sure thing Ms. Wheeler. What’s up?”

“You missed last week’s lab report,” she said, handing him a folder. “I need you to submit the report as well as go over these corrections. Then resubmit it tomorrow during class.”

Andrew nodded, taking the folder. Yeah, like he’ll have time to get this done after helping his father out. “Sorry about that. I’ve just been… busy. I’ll get this done as soon as I can.”

“I understand Andrew,” replied Ms. Wheeler, her tone softening. “But I know you’re capable of more than this. Don’t sell yourself short.”

“Thanks,” he muttered before making his way to the cafeteria, clutching the folder like it was a lead weight.



By the time he made it to the cafeteria, most of the tables had filled up. Luckily, he spotted Zane and Elias at their usual table. Andrew quickly got his food and made his way over.

“Look who’s late again,” teased Zane as he balanced a French fry on the edge of his tray.

“Had to talk to Ms. Wheeler about some stupid lap report I missed,” replied Andrew as he dropped his tray down and stole the fry, Zane staring at him with a betrayed expression.

“Classic Andrew,” said Elias. “You can’t seem to stay on top of things lately, can you?” Andrew shrugged and proceeded to dig in finally. Zane and Elias then delved into another heated debate on the best quarterback of the NFL.

He wasn’t wrong. Between his nearly nightly werewolf duties and the growing amount of homework and projects, Andrew felt like he was being crushed. Was this what his life would be from now on? Constantly having to put out different fires with no rest? Is this why his dad is usually an asshole?

As Andrew was thinking about his predicament, his gaze lazily drifted across the cafeteria before finding its way to Theo Ravencroft. The school’s resident rich boy, Theo was sitting a few tables away, quietly reading. Despite being the rich kid, Andrew often noticed Theo being by himself or sometimes with his sidekick, Marissa Vancea. So, it was no surprise that he was alone nor was Andrew shocked to see no remnants of a meal. After all, vampires like Theo didn’t really need to eat in the traditional sense, they only did it as a luxury and to maintain their cover. The thought of Theo’s true meal almost made Andrew lose his own meal. 

Andrew studied the young vampire, his tall thin frame, his almost porcelain-like skin, and piercing violet eyes seemed to make Theo into an alluring and mesmerizing figure ripped straight from one of the Gothic novels that Andrew was supposed to be reading for Ms. Hayes’ class. And of course, his black hair was all neat and perfectly styled!

Suddenly, Theo looked up from his book and their eyes met. It was probably only a second, but time seemed to have halted for Andrew before Theo looked away, his face unreadable. Andrew frowned but he wasn’t sure why. It would be best if Andrew kept his distance from Theo anyways. If the war ever reached Veronaville, it would be expected for Andrew and Theo, both the heirs to their respective sides, to fight in the war, possibly meeting on the battlefield.

“What are you staring at?” asked Zane.

“Nothing,” muttered Andrew, turning his focus back to his food.



Football practice was as grueling as Andrew expected. Coach Barkley had them run endless drills, trying his hardest to make the team master teamwork and precision. His efforts weren’t for nothing, Andrew could notice the slight improvement in the team’s performance. He also could feel the bruises forming after repeated tackles. Finally, the practice was over, and Andrew made his way to the showers.

“Great work today, Ironclaw!” Coach Barkley said as Andrew ran by, stopping him mid-sprint. Andrew smiled and nodded before resuming his run. Despite the much-needed praise, Andrew’s mind wandered as the sun dipped lower over the horizon. He felt the pull of the moon, a subtle hum in his veins, reminding him of his true nature and the work that still needed to be done.



By the time Andrew came home, the last remnants of the sun’s light were beginning to fade as the moon continued her climb. As he peddled into the driveway, he saw his father waiting for him on the porch.

“You’re late,” said Titus, his voice stern and laced with annoyance.

Andrew glanced at his watch. 8:30. Seriously? Andrew sighed, “Coach kept us longer.” Andrew parked his bike and made his way up the steps, opening the front door and placing his backpack at its usual spot.

“No excuses. Let’s go.”

“Yes, sir.”

The two trekked deep into the nearby woods, the cool night air giving Andrew some relief from his exhausting day. As they walked, Titus explained what needed to be done—an inspection of the outer edges of the woods to make sure no creatures or other packs encroached into their territory. A simple task but one that Andrew knew would last a few hours. Joy. The werewolves made the route through the forest but again Andrew’s mind wandered.

“Andrew, pay attention,” snapped Titus when Andrew nearly tripped over a root.

“Sorry,” muttered Andrew as he refocused.

They came to a clearing when they spotted claw marks on some of the trees. Titus knelt to examine the ground beneath the marred trees, sniffing the area. “Fresh scent,” he muttered.

Andrew knelt beside him, picking up the scent thanks to his heightened senses. The moon cycles determined the strength of all werewolf abilities with the full moon giving them their most potent burst of power and the new moon at their weakest. Luckily for Andrew and Titus, the moon tonight was at Waning Gibbous. More than enough for their task to find the possible intruder.

“Most likely a solo traveler,” Titus concluded. “We still shouldn’t take any chances. Let’s remind them which pack lives here and mark the trees.”

Andrew grounded himself, his knees bent as he extended his claws and began marking the nearby trees while his father began setting up scent barriers. The two worked in silence save for the scratching of bark and occasional rustle of leaves as the two made their way through the trees. Normally the silence would be welcomed by Andrew were it not for the restless mind he’s had all day. Countless thoughts swirled in his head, but one moment kept repeating: the brief glance from Theo during lunch. Andrew never truly noticed Theo before; he didn’t really care much for him and his rich buddy Marissa. His aloofness always seemed to be more of a sign of Theo’s perceived superiority over the rest of the school, especially against the werewolves. And yet, he kept picturing his stunning violet eyes.

“You’ve been distracted all day, son,” said Titus, snapping Andrew back to attention. He winced, expecting another lecture. “Is there something you want to talk about?”

Well, that was not all what Andrew thought he would say. Is his dad actually wanting to have a conversation with him? Yeah, there is a lot on his mind. But what could Andrew talk about with his dad?

“Do you ever think…” Andrew started before hesitating. Is it even worth bringing this up with him? “I mean, do you ever wonder what life would be like to just…” he gestured to the woods around them, “Not have to do these things every night? That… maybe we can live out a normal life?”

Titus immediately stopped his work, turning to Andrew, their amber eyes meeting. “This is who we are, Andrew,” he said, firmly. “The world we live in, you can’t run from it. You have to meet it head on and deal with the repercussions afterwards.”

Andrew didn’t reply. He simply returned to his work all while the weight of his father’s words settled in, his heart falling.



By the time they had marked every tree they could and left as many scent barriers as Titus could bring, the moon was high overhead. The two made their way back home in complete silence. Once home, Andrew immediately retreated to his room, threw off his shirt and fell onto his bed, the need to fully disrobe melting away from the contact with his soft mattress. Every muscle in his body ached but he managed to turn onto his back and kick off his pants.

As he pulled over the covers, his mind once again raced with the events of the day—the judgmental gaze of Mr. Hardy, the heavy expectations hoisted onto him by his father, Coach Barkley’s praise, the fleeting gaze from Theo. He reached over and turned off the light on his nightstand, but not before giving a gentle kiss to the picture next to him. The woman on it forever smiling.

Andrew sighed, his eyelids growing heavy. Tomorrow will be another long day. But for now, he let himself drift into a dreamless sleep."
[5e][Online][GMT +1] Players for second Homebrew Spelljammer D&D campaign,LFG_Europe,1i84jig,2025-01-23 09:27:10,2,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/LFG_Europe/comments/1i84jig/5eonlinegmt_1_players_for_second_homebrew/,DeadlyNadder,Closed,"Hello Everyone,

We are looking for 3 new players to join for our second Homebrew Spelljammer D&D campaign.

Recently we completed our 1st campaign spanning over 2 years. The second campaign will take place in the same world and setting, but in a new location / faction, it is a perfect time for new people to join. Campaign 2 will be divided into chapters aiming for 3-6 sessions in length. At the start of a chapter you can decide to make a new character or continue with your existing character. At the end of a chapter we will level up - starting at level 2.

### Timeslot: GMT +1 (CET) 20:30 on Friday

### Requirements / Rules:

- Age minimum 18+

- No romantic roleplay.

- We are LGBT friendly.

- New Player friendly. Though, be warned Spelljammer is a bit of a difficult place to start. Since we start at level 2 it should be feasable.

- No Webcam.

- Microphone required.

- Software: Discord, DND beyond, and Owlbear (subscriptions are not required).

- If a player is disruptive or inappropriate during or after the game in any way let the GM know. The focus should be on making an enjoyable experience for everyone!

- Ruleset: We will start out using the 5e D&D 2024 rules.
Depending on how the group feels we may use some old rules for specific things or switch back to the 2014 rule set. For spelljammer mechanics we intend to use (some) 2nd edition rules for spacetravel / combat. Generally to flesh out the spacefaring, since we found it to be very lacking in the 5e release.

- Banned Species: Hadozee, Legacy Aarakocra.
GM (me): ""I'd like to disincentivize anyone from playing an elf / half elf for Chapter 1. (because we played with 2 Astral Elves for +/- 2 years).
They don't make as much sense in the setting (Giff focus), but if you can come up with a good backstory to play one after chapter 1 we can make it happen.""

## Background

Our campaign does not use: galaxies, solar systems, or planets. Instead the Astral Sea has many city's and other smaller locations. The Astral Sea has limited resources that put a strain on its inhabitants. Typically resources that can be found are remnants from other dimensions (perhaps due to dimensional tears or other anomalies).

###There are 5 major factions:

-.  Giff ""The Crimson Horde""- Military focus - Previously at war with the Astral Elves / Io. The war cost the lives of a great number of Giff, and low birthrates meant that the Giff were forced to except more ""fragile"" sentients into their society. This is a trend that will continue; within 2 generations it is projected that other species will out number the Giff 5-1. As a Giff grows older and begins to slow down, they are possessed with the idea of proving themselves still young and vital - usually in battle. As a result, there are very, very few old giff.
Giff still tend to out rank other sentients within their military society.
The inclusion of new cultures and their knowledge has resulted in rapid technological growth.
- Paramex Command - Is the focus of Campaign 2.
Effectively a Military base near the Giff Capitol ""New Spark"". PARAMEX has a complicated organization structure spanning many departments: Counter Intelligence Division, Alchemy Department, Zoology Division, Tactical Response Team, Anomaly Response Team, etc. For Chapter 1 - You are an agent of Paramex Command's Tactical Response team.

-.  Io - Astal Elves - Mageocracy lead by king Miran'Veimar and the High Mages of the Academy of Arcanium. Very traditional.

-.  ASTARIUS MEGACORP - Massive Corporation founded by the Dwarves that settled in the Astral Sea. Profited massively from the War between Giff and Io in the past.
Controls most valuable resources in the Astral Sea. When both Giff and Io were unable to pay out certain loans the Corporation took territory from them as collateral.

-.  Freespace - Independent yet organised group of Freefolk, controls less valuable regions, economically relies on sustainably farming the Astral Whales that still exist in their region of space.

-.  The Shaar - Collective term (used by the average sentient) for all Thri-Kreen dominated sectors. Considered very hostile an dangerous.

However in reality a Shaar sector may contain many hives, with each a unique culture.

Surrounding our known space is Deep Space. A dangerous mysterious deadzone - void of light and living creatures. Each year the borders of Deep Space creep in slightly closer.

    Feels like I'm falling, through the graveyard I'm crawling, Stars burn bright, universe and planets in flight. As they laugh thinking I'm joking, I'm hurting so I cut them all as I sever the ties slowly. The  chosen, the lost, the unholy, ""The Hell Hound Militia""

    Ride around with the shadows, not making a sound,  
Hunting for graves... insanity robbing the remnants of sanity. Warlord engraved right across this mask, deeply embedded, strangling my face, a visage of torment forged in malice. Hidden depths emerging from a natural psychotic violent twisting place. Found a corpse hole in the face, trying to talk when shot in the brain. Maniacally laughing as I see their bodies in the rain, the downpour mingling with the blood, a grotesque ballet of death. Let the demons guide my steps, the true and insane. Whispers of the damned echo in the hollows of my mind, their voices a symphony of chaos, each note a taunt, a relentless chant drawing me deeper into madness. Nothing left but to devour all in my merciless domain. A kingdom built on despair, where nightmares feast, I revel in the carnage, the cries of the dying.Every wail a hymn, every struggle a twisted pleasure, embraced by the shadows, anointed by darkness. Here, I reign unchallenged, consumed by my vile hunger, in this abyss, I find my purpose, my mission to obliterate, to annihilate, to revel in the void.

    Now I’m lookin’ at you, a fleeting vision, I gather her up fast. Sacred thoughts swarm my mind so I float my hand on her throat. Enjoy the slow stimulation, suspended in a haze of wicked desire. She dances so close to all I see... nothing left besides me, love it, despise it, but like a frantic fiend, I demand more. Her essence intoxicating, a heavy mix of anguish and allure. She smiles not of her own, death's sweet incision surrounding her domain, with a haunting echo of fate, the soft whispers of the grave beckons her near. Reality lost, no longer remains, slipping through my fingers like sand. Red seeps deep, like blood through cloth, a tapestry of despair I keep, full control of all I possess, yet I weave my own chains of torment. Can’t escape my futile dreams, dark whispers weave spells around my soul, love entwined with death's relentless toll, a grotesque dance of longing. I love the witch of death, feverishly bubbling within me, her dark magic coursing through my veins like poison. I am the Dark Angel only I can see, a specter cloaked in grim elegance. I scream, the sound of my own damnation each echo a testament to my twisted desires, in this hellish embrace, I find my truth, alover of shadows, a harbinger of despair, forever bound to this darkened fate.

    Relentlessly popping ketamine, mixing it with the alchemy of despair, mysteries attempting to unfold like dark petals, revealing secrets. My grip on sanity slips, losing my mind's vision, now I’m jumping off the balcony, surrendering to the abyss. Mind fractured, in turmoil unbound, a cacophony of screams within. Unearthed, I’m losing my mind, I need help, but the darkness taunts.  draining my soul's mana, need some health, a desperate plea for salvation as shadows gather, suffocating the flicker of light. Death, send me a potion to gain me some wealth, a twisted bargain with fate. God’s eyes avoid my stare, the divine turning its back on my plight. Fists up, asking, ""How you gonna kill me?"" in my resenting defiance. No fear, for death rides with me, a specter whispering sweet nothings, o I’ll just end it myself, embracing the cold kiss of oblivion, a surrender to the void, where pain finds bliss. In this dark symphony, I dance with the demons of my soul, each step a descent into madness, reveling in my eternal fall.

    Tiptoeing into the dark forest where I feel free, Demons wait in the moonlight, their eyes gleaming with hunger like hyenas, they attack ferociously, slitting and cutting body and mind, anticipating my slow demise, the feast of despair unravels. Like a newborn, I cling to where I belong, all I know my comfortable form, a cocoon of suffering and solace.""Can you hear that noise?"" ... the ruckus outside my mind's window, a cacophony of tormented souls, their wails weaving through the trees. Tattoos upon my skin, the only story I’ve known, each mark a testament to the battles fought and lost. 

    Hatred shadows me, dark as the crow circling above, its wings whispering secrets of a suicide flow. An omen gliding through the starlit gloom, seeking its next offering. In this sinister sanctuary, a loyal specter, the forest breathing around me, a living entity of anguish, , the air thickens with dread. The moon, a cruel voyeur, bathes me in melancholy light. I wade deeper into the chaos, seduced by the darkness, each step tethered to the ungodly vividly dancing with my demons, the ground soaked in the blood of those who sought to escape, their ghosts entwining with mine, a chorus of lost hopes, this macabre realm. I am alive yet dead, bound to the shadows, where freedom is a mirage, the only truth: I belong to the night, a wanderer despair, forever searching for solace. Yet finding only echoes of my own surrender, as the forest swallows me whole, a final resting embrace.

    Screaming, ""I don't wanna die,"" a wretched cry from my hollow core, Since birth, I’ve lurked in shadows, lonely and  consumed. ""What path is true in this twisted maze of despair""...""Where does my life even start""...""My ending shrouded in silence"" Amidst this cursed ride, losing my mind, spiraling into the graveyard. The strings of this fragile life, ""Fate’s cruel grip or chance’s mockery"" ""Is there meaning in this torment, or are we mere playthings in an endless night"" thoughts swirl like dead fish in a impassable storms, suffocating under their malignant weight. Trapped in shadows, forever cursed to question my wretched existence.

    In the depths of this abyss, where laughter turns to mockery, wandering through the ruins of my own soul, a twisted specter of despair. The darkness wraps around me like a shroud, cold and suffocating every heartbeat a countdown, every breath a struggle against the weight. The stars, hide behind black veils, watching as I descend deeper into this eternal night no mercy awaits in this desolate void, only echoes of torment and an ever deepening fracture of a remnant of what was, stalking the shadows, my kin in oblivion. Trapped in a pulse of anguish, devoid of light, bound to the shadows, forever lost. A chilling testament to a soul abandoned, my existence, a feast of despair and within its grasp, I find no resolution, no escape, just the consuming dark.

    Feels like I'm falling, through the graveyard I'm crawling, stars burn bright, each a cruel reminder, universe and planets in flight. As they laugh, thinking I'm joking, their ignorance a dagger in my aching heart, I'm hurting, so I cut them all, severing the ties slowly, methodically. Each slice a whisper of rebellion, each drop of blood a silent scream. I am the chosen. I am the cursed. I am the inaccessible..... burdened with this blackened FATE, I AM ""THE HELL HOUND MILITIA""

Im 19 (M) and recently decided to distant myself from my 4 year old relationship (20) F. But I don’t know if I’m making a mistake.,relationships,1i7x2b3,2025-01-23 01:13:48,0,0.33,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1i7x2b3/im_19_m_and_recently_decided_to_distant_myself/,iAlxhh21,,"For some context, I’m 19(M), she is currently 20(F) 

I met her about 4 years ago, we been together even since but I did fucked up, not cheating wise but personally wise, I had a lot of battling with me mind during my early teen years, I had sudden episodes of depression and depersonalization, and I needed up 3-4 months in a psych ward. I eventually went back to life but I really never been the same, I got a lil chubby and I don’t feel great about myself. 
But even after all this she stayed there, we tried really hard to have a good relationship but it seems like she never got over the fact that I “left” for those months that I was in psych ward. 
It’s been a whole year if not more of her being different always fighting and never seem to be happy where she’s at. 
But then all of the sudden she would be the best gf in the world. 
So after all this on and off for about a year I needed ended up having another episode of my “depression” and I stopped talking to everyone and couldn’t get better. Well that lasted about 3 weeks, and she decided to leave. 
I respected it, I knew it was my mistake for not being stable mentally at this point of life, but then she after about one month of no contact she called me with the excuse of helping her cousin get a phone line with my provider, I genially agree since I wanted to get her back into my life, I literally loved her to a point that I cared more about her than my own self. 
She started talking back to me and we ended up tying things out again but slowly, I decided to go visit her on a weekend and she agreed, we had a great time, everything was normal and in a good shape. I even decided to go back the next weekend, and suddenly something changed, I don’t remember how I found out, but during the 3-4 weeks I was having my last ever episode of depression she talked to a different guy, a guy that years ago when we first started talking tried fighting me bc “he liked her too” that really broke me. But we talked, she said many things to me about her mental health and how she was feeling I told her I was going to help her out. I ended up helping her find a therapist that she could talk to. 
We kept trying and even tho it did bothered a lot still that she talked to that guy I was trying to see the good side of things since I loved her so much. 
I started seeing a change in her personality, I’m Hispanic and so is she but to put a quick example her music taste change from Lana de el Rey vibes to sexy red vibes. 
She was not the same aesthetic and different to the other girls I saw on her before. 
 Even tho we were talking she still had me blocked on all social but WhatsApp. Welp few days later she started posting quotes on X and for some reason this quotes or notes she was posting there were somehow directo to the “guy” she talked to. 
I pointed it out and all I got from was an argument and for her not to talk to me. 
She keeps saying that he is no one in her life and that she wants to the things ride but I just couldn’t feel it :( 
I feel betrayed and even tho she swears they never kissed or anything happened deep down I think it did. 
I distanced myself from her, and I later found out she was hurting herself and took some pills that made her land in the hospital. 
After this I never reached out to her but kept in touch with her family since they seem to like me a lot. She ended up calling me to ask about the phone bill. ( I been paying for the past 2-3 months we didn’t talk to each other) and somehow that phone call also ended up on her being mad at me for asking why she talked to that guy. 
 

Listen I know I fucked it up early in the relationship by not being the most stable person mentally but I did my best to recover her love, I have flowers, gifts, dates, everything in my power to demonstrate her that i was becoming a better person in other boys a MAN. 
Now the last thing we talked about is how she betrayed me and till this date she doesn’t agree with the fact that she talked to someone else, every time I remember her what she did she comes with the excuse of that she was in a bad situation, alone and needed attention. But never ever apologized for doing it even tho she sweared she loved me and wanted to work things out. 
I ended up distancing myself again but I can’t stop thinking about her everyday. She’s on my mind all the time and even tho I’m working on myself by hitting the gym and focusing on my college it seems like I’ll never get over her. 
She was my first ever true love, the only person I trusted and the person who I thought of marrying, I left my parents house to prove her that I was independent and that is still a bad decision to this day.
Now I’m just the bad guy of the story, she says that whenever she landed in the hospital I was never there for her like she was, but she tried committing not even 2 weeks after months of me trying my best to get her back.    
She seems to be happy and in peace, even my mom told me that they saw each other and she seems great. 
I hate being in this situation, I don’t see a future where I would ever love someone else, or even worst get to see her move on and get together with someone else. 
I know I’m young and that there’s a lot of life ahead of me but my heart is too stupid to let people go. 


TL;DR! Was the smartest thing to move on? I pretty much feel like I made a really big deal of her talking to someone else, since deep down I do believe nothing ever happened between them. But I don’t know if it would be smart to be with that someone and have this ache on my heart that I was already betrayed."

When to Jump Ship? Follow Up,estimators,1i7tj1q,2025-01-22 21:50:13,30,1.0,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/estimators/comments/1i7tj1q/when_to_jump_ship_follow_up/,BrooklynBuild,,"Roughly 5 month ago I made a post asking for advice about leaving the company I worked for. I thank you all for the many great replies. As of this week (Monday) I started back with my old company (a group I helped form back in 2022) and I couldn’t be happier. I took a slight pay cut to come back but money isn’t everything, and I have my freedom back. In 2022 and 2023 I worked from home and really only had to work 3-4 days a week, we only had 2 crews to keep busy. In 2024 I switched companies when I moved 5 hours away.

I soon learned in 2024 I had made a mistake, the company I went to didn’t pay vendors on time (or at all), we had liens against jobs, and funding new jobs was always a chore. I had to constantly lie to customers and blame the suppliers as to why we weren’t on the job. I’m a young guy in the industry (a niche one at that “Division 34”) and I couldn’t stand my name getting dragged through the mud for stuff I didn’t do.

My old company and I finally came to an agreement on terms of work and pay a few weeks back and last week I offered my two weeks but quit the next day as I haven’t done anything since Christmas…. I left the old group with $1.5mil worth of work.

So what am I getting at? If you hate your job don’t stay, find something else. Driving home with an aching chest and everyday is not worth it. Telling you wife to quit asking you about your day is no way to go through life.

I stuck it out because I knew something else would come along but damn I couldn’t have been happier to leave. It wasn’t a bad job on paper and not much was asked of me, as I was a self starter and found my own work. But after I learned how the company conducted business it was hard to get motivated to find them more work, just for them to screw it up and muddy my name. We  had a multiple state radius in the Midwest. Anywhere from New Mexico to Pennsylvania, we had our hands in it. Thankful for the opportunities and exposure to new contacts but good riddance…."

Cash Account for Emergency Savings?,wealthfront,1i7t7dd,2025-01-22 21:33:35,5,0.78,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/wealthfront/comments/1i7t7dd/cash_account_for_emergency_savings/,Grumpy_F0X,,"Hi people of reddit!

I've come to ask strangers on the internet for advise/recommendations.

For years I have been using Connex Credit Union's Mini Money Market (MMM) account as storage for my emergency funds. I use a completely sperate bank, Liberty Bank (LB) specifically, for all of my checking general spending and bill paying.

I have gotten up to almost $10k in my emergency fund and, while I love Connex and totally recommend them, the intrest on any of their savings accounts, and this MMM is pitiful. I'm making a whopping $3/mo.

So I've been looking for a new home for my emergency fund where it can sit and, hopefully do nothing for a long time, and grow. NerdWallet pointed me to Discover, CapitalOne, CIT, SoFi, but eventually several searches have lead me here to WealthFront (WF). I see WF mentioned by at least a handful of people everywhere I search for savings accounts.

Additionally, I fully intend on keeping LB for my checking and billpay needs. I want WF to be completely isolated from where I usually spend money. I also have no intention of using their investment options.

That said, I do have some concerns that I'd like some existing customers to maybe speak on:

Q1: I've heard repeatedly that WF is technically not a bank, and they store money in partner banks, which is how they get their FDIC insurance. Because of this, however, I've heard some horror stories about people trying to do ACH transfers, and suddenly that have $2k held up in limbo because of one of their partner banks not letting go of the money, and the best WF can do is say ""we're looking into it.""  Has anyone run into trouble when transfering between banks, or losing access to their money at all? Obviously, wanting to use this as my EMERGENCY fund, losing access for even a couple days could end up being a big problem should such an emergency arise.

Q2: The fine print is a little confusing, so I'm looking to see if someone has just experienced a limit in how much cash you can withdraw from an ATM at once, or in one day. I imagine a scenario where a home repair can be performed faster if I provide someone cash, and I'd need to go to an ATM to grab say $3k in cash immediately. I know some bank's HYS have a small cash withdrawl limit, which isn't ideal in this scenario. Theoretically, if I have the ability to instant transfer between banks, I could just transfer $3k from WF tomy LB account, and then go withdraw from my LB branch, but I'd like to know what the ATM processes are and what your experiences have been.

Q3: Customer service. What is there live, real, human customer service like? I can only seem to find a way to email customer service. Do they have a phone number? What are their call center's hours?

Q4: I've heard their APY dipped from 5% to 4.5% recently-ish. To those that have had WF for several years, does their APY change very often?

Q5: What's with the sloth wearing a jetpack that appears and follows your cursor when you're at the bottom of their home page? I mean, I obviously approve, but is it WF's mascot or something?

Q6: If all this makes you think, maybe WF isn't for me, do you have any suggestions as to where else I should look into?  
...

I rarely post on Reddit, so I apoligize for this being a long one, but I thank all of you for your help! I'm kind of ready to pull the trigger, but with this being a huge amount of money that I'll have to move to a ""non-bank,"" I'm really nervous."

Am I being scammed? Recently moved off UpWork with an employer,Scams,1i7rshb,2025-01-22 20:23:32,0,0.4,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1i7rshb/am_i_being_scammed_recently_moved_off_upwork_with/,Royal-Limit-5612,Help Needed,"Hi!

I really need a job right now and LinkedIn hasn’t been working so I recently got a little traction with UpWork.

I have 10 years selling software in San Francisco so I’m really shocked at how hard it’s been.

Luckily, I did relocate to Tennessee, so it’s cheaper, but I feel I’m struggling at the bottom of the barrel.

Recently, I got a couple contracts off UpWork.

The one we’ll be discussing today, we’ll call him Sanders.

Sanders hired me for 1 week on UpWork and has paid me 20 bucks an hour for 2 days for 5 days on UpWork.

No problem.

At the end of the week he says I did great, which I did do pretty good doing cold calling and setting appointments for him, and he wants to hire me full time, but only for 2k/month.

This is a bit of an insult to me, but, it’s something to start with, and it’s easy for me to do it at the same time as other Upwork contracts/interviews. So I agreed to roughly 5/6 hours a day for 2k/month, and we’ve moved off UpWork.

I actually sort of suggested it, but he first asked me if I wanted to be on or off UpWork and I said on. 

He said let’s start on and move off.

That’s the agreement.

We talk every day and go over our calls.

His website doesn’t look great, but he apparently does have a couple of contracts generating leads with a couple businesses.

And his LinkedIn and real company he works for looks real. He’s supposedly a VP for one company.

But he’s hired me to help him with his tiny business he’s trying to start.

So I got an email address and some other credentials to login to, we’re doing daily updates, but when I got this email from him I got a little spooked:

————

I will need account and routing #'s for ACH/ direct deposit 

Also name of the bank

————

Is this standard stuff I’m over thinking? In my head, it all sort of makes sense. He’s trying to start a first business, doesn’t have much infrastructure setup, hence the low pay, but it’s at least *something*

I’m dying for work right now

How bad will it be if I share this information with him?

What risks am I facing if I do?

I suggested Venmo or PayPal or Zelle and he said he’s open to it but might need a w9 from me.

Is this a scam?

Also I called his supposed real employer and pretended I was someone else and asked for him. They did actually go to transfer me and I hung up."
"Hello, every year around the time that I came out, I make sure to review messages that were sent to me by lovely family members :) it has been about 8 years but they still try to gaslight me from time to time. Enjoy this letter from my sperm donor :)",Exvangelical,1i7rohz,2025-01-22 20:18:06,38,0.95,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Exvangelical/comments/1i7rohz/hello_every_year_around_the_time_that_i_came_out/,Blue_Dragon3,Discussion,"Good Morning Son,

You have been on my mind a lot over the last few days and I just wanted to reach out to you.  No matter what I say I am afraid that you will twist it around and miss what I am really saying but I’m going to try anyway.

I would love to be happy about you getting married and be involved in that.  However I think that even if I turned away from all my convictions as it seems that you want me to I don’t think that you would be happy or that we would be any closer.  You know my convictions and beliefs there is no reason to re-hash that.  I’m not going to change you and I’m not even trying to.  I would appreciate the same respect from you.  You have made choices, as a grown man you get to do that.  We don’t have to agree.  I am friends with a lot of people I don’t see eye to eye with.  I wish you could back off from the all or nothing stance that you have taken and meet in the middle.

Here is an example.   SG and SP were friends with some teenage girls from the church when I was, Kinder aged.  These girls had a little brother who in his 20’s came out as gay.  His name was Danny.  Danny and his sisters were very good friends of our family when I was a kid.  Danny knew that SG, SP, his parents and his sisters did not condone his lifestyle but they still loved him and wanted him in their lives.   An unspoken agreement was reached and to this day all parties still get along.  In our trips to Colorado I still see Danny and his sisters, now all nearly 60 years old when I can.  The agreement was that Danny would not promote his lifestyle or bring “partners” to family gatherings.   The rest of us agreed not to be critical of him, make jokes, or try and otherwise change him.  Each side respected each other and a relationship was preserved.  When this came down I was pretty young but I remember the initial shockwave to everyone then we all got past it.  No one had to change.  That is what we want from you.

It is not being disrespectful to you for us to request you to respect our wishes in our home and we will not be disrespectful of the choices you are making that we don’t agree with.  There are lot of other things happening that are far bigger than this.  Danny kept his life outside of the family as his own thing and to this day no one in that family tries to change him, its been so long that its not even noticed anymore.  The rules are mutually respected and second nature.

How come we cannot have this?  Why are you forcing us into the corner of all or nothing in having a relationship with you?  You are unfairly trying to get us to forget some of our deepest convictions because you don’t like the way we believe.  On the other hand we’ve not asked you not to be gay.  We’ve not ever said to you, ""choose between us or being gay"".  All that we have asked since this started is for you to maintain a relationship with us that is not centered around being gay, your support for it and our convictions against it.  You have made this so much harder and more painful than it ever needed to be.  

You are missing so much that is happening in your family, not because you are gay but because you have chosen to make that the center piece of everything relating to us.  The fact is we’ve not changed.  The parents that you respected a year ago are still here, the siblings that you were close to are still here doing what we do, living each day.

The past, I refer to is the months since you made this announcement and have been so angry with us, cannot be changed.  In this context looking forever in the rearview mirror means you are missing what is out in front and will crash.

Son, our arms are open.  We want to have you in our lives.  We aren’t going to argue and try to change you please don’t try to change us and lets just have a good relationship.   Please, we miss you son and our heart aches from your exclusion from all things family.

I love you son, I hope that you have a good day and I hope that you can see my heart, here, I’m not trying to change you.  Changes to people other than myself is above my pay grade.

- your Dad 

For context SG and SP are his parents :) "
