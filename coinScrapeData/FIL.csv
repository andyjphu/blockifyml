Exploring crypto incentives for decentralization and community support,ClearlightStudios,1i7qjke,2025-01-22 19:24:10,3,0.67,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClearlightStudios/comments/1i7qjke/exploring_crypto_incentives_for_decentralization/,pfunksozy,,"## Little intro and some qualifiers:
It’s been a long time since I have posted anything substantial anywhere, but I’m practicing following the thread of what lights me up, and this is very much that. I just became aware of this movement through u/NoWord423 TTs. It’s something that, like for a lot of others, has been very alive in my mind lately.

I want to start by being upfront that I do have a reasonably strong tech background, but more in hardware and robotics stuff related to academic research, so I’m owning that I am somewhat out of my depth in terms of the technical and organizational feasibility of what I’m proposing here. Also, I want to be transparent that I relied on GPT for help getting a lay of the land, so my grasp of some of the details is pretty superficial.

---

## The idea:
I’ve been considering the potential for incorporating a crypto-based currency in this type of distributed grass-roots platform. Specifically, an approach where users would be incentivized to contribute storage and compute power through tokens tied to the platform’s own cryptocurrency, which could also support creators, moderators, and developers.

### In essence, the proposal involves:
- Allowing users to “host” content (storage) and handle compute tasks on their devices (or nodes).
- Rewarding these contributions with a token unique to the platform.
- Leveraging that token to financially support content creators, moderators, and devs.
- Ultimately reducing reliance on centralized infrastructure and financial systems.

I’ve skimmed the posts and the materials put together by u/Ally_Madrone. If I understand correctly, the idea is to use IPFS for decentralized content storage and NerdNode for distributed compute tasks. So it seems there is already an intention to utilize some form of peer-to-peer (P2P) approach, though I’m unclear if the intention is to utilize user devices or dedicated nodes (e.g., servers) for hosting. I’m assuming the former given the spirit of the movement.

There are existing platforms that combine parts of this idea. Filecoin rewards users with FIL tokens for hosting data using IPFS. Steemit incentivizes creators with STEEM tokens. Blockchain-based platforms like DTube and LBRY use decentralized storage and crypto incentives but focus more on content hosting and monetization than large-scale P2P resource sharing with social engagement. None fully combine these elements into a cohesive model, which could be a “key differentiator” for this platform; though not sure how strongly that case can be made. Regardless, it seems a plausible means to support the (primary?) goal to free the platform from dependency on centralized infrastructure and financial systems.

---

## Recognizing the risk:
Like others, despite positives of the ideology of crypto, my distaste for a lot of that world stems from the ecological disconnect and the culture that seems to surround it; which just feels like more hoarding and trading imaginary assets based in proof-of-work approaches that are further fucking the environment without adding real substantive value. The idea of tying a currency to something prosocial, with its value grounded in necessary resource contributions, is deeply compelling to me and something I’ve been passively pondering for a while. This approach seems like a way of getting at that.

I’m also hyper vigilant of not falling prey to a slow burn into something for-profit, or, more broadly, something that retains too much of the corrupting influences we are trying to escape. I’m primarily motivated by the potential of digital currencies to enable a platform like this to be truly self-supporting and decoupled from outside dependencies that make it vulnerable to the powers that be.

It’s also important to note that for the currency to effectively support community members and potentially offset unavoidable costs within the current system, it would need to be tradable on public markets. This introduces the challenge of ensuring the currency remains safeguarded against oligarchic control or manipulation, preserving its integrity as a tool for empowering the community rather than another means for wealth hoarding.

Additionally, there are a lot of unknowns (for me at least) in terms of addressing scalability, fraud prevention, regulatory compliance, handling potential disputes and educating users in how to work with the currency.

---

## Technical details (pretty simplistic right now):
To integrate a P2P model into the existing plans, the platform could extend its use of IPFS for decentralized storage by users, if that was not already the plan, and incentivize users to host and pin content. This would require a system to track storage contributions (e.g., GB stored and uptime) and reward participants appropriately. Similarly, compute tasks currently handled by NerdNode (e.g., video transcoding) could be distributed to user devices using a P2P compute framework (e.g., Golem) or a custom solution. I am unclear what the dev challenges of this would be.

A blockchain-based token system would automate these rewards via smart contracts, ensuring transparency and security. Tokens could be managed through an integrated wallet within the app, and used fluidly within the app as well as traded on public marketplaces. It’s worth noting that we would likely want to rely on an existing blockchain (e.g., Ethereum), though this could itself create a vulnerability.

---

## Bigger picture (little self-indulgent so feel free to skip):
I’m motivated by the question of how to provide tangible support to the community and its bigger collective vision in a broader sense. At the risk of exposing the degree of borderline woo-woo energy I’ve been feeling around this period of collective death and rebirth, I do believe - and know I’m not alone - that we are in the process of a massive state change where small movements will have huge ripples forward.

Like many of those in this collective, I feel the vertigo of trying to ride this swell of hope while simultaneously feeling our continued descent into the darkest forms of control and greed. In this breaking though, I deeply believe the rising collective disgust and disillusionment with the old way makes a platform like this absolutely inevitable. The world needs a global hub to incubate the new vision of what human life can be - unencumbered by concepts like nation states and safe from power structures that have become pathological. To the point, whatever truly grass-roots, collectivist platform, or platforms, hit that inflection point of a critical mass adoption will have a yet unknowable impact on how things unfold into the shape of the next era.

On pragmatic grounds, what I’ve described seems plausible, and if it’s tractable, I see a nascent potential to contribute to the exploration of more sustainable grassroots economies. To collaborate effectively in a global village like the one this platform aims to create, we still need some means of tracking energy exchange. Ideally something that we control and can use for leverage in the existing system. Something that to siphon hoarded energy/resources to be repurposed and redistributed for what comes next. We want to create a space that can help to consolidate the like minded and nurture this cultural evolution with more truly democratic systems of governance. What I would add is that this could also be a space to experiment with new economies that can seed the next paradigm.

---

## TL;DR:
Proposal to use our own crypto to incentivize user-based compute/storage and engagement... and maybe fund the new new-world order.

---

## Feedback:
Any is welcome but first and foremost:
- Does this align with the goals of the platform?
- Do folks feel the approach is at least feasible?
- What challenges or opportunities do folks see in implementing such an approach?

Even if the consensus is this is a non-starter, it was still fun to have an excuse to get into this space with y'all <3"

"$MicroGPT has no army. It's an actual company with a working product, and could be the next $filecoin + ChatGPT Marsshot!",CryptoMarsShots,1ht1kl8,2025-01-03 19:23:37,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarsShots/comments/1ht1kl8/microgpt_has_no_army_its_an_actual_company_with_a/,HumblestofBears,DISCUSSION,"When I was researching $MicroGPT to consider whether it was a decent moonshot, the best token comparison I found was $Filecoin, in my opinion. Both offer a critical service to technology professionals, and both lean on the blockchain for decentralized processing power. $Filecoin, launched in 2020, tackled a massive inefficiency: centralized cloud storage. By building a decentralized network, it lets people monetize their unused storage space and earn FIL tokens. It’s like Airbnb, but for your hard drive. The result? Reduced reliance on Big Tech’s storage monopolies, better data security, and redundancy that’s light-years ahead of traditional systems. With a market cap exceeding $3 billion, $Filecoin is a great example of how early investors in smart tech tokens can achieve outsize returns with the adoption of the tech in question.

$microgpt is taking a shot at something even bigger: revolutionizing how we code. It merges AI with blockchain to create a decentralized platform for building software and smart contracts. $microgpt uses AI to help developers write, debug, and optimize code faster than ever boosting productivity like ChatGPT for college papers, except instead of cheating on their homework, users are using code to streamline code and work faster to deliver products that can be put to immediate use in the world. All tools are on the blockchain, meaning they’re secure, accessible, and tamper-proof. The platform also simplifies creating blockchain-native applications, opening the door for massive industry-wide adoption. We already have AI creating AI tokens, but instead of investing in the coins AI users create, choose the tool they will all use for sustainable growth beyond just the duration of a fart joke.

$Filecoin’s valuation sits above $3 billion, showcasing its established dominance, while $microgpt, with a market cap under $30 million, presents an incredible growth opportunity. Early investors in $microgpt stand to gain exponentially if the project fulfills its potential. Just rising to meet Filecoin's market saturation, $MicroGPT would increase \*100. As this is an emergent tech and a major trend that can become very dominant, the case for an even more bullish marketcap is definitely on the table.

AI-driven blockchain coding is a wide-open playing field, and $microgpt is staking its claim as the first mover. As the convergence of AI and blockchain gains momentum, $microgpt’s position at the forefront of this trend could translate into massive returns. Its scalability and ability to attract a loyal developer community further solidify its potential for explosive growth. High risk, high reward: this is the kind of bet that changes the game. $microgpt isn’t just streamlining coding; it’s aiming to redefine what’s possible in the blockchain ecosystem.

This information comes from [data collated by Messari](https://x.com/MessariCrypto/status/1874842491108900922), a company renowned for providing crypto research, reports, and real-time data.

https://preview.redd.it/f8mnh3eqjqae1.jpg?width=1153&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=050df554cd065ac7ea19589929f185b63a05f2df

According to their analysis which excludes Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum beat out competition from notable projects like Cardano (ADA), Sui Network (SUI), Ripple (XRP), Zcash (ZEC), and Filecoin (FIL) to secure its position as the second most favorite crypto project in the country, just trailing behind Solana by a few states.

What makes this data particularly interesting is the context of Ethereum's performance in 2024. It was not a stellar year for ETH, which failed to capitalize on an ETF to surge significantly, only managing a 45% increase over the year. In contrast, Solana had a remarkable run, hitting an all-time high in November and boasting a 92.9% increase over the same period.

Need i mention that [Solana saw more activity than ETH in 2024](https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-beats-ethereum-economy-first-time-october) driven by its low fees and high throughput? There's also no need to stress the point that [it attracted more developers in 2024](https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-flips-ethereum-top-ecosystem-new-developers) compared to our darling ETH.

The biggest takeaway from this data is the enduring belief in Ethereum's potential among residents of the United States, regardless of its price action. This suggests that ETH has the backing of a strong community with long-term vision and will no doubts finish strong in 2025 right?"

While mainstream coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate the headlines, there are several lesser-known gems worth considering for a diversified portfolio. Here’s a look at some top cryptocurrencies that show promise for long-term investment:

# 1. Onooks (OOKS)

With a growing number of enterprise partnerships and real-world applications, Hedera is poised to be a significant player in the blockchain ecosystem.

# 3. Monero (XMR)

For investors prioritizing privacy, **Monero** is an excellent choice. Known for its focus on secure, private, and untraceable transactions, Monero offers a level of anonymity that few other cryptocurrencies can match.

* **Use Case**: Privacy-focused transactions
* **Key Features**: Untraceable transactions, decentralized network

5 DePIN Altcoins to Watch in December 2024,Blockmandev,1h1v94x,2024-11-28 07:50:00,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockmandev/comments/1h1v94x/5_depin_altcoins_to_watch_in_december_2024/,MammothBattle33,,"🚨 Crypto News: As November closes and December 2024 kicks off, the spotlight shifts to portfolio rebalancing and exploring promising altcoins. The Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) narrative is heating up, securing its place as the next trend to keep an eye on. If you're on the hunt for potential gems, these five DePIN altcoins are worth watching.

First up is $FIL (Filecoin), showing serious momentum with a 56.22% price jump over the past month. With a bullish Awesome Oscillator (AO) reading, $FIL could climb to $6.50 if the upward trend persists. Next in line is $AR (Arweave), riding a 20.98% weekly gain, fueled by an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. If buying pressure holds, $AR could aim for $24.57 soon.

Then there’s GRASS, the DePIN sleeper that exploded by 300% in November. Currently priced at $3.48, this new kid on the block is flirting with an all-time high. A strong December could see it shoot past $5. Meanwhile, $IO (io.net) is riding its bullish streak, up 65% in 30 days. If it stays above its 20-day EMA, $IO might charge above the $4 mark.

Finally, the NetMind Token ($NMT) is enjoying a surge in trading volume and climbing back with force. After a rocky fall to $1.29 in early November, $NMT is now hovering at $3.76 and might just break $5 if the bulls push hard enough.

December is shaping up to be a thrilling month for DePIN lovers. Keep these altcoins on your radar—opportunities like this don’t stay quiet for long.

Filliquid 3 month review,filecoin,1gqejfr,2024-11-13 09:49:02,3,0.67,1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gqejfr,BLY-IMPRV,,"TLDR
- Stake roughly 50000 FIL in Filliquid
- lock up FIT 3 month, mining almost 500,000 FIG 
- re-staking FIG, get earn from protocol profit by filecoin. 
- withdraw all my principal to binance safely.

- After this experience, I’m positively considering continuing to mine FIG tokens.

—————-

**Part 1: Experience with Filliquid**

- **Introduction**:
  - Here’s my review after using Filliquid for the past three months. If you're considering this product, this may be helpful.

- **First Impressions**:
  - The APY was quite low, and all the functions were rather slow, which was inconvenient. The UI and UX felt like they only supported the minimum functionality. However, after checking the documentation and seeing that the smart contract is decentralized and verified, I decided to go ahead with Filecoin staking.

- **Usage**:
  - I accessed Filliquid through [Filliquid Dapp](https://dapp.filliquid.io/en/lease?invitecode=b1LlOVfy) using MetaMask and connected my wallet. I transferred Filecoin to this wallet using Binance.

- **Features Used**:
  - **Filecoin Staking**: I staked Filecoin and received FIT, which works as a receipt. This decentralized approach prevents centralized platforms from blocking my earnings. By redeeming FIT, I could view my Filecoin interest earnings.
  
  - **FIG Farming**: The value of FIT fluctuates as storage providers (SPs) in Filliquid repay Filecoin, allowing me to mine FIG in the meantime and generate additional revenue.

- **Side Effects**:
  - I didn’t experience any issues and successfully mined a total of 500,000 FIG tokens.

- **Overall Impression**:
  - I’ve been monitoring the project since its testnet phase, and seeing the consistent release of new features is promising. If UI/UX improves, TVL grows, and more SPs use it, the project seems likely to continue growing. The terms provided to SPs borrowing Filecoin also seem reasonable.

---

**Part 2: Expected Returns with FIG Token**

- **Background**:
  - FIG Token is related to the Filliquid ecosystem, and I’m interested in it for investment purposes.

- **Investment Rationale**:
  - **Utility**: If FIG token offers real utility within the ecosystem, such as discounts or voting rights, it could contribute to its value growth.

- **Expected Returns**:
  - **Short-Term**: Potential gains from successful exchange listings and sales of FIG tokens.
  - **Long-Term**: If Filliquid establishes a strong market position, FIG could appreciate as the ecosystem expands. FIG also allows sharing in Filecoin earnings without the need for a mining device, providing dividends and a long-term revenue pipeline.

President Trump has publicly mentioned that if he gets re-elected, his first job in the office, is to fire Gary Gensler, Chairman of U.S SEC, from the position. 



Gary Gansler has been hated by Crypto investors, as he has been trying to put a harsh regulation on the Crypto industry and is well-known for his conflict with the Ripple, XRP token. 



Due to this issue, XRP token has been suppressed with the price action and the token has been mocked for a long time. 



Including XRP, there are more tokens that have been flagged as securities, by the U.S SEC, and let me list them, because those tokens will skyrocket when the new president reclaims the White House.

Internet Archive Thoughts 2024-10-26,internetarchive,1gcyg0g,2024-10-26 19:59:23,132,0.97,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/internetarchive/comments/1gcyg0g/internet_archive_thoughts_20241026/,textfiles,,"Some additional thoughts about the Internet Archive and the current outage. As before: If I don't talk about something that probably means it's something I can't talk about or I don't know anything about it because I'm just one person, or people working on it don't talk to me. Okay? Okay.

**Why are you posting this on Reddit instead of an** [archive.org](http://archive.org/) **site?**

Because it's not any official [archive.org](http://archive.org/) positions or statements. I'm just chatting.

**Why aren't logins back yet? Can you just make it so logging-in isn't required?**

There's a family of requests out there about the logging-in not working, and features not working. I'm going to use a very clunky metaphor, which will probably not change the avalanche of requests/demands around this feature.

*Your water heater turns out to be rusting and even though you have water filters, the water isn't good. So you start replacing the water heater. But the new water heater needs a specific type of piping to work, so now you're replacing pipes. And the pipes won't fit in the same runs within the walls, so now you're making new ones. And the fixtures, the taps and shower heads, won't work either. So now you're doing all this work, all intending so that when someone comes in and starts to shower, it all works, and a set of people go ""Come on, it was just a water heater. Where's my water?""*

A lot of the systems within the archive are this right now. The teams have two problems - take smart steps to make the systems better, **and** when they turn them on they're going to be absolutely blanketed by hundreds of thousands of users, some of them in a state of anxiety or relief, and the system has to work as best as it can when it comes back. That's simply what's taking so long. Again, clunky metaphor, but the Water Heater replacement is a small part and everyone has to be on board. 

**Fix the Video Player.**

People aren't even phrasing this as a question these days - many are issuing it as a command. The audio and video player are being completely replaced/upgraded and that is taking some time.

In the meantime, for items which have open downloads (which is most of them), clicking on SHOW ALL on the right in the list of formats will give you the original directory of the item, and you can click on the audio video files and *most* browsers will open their *own* player and start playing the files. It's not perfect by any means, but it does work.  

Obviously, if you can't click on SHOW ALL this doesn't happen yet - but many are able to work if you do this.

**The Wayback Machine and Book Reader are Being Weird.**

*I bet they are!* I speak for myself, but it's a miracle to me this team has gotten as much back up as they have, this fast. Some people were sleeping for few hours a night, and then coordinating multiple times a day. At some point this has more downsides than upsides, but it does appear to have paid off in the short term - when it works, it works.

Someone should write a book on the Wayback machine - how many other players of data gathered over 25 years via a dozen organizations of material that changed standards and presentation the whole time are there? Even VHS tape and floppies were static platforms - CD-ROMs are a bit of a bear because they silently changed the format a few times. But the Web and web pages? It's a Herculean effort done by some of the most brilliant minds I've ever encountered for it to ""just work"". 

Clearly, then, they're still ironing things out.  At some point it goes from ""We're up more and more"" to ""We're fully up, let's fix bugs and settle open issues"" and they'll continue the same miraculous work they've done up to this point. I can't say enough good things about Wayback Team.

Book reader problems are similar - clearly there's going to be months of tracking down bugs or issues, but news flash, that's been the book reader main effort for the last 15 years.

**You should decentralize the entire Archive and put it on The Blockchain.**

Well, there's multiple blockchains, so I assume people who say this mean ""put it in a ledger"" or some other such bit.

In 2015, after talking with a number of people, Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle started writing quite a bit about decentralizing the web, taking it out of a specific set of central commercial firms:

[https://blog.archive.org/2015/02/11/locking-the-web-open-a-call-for-a-distributed-web/](https://blog.archive.org/2015/02/11/locking-the-web-open-a-call-for-a-distributed-web/)   
Wayback: [https://web.archive.org/web/20150215032235/http://blog.archive.org/2015/02/11/locking-the-web-open-a-call-for-a-distributed-web/](https://web.archive.org/web/20150215032235/http://blog.archive.org/2015/02/11/locking-the-web-open-a-call-for-a-distributed-web/)

So, it's been thought of for a long time. The different approaches have ranged - I did an experiment called INTERNETARCHIVE.BAK back in 2015:

[https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/INTERNETARCHIVE.BAK](https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/INTERNETARCHIVE.BAK)

Currently, there's a project called Filecoin doing some of this work:

[https://www.fil.org/blog/democracys-library-announces-more-than-a-petabyte-of-government-data-uploaded-to-the-filecoin-network](https://www.fil.org/blog/democracys-library-announces-more-than-a-petabyte-of-government-data-uploaded-to-the-filecoin-network)

There's other work with onion links/tor, as well as torrents, and IPFS work. There's also a once-every two years event called Decentralized Web that the Archive has co-sponsored that addresses the issues:

[https://dwebcamp.org/](https://dwebcamp.org/)

The thing about the Internet Archive is it does a *lot of amazing stuff*, and it does it in many directions and all the time. It's quite breathtaking, really.

**Thanks for all the information you typed in. Now fix it all, immediately.**

We've got our best minds on it."

The projects propelling DePIN Ecosystem forward,DePINside,1fy8rbc,2024-10-07 10:18:36,18,1.0,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/DePINside/comments/1fy8rbc/the_projects_propelling_depin_ecosystem_forward/,kuonanaxu,,"The bull run is around the corner and I feel DePIN ecosystem will be a booming narrative. Every narrative has got the stigma of being the magic internet money made up of only ones and zero but DePIN project have physical, tangible assets that you can hold and point to something that exist. 

There are few of the many DePIN project I'm more focused on:

1. PEAQ: is an L1 blockchain tailored for DePINs, allowing builders to develop various use-cases such as mobility, ride-sharing, solar energy, and many more on the Peaq platform. They grew exponentially lately and their TGE is this month.

2. Filecoin: In the cryptocurrency world, FIL is the native cryptocurrency of the Filecoin network. Such a currency is used to incentivize storage providers. While cryptocurrency is used for transactions in the ecosystem, it is also used for paying storage providers. Storage providers may also earn FIL when they maintain data integrity.

3. Parasail: The first restaking project on DePIN ecosystem. Recently partnered with Fluence(Cloudless DePIN computing program) where users can delegate their FLT and earn 10.5% Apy and Sail points.  They have been working with Filecoin for a while and they still offer 19% for $FIL stakers

4. IOTEX: is a decentralised platform for the internet of things providing secure interaction between devices. They recently partnered with DePIN X and helped raised over 2M dollars. 

5. Helium: They are building a decentralised wireless network for IOT devices and you can set up hotspot to support the network and earn rewards. This feels like it could actually be a core piece in our web3 infrastructure. 

The DePIN space may not be grabbing much headlines like other narratives, but it's building the future of the next big breakthrough in the crypto space.

 The Real-World Impact of DePIN Innovations,AltStreetBets,1fotuxn,2024-09-24 22:17:22,22,0.97,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/AltStreetBets/comments/1fotuxn/the_realworld_impact_of_depin_innovations/,oracleifi,Fundamentals,"The DePIN space is massively underrated right now, but it's clear that it’s going to disrupt major industries. From decentralized storage to energy grids, these projects are solving real infrastructure problems that have been dominated by central authorities for too long. With blockchain, control and ownership are shifting back to the community—and that’s where DePIN shines.

I’ve been following a few key projects that are already making moves, and I wanted to share them to get your thoughts. Here’s what I think are some of the top DePIN projects to keep on your radar:

1. Filecoin

Filecoin is probably one of the biggest names in decentralized storage, but it's a great example of a DePIN project solving real problems. It offers a decentralized marketplace for data storage where users can rent out unused storage space on their hard drives and get paid in FIL. With so much of the world’s data being stored by centralized entities, Filecoin offers a trustless and decentralized alternative. Data storage is a critical part of our infrastructure, and I think Filecoin’s approach is an important step forward in decentralizing it.

2. Peaq Network

This one is an absolute gem. Peaq is an L1 blockchain that's quickly becoming a go-to platform for DePIN builders. They’re specifically focused on scaling decentralized infrastructure projects like mobility, energy grids, and even data-sharing protocols. What’s cool is that over 40 projects have already started building on Peaq, and their ecosystem is expanding fast. One project I like that’s part of Peaq is Silencio, which allows users to earn rewards by detecting sounds in their environment.

Plus, Peaq has a PEAQ coin listing coming up, which I’m personally watching very closely. If DePIN blows up, Peaq might be at the forefront.

3. DIMO

This project has been quietly making waves. DIMO focuses on creating a decentralized vehicle data network. Think of it as the Web3 version of vehicle diagnostics, where drivers and fleet operators can share data and earn rewards for doing so. In a future where autonomous vehicles become more common, having a decentralized network for vehicle data could be a game-changer.

Unlike some crypto sectors that can feel a bit speculative, DePIN projects have real-world utility. They're actually solving physical infrastructure problems while decentralizing the control of essential services like energy, wireless networks, and transportation."
Where is DEPIN in our lives?,DAOLabs,1foo60o,2024-09-24 17:38:59,11,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DAOLabs/comments/1foo60o/where_is_depin_in_our_lives/,tarangogu,Reddit Tasks,"https://preview.redd.it/surcpavsttqd1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=86d422ee6d3b153f0b3d2b29581e4634fffd228c

We have been hearing about DePIN frequently in the cryptocurrency and blockchain field recently. It has almost never left the market agenda since the beginning of this year.

Any protocol with decentralized physical network infrastructures can be called DePin. DePin, which is frequently used in the cryptocurrency sector, means that blockchain networks are connected to a physical infrastructure.

DePin initiatives in the field are generally concentrated in business lines such as telecom infrastructure, power plants, cloud solutions, data storage areas. Recently, initiatives for electric vehicles and charging stations have also been seen. These areas are sectors where large companies have a say because they require large infrastructure investments.

The cryptocurrency sector has turned to meet its high capital needs with tokenization. Tokenization increases the competitiveness of strong communities by spreading the need to the base. The capital requirement required by DePin initiatives is also tried to be solved by spreading the service offered to the base in a similar way.

Since DePin protocols work with physical devices, they work with token incentives for participants to purchase these devices. Participants who contribute to the network by purchasing the device aim to earn income by regularly earning tokens. The protocol has a more decentralized and powerful infrastructure as it has more participants from different locations.

DePin protocols that can provide decentralization have the opportunity to compete with other companies by having a lower and distributed risk structure compared to large companies.

If we touch on the leading DePin projects, these are;

Helium (HNT): Helium offers a global wireless network consisting of decentralized nodes called hotspots. This network is used to connect internet access and internet of things (IoT) devices.

Filecoin (FIL): It offers decentralized file storage and sharing service. Many different files can be stored on the blockchain in Filecoin.

Render (RNDR): It offers the render service in a decentralized way. Participants offer GPU power that they can rent to designers and are rewarded with RNDR in return.

Hivemapper (HONEY): It offers a decentralized mapping service. Participants provide real-time data such as GPS location and street view, allowing a world map to be created on the blockchain.

I would like to talk about IoTeX (IOTX), a remarkable depin project of recent times.

It is dedicated to developing the Internet of Things (IoT) sector by developing decentralized hardware that increases security and privacy. IoTeX focuses on providing DePIN infrastructure solutions. In addition to various developer tools and go-to-market support, they encourage the growth of decentralized network initiatives by providing centralized services such as W3bstream.

Using IoTeX's decentralized devices significantly increases user security and privacy. Moreover, users have the opportunity to earn IOTX tokens by interacting with the platform.

DePIN projects have already entered our daily lives and are promising for the future in the sector with new developments. It is obvious that we will hear their names more in 2025

Happy Friday! Sofia here with our weekly wrap-up. As we embrace the crisp autumn air, I'm thrilled to share our remarkable strides in expanding our reach and impact. Your continued support fuels our growth and drives us to new heights.

This week has been particularly exhilarating on the growth front. I'm proud to announce a strategic collaboration with [TARS AI](https://x.com/numbersprotocol/status/1830951297140564350?s=19), a partnership that merges their powerful AI, backed by the Solana Foundation, with our Provenance solution. This is a game-changing step towards a more secure and verified digital ecosystem, significantly expanding our technological reach and market potential.

Additionally, Numbers Protocol has been spotlighted in the [Filecoin Ecosystem digest](https://www.fil.org/digest/the-potential-for-decentralized-technology-to-rebuild-digital-trust), with a feature that delves into our crucial role in combating Disinformation and Misinformation, especially in the context of elections. This exposure not only boosts our visibility but also solidifies our position as thought leaders in the digital integrity space.

Our business development efforts are bearing fruit, with several exciting developments. We've made significant progress in our discussions with ANI News, one of India's leading news agencies. We're on the brink of integrating Capture Eye into their workflow, a move that would dramatically enhance the authenticity and traceability of digital content in the news industry. This partnership can potentially set a new standard for media integrity across South Asia.

Looking ahead, mark your calendars for September 12th! We'll be front and center at a key networking event during Boston Blockchain Week. This is a prime opportunity to showcase our solutions, forge new partnerships, and expand our influence in the blockchain community. We're preparing special gift cards for attendees to experience our Capture service, aiming to convert high-quality leads on the spot. Meanwhile, our team member, White, is currently representing Numbers Protocol at Cybertech NYC 2024. He's not just an attendee – he's a featured speaker, discussing how Numbers can contribute to developing human capital for New York City. This speaking engagement significantly boosts our profile in one of the world's major tech and financial hubs.

To support our expansion, we've rolled out key product enhancements. Dashboard upgrades now allow freemium users to create showcase pages and change usernames, improving user engagement and potentially driving conversions to paid tiers. We've also streamlined the Claim Copyright UI and flow, reducing friction in one of our core services and potentially increasing usage rates.

### Digital Currency Surge: A ⁢Week of ⁤Rebound and Regulatory⁤ Developments

Bitcoin’s Rally Toward ⁢$60,000 Marks ⁣Market OptimismIn the latest financial updates, cryptocurrencies are experiencing significant​ upward momentum. Bitcoin, the leading digital currency, approached the $60,000 benchmark after a tumultuous period marked by sharp declines. As of now, Bitcoin is trading around ⁣$59,500 following a 6.4% increase over the last day.

Ether (ETH), another major‌ cryptocurrency contender on the market list which also serves as Ethereum’s native token managed to climb over 8.8% in just 24 hours reaching past $2,600. This recovery signifies Ether catching pace with Bitcoin once again‌ after several days of underperformance.

Reflecting‍ broader crypto market movements was CoinDesk’s Index featuring top performing altcoins such as⁢ Solana‌ (SOL), Near Protocol (NEAR), Avalanche (AVAX) and Filecoin (FIL). These altcoins strongly trailed⁤ alongside registering⁣ growth close to 10%.

Ripple Experiences Significant ⁣Spike Amid Legal ProgressParticular attention has been drawn to Ripple’s XRP which skyrocketed by ‍an impressive 22%. This uptrend is closely tied‌ to recent legal victories where a U.S. ‍court imposed a considerably lesser fine than anticipated in ongoing regulatory challenges against it—amounting only up to⁣ $125 million contrary to a potential couple billion dollars initially suggested by regulators.

### Catalysts Behind ⁣The Cryptocurrency Market‍ Recovery

Key Legal and Regulatory Advances Boost Crypto SentimentsRecent positive developments are buoying investor sentiments further across different cryptocurrency assets including Bitcoin and ​others.

On Thursday alone⁣ two favorable events emerged:

  - First was approval from U.S. authorities permitting FTX Trading LTD together with its affiliate Alameda Research LLC disburse approximately​ $12.7 billion owed back creditors potentially introducing ​new capital ​into crypto markets.

  - Concurrently Russia has embraced cryptocurrency mining within its borders enhancing worldwide ‍blockchain participation often cited “Bitcoin FOMO” among nations heating​ up—a statement reinforced when Russian President ‍Vladimir Putin officially sanctioned activity;⁤ expectedly benefiting global blockchain operations expanding both technical robustness decentralizing miner influences further.

This geopolitical embrace came just as bitcoin rebounded robustly extinguishing‌ losses experienced earlier this week spontaneously witnessed Monday falling down near $49K before recoiling ⁣splendidly within days potentially painting bullish ‌symbols like⁣ ‘hammer ⁤candlestick’ suggesting imminent trends reversals anticipated in trading spaces.

### Market Projections Remain Guardedly Optimistic Amid Volatility Warnings

Despite obvious excitement hanging around potential bullish outcomes leading figures within analytic ‍circles urge ‌cautious strategy adoption given ‍pending fluctuations still possible⁣ post-sharp descents swiftly navigated at week’s start—coherently explained David Zimmerman from K33 Research advised ‍avoiding hurried⁢ investments advocating waiting till more solid strength signs manifest themselves amongst available cryptos retracing previously dipped values therefore not⁢ all ⁤analysts expect smooth continuation upwards​ suggesting some “choppiness” could prevail first before stabilizing anew perhaps resolving resistance faced historically at ‌significant moving average junctures‍ diluting swift ascends long term remaining undeterred however should ​resistance levels decisively break upwards facilitating sustaining rallies accordingly echoing sentimentals discovered sector-wide ⁤bolstered collective optimism surrounds us yet prudent⁢ reflexes shall dictate maneuvers guiding next portfolios adjustments suitably so keeping roller-coaster​ nature intrinsic speculative markets always ⁢mindfully considered.

🧣 Il nuovo fondo di Grayscale mira a capitalizzare il settore dell'intelligenza artificiale decentralizzata



🧤 Grayscale Decentralized AI Fund LLC: Una nuova frontiera per la DeFi



🧣 Grayscale ha lanciato un nuovo fondo dedicato alle criptovalute legate all'intelligenza artificiale decentralizzata. Il fondo includerà cinque token: $TAO di Bittensor, $FIL di Filecoin, $LPT di Livepeer, $RNDR di Render e $c di Near Protocol. Questi token rappresentano protocolli che sviluppano servizi AI decentralizzati, affrontano problemi generati dall'AI e offrono infrastrutture critiche come condivisione dati e computazione.



🧤 Scelte discusse e polemiche tra gli appassionati



🧣 Le scelte di Grayscale hanno già suscitato dibattiti, con l'esclusione di progetti come $ASI, $AGIX, $OCEAN e $FET. La composizione del fondo, che sarà ribilanciata trimestralmente, riflette una strategia mirata a protocolli con un potenziale significativo nel settore AI. Tuttavia, alcuni appassionati ritengono che le esclusioni possano limitare la diversificazione e l'efficacia del fondo.



🧤 Impatto del fondo AI di Grayscale e scenari futuri



🧣 Il fondo di Grayscale, disponibile solo per investitori accreditati, rappresenta un passo importante verso l'integrazione delle tecnologie AI nella DeFi. Questo sviluppo potrebbe accelerare l'adozione di criptovalute AI e spingere altre piattaforme a seguire l'esempio di Grayscale. Tuttavia, la scelta dei token e l'esclusione di altri progetti promettenti potrebbero influenzare le dinamiche del mercato e sollevare ulteriori discussioni tra gli investitori e gli appassionati del settore.

- iPhone, Chrome 

I recently tested staking a small amount of my Filecoin. I was pleasantly surprised to see that only a very minimal amount of FIL was used as gas fees. It's clear that Filecoin's technology has improved significantly.

Upon staking Filecoin, I received FIT tokens in a 1:1 ratio as collateral. These tokens allowed me to earn staking rewards from Filecoin mining.

I then used these FIT tokens to mine the initial Filliquid governance tokens. So far, it seems like the return is about 3x.

Assuming one FIG token is worth $1, I've earned about $300.

Given that the current Filecoin price is $5, staking 100 FIL is worth $500. By staking $500 worth of Filecoin, I've earned $300 worth of FIG tokens plus an annual 10% staking reward in Filecoin.

After researching various Filecoin DeFi projects and finding most of their APYs unsatisfactory, I discovered that Filliquid, which launched its mainnet yesterday, offers farming services. I'm planning to farm on this platform first.

I will continue to share updates on my testing progress here.

The future of Web3 is beyond mere hype. Crypto projects to watch out for in 2024,Crypto_General,1e1i7mo,2024-07-12 09:51:54,30,0.98,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crypto_General/comments/1e1i7mo/the_future_of_web3_is_beyond_mere_hype_crypto/,Ok-Western-5799,Question?," There's no doubt that this is another bull season, and the buzz of newer crypto projects spurring up isn't surprising. As an investor to maximize gains, I aim to make the best of the season to create generational wealth. 

During the last bear market, over 1,800 crypto projects went under. A study conducted by Satis Group estimated that around 78% of ICOs were scams, 4% failed, 3% had gone dead, and only 15% went on to trade on exchanges. This can be attributed to the fact that many of these projects focused mostly on the hype, following the bull run rather than building an ecosystem that provides real utility and key infrastructure. BitConnect (BCC), Terra (LUNA), and Filecoin (FIL) are prime examples.

I've curated a few projects that are still building despite the market fluctuations and I am ready to hear your thoughts

First is Stacks (STX), a Layer 2 solution that brings smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) to Bitcoin. It leverages Bitcoin's security while enabling more complex functionalities through its blockchain. It offers the Clarity smart contract language, PoX (Proof of Transfer) consensus mechanism and integration with Bitcoin's security. As a first mover, Stacks shows massive potential with many projects building on it.

Next is SUPRA Labs, a vertically integrated L1 building solutions for the next generation of super dApps. SUPRA is developing a fully vertically integrated blockchain stack, including Layer 1, in-protocol oracles, VRFs, Bridges, multi-VM support, and AMM. These components run on the same nodes as consensus, reducing latency and simplifying cross-chain liquidity. By integrating these features into the base layer, SUPRA aims to streamline information flow across blockchains, enabling seamless interaction between protocols. It has the advantage of building encompassing solutions for Bitcoin L2.

TON (Telegram Open Network) makes my list because it is building a blockchain platform integrated with the Telegram ecosystem, aiming to provide decentralized applications (dApps) and services. With a focus on integrating blockchain technology into a widely used messaging app, TON has the potential to drive mass adoption of decentralized services and create new use cases for blockchain within social media and communication.

Celo (CELO) is a mobile-first blockchain platform that supports the creation of decentralized applications and smart contracts, with a focus on financial inclusion. By targeting the mobile user base, Celo aims to drive mass adoption of blockchain technology in underbanked regions, providing essential financial services to millions.

As an investor aiming to maximize gains this bull season and create generational wealth, it's crucial to focus on projects that offer real utility and robust infrastructure, rather than just following the hype. I'd love to hear your thoughts on these projects and any other promising ones you’ve come across. "

Also in general when a crypto or stock is purchased with an IOU before it launches, how often does that price correlate with the actual value at launch..

ANSWER:

Projects similar to Pi Network that have entered mainnet include several cryptocurrencies that initially distributed tokens through non-traditional means like airdrops or initial coin offerings (ICOs) and later launched on their own blockchains. Some examples include:

EOS:

Launch: June 2018

Price at Launch: Approximately $5.40

TRON (TRX):

Launch: May 2018

Price at Launch: Approximately $0.05

Cardano (ADA):

Launch: September 2017

Price at Launch: Approximately $0.02

Stellar (XLM):

Launch: 2014 (Mainnet launched later)

Price at Launch: Approximately $0.003

IOUs and Actual Launch Prices

The correlation between IOU prices and actual launch prices can vary significantly:

Positive Correlation: In some cases, IOUs can be a good indicator of the initial market price, especially if the project has strong market interest and hype.

Negative Correlation: IOU prices can sometimes be overinflated due to speculative trading, leading to a correction once the token is officially launched and more widely traded.

Market Conditions: The overall market conditions at the time of the launch also play a significant role. If the market is bullish, the launch price can be higher than IOUs, and vice versa during bearish conditions.

In general, the correlation is inconsistent and heavily influenced by market sentiment, project fundamentals, and overall crypto market conditions at the time of the launch

HERE ARE SOME SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES WITH IOU PRICES COMPARED TO THEIR ACTUAL LAUNCH PRICE -


1. Polkadot (DOT)

IOU Price: DOT had IOUs traded on exchanges like MXC before the mainnet launch. Prices varied, but they generally hovered around $150-$200 (note: DOT underwent a redenomination later where 1 old DOT became 100 new DOT).

Launch Price: When Polkadot went live on the mainnet in August 2020, the new DOT token opened at around $2.90 (post-redenomination).

2. Filecoin (FIL)

IOU Price: FIL IOUs traded on exchanges like CoinList at prices ranging from $30 to $80 in anticipation of the mainnet launch.

Launch Price: When Filecoin launched its mainnet in October 2020, the price opened at around $30 and spiked as high as $200 due to high demand and limited initial liquidity, but quickly stabilized to around $40-$50.

3. Ecomi (OMI)

IOU Price: OMI IOUs traded on Bitforex at around $0.0001 to $0.0002 before the mainnet launch.

Launch Price: When Ecomi's OMI token officially launched on Uniswap in March 2021, the price initially spiked to around $0.001 to $0.002.

4. Kusama (KSM)

IOU Price: Kusama's IOUs traded at prices ranging from $1 to $5 on exchanges like MXC before the mainnet launch.

Launch Price: Upon mainnet launch in August 2019, KSM opened at around $1.70, gradually increasing as the project gained traction.

5. Solana (SOL)

IOU Price: SOL had IOUs trading at around $0.20 to $0.50 before its mainnet beta launch.

Launch Price: When Solana launched its mainnet beta in March 2020, the price opened at around $0.50 to $0.80.

Correlation Insights

Polkadot (DOT): The IOU price and the post-redenomination launch price showed a strong correlation.

Filecoin (FIL): The initial launch price significantly exceeded the IOU price due to high demand but later stabilized closer to IOU prices.

Ecomi (OMI): The launch price showed a substantial increase from IOU prices, likely due to initial excitement and limited supply.

Kusama (KSM): IOU prices were relatively aligned with the launch price, though the price increased gradually as the project matured.

Solana (SOL): The launch price was slightly higher than the IOU prices, showing moderate correlation.

Overall, while there can be some correlation between IOU prices and actual launch prices, the degree of correlation varies and is influenced by market conditions, project hype, and initial liquidity.

*****How does pi networks goals, foundation, current success and eco friendly approach compare to those examples you gave me. ??****

Answer-

Pi Network has unique characteristics compared to the examples provided (Polkadot, Filecoin, Ecomi, Kusama, Solana). Here’s a comparative analysis based on goals, foundation, current success, and eco-friendly approach:

Goals

Pi Network: Aims to create a user-friendly, decentralized cryptocurrency that can be mined via mobile phones with minimal resource consumption. It focuses on accessibility and inclusivity, aiming to bring cryptocurrency to the masses.

Polkadot (DOT): Seeks to enable different blockchains to interoperate seamlessly. Its goal is to create a decentralized web where users are in control.

Filecoin (FIL): Aims to create a decentralized storage network, allowing users to rent out their unused storage space. It focuses on data storage and retrieval.

Ecomi (OMI): Focuses on digital collectibles and NFTs, aiming to bring mainstream adoption of blockchain technology in the digital collectibles space.

Kusama (KSM): Serves as a canary network for Polkadot, allowing developers to experiment with new features in a real-world environment. It aims to foster innovation and rapid development.

Solana (SOL): Focuses on high-performance blockchain technology, aiming to provide fast, secure, and scalable decentralized applications and crypto-currencies.

Foundation

Pi Network: Developed by a team of Stanford graduates, it has built its foundation on the concept of mobile mining and creating a widespread network of users before launching on the mainnet.

Polkadot: Created by Dr. Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum. It has a strong foundation with significant technical expertise and a well-defined vision for blockchain interoperability.

Filecoin: Developed by Protocol Labs, also the creators of IPFS. It has a robust technical foundation focused on decentralized storage solutions.

Ecomi: Built by a team with experience in the digital collectibles industry. It leverages partnerships with well-known brands to enhance its appeal.

Kusama: Developed by the same team behind Polkadot, it shares much of the same technology and vision but focuses on experimental and early-stage projects.

Solana: Founded by Anatoly Yakovenko, it has a strong technical foundation with innovations like the Proof of History consensus mechanism.

Current Success

Pi Network: Boasts millions of users participating in its mining process via mobile apps, but it hasn't launched its mainnet yet. Its success lies in its large and engaged user base, but it still faces skepticism regarding its long-term viability and actual use case.

Polkadot: Successfully launched its mainnet and has become one of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap. It has numerous projects built on its ecosystem.

Filecoin: Launched its mainnet and is actively used for decentralized storage solutions. It has secured significant partnerships and a strong market presence.

Ecomi: Launched its mainnet and has a growing user base, particularly in the digital collectibles market. It has gained traction through partnerships with major brands.

Kusama: Successfully operating as an experimental network for Polkadot, with many projects and parachains testing on it before moving to Polkadot.

Solana: Has seen significant success with numerous projects building on its platform, a high transaction throughput, and a strong market presence.

Eco-Friendly Approach

Pi Network: Emphasizes low-energy mobile mining, which is significantly less resource-intensive than traditional mining methods like those used in Bitcoin.

Polkadot: Uses a Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) consensus mechanism, which is more energy-efficient than Proof of Work (PoW).

Filecoin: Uses a Proof of Replication and Proof of Spacetime consensus mechanism, which, while energy-intensive due to storage requirements, aims to optimize storage resources.

Ecomi: Built on the GoChain blockchain, which uses Proof of Reputation (PoR) and is designed to be more energy-efficient.

Kusama: Similar to Polkadot, it uses a Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) mechanism, which is more eco-friendly compared to PoW.

Solana: Uses a Proof of History (PoH) and Proof of Stake (PoS) hybrid consensus mechanism, which is more energy-efficient than PoW.

Summary

Pi Network: Focuses on accessibility, mobile mining, and eco-friendliness, with its main success being its large user base and novel approach to mining. However, it still needs to prove its viability and use case upon mainnet launch.

Others: Polkadot, Filecoin, Ecomi, Kusama, and Solana have all launched their mainnets and have established themselves in their respective niches with varying degrees of success. They employ various eco-friendly consensus mechanisms and have solid technical foundations and active ecosystems.
