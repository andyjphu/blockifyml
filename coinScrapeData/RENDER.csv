What is happening with my vertex groups?

I have a bunch of old, bad snakes. They all have 1 vertex group ""Head"" most of the other parts have a single group or two. see on the side for the teeth and tongue.

All the new snakes I'm creating and adding to the armature via CRTL+P end up with every single group in their vertex groups and a dotted line to the origin at the bottom.

This is my first time doing any rigging and I'm struggling now."

If you're getting tearing on a VRR display here's how to fix it (FF7 Rebirth PC),FFVIIRemake,1i9xihm,2025-01-25 16:26:59,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/comments/1i9xihm/if_youre_getting_tearing_on_a_vrr_display_heres/,EvilMonkeySlayer,No Spoilers - Help,"I've noticed with the VRR option enabled whenever it reaches the maximum framerate of the display it begins tearing such as during pre-rendered cutscenes etc.   

You can sidestep this by either enabling the vsync option or going into your respective gpu driver settings for the game and limiting the framerate a few frames below that max.   

For example, I'm playing on a HTPC connected to a 4k 120hz oled. So I've set the max framerate to 117fps. This way it keeps VRR enabled.   

For example the path I've set on mine is my G drive at:

**G:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH\End\Binaries\Win64\ff7rebirth_.exe**   

If you're using the C drive then it'll likely be the default steam path etc.   

Don't bother with G:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH\ff7rebirth.exe as that does nothing. It's a shim exe from what I can tell."

I currently have a laptop with a 6800HS/680m and 3050. My battery life nearly doubled when I disabled the 3050 in the bios, and pretty much never enable it except for if I'm doing some heavier lifting in Resolve when I'm plugged in (Windows sleep mode also seems to work way better with the DGPU disabled in bios).

Would there be an option to disable the 4050 completely in the bios like my Lenovo? This would be my preference so it's not slowly sipping away battery when on standby and I can actually render entire 50 minute long 4K videos on half a charge with the AMD rendering engine vs. Nvidia where I pretty much have to plug in. 

FYI I'm looking at the 365 CPU with 24GB of ram, the 370/32GB/4060 option is an extra $600 Canadian and I'm sure the lower base model will meet my needs performance wise. Being able to completely disable the discreet graphics would be a huge plus as you can't really do this in Windows and I suspect that's why the battery life is not great for this model."

Recently I figured out how to do renders in Blender after having some problems with getting good renders out of my current primary software.

I would like to get better at doing renders in Blender so I can get more out of the program. Currently my main problem is not knowing how to make the render look ""real"", lively/lived-in. All of my renders look more like dioramas than photos, which is what I'm aiming for.

I'd like to get better at renders so I can rely on myself more often when I need something done for one of my projects instead of needing to commission someone else for it (like concept art or character portraits,  stuff like archvizs and the like as well)

Any and all help is appreciated

Talent Idea: Blank,Ordeal_Webtoon,1i9wzka,2025-01-25 16:03:24,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ordeal_Webtoon/comments/1i9wzka/talent_idea_blank/,HiveFleetFlayer,,"Talent Type: Psychic

Blank is a telepathic Psychic Talent that has an effective range of of around 30 feet and affects any kimyo within that range. The holder of the talent is capable of disabling a given kimyo's ability, rendering them powerless. This is done by targeting​ the part of the mind that is responsible for the use and control of talents and muting it. So long as the kimyo is with range and the holder is focused the kimyo will be unable to actively use their talent. Shift and state tlaents will be unable to transform, element talents unable to control their given element, even void talents will be unable to access the realm. 

However the talent only prevents conscious and active efforts to use a talent, and exceptions do exist. Any passive, unconscious, or mutagenic talents are still able to operate due their their nature; Living or indepent talents can still operate since they are separate from the holder's mind; Any abilities that are merely benefits a talent still remain. It also doesn't truly smother the talent itself, it doesn't push a State or shift kimyo out of their form of they have already transformed nor get rid of the a kinesis or creation manifestations from those talents.

Examples: Andrea's weapon mastery would still take affect due to its nature of a more passive ability.

Che wouldn't able to enter the illios state nor summon any flames but his fire resistant would still remain.

  
Tevin's hides, if they were already equipped, will remain. He'll be unable to remove them or make more, but they would still be around.

The target can be specific or it can be any and all kimyo with the talents range.

Investing in Nature: Exploring Acres of Land for Sale,u_TheLotStore,1i9wxf5,2025-01-25 16:00:52,1,1.0,0,https://i.redd.it/6j99kl35f7fe1.jpeg,TheLotStore,,"Engaging in Nature: Discovering Acres of Property for Sale\
\
In the fast-paced contemporary world, as cities continue to expand and natural resources dwindle, engaging with nature has grown increasingly vital. With a rising awareness of the importance of environmental protection and conservation, exploring extensive acres of property for sale has emerged as a well-received and profitable choice.\
\
Given the escalating demand for land serving various purposes like agriculture, conservation, and development, a diverse range of options awaits entrepreneurs keen on delving into nature. From unspoiled woodland areas to productive farmlands, opportunities abound for individuals seeking to make a positive impact on the environment while also establishing a solid investment foundation.\
\
One of the primary advantages of engaging with extensive acres of property for sale is the potential for long-term appreciation. In contrast to other investment types susceptible to volatility and market fluctuations, property serves as a tangible asset that tends to appreciate over time. This principle rings especially true for property situated in high-demand, low-supply areas, such as waterfront estates or lands endowed with unique natural characteristics.\
\
Another significant benefit of engaging with nature is the potential for tax incentives. Many nations offer substantial tax advantages to landowners committed to conserving their property, including reduced property taxes or tax deductions for conservation activities. This renders property investment not just financially fruitful but also socially responsible.\
\
When contemplating the engagement with expansive acres of property for sale, several crucial factors merit consideration. Among these, the location of the property stands out as paramount. Ideally, investors should aim for properties in regions experiencing robust demand and limited availability, such as rapidly growing locales or areas boasting distinctive natural attributes.\
\
Furthermore, investors should ponder the potential utilities of the property. While some may prioritize conserving the property for its scenic allure or wildlife sanctity, others may intend to develop the property for agricultural or recreational purposes. Grasping the potential applications of the property can aid investors in optimizing returns and making well-informed investment decisions.\
\
An additional pivotal factor to consider when engaging with vast acres of property for sale is the potential risks involved. While property can represent a stable and secure investment avenue, certain risks accompany property ownership and management, such as environmental regulations, natural calamities, and fluctuating market conditions. Investors should diligently evaluate these risks and adopt appropriate measures to mitigate them, such as conducting thorough due diligence and collaborating with seasoned professionals.\
\
Beyond financial considerations, engaging with nature also brings forth social and environmental merits. Through conserving and safeguarding property, investors can contribute to safeguarding crucial habitats, combatting climate change, and promoting biodiversity. This can yield enduring positive ramifications for the local community and the environment, rendering the engagement with nature a socially responsible decision.\
\
For those intent on exploring extensive acres of property for sale, an array of resources exists to streamline the investment journey. Real estate agencies, conservation organizations, and land trusts can furnish valuable insights and counsel on procuring and overseeing property for conservation or development objectives. Furthermore, online platforms and marketplaces can connect investors with assorted properties available for purchase, simplifying the quest for the ideal property to invest in.\
\
Ultimately, immersing oneself in nature through vast acres of property for sale can prove to be a gratifying and lucrative pursuit. By dedicating time to diligent research and evaluation of potential investment opportunities, investors can arrive at well-considered decisions that benefit both their financial portfolio and the environment. Whether aspiring to conserve an unblemished forest, cultivate a sustainable farm, or establish a recreational haven, engaging with nature presents a distinctive chance to effect positive change in the world while simultaneously reaping long-term rewards.\

At the time I removed it with napkins and possibly tried to disinfect it with a rubbing alcohol wipe; I’m not sure. Was that enough to render any viruses, or parasites dead? I know that’s a large time frame—my city gets quite hot in summers—but I was hoping someone would know. It’s a porous surface from what I can tell like the bottom of a shoe, and I’ve covered it with large cardboard since then. I only thought to clean it again after emptying that space to help a friend transport their luggage.

tidbit: The poo was quite pungent likely because my dog was dying. It filled the van with that stink but didn’t linger too long after removal, and didn’t seem to make the upolstry stink, so maybe this is more a general question about pet poo..?"

Ridiculous. Literally this is my 4th game I’ve been kicked from today. Two of which I wasn’t even able to move from where it spawned me. As soon as the game renders, back to a black screen saying I’m kicked.

You have every right to play the game the way you want to play it. There’s no denying that. But this is just getting out of control.

If it’s just you and one friend playing and don’t want anyone else joining? Make a private lobby. 

If you want to experience the game by yourself to properly enjoy it? Make a private lobby. 

If you want to take things slow and explore everything without other players rushing you? Make it a private lobby.

Don’t ruin the game if you don’t like other players playing the game with you. "

It's been [a few weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/sveltejs/comments/1hu2b3s/frizzante_a_go_web_server_that_renders_svelte/).

I've been working on [Frizzante](https://github.com/razshare/frizzante) and I'm posting this to keep anyone interested up to date.

I've started writing some documentation for the project, [you can find it here](https://razshare.github.io/frizzante-docs/).

There are also a bunch of new features and improvements.

For starters, there's now [an easy way to use certificates](https://razshare.github.io/frizzante-docs/certificates/).

Byte-range requests are now supported, this is an internal feature, it allows the user to, for example, skip around an embedded video without downloading the whole thing.

[Web sockets are now supported](https://razshare.github.io/frizzante-docs/web-socket-handlers/) out of the box, and the api is partially compatible with regular route handlers. That should make it really easy to learn to use (less things to remember).

A code generation system, where the idea is to generate code before building your project to add new features seamlessly, a [sort of ""preparation"" phase](https://razshare.github.io/frizzante-docs/prepare/). The technique is obviously inspired by others, like Laravel, Rails, Shadcn and so on, and I think it will serve the project well.

Three [modes](https://razshare.github.io/frizzante-docs/svelte-pages/) of rendering, [server](https://razshare.github.io/frizzante-docs/overview/#server-mode), [client](https://razshare.github.io/frizzante-docs/overview/#client-mode) and [full](https://razshare.github.io/frizzante-docs/overview/#full-mode) (some people were specifically asking for this last time).

An [updated starter-template](https://github.com/razshare/frizzante-starter/blob/main/main.go) that's a bit more complex than just ""hello world"", a todo list.

And finally, a more in-depth example of [how forms are supposed to work](https://razshare.github.io/frizzante-docs/svelte-pages/#form-fields).

Give it a try if you find it interesting and useful.

Please help me understand what's going on,Paranormal,1i9wf09,2025-01-25 15:38:33,4,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1i9wf09/please_help_me_understand_whats_going_on/,ValwareUK,Question,"Hi, I'm a programmer who likes taking walks, and sometimes on my walks something very strange happens. I'm not sure if this is even the correct place to post this, but I feel like I've gone through other avenues, like speaking to mental health professionals (who told me this is not a mental-health-related problem), and I was wondering if anyone has experienced or knows anyone who experienced something similar, or at least if someone has some explanation about what is happening to me, I'd really like to hear, because I feel like I'm losing my mind.

# The Problem

When I'm out on my walks with my dog, occasionally I will be hit with what feels like a distant memory. The odd thing is, the memory is of the current place and (seemingly) the current time-period, however the memory feels ancient, even impossibly old given I'm only 33 and these memories feel like they are from earlier than that. Not only that, I have no words to describe how high-definition that memory is, and how weirdly interactive it is. The only way I can describe it is by comparing our reality to that of a Playstation 1 game. This reality looks like a badly rendered Playstation 1 game by comparison. The place in the memory is of the same place, but there's so much feelings of belonging, home and love that resonate strongly from the memories.

# So What About It

The memories seem to not be tied to an event or person, but they're tied to places and smells, and triggered by places and smells. They come with a deeper sense of home and belonging and love than anything I can usually remember, a stronger sense of familiarity, and overwhelming happiness to ""be back"", or so the emotions would indicate. In the past, they were just flashes of picture filled with layers of emotion, and now the memories can last up to around ten seconds (or so) and I can look around and remember things that are impossible, but when I leave the immersion, I forget them, like a dream, but I remember having remembered them, even if I don't remember them now. Makes sense? Doesn't make any sense to me, anyway.

# My Thoughts

Well, initially I thought I am going crazy, time to talk to a mental health professional. Since they assured me it doesn't sound mental health related, and sounds like a strong imagination, I started finding out what else it could be, since I know for a fact I could not have willingly imagined such a higher definition place because it seems impossible to imagine until you saw it. And so, it seems to line up uncomfortably well with Simulation Theory, but if it's a simulation then it feels like this reality has bugs or is breaking apart slowly in general. I would personally rather it were mental health problems or even something paranormal than a breaking-down simulation (for obvious reasons). But I do feel like this world feels less and less ""real"" to me every time it happens, which happens two or three times a week, always on my walks, and always triggered by a combination of location and smell, there seems to be no reoccurring spot and I cannot reproduce it purposefully.

  
Please give me your thoughts, if you know anything or if this sounds like something familiar or similar to something, please tell me what you think it could be, or even ideas how to trigger it to happen again or to keep me there for longer, because 10 seconds is not enough each time heh... I just want to feel that sensation of home, belonging and love again, but I am unknowing and distrustful of what is even happening.

Thank you for reading."

**Question:**  
A PC GPU achieves a gaming performance of 130 FPS at a given resolution. Increasing the resolution by 78% reduces the performance to 105 FPS. Determine the expected performance if the resolution is increased by 25% instead of 78%.

**o1:**

To solve this, we can use the relationship between resolution and performance. GPU performance (in frames per second, FPS) typically decreases as resolution increases due to the increased number of pixels that need to be processed.

# Step 1: Relationship between Resolution and FPS

If we denote:

* R1R\_1R1​ as the original resolution,
* R2=R1×(1+0.78)R\_2 = R\_1 \\times (1 + 0.78)R2​=R1​×(1+0.78) as the increased resolution (by 78%),
* FPS1=130FPS\_1 = 130FPS1​=130 as the original FPS,
* FPS2=105FPS\_2 = 105FPS2​=105 as the FPS at R2R\_2R2​,

we can approximate the relationship between resolution and FPS using an inverse proportionality:

FPS∝Resolution1​

This implies:

FPS1FPS2=R2R1\\frac{FPS\_1}{FPS\_2} = \\frac{R\_2}{R\_1}FPS2​FPS1​​=R1​R2​​

# Step 2: Calculate the Constant

From the given data:

130105=R1×(1+0.78)R1\\frac{130}{105} = \\frac{R\_1 \\times (1 + 0.78)}{R\_1}105130​=R1​R1​×(1+0.78)​

Simplify:

130105=1.78\\frac{130}{105} = 1.78105130​=1.78

# Step 3: Find the New FPS for a 25% Increase

For a 25% increase in resolution:

R3=R1×(1+0.25)=R1×1.25R\_3 = R\_1 \\times (1 + 0.25) = R\_1 \\times 1.25R3​=R1​×(1+0.25)=R1​×1.25

Using the same proportionality:

FPS1FPS3=R3R1=1.25\\frac{FPS\_1}{FPS\_3} = \\frac{R\_3}{R\_1} = 1.25FPS3​FPS1​​=R1​R3​​=1.25

Rearrange to find FPS3FPS\_3FPS3​:

FPS3=FPS11.25FPS\_3 = \\frac{FPS\_1}{1.25}FPS3​=1.25FPS1​​

Substitute FPS1=130FPS\_1 = 130FPS1​=130:

FPS3=1301.25=104FPS\_3 = \\frac{130}{1.25} = 104FPS3​=1.25130​=104

# Final Answer:

The expected performance at a 25% resolution increase is approximately **104 FPS**

**Gemini:**

Here's how we can approach this problem:

**1. Understand the Relationship:**

We're dealing with an inverse relationship between resolution and FPS. As resolution increases, FPS decreases. We can model this with a power law relationship:

FPS = k / (Resolution)\^n

Where:

* FPS is the frames per second
* Resolution is a measure of the number of pixels (we'll use a relative measure here)
* k is a constant of proportionality
* n is an exponent that describes the strength of the relationship

**2. Set up Equations:**

Let's normalize the initial resolution to 1. This means:

* Initial Resolution: 1
* Initial FPS: 130

When the resolution is increased by 78%, the new resolution is 1 + 0.78 = 1.78. The FPS becomes 105. We can set up two equations:

* 130 = k / (1)\^n => k = 130
* 105 = 130 / (1.78)\^n

**3. Solve for n:**

Using the second equation:

* (1.78)\^n = 130 / 105
* (1.78)\^n ≈ 1.238
* Taking the logarithm of both sides (you can use any base, but natural log is common):
   * n \* ln(1.78) = ln(1.238)
   * n ≈ ln(1.238) / ln(1.78)
   * n ≈ 0.213 / 0.577
   * n ≈ 0.37

**4. Calculate FPS for a 25% Resolution Increase:**

If the resolution is increased by 25%, the new resolution is 1 + 0.25 = 1.25. Now we can use our equation with the calculated 'n' and 'k':

* FPS = 130 / (1.25)\^0.37
* FPS ≈ 130 / 1.087
* FPS ≈ 119.6

**5. Final Answer:**

The expected performance with a 25% resolution increase is approximately 120 FPS

**Claude 3-Sonnet:**

To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the change in resolution and the change in performance, and then use it to calculate the expected performance when the resolution is increased by 25%.

Given information:

* Initial resolution: Let's denote it as R.
* Initial performance: 130 FPS.
* When the resolution is increased by 78%, the performance decreases to 105 FPS.

Step 1: Find the change in resolution and the corresponding change in performance when the resolution is increased by 78%.  
Change in resolution = R × 1.78 - R = 0.78R  
Change in performance = 130 - 105 = 25 FPS

Step 2: Assume a linear relationship between the change in resolution and the change in performance.  
Change in performance / Change in resolution = 25 FPS / (0.78R)  
= 25 / (0.78R) FPS per unit change in resolution

Step 3: Calculate the expected performance when the resolution is increased by 25%.  
Change in resolution = R × 1.25 - R = 0.25R  
Expected change in performance = (25 / (0.78R)) × 0.25R  
= 8.04 FPS

Step 4: Calculate the expected performance by subtracting the change in performance from the initial performance.  
Expected performance = Initial performance - Expected change in performance  
= 130 - 8.04  
= 121.96 FPS

Therefore, if the resolution is increased by 25%, the expected gaming performance of the PC GPU would be approximately 121.96 FPS

**DeepSeek-R1:**

Okay, so I need to figure out the expected performance of a GPU when the resolution is increased by 25%, given that increasing it by 78% reduces the FPS from 130 to 105. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, I know that increasing the resolution usually puts more load on the GPU because there are more pixels to render. Therefore, the frame rate (FPS) tends to decrease as resolution increases. The question is asking how much the FPS will drop if we increase the resolution by a smaller percentage (25%) instead of the original 78%.

The original resolution isn't given, but maybe I can model the relationship between resolution and performance. Typically, performance (in FPS) is inversely proportional to the resolution, assuming all other factors remain constant. That is, if you double the resolution, the FPS should halve, right? Because the GPU has to work twice as hard per frame. But maybe this isn't exactly linear? Or perhaps it's a different relationship?

Wait, let me think. Resolution is measured in pixels, which is width multiplied by height. So increasing the resolution by 78% would mean increasing both the width and height by some percentage? Or is it increasing the total number of pixels by 78%? The problem says ""increasing the resolution by 78%"", so I think that means the total number of pixels increases by 78%. So if the original resolution is, say, X pixels, then the new resolution is X + 0.78X = 1.78X. Therefore, the pixel count is multiplied by 1.78.

Similarly, increasing the resolution by 25% would mean the new resolution is 1.25 times the original pixel count.

If performance is inversely proportional to the resolution (pixel count), then FPS1 \* Res1 = FPS2 \* Res2. So FPS2 = FPS1 \* (Res1 / Res2). But let me check if that holds with the given numbers.

Original FPS is 130 at original resolution. After increasing resolution by 78%, the new FPS is 105. Let's see if 130 / 105 equals the ratio of the new resolution to the original resolution.

130 / 105 ≈ 1.238. But the resolution increased by 78%, so the new resolution is 1.78 times the original. But 1.78 is much larger than 1.238. Hmm, so that doesn't match. Therefore, the relationship isn't a direct inverse proportionality. Maybe the relationship is that FPS is inversely proportional to the increase in resolution?

Wait, perhaps the scaling is different. Maybe it's not linear with resolution, but with some other factor. Let me think. For example, in 3D rendering, the number of pixels directly affects the fill rate and the workload for the GPU. So if you have more pixels, each frame takes more time to render, hence lower FPS. If the resolution scales by a factor of k, then the time per frame scales by k, so FPS scales by 1/k.

So if the resolution is multiplied by k, FPS is divided by k. Therefore, FPS2 = FPS1 / k.

Let me check with the given numbers. Original FPS is 130. After increasing resolution by 78%, the resolution becomes 1.78 times the original. So according to this model, the new FPS should be 130 / 1.78 ≈ 73.03. But the problem states that the FPS is reduced to 105, which is much higher than 73.03. Therefore, this model isn't correct. So my assumption that FPS is inversely proportional to resolution must be wrong.

Hmm, maybe the relationship isn't linear? Maybe it's a different kind of relationship. Perhaps the performance scales with the square root of the resolution? Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe the workload scales with resolution, but other factors like memory bandwidth or processing power come into play. But without specific technical details, perhaps I need to find an empirical relationship based on the given data.

So, given that increasing the resolution by 78% causes the FPS to drop from 130 to 105, maybe I can model the relationship between resolution scale and FPS. Let's denote the original resolution as R. Then, increasing it by 78% makes it 1.78R. The FPS drops from 130 to 105. So the ratio of FPS is 105/130 ≈ 0.8077. So the FPS is about 80.77% of the original when the resolution is increased by 78%.

If I can find the relationship between the resolution scale factor (k) and the FPS ratio (FPS\_new / FPS\_old), maybe I can model it as a linear relationship? Or perhaps some exponential relationship?

Wait, let's think in terms of scaling factors. Let me denote k as the scale factor for resolution. So k = 1.78 for a 78% increase. Then, FPS\_new = FPS\_old \* (1 / k\^a), where 'a' is some exponent. So we can solve for 'a' using the given data.

So 105 = 130 / (1.78)\^a

Therefore, (1.78)\^a = 130 / 105 ≈ 1.238

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

a \* ln(1.78) = ln(1.238)

Therefore, a = ln(1.238) / ln(1.78) ≈ (0.213) / (0.576) ≈ 0.369

So the exponent a is approximately 0.369.

Therefore, the relationship is FPS\_new = FPS\_old / (k)\^0.369

So, for a 25% increase in resolution, k = 1.25. Then,

FPS\_new = 130 / (1.25)\^0.369

Calculate 1.25\^0.369:

First, take ln(1.25) ≈ 0.223, multiply by 0.369 ≈ 0.0824

Exponentiate: e\^0.0824 ≈ 1.086

Therefore, FPS\_new ≈ 130 / 1.086 ≈ 119.7

So approximately 120 FPS.

But let me check this calculation again step by step to make sure.

First, original data:

When resolution is increased by 78%, so k = 1 + 0.78 = 1.78.

FPS drops from 130 to 105.

Assuming the formula is FPS\_new = FPS\_old / (k)\^a, solve for a:

105 = 130 / (1.78)\^a

Multiply both sides by (1.78)\^a:

105 \* (1.78)\^a = 130

Divide both sides by 105:

(1.78)\^a = 130 / 105 ≈ 1.2381

Take natural log:

a \* ln(1.78) = ln(1.2381)

Calculate ln(1.78): ln(1.78) ≈ 0.5766

ln(1.2381) ≈ 0.2134

Therefore, a ≈ 0.2134 / 0.5766 ≈ 0.3698

So, a ≈ 0.37

Therefore, the formula is FPS\_new = 130 / (k)\^0.37

Now, for a 25% increase in resolution, k = 1.25.

Compute 1.25\^0.37:

Again, take natural log of 1.25: ln(1.25) ≈ 0.2231

Multiply by 0.37: 0.2231 \* 0.37 ≈ 0.0825

Exponentiate: e\^0.0825 ≈ 1.086

Therefore, FPS\_new ≈ 130 / 1.086 ≈ 119.7, so approximately 120 FPS.

But let me check using another method. Alternatively, compute 1.25\^0.37 directly.

1.25\^0.37. Let's compute this step by step.

First, note that 1.25 is 5/4. So (5/4)\^0.37.

Alternatively, use logarithms. Let me use base 10 for easier calculation.

log10(1.25) ≈ 0.09691

Multiply by 0.37: 0.09691 \* 0.37 ≈ 0.03586

Then, 10\^0.03586 ≈ 1.086. So same result. Therefore, 1.25\^0.37 ≈ 1.086.

Thus, 130 / 1.086 ≈ 119.7. So approximately 120.

But let me check this with another approach. Maybe the scaling is linear? If a 78% increase causes a 130 to 105 drop, then how much does a 25% increase cause?

Alternatively, maybe it's a linear relationship between resolution increase and FPS decrease. But that might not be accurate. Let's see.

If we consider that increasing resolution by 78% leads to a performance decrease of (130 - 105)/130 = 25/130 ≈ 19.23%. So a 78% resolution increase causes a 19.23% decrease in FPS.

But if the relationship is linear, then a 25% resolution increase would cause a (25/78)\*19.23% ≈ (0.3205)\*19.23 ≈ 6.16% decrease. Then FPS would be 130\*(1 - 0.0616) ≈ 130\*0.9384 ≈ 122. So around 122 FPS. But this is a different result than the previous method.

But which one is correct? Since the first method models the relationship as a power law, and the second as a linear relationship. But in reality, the relationship between resolution and performance is usually not linear. Since resolution scales with the number of pixels, which is a multiplicative factor on both width and height. So increasing resolution by 78% (assuming in both dimensions) would actually multiply the pixel count by (1 + 0.78). Wait, no. Wait, resolution is usually given as width x height. So a 78% increase in resolution could be ambiguous. Is it 78% increase in each dimension, leading to a total pixel increase of (1.78)\^2 - 1 = 2.1684, which is 116.84% increase in total pixels? Or is the 78% increase referring to total pixels?

This is a critical point. The problem states ""increasing the resolution by 78%"". The term ""resolution"" can be ambiguous. In common usage, increasing resolution by a percentage usually refers to increasing each dimension by that percentage, thereby increasing the total number of pixels by the square of that factor. For example, increasing resolution by 100% (doubling) each dimension would result in 4x the pixels. However, sometimes people might refer to the total pixel count. The problem doesn't specify, but given that increasing resolution by 78% leads to a decrease in FPS from 130 to 105, we need to figure out which interpretation fits.

If it's a 78% increase in each dimension, then total pixels become (1.78)\^2 = 3.1684 times the original, which is a 216.84% increase in total pixels. However, such a massive increase in pixels would likely result in a much larger drop in FPS, but in the problem, the FPS only drops from 130 to 105. Therefore, this suggests that the 78% increase is in total pixels, not per dimension.

Therefore, the problem likely means that the total resolution (number of pixels) is increased by 78%, so the new resolution is 1.78 times the original. Similarly, increasing by 25% would mean 1.25 times the original pixel count.

Given that, then going back, if the total pixels are 1.78 times, then the FPS is 105, which is 130 / 1.78\^a ≈ 105. We found a ≈ 0.37. So, this seems like a reasonable model.

Alternatively, if we model it as the time per frame being proportional to the number of pixels, then FPS is inversely proportional to the number of pixels. But according to that, FPS would be 130 / 1.78 ≈ 73, which is not the case here. Therefore, that model is invalid. So perhaps the workload isn't strictly linear with resolution. Maybe due to other factors like reduced CPU bottleneck or something else. But given that we have to work with the numbers provided, we can model the relationship as a power law where FPS scales as 1 / k\^a, with a ≈ 0.37.

Alternatively, perhaps the relationship is linear in terms of some other factor. Let's see. Let me try to check with the given numbers.

Original FPS: 130 at resolution R.

After increasing resolution to 1.78R, FPS becomes 105.

Suppose the relationship is FPS = C / R\^a, where C is a constant.

So, 130 = C / R\^a

105 = C / (1.78R)\^a

Divide the first equation by the second:

130 / 105 = (C / R\^a) / (C / (1.78R)\^a) ) = (1.78R)\^a / R\^a = 1.78\^a

Therefore, 130/105 = 1.78\^a

Which is the same as before. So 1.78\^a = 130/105 ≈ 1.2381

Therefore, a ≈ 0.3698 as before.

Therefore, using this model, for a resolution increase of 25%, which is 1.25R, then FPS = 130 / (1.25)\^0.3698 ≈ 130 / 1.086 ≈ 119.7, so \~120 FPS.

But let me check another way. If we think of the exponent 'a' as representing how much the performance scales with resolution. If a = 1, it's inverse linear (double the resolution, half the FPS). Here, a ≈ 0.37, which is less than 1, meaning that the FPS doesn't drop as much as inverse linear. So the drop is less severe. So, increasing resolution by 25% would result in FPS dropping by a factor of 1.25\^0.37 ≈ 1.086, so \~8.6% decrease, leading to 130 / 1.086 ≈ 120.

Alternatively, since 78% increase corresponds to a factor of 1.78, and 25% is 1.25. So, maybe we can use the ratio between the two.

Wait, but how? Maybe we can set up a proportion. If a 78% increase leads to a certain performance drop, then a 25% increase would lead to a proportionally smaller drop.

But that might not be accurate unless the relationship is linear, which we already saw isn't the case.

Alternatively, using the same exponent, which we calculated as \~0.37, then for any resolution scale factor k, the FPS is 130 / k\^0.37.

So for k=1.25, FPS=130 / 1.25\^0.37 ≈ 130 / 1.086 ≈ 119.7.

Alternatively, perhaps use logarithms to interpolate. Wait, but we already did that with the exponent.

Alternatively, think in terms of percentage decrease. If going from 100% res to 178% res (78% increase), the FPS goes from 130 to 105. So, the FPS multiplier is 105/130 ≈ 0.8077 over a resolution multiplier of 1.78.

Similarly, for a resolution multiplier of 1.25, the FPS multiplier would be (1.25 / 1.78)\^(log(0.8077)/log(1.78))? Wait, that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, since we have a power law established, FPS = 130 \* (1 / k)\^0.3698, then for k=1.25, FPS = 130 / 1.25\^0.3698 ≈ 119.7. Therefore, the answer is approximately 120 FPS.

But maybe the problem expects a different approach. Let's consider that the performance is inversely proportional to the resolution. So, FPS \* Resolution = constant.

But when we check with the given numbers, 130 \* R = constant, and 105 \* 1.78R = constant. So:

130R = 105 \* 1.78R

Divide both sides by R: 130 = 105 \* 1.78

Calculate 105\*1.78: 105\*1.78 = 105\*(1 + 0.78) = 105 + 105\*0.78 = 105 + 81.9 = 186.9

But 130 ≠ 186.9, so this is false. Therefore, the relationship is not FPS inversely proportional to resolution. Therefore, that approach is invalid.

Alternatively, maybe the performance scales with the square root of the resolution? That is, FPS is inversely proportional to the square root of the resolution. So FPS1 \* sqrt(Res1) = FPS2 \* sqrt(Res2).

Testing this: 130 \* sqrt(R) = 105 \* sqrt(1.78R)

Divide both sides by sqrt(R): 130 = 105 \* sqrt(1.78)

Calculate sqrt(1.78) ≈ 1.334

So 105 \* 1.334 ≈ 140.07 ≈ 130? No, 140 ≠ 130. Therefore, this model is also invalid.

Alternatively, maybe the relationship is that FPS scales with the inverse of the resolution raised to some power, which we have already determined via the exponent a ≈ 0.37.

Therefore, unless there's another way to model this, the most accurate approach based on the given data is the power law relationship with exponent \~0.37.

Alternatively, maybe we can consider the difference in resolution and the difference in FPS. So, from 100% to 178%, which is +78%, the FPS decreases by 25 (from 130 to 105). So, per 1% increase in resolution, the FPS decreases by 25/78 ≈ 0.3205 FPS per percentage point. Then, for a 25% increase, the decrease would be 25 \* 0.3205 ≈ 8.01 FPS, leading to 130 - 8.01 ≈ 121.99 FPS. So approximately 122 FPS. But this is a linear approximation, which may not be correct because the relationship is likely non-linear.

But which approach is correct? Since we have only two data points, it's impossible to know the true relationship. However, in real-world scenarios, GPU performance doesn't scale linearly with resolution. It's more common for FPS to be inversely proportional to the resolution (i.e., linear with the number of pixels), but in this case, that doesn't fit because 130 / 1.78 ≈ 73, which doesn't match the given 105.

Therefore, given the discrepancy, the problem must be assuming a different relationship. Perhaps the question is simplified, and the performance hit is linear with the percentage increase in resolution. That is, each percentage increase in resolution causes a fixed percentage decrease in FPS.

Wait, let's try that. If increasing resolution by 78% causes FPS to drop from 130 to 105, which is a decrease of (130 - 105)/130 = 25/130 ≈ 19.23%. So, 19.23% decrease for a 78% increase in resolution. So, the performance scales as (1 - 0.1923) = 0.8077 for a 78% increase.

If we model this as a linear relationship where each 1% increase in resolution causes a (19.23/78)% ≈ 0.246% decrease in FPS. Then, for a 25% increase in resolution, the FPS decrease would be 25 \* 0.246% ≈ 6.15%, resulting in FPS = 130 \* (1 - 0.0615) ≈ 130 \* 0.9385 ≈ 122. So 122 FPS. But again, this assumes a linear relationship which might not hold.

But in reality, performance scaling with resolution is more complex. However, given that the problem provides only two data points, we have to assume some model. The question is, which model is the problem expecting?

The two possible models I can think of are:

1. Power law relationship where FPS is inversely proportional to resolution raised to some exponent (which we calculated as \~0.37), leading to \~120 FPS.
2. Linear relationship where the FPS decrease is proportional to the resolution increase, leading to \~122 FPS.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the resolution increase as per-axis, so that total pixels increase by (1.78)\^2. Let's check that.

Wait, if increasing resolution by 78% per axis, then total pixels would be (1.78)\^2 = 3.1684 times original. Then, if FPS is inversely proportional to total pixels, then FPS would be 130 / 3.1684 ≈ 41.03. But given that the problem states FPS is 105, this is inconsistent. Therefore, the problem must be referring to total resolution increase, not per-axis.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in terms of pixel density or something else. But without more information, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a simple percentage calculation. If a 78% increase in resolution causes a (130 - 105)/130 = \~19.23% decrease in FPS, then a 25% increase would cause a (25/78)\*19.23% ≈ 6.15% decrease, leading to 130\*(1 - 0.0615) ≈ 122 FPS.

But this is a linear extrapolation, which is simplistic but might be what's expected here.

Alternatively, the problem might assume that the performance is inversely proportional to the resolution. Then, if resolution increases by 78%, the FPS should be 130 / 1.78 ≈ 73, but since it's given as 105, this model is invalid. So the problem must be expecting a different approach.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is referring to the resolution scaling in one dimension? For example, increasing the resolution by 78% in one dimension (width or height), thereby increasing the total pixel count by 78%. But that's not standard. Usually, resolution is increased proportionally in both dimensions.

But if the problem states a 78% increase in resolution, and it's referring to the total number of pixels, then the pixel count is 1.78 times the original. Therefore, the scaling factor for resolution is 1.78, and the FPS is 105. Then, to find the scaling factor for a 25% increase in resolution (pixel count 1.25 times original), leading to FPS = ?

Given that, and assuming a power law relationship between resolution and FPS, we determined the exponent a ≈ 0.37. Therefore, the expected FPS is \~120.

Alternatively, the problem might be expecting the assumption that performance scales with the inverse of the resolution, but since that doesn't match the given data, perhaps the answer is derived from the ratio of the resolution increases.

Wait, here's another approach. The performance decreased by a factor of 105/130 ≈ 0.8077 when the resolution increased by a factor of 1.78. So, the performance scales by 0.8077 when the resolution scales by 1.78.

If we want to find the performance when the resolution scales by 1.25, we can set up a proportion:

(1.78 / 1.25) = (0.8077 / x)

But this is not a direct proportion. Alternatively, if we consider that the scaling factor for performance is (1.78 / new\_resolution\_factor) \* 0.8077? Not sure.

Alternatively, use linear interpolation on a log scale. Since the relationship is a power law, which is linear in log-log space.

Take the log of both resolution scale and performance scale.

Original data point:

Resolution scale: 1.78 (log(1.78) ≈ 0.5766)

Performance scale: 0.8077 (log(0.8077) ≈ -0.2134)

For a new resolution scale of 1.25 (log(1.25) ≈ 0.09691), we can find the corresponding performance scale.

Assuming a linear relationship in log-log space, which corresponds to a power law in linear space.

The slope of the line in log-log space is (log(0.8077) - log(1)) / (log(1.78) - log(1)) = (-0.2134 - 0) / (0.5766 - 0) ≈ -0.2134 / 0.5766 ≈ -0.3698

So the slope is approximately -0.3698, which is the exponent 'a' we found earlier.

Therefore, the equation in log-log space is:

log(performance\_scale) = slope \* log(resolution\_scale) + intercept

We know that when resolution\_scale = 1, performance\_scale = 1. Therefore, the intercept is 0.

Therefore, log(performance\_scale) = -0.3698 \* log(resolution\_scale)

Therefore, for resolution\_scale = 1.25,

log(performance\_scale) = -0.3698 \* log(1.25) ≈ -0.3698 \* 0.09691 ≈ -0.0359

Exponentiate both sides:

performance\_scale ≈ e\^(-0.0359) ≈ 0.9647

Therefore, the performance scale is \~0.9647, so FPS = 130 \* 0.9647 ≈ 125.4

Wait, this contradicts our previous result. Wait, why is that?

Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, no. Wait, if the original performance scale is 0.8077 when resolution scale is 1.78, and we model it as a power law, then performance\_scale = (resolution\_scale)\^-a, where a ≈ 0.3698.

Therefore, for resolution\_scale = 1.25, performance\_scale = 1.25\^-0.3698 ≈ 0.921, so FPS = 130 \* 0.921 ≈ 119.7, which matches the previous result.

But in the log-log space approach above, I get performance\_scale ≈ 0.9647, leading to \~125 FPS. That must be an error. Wait, let's re-examine.

Wait, the equation in log-log space is:

log(performance\_scale) = -a \* log(resolution\_scale)

Given that when resolution\_scale = 1.78, performance\_scale = 0.8077.

So:

log(0.8077) = -a \* log(1.78)

Therefore, a = -log(0.8077)/log(1.78) ≈ -(-0.2134)/0.5766 ≈ 0.3698

Therefore, for resolution\_scale = 1.25,

log(performance\_scale) = -0.3698 \* log(1.25) ≈ -0.3698 \* 0.09691 ≈ -0.0359

So performance\_scale = e\^(-0.0359) ≈ 0.9647

Wait, but that can't be, because when resolution\_scale = 1, performance\_scale = 1, and for higher resolution scales, performance\_scale decreases. But according to this, at resolution\_scale = 1.25, performance\_scale is \~0.9647, meaning FPS = 130 \* 0.9647 ≈ 125.4. But according to the power law formula, it should be 130 / (1.25)\^0.3698 ≈ 119.7.

Wait, there's a discrepancy here. Wait, no, actually, in the power law formula, performance\_scale = 1 / (resolution\_scale)\^a = (resolution\_scale)\^-a

Therefore, if we take logs:

log(performance\_scale) = -a \* log(resolution\_scale)

But when I computed performance\_scale = e\^(-0.0359) ≈ 0.9647, that is correct. However, 0.9647 is relative to the original performance. So FPS = 130 \* 0.9647 ≈ 125.4. But according to the direct calculation using the power law exponent, it's 130 / (1.25)\^0.3698 ≈ 119.7.

Wait, that can't be both. Where is the mistake?

Wait, no. Wait, in the power law formula, performance\_scale is (FPS\_new / FPS\_old) = (resolution\_scale)\^-a

Therefore, (FPS\_new / 130) = (1.25)\^-0.3698 ≈ 0.921

Therefore, FPS\_new ≈ 130 \* 0.921 ≈ 119.7

But in the log-log space calculation, I get performance\_scale ≈ 0.9647. That suggests inconsistency. Therefore, I must have messed up the log-log space calculation.

Wait, no. Wait, if performance\_scale = (resolution\_scale)\^-a, then log(performance\_scale) = -a \* log(resolution\_scale). So, given that a ≈ 0.3698,

For resolution\_scale = 1.25,

log(performance\_scale) = -0.3698 \* log(1.25) ≈ -0.3698 \* 0.09691 ≈ -0.0359

Therefore, performance\_scale = e\^{-0.0359} ≈ 0.9647

Wait, but 1.25\^-0.3698 ≈ e\^{-0.3698 \* ln(1.25)} ≈ e\^{-0.3698 \* 0.2231} ≈ e\^{-0.0824} ≈ 0.921

Ah! Here's the mistake. I used natural logarithm in one place and base 10 in another? Wait, no. Wait, let's recast.

The formula is performance\_scale = (resolution\_scale)\^-a

So, for resolution\_scale = 1.25,

performance\_scale = 1.25\^-0.3698 ≈ e\^{-0.3698 \* ln(1.25)} ≈ e\^{-0.3698 \* 0.2231} ≈ e\^{-0.0824} ≈ 0.921

But when I computed log(performance\_scale) as -0.0359, I was using log base 10. Wait, no. Wait, in the previous calculation, I used natural logarithm for the logs.

Wait, in the log-log space approach, if we are using natural logs, then:

log(performance\_scale) = -a \* log(resolution\_scale)

Where log is natural log.

So, for resolution\_scale = 1.25,

log(performance\_scale) = -0.3698 \* ln(1.25) ≈ -0.3698 \* 0.2231 ≈ -0.0824

Therefore, performance\_scale = e\^{-0.0824} ≈ 0.921

Which matches the direct calculation. Therefore, my previous log-log space calculation was incorrect because I used base 10 logs instead of natural logs. That was the mistake.

Therefore, the correct calculation is performance\_scale ≈ 0.921, leading to FPS ≈ 119.7, so \~120.

Therefore, the previous result of \~120 FPS is correct.

Thus, the answer should be approximately 120 FPS.

But let's check one more time for errors.

Original data: scaling resolution by 1.78 leads to FPS scaling by 105/130 ≈ 0.8077.

Assuming power law: 0.8077 = 1.78\^-a => a ≈ 0.3698.

For resolution scale 1.25, FPS scale = 1.25\^-0.3698 ≈ 0.921, so FPS ≈ 130 \* 0.921 ≈ 119.7.

Yes, so approximately 120.

Alternatively, if we use log base 10:

log10(0.8077) ≈ -0.0924

log10(1.78) ≈ 0.2504

Slope a = -0.0924 / 0.2504 ≈ -0.369, same as before.

For resolution scale 1.25, log10(1.25) ≈ 0.09691

log10(performance\_scale) = -0.369 \* 0.09691 ≈ -0.0357

performance\_scale = 10\^-0.0357 ≈ 0.921, same result.

Therefore, regardless of the logarithm base, we get performance\_scale ≈ 0.921, leading to \~120 FPS.

Therefore, I think this is the correct answer.

\*\*Final Answer\*\*

The expected performance is \\boxed{120} FPS

Given that a PC GPU achieves 130 FPS at a certain resolution, and increasing the resolution by 78% reduces the performance to 105 FPS, we need to determine the expected performance if the resolution is increased by 25% instead.

1. **Understanding the relationship between resolution and performance**:
   * The original resolution is R*R*.
   * Increasing the resolution by 78% results in a new resolution of 1.78R1.78*R*.
   * The performance drops from 130 FPS to 105 FPS.
2. **Modeling the relationship**:
   * We assume a power law relationship between resolution and FPS: FPS∝1ResolutionaFPS∝Resolution*a*1​.
   * Using the given data, we solve for the exponent a*a*:105=130(1.78)a105=(1.78)*a*130​(1.78)a=130105≈1.2381(1.78)*a*=105130​≈1.2381Taking the natural logarithm on both sides:a⋅ln⁡(1.78)=ln⁡(1.2381)*a*⋅ln(1.78)=ln(1.2381)a≈ln⁡(1.2381)ln⁡(1.78)≈0.21340.5766≈0.3698*a*≈ln(1.78)ln(1.2381)​≈0.57660.2134​≈0.3698
3. **Applying the model to a 25% resolution increase**:
   * For a 25% increase in resolution, the new resolution is 1.25R1.25*R*.
   * Using the exponent a≈0.3698*a*≈0.3698:FPSnew=130(1.25)0.3698FPSnew​=(1.25)0.3698130​Calculating (1.25)0.3698(1.25)0.3698:ln⁡(1.25)≈0.2231ln(1.25)≈0.22310.3698⋅0.2231≈0.08240.3698⋅0.2231≈0.0824e0.0824≈1.086*e*0.0824≈1.086FPSnew≈1301.086≈119.7FPSnew​≈1.086130​≈119.7
4. **Conclusion**:
   * The expected performance when the resolution is increased by 25% is approximately 120 FPS"

I'm not concerned of the royal rota rats. I know they are beyond correcting because the disease has spread over to their hearts.

I'm concerned about the non-UK, non-rota and media outlets from commonwealth.

There's a news platform recently launched to show global headlines from a native (Indian) perspective. I love their primary journalist and I love how she presents her views. Infact she has a very loyal fanbase who have followed her from her previous network, ensuring all of the success of the new one and rendering the old one with negligible viewership.

But I recently looked into their coverage of H&M and it seemed like their entertainment desk copies all of the headlines from rota outlets. What's worse, the journalist doing so claims that she is ""utilising her gender lens"" to write her stories.

This is hypocrisy max. I have written an email to her, the network as well as the primary journalist. I have left multiple tweets.

In the past, I wrote a similar letter to another journalist who used to write opinion columns and she not only responded to my email but just stopped covering H&M altogether. I took it as a positive because honestly I didn't expect her to become supportive but the fact that she understood the sentiment of the readers did not match with her and just stopped, it was enough of a win.

What can be done about those who fail to acknowledge any feedback?

It pisses me off specially because of the hypocrisy that they started of their channel to make a point about the Indian sentiments. Then why follow that of the people who not only colonised your ancestors but also continue to be racists to other people of colour?

I'm just thinking out loud. What will stop them?
- submission of written petitions signed by a number of viewers/readers?
- continual pleas on social media but from a number of people?
- writing and posting letters in person?

I'm serious about this. I got time, I have my reasons.. I will do it. Does anyone have experience with this kind of stuff?"

*Why are you waning to see it? If you don't mind me asking.*

Just since, when we were holding it last time I could have sworn that I had felt someone or something doing the same to us.

*Weird*

\*""\*Slowly laying the princess down making sure not to wake her you lay her down on the soft carpet. You turn towards the fridge. Noticing that your plushy has been accompanied by one that resembles the princess. Picking it up you notice the familiar warmth again. However due to your previous thoughts it's less a nostalgic glow, and more the feeling that you're in someone's warm hands. Squeezing it lightly you find that you become partly out of breath as the air is forced out of your lungs.""

Holy hell what happened?!?!?

**Did we do that?**

*I think it was us squeezing the plushy. I think we might be linked to it somehow. Makes me wonder if the princess is linked to hers as well.*

""You lean forward and lightly stroke the head of the princess's doll. From behind you hear the princess stir slightly in her sleep as if responding to an unseen stimulus.""

*It seems she is. That's strange. We should probably leave them in case we do something on accident.*

**We probably should. Wouldn't want to accidentally hurt her.**

Agreed. Also why are you being so quiet?

"".....Forgive me.""

Wait don't tell me...

""Picking up the two plushies you exit the dome and proceed towards the oven""

\[Resist\]

Why are you doing this?!??! I thought you had changed. I thought you were going to let us be happy together. I thought we didn't have to hurt each other anymore.

**I thought you were going to let us have fun for a change! We were so happy last night! Do you really want to take that from us?**

*I thought you had moved past you're previous goals. You said you were willing to let the world world end and that you wouldn't take our cherished moments from us. Was that all just a lie?*

""I'm sorry! I swear it wasn't. I hate that I have to go back on this. I thought all hope at saving the world was gone when the blade was rendered harmless and I had resigned myself to the consequences. But seeing this now. We still have a chance to save everyone. Please. I'm desperate""

""Quickly and silently you head towards the kitchen you turn the setting of the oven to the highest settings. You can already feel the heat emanating from its interior.""

\[Resist further\]

We have to do something. If he's wanting to kill the princess by throw in her plushy in here. I have an idea. But you may not like it.

*It's fine just think of anything! Quickly!*

I need you two to restrain him. Can you do that?

\[Both eepy and hero\] ***Got it!***

""What are you doing?!?! The world's on the line here. Wait. NO! You can't do that!""

Too late.

""Before I can make an attempt to correct your mistake you toss the princess's plushy behind you and your own into the oven. The pain is almost instant. Burns begin appearing over your body. The pain is too much for you to even stand""

This was the only thing we could do.

*You were going to kill the princess if we didn't do something.*

**Yeah. Didn't you see how nice she was? You can't let harm befall someone like her.**

""I'm sorry! You can understand me can't you? I didn't want to do this but it's the entire world that's on the line! I'm sorry! Im sorry!""

I think it might be a bit too late for that. I don't think we can hold out much longer anyway. We'll have to explain what happened when we get back. I hope she understands

*\[Both hero and eepy\] Yeah. Me too.*

*""I'm so sorry!""*

See you guys on the other side?

\[Both eepy and hero\] Yeah. We'll see you then.

**Chapter 3: The companion**

**""You're on a pa....""**

We're going to stop you right there. Boys! let's tie him up!

""What's the meaning of this?!?!?!""

*We already know about everything. About the cabin and the princess, and the looping every time we die.*

**And the fact that your a betraying, lying sack of crap!**

And before you say it. No we are **not** slaying her. We're leaving together.

\*\*""\*\*You're....... not slaying her? But she's a threat to the world! Everyone will die if she gets out! Including **you**. And the fact that you've been here means that her influence has most likely spread even further""

**You think that. But last time we were perfectly safe. Had a great  time together as well.**

I feel like this is not going anywhere. Could you just shove a sock or something in his mouth for a while?

*On it!*

\[proceed to cabin\]

How do you guys think we should explain what happened?

*Why don't you just tell her exactly what happened?*

**Would that involve telling her about us?**

*I guess so. But that shouldn't be too bad.*

I guess it shouldn't

\[Enter cabin\]

It's changed again.

*Yeah Most of those plushies have also disappeared too. The two of us are still here though. We should get rid of them before anything happens.*

*Agreed.*

***Dunno how but it seems like there's a hatch in the roof of the cabin. Why don't we hide them up there so nothing gets to them?***

Good idea!

\[Quiet has opened the hatch and entered the crawlspace above\]

*There's a padlock here as well. It's like the cabin is responding to our needs.*

They should be nice and safe up here though.

**Yeah. Nothing's harming em up here.**

\[Quiet has descended down the hatch and locked it tight with the padlock. They then proceed down the basement stairs\]

""**Is that you? Please come down, you left so suddenly. I really need to know why.""**

\[proceed down the stairs\]

(Upon seeing quiet the princess tears up and rushes towards him. Wrapping him in a warm embrace)

""**I'm really glad you're okay. You weren't there when I woke up. You weren't there and I saw what happened. Why? What happened?""**

\[outloud\] I'm really sorry for what happened, I wanted to leave with you once you had woken up but I really didn't have any other choice. I feel like you should know exactly what happened.""

""**I think i'd like that""**

Okay. So basically before we had first met. I had woken up in the forest. There was this voice telling me that I had needed to kill you. I don't know what his actual name is, but i've just always called him the narrator. But I never wanted to do that. I'd still never want to do that. There were other voices as well, 2 to be precise.""

""**Are these two other voices kind?""**

Very. Like me, they don't want to harm you either. Last time around it had appeared that even the narrator had changed. But once we had woken up it had turned out that it wasn't the case. You see, he believes that you're somehow a threat to the world.

""**A threat to the world?!?! But I don't want to hurt anyone. I like the world""**

I know you do. The other two, know you do. I never believed him from the start. You remember those plushies of ourselves that appeared last time around?

""**Yes""**

Well, it turned out that they sort of act like a voodoo doll of sorts, anything you do to them, happens to us.

""**So if i'm getting this right. You're saying that this ""narrator"" guy tried to destroy mine?""**

That's exactly what i'm trying to say. We couldn't let him do that so We had to try anything to get him to stop him. We really had no other choice than to burn our own. This time around the plushies were still here. So we decided to hide them far outside of our reach""

**""Thank you for that. I had no idea what had happened. I had just woken up to see your charred skeleton. I had no idea what to think. I do think locking the plushies away was the right idea though.""**

So you're not mad?

""**How could I be? You saved me after all!""**

I'm glad that went over well

**I'm just glad that she still likes us!**

""**You know how you said that you wanted to leave with me?""**

Yeah.

""**Well. I've always wanted to have the same. In fact i've prepared some bags for us. Should have all of the essentials that I know of""**

**\[In quiet's head\] There is only so much you can do in this basement. Even if it is fun. I'm down for this!**

*I'm on board with the plan as well. She's been down here for who knows how long. She should really see the outside world.*

\[Outloud\] You're really prepared! I don't know much about the outside myself to be honest. I've only ever been in the woods.

""**Then it's decided! Your bag is the one with the feather keychain""**

\*\*\[\*\*proceed back up the stairs\]

Are you okay? It seems like you're really nervous.

""**Yeah. I'm just nervous about what it'll be like. Like what if it's bad? But I think as long as i'm with you, it's all going to be okay""**

**\[exit the cabin\]**

\[In Quiet's Head\]

""Phleough! What're you doing? You can't just leave with her""

Yeah we know. The world is supposed to end. But take a look around you it's all still here.

""Wait. No. no no no no no. This can't be right. She's supposed to have ended the world. This isn't supposed to have been what happened.""

*But it is happening.*

Listen. You've been proven wrong about her. You can use this opportunity to get your bearings but in the mean time can you can describe things to us, okay?

""I suppose I have no other choice. As you look around at the outside world you find the princess doing the same. Her eyes wide and filled with a sense of awe and childlike wonder at the starry night above you, suddenly her attention is drawn to something up in the trees""

""**Look!!! It looks like you!""**

\*\*""\*\*Following her pointed finger you find that she's been pointing towards a bird resting on a branch on a tree nearby""

\[In quiet's head\]:

Do we really look like that?

*I mean we do have feathers*

**Why don't we ask her?**

\[Outloud\]

Do I really look like that? I don't think I've ever seen what I look like before.

""**You do kinda look like that. You're all feathery and you've also got wings! Can't tell if you have a beak or not though.""**

\[In head\]

**I guess we do look like that. Having wings is also news to me.**

\[outloud\]

I guess I must look like that. Didn't know I had wings though. That's neat!

""**I think it's cool as well! You also remind me of a big fluffy blanket!""**

You want to see what else is out there? I think we should probably head down the path I came here on.

""**Sounds like a plan!""**

""Progressing down the path the princess remains with the same childlike wonder she first portrayed. However she does seem to make an effort to remain close to your proximity. As you travel further the path you two are walking on seems to begin to branch off into separate paths, all of which seem to be fairly well traveled""

""**Seems we're getting close to something!""**

""Up ahead you find that the forest begins to become sparse emerging you see a large rolling country fields, over the horizon the sun begins to rise. Vibrant colours pouring over the horizons.""

Woah

""That's really pretty!""

""As you're looking out into the horizon you find that there's a building in the distance.""

Wonder what that building's used for?

""**Why don't we find out?""**

""It takes you some time, not that time is a thing to worry about. You and the princess trek across the country fields soaking in the surroundings as you do so""

""**The outside world really is magnificent""**

It really is

""Eventually you both make it to the building and head inside""

""Inside you find that it seems to house the entrance for a tourist attraction of some kind. There are others as well. You can't seem to see any that look like you, all of them seeming to have physical characteristics of the princess""

\[In quiet's head\]

This looks interesting. Wonder what""s being done here.

**Should we try to ask one of the people here?**

*I guess that'll be the most logical way of figuring things out*

\[outloud\]

""Approaching the counter you go over many things in your head. What question's do you ask? How do you greet them?. Approaching you find the individual stiffen up as they notice your approach.""

\[in quiet's head\]

**Are they okay? I hope we're not scaring them somehow**.

*Let's try to act natural*

\[outloud\]

Hi! Uh, I don't really get out much but me and my companion there (gestures to princess) just happened to see this building and was wondering what it's used for? Seems to be an attraction of some kind, from what I can guess.

""The individual behind the counter seems to relax after your introduction. Seemingly convincing them that you're not some kind of threat.""

(w) Uh... Well this building has been built over a large cave system. So in order to educate any potential visitors about the different landforms that can occur down there, we offer guided tours. Forgive me if I offended you for being a bit frightened at your appearance.

\[in quiet's head\]

***So that's what they were afraid of? Not that it offends me or anything.***

*Doesn't offend me either. I mean we don't even know what we look like ourselves.*

\[outloud\]

It's fine!  I don't think I've ever seen my own appearance to be honest. I have been told that I look like a bird though

(W) I would say that's an apt descriptor. I may have a solution for you since you say you've never seen yourself before

""As he says that he begins rummaging through some unseen compartment before producing a rectangular shaped device. Pressing a button, a flash occurs and from a receptacle at the bottom a small piece of paper is produced. The clerk then hands you the device and paper""

(W) I'll let you have this photo for free, I'll let you have a look at the camera as well. If you decide to buy a ticket for your friend and yourself come and notify me. You'll get to hold on to the camera if you purchase tickets as well as they're included.

\[In Quiet's head\]

So that's what it's called!

*Should we have a look at ourselves?*

**I'd really want to!**

""Flipping the piece of paper over in your hand, you gaze upon yourself for the first time. You find that the princess was right in her description. Looking back up at you are a pair of snow white eyes set on top of a feathered head. The ret of your body seems to be humanoid although you can't overly tell as it seems to be largely covered by two large feathered wings. The most puzzling characteristic though is what seems to be a large beak filled with teeth. Although it does seem like its presence alters every time you look at it.""

Wait. So that's what we look like?!?!

**I mean she** ***did*** **say we looked like a bird.**

*She did. But I would still consider it a bit of a surprise to see it for ourselves*

""As you're analysing your photograph the princess seems to have finished looking around and notices what you're doing. Quickly stepping up to see what exactly you're looking at""

""**What're you looking at?""**

The person behind the desk used this \[holds up camera\] to take a photo of me. Just intrigued by it as I've never seen myself before. They say we can get it included if we buy a ticket to the tours they're offering.

""**I can see why you're fascinated by this! Wait. Can you try it on me?""**

**""**As she says this she backs up a few steps in order for you to get a full view. Remembering when the worker took your own photo you raise up the camera and press the button located on the top. The flash goes off, startling the princess a little. However she comes back up and pulls the photo free from its producer""

""**Woah... That is cool! You said we can own this if we buy a ticket? I'm on board if that's what you're going to be asking me.""**

Then I guess it's decided!

\[To the worker\]

Hi! I'd like to get a ticket for me and my good friend here.

(w) Okay so here you go and have a good time!

My [28F] boyfriends new job [28M] is hurting our relationship,relationship_advice,1i9vjvu,2025-01-25 15:00:21,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i9vjvu/my_28f_boyfriends_new_job_28m_is_hurting_our/,sad-gf_throwaway,,"
I [28F] have been dating my now boyfriend [28M] for a little over 3 months. We started talking around 5 months ago, but only made it official in October. Warning in advance for the length of this post - I am autistic and have a really hard time condensing details. TLDR at the bottom. 

When we started the relationship, it was a dream. We both want the same lifestyle, work toward marriage and a family, me AuDHD and him ADHD, both highly creative, both high achievers with many hobbies. We would have these extremely interesting conversations about special areas of knowledge, multi-paragraph texts, teaching each other about our hobbies, a lot of mutual flirtation and chemistry. Talking to him was the best part of my day and I would genuinely look forward to hearing from him, we took our own time and space but the time we did share was very high quality. He’s the only man I’ve ever found intellectually challenging enough to make me deeply interested. We would exchange 10-15 high quality messages per day, and see each other 1-2x per week for dates (driving out to the beach, trying new restaurants, laying in the park and talking for hours, going for walks around town to check out local businesses). He paid for a few dates in the very beginning to be gentlemanly, and then we quickly worked to a good 50/50 split, taking turns spoiling each other. Our communication is above average and our emotional connection is very deep. 

In the beginning, he would always insist that he wanted to see me as much as possible - if I ever needed him, I should ask and he would be there in a heartbeat. He would tell me, without me asking, that he wanted to support me and that taking care of me was his privilege (we both have physical disabilities that cause a lot of pain, and this sentiment was mutual). I felt extremely secure in the relationship, very supported, understood, desired and genuinely happy. 

Around November, he was settling in at a new job working 9-5 and at the same time he moved back in with his parents (more on that later). At first, the job didn’t seem to affect things - we still had our date nights, we would text here and there throughout the workday, still very thoughtful conversations. However, around this time his pain condition started to flare up and our sex life was impacted. Previously, we were very compatible - without going into things too much, he was an enthusiastic pleasure dom and I am the perfect counterpart to that (our size difference really plays into the dynamic, as I am very petite and he is above average height and build). He knew there were certain things I didn’t prefer to do in the bedroom due to trauma, and insisted he would not miss or need those things at all. After his pain started kicking in, he would increasingly ask me for these things, getting to the point of a complete role reversal where I was the one servicing 95% of the time and he would just lay back. This became hard on me physically because of our size difference, I would get dizzy and exhausted during, and I stopped enjoying our sex. Aftercare was lacking, when previously it was great. I can’t lie, he got a little bit lazy, and put on an amount of weight in a short period of time after starting the job which I think contributed to this change. I have never commented on his weight or feeling he was being lazy, but I did have an honest conversation about how my experience had been impacted. He recognized the change, acknowledged it and worked toward improvements. I acknowledged his recent increase in pain, and came up with solutions that worked for both of us. This was enough at the time, but marks the beginning of the changes I’ve seen since starting this new job. 

Around December, I noticed he had stopped planning dates for us and all the compliments and bids for my time were disappearing. Our hang outs became routine, with him coming to my house to sleep over every weekend by default. At only 2 months, this felt really soon to be settling into a routine. I felt he had gotten too comfortable too fast, especially since we had multiple mutual conversations in the early stages about how relationships should be a consistent effort, and how losing the desire to impress your partner would inevitably lead to the death of the relationship. We had talked at length about these things and both enthusiastically agreed that it was important to us to have an intentional and passionate relationship. Our messages became mostly sexting, and mostly possessive or degrading. We share some mutual kinks surrounding these things, and while we enjoy them in bed, I felt for a while that I was being reduced to an object of possession both in and out of the bedroom. I had another honest conversation about this, where I expressed my feelings - I reaffirmed that I do still enjoy our spicy conversations, but I just needed more of that initial romance and general emotional cherishing I used to get from him, along with more intellectual conversation. At this point, I was catering to him a lot and almost exclusively compromising myself for our relationship. I wanted to be patient and pull my weight in the relationship. 

After this conversation, he essentially stopped talking to me about sex and stopped flirting whatsoever, outside of when I would initiate. (I would come to find out later that he took what I asked for way too far and became afraid to even mention sex, for worry of it upsetting me. He ignored the part where I said I love our spicy conversations but need more of the other stuff, and just cut out the spice altogether.) Now I was not receiving the romantic affirmation I needed, and also not receiving any sexual attention either. I tried to improve things by stepping up and planning dates, and really attempting to make the holiday season special. I started paying for a lot more of our dates, buying him nice gifts (Dior cologne, David Yurman bracelet), arranging our dates (intimate underground concert, holiday light shows, zoo, dinner dates) and complimenting him more. I started initiating most of our sexual interactions as well, and even leaned harder into some of his interests to assure his pleasure. For the month of December, I felt that I was leading the relationship and replacing his efforts as the masculine partner. I felt a great impact to my ability to be feminine and lean into the relationship emotionally, needing to put him before myself to keep things afloat. 

Because I am autistic, I don’t know exactly where to draw the line on these things and I thought what I was doing was helpful, not wanting to uphold patriarchal expectations, wanting to support him and give him a break. I wanted to show that I care about the relationship enough to step up. Throughout all of this, I considered that he may be losing interest in me or pulling away, and I really gently and amicably asked him if he thought time away from the relationship would be helpful. I regularly open space for feedback and dialogue in our relationship, and our communication is really above average (at least on my part). The entire time, he has insisted that he is extremely in love with me, finds no fault in me as a partner,  is lucky to be with me, sees me as his future wife and mother of his children, wants to spend all his time with me, etc. However he keeps noticing himself falling short. 

We come back to the “taking care” part of things that was previously insisted upon. In the end of December, he got sick and I took care of him for the weekend - such good care that he recovered in 2 days. I have a lot of experience with caregiving and know how to meet needs without being asked. Later in the same week, I caught the illness he had and it turned out to be Covid. I became much more sick than he was, and he said he would come take care of me. The entire time he was “taking care of” me, I did not feel taken care of - I had to ask him to get me medicine, to get us food, to help me with every little thing. When he was sick, I paid for all of the medicine and food. When I was sick, I offered to pay for things and he accepted my money rather than insisting on returning the favor. This all left me questioning whether I could picture a future with someone I didn’t fully trust to take care of me. I was sick for almost 2 weeks and spent most of that alone with no help, and lost out on a lot of income from work (I am self employed in a high earning arts industry). 

Throughout all of this, I have been supporting myself independently, running a successful business, having my own house (rented with one housemate in a HCOL area), performing 90% of house chores (I have an agreement with my housemate, who pays more rent in exchange as he is terrible at cleaning), taking care of two animals (one of them being recently diagnosed with diabetes, requiring a lot of extra care and $$$), and I have been bending over backwards to make my relationship work. I have zero family involvement in my life due to childhood abuse, and have been on my own since 17. I spend all of my free time on adulting, improving my business, caring for my animals, caring for my home, exercising and cooking, etc. 

He, on the other hand, has full family support from a very wealthy family. When we met, he was working part time hours in a recreational field doing a very expensive hobby he enjoys. He has no pets, no dependents. He had an apartment when we met, but moved back home when his lease was up (which I encouraged, to put extra money toward his student loans). He has no obligations outside of work, does not contribute financially to his household, and only does a few chores here and there when asked. He spends his free time golfing, surfing, and working on various hobby projects involving 3D modeling, laser etching, sculpting etc. 

In January, my workplace (studio space, contracted) was going through a lot of changes and the owner put a lot of work onto me that  is not my responsibility, along with some other work stressors. My already full plate became overflowing, and my physical disability worsens with cold weather. I hit the wall and burn out badly, with autistic burnout, and physical symptoms. I have a condition (MCAS) that causes allergic reactions in response to severe stress. While going through all of this, I have never been demanding of my partner’s time or attention, but when it got so bad that I was worried I may need medical attention I broke down and asked him to be here for me. His response was to pull away, tell me his work had been really impacting his time and energy, and that I should seek an outside third party for help. I expressed actual severe and pressing personal needs to him ONE time, and he shut down. I told him I was so burnt out and overwhelmed, I felt like I was drowning, breaking out in hives, and having serious heart issues. All I asked him to do was come over and be with me and provide some comfort. He did eventually come over, but he caused more distress than help, just sitting near me and staring at me. Somehow I ended the day taking care of him and giving him a 45 minute massage because his shoulder pain had been bothering him. I looked around at the house uncleaned, chores undone, myself having ordered and paid for dinner for us, not having felt my stress relieved in the slightest and felt something break. I no longer trusted this man could be a life partner. If one 9-5 job with no other obligations was enough to render him nearly useless, unable to provide basic support or care, unable to engage in conversation as we used to, unable to provide reassurance or any amount of romance to our relationship… how could he possibly handle building a family together? 

The reason I am here asking for advice is because I don’t know how to trust my own intuition, being autistic and having different thought patterns. I want to be reasonable and I’m afraid my standards will leave me alone for the rest of my life, as I’ve never met a partner who could match my effort and thoughtfulness. I end up feeling hurt constantly by the lack of effort I feel from people who claim they love me, and this is a pattern. I need to highlight the good things he’s done that give me pause:

When I bring my concerns to him, we have reasonable conversations. It takes him longer to come to an understanding, but he has never raised his voice or gotten angry and he lets me speak and never talks over me. He ways acknowledges my feelings and makes what seem like genuine promises to put effort and do better. 

He has converted on feedback I’ve given in the past. He always opens my car door, he has bought me flowers a handful of times, he adjusted things in the bedroom to meet my needs again, he makes attempts to spend time when he is tired (setting up video game nights to play over discord). 

He puts in the time and effort to drive to me more often than I drive to him, a roughly 30-45min drive, because I really dislike driving. He drives us when we are together. 

He made plans for a nice dinner date for us, although it took a month and was canceled at the last minute due to ICE raids impacting the restaurant, he attempted and put a lot of thought into planning a romantic thing. 

He has made me thoughtful little gifts with his skills, some that took a good amount of time and some money. He made me a necklace from sea glass we collected together, a music box with a song from one of my favorite Ghibli films, a paper version of my favorite flower, a specialized piece of equipment related to my work, a hand sculpted jewelry bowl when he heard me say I had nowhere to put my rings. Though most of these happened in the first 2 months when things were good, he has shown he has the ability to execute a level of thoughtfulness with these that far exceeds any other man I’ve been involved with.  

He has been there for me in the beginning in ways that are vital to my life, washing my hair for me when the nerve pain in my hands was too severe, brushing my hair out for me, bringing me food when I was in too much pain to leave my bed. 

I am deeply conflicted because through all of this, I genuinely believe that he has the ability to be such a thoughtful and caring partner. It’s just in recent months, his actions have made me feel incredibly neglected and even abandoned at times. He insists his feelings have only grown stronger and none of this is because he’s pulled away or become less interested, but that it’s all because he is tired from his work. We barely speak or see each other beyond the routine “good morning, did you eat lunch, how was your day, don’t stay up too late” etc. Now on the weekends, he isn’t looking forward to seeing me, he is taking extra days away to practice his hobbies and see his friends (which I always acknowledge as very important and outwardly support, regardless of my own feelings of loneliness and loss of priority in his life). We had a deep conversation about this where he acknowledged it hasn’t been fair to me and that he feared starting a 9-5 job would hurt his ability to be present in our relationship. He showed a lot of vulnerability, and really broke down crying. I provided a lot of emotional support, met his needs, and put my own needs on the back burner again. 

I don’t know how long I can put my needs on the back burner like that, while supporting his. I am starting to resent him, feeling my cup is empty and my plate is overflowing with no support. While he struggles with his one obligation (work) and uses the free time to make space for himself and his needs and hobbies, I am expected to over perform and handle my dozen obligations, have very little time for myself, and disregard my own emotional and romantic needs. This feels like it may just be the same general trap that most women fall into, of playing every role, having to have the capacity to do everything. I am terrified of committing to a partner that makes me worry I will be spreading myself thin my whole life, caring for everyone and having no one to care for me. Having grown up in an abusive home, I have never in my entire life had another person truly care for me and I worry it will kill me one day, I’m so exhausted. Yet I stay calm and level, never ask for too much, get the work done. I just want my one person, my life partner, to be the one space I feel safe and supported but I don’t know if that’s realistic. 

Reddit, I don’t know if I’m giving up a good thing out of fear, or if the valid concerns I have are enough of a red flag. Relationships are complicated, I don’t want to be alone forever, I don’t want to be exhausted forever either. How long is a reasonable amount of time to wait it out, with a relationship of only 3 months? If you’ve experienced similar, what helped? 

TLDR; Amazing relationship became not so amazing after partner [28M] started new job, taking away his time and energy. Imbalance in effort and responsibilities is causing me [28F] resentment and emotional pain. We love each other, but we question our ability to make it through this without damaging our relationship permanently. He wants things to work, I am exhausted and feel neglected. Should we step away from this relationship, or weather the storm together? What can we do to improve things for the both of us?"

Keep running into a problem. would love some thoughts.,dawless,1i9vhwo,2025-01-25 14:57:54,1,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dawless/comments/1i9vhwo/keep_running_into_a_problem_would_love_some/,jash9020,,"So i have a live setup that consists of a keystep pro, yamaha mu90 and fb-01, 404a and mk2, and mg10xuf for the mixer. I also have my guitar running through an ms70cdr and a couple other pedals. The problem i keep running into is whether i should have the end of the chain be the mixer or have the mixer end at the 404mk2

 big pros of having end of mk2
-I really need master fx for transitioning between songs, i often blast delays and phasers at the end of songs 
-gives the 2 synth modules some extra effects because other than the onboard effects of the mixer i dont have much else. I do have those cheap behringer multi-fx pedals for them but thats it

Big cons of mk2 at end of chain
- makes the Mk2 basically rendered to just an effects box. I can do a bit of running samples through it but very limited as i cant fade out samples if its not going through the mixer because everything is running through it
-The workflow is so much easier and smoother on the mk2. I do most of the sequencing Keystep pro but editing samples goes so much quicker with it and it would open up another big option for samples instead of sequencing all the samples on one midi channel (the 404a) 

What do you guys think?
Feel free to ask questions and to criticize the shit out of me.

Also ik getting a digitakt would be an answer but i really want to make it work with what i got. Thats part of the art aint it?


I also considered having the 404a be the end of the chain but no usb so i cant record into my phone easily, and only one effect at a time.

Thank you for your helps!!"

“I demand proof of the faction’s solvency. They may be registered with the Arena, but have they even challenged a single floor? Can they even field a squad, for that matter? I’ve seen Dave’s accomplishments if you can call them that. He's conquered nothing more than a few dungeons while he was mostly carried by his betters, so tell me, how exactly is this faction solvent?” Korl asked, the rage now plain in his voice. I disagreed with my own capabilities; at least past the first dungeon, no one had carried me. Sure, Elicec was emerging as the real combat leader, but I was never going to be good at that anyway. This was entirely beside the point, though. Korl was mostly right, if for the wrong reasons. In no way was I qualified to run a faction. The idea that my house would be the main source of mana for Earth had been bad enough, but this? Dammit, Mel, was this really the only choice?

“Hmm, Korl has a point. I’d rather not grant a universe to a faction that is completely incapable. The Spiral doesn’t need that kind of instability. Melhelm, what are the plans for continuity of faction?” the three balls asked. Great, so it wasn’t just Earth. It was the entire universe.

“Those two over there are. They just happen to be Dave’s kids. The daughter is currently knocked up, so the line of succession is pretty secure,” Mel answered. Alex’s eyes went wide when Mel said this, but she managed to stay silent. Was I going to be a grandfather? I tried to sneak an approving smile at my daughter, but she wasn’t looking my way.

“And the rest of the offices? Are you planning to pull double duty as an adventurer hall representative and Arena manager?” the judge asked. Just how many positions did we have to fill to be a real faction?

“I am, but as most of those here haven’t sworn the soul oath, I ain’t gonna risk commenting much there,” Mel answered.

“Exception granted. If he’s going to be a faction leader anyway, it’s not like that will matter, and I want to hear it all before I render any decision,” the judge said. I felt a wave of force pass over me after the words. Had that temporarily disabled Mel’s soul oath? Wait, why didn’t faction leaders have to take one? That was strange.

“Thanks. As you know, my record as a manager speaks pretty damn well for itself. While I may have retired, that doesn’t mean I ain’t willing ta return to help some people I consider my friends. And no, we obviously can’t field a full squad. But that ain’t a damned requirement anyway. Hell, Sanquar here famously fought alone most of the time. Cecile, Elicec, Elody, and Dave himself oughtta be plenty until we recruit some new climbers,” Mel explained. It seemed like there was no avoiding the Arena now, and somehow, that was much less of an anxiety-inducing thought than being emperor was.

“Fine, I can see where the vast majority of offices can be filled with who you have here, but there are two pretty big gaps. How do you plan to manage traffic between the Spiral and here? This world is mana barren, so you aren’t building any kind of door anytime soon, and not even Miss Elody here is capable of being an official Spiral liaison,” the judge continued. I thought I knew the answer to at least one of those. Traveler’s offer could easily fulfill the first part.

“One of the Travelers has already granted Dave, and by extension his empire, free travel, and is planning to migrate here in a new traveler’s gate once we have all the paperwork done. As for the second, you’re right; we don’t actually have anyone lined up yet. But, hey, Pryte, interested in a change of scenery? I imagine your job is about to get real unfun soon, so why not change up your career a bit?” Mel called to the little man next to Elody.

“Yes, actually, I would be very interested,” Pryte answered, sounding oddly afraid. Had Korl threatened him? What had happened once the paperwork was discovered and they realized Sanquar was here and learned of Pryte’s role in hiding it for as brief a time as he had managed?

“Well then, I have my ruling, which will be contingent on one thing, which I will cover after it. I doubt either party will be overly happy with it, so I’m confident it’s the right move. Korl, they do, in fact, have everything needed to form a faction, and while yes, the laws on the matter are archaic, they are still on the books. Dave was able to repel the orc invasion, even going so far as to kill the Singing Blade’s squad leader. He has every right to lead his universe. That said, Melhelm, you need to recognize we cannot have any more chaos than we currently have. Things have grown increasingly tense with how long it has been since the last System expansion, and we don’t need a faction war breaking out trying to claim this new universe. So, The Empire of Dave has one month to climb past the tenth floor of the Arena. Otherwise, the universe goes to Korl,” the judge said. Mel’s jaw dropped, and I was sure that wasn’t a good sign.

“Zcalria, we need longer than that, please. No one can climb that fast,” Mel said pleadingly.

“You aren’t getting it, and trust me, Melhelm, it’s for the best. You need to prove just what your faction can do, or the wolves will be on you before the week is out, but as I said, this is still contingent on a single thing. Dave, you haven’t spoken the entire time I’ve been here, despite the fact that you have looked ready to. Is everything Melhelm has said true? Are you really willing to be the head of a faction?” Zcalria asked. I was not, but it turned out I was going to be a grandfather, and I was already a father. That meant I had responsibilities to protect my family, and even beyond that, I couldn’t just abandon my friends who had been so willing to follow me back here.

“Sorry, my dislike of Korl primarily kept me quiet. Mel understandingly made sure I didn’t put my foot in my mouth there. Do I want to lead the faction? No, not really. I’m going to, though. I can’t run away from responsibility, and this is the hand that was dealt, so I guess I’m the emperor of the Empire of Dave,” I said. What choice did I have but to do everything in my power to protect those I cared about?

“Good answer. Well, that settles that for now. I’ll see you all in a month. Korl, in the meantime, you are to stay out of this universe,” Zcalria said before both he and Korl vanished.

“Dammit, dammit, dammit. That was going so damn well too, but y’all just ain’t ready for that quick of a climb. I know Dave can do some insane shit, but there’s just no way,” Mel said, sighing loudly and changing color to a dark blue.

“Put aside the idea we can’t, as we now have no choice, and I haven’t signed on with a losing faction. The judge was nice enough to leave the soul oath inoperable as far as I can tell, so explain what you’re so worried about, Mel,” Elody said.

“Look, you can likely carry them all through the first seven floors without much of a hassle. I ain’t worried there. Hell, ya can probably even find and recruit the three more people yer gonna need for the eighth. With a lotta luck, it’s even possible y’all make it through the ninth. The problem is the Tenth. It’s a two-squad duel, and killing is entirely allowed. Whoever we’re up against is definitely gonna get paid to go for a total team kill, and I promise y’all they’ll be fielding a full fifteen people. I don’t know how we get y’all ready to win that fight in time,” Mel said, his color going even more blue.

“Okay, then we worry about the tenth when we get there. Why do we need to recruit more people?” Elody asked. Not to mention, how did we recruit more people? We didn’t exactly have, well, anything to offer.

“The first floor is a grand melee. Well, it’s more of a bloodbath, honestly, but a hundred faction squads and just as many free agents are tossed into a constructed city, and hundreds of monsters are let loose. None of the free agents are prepared for it. Almost all of them end up dead by the end. The few that make it through are usually so far in debt to a sponsor they may as well be their slave. The floor ends once only ten squads and/or free agents are still able to fight, and all the monsters are dead. Which means people generally start slaughtering each other, and the faction with the most power will have outfitted their squads so well that the free agents don’t really stand a chance,” Mel explained.

“Couldn’t they just all band together and instantly win once the monsters were dead?” I asked. It seemed like a viable way.

“They could, and it’s even happened before. They were all dead by the next day. Those at the bottom do not get to make peace calls for those at the top, and trying to disobey a faction leader is a great way to end up dead, but the good news here is that with all them free agents desperate to get through it alive, there’s likely to be a few you can convince to join up. Oh, and the word free here is a bit of a misnomer. Some of these guys will not be there of their own free will. They just won’t have any squad backing ‘em,” Mel explained. Well, that at least explained how we could get some people.

“Hey, you’re the ones that killed Wralf, right? I’m willing to join your squad in exchange for my life!” a voice yelled from a figure exiting the woods. Was that an orc?

*The first floor of the Arena was originally designed as a way for people to make alliances and learn to form bonds that would teach them how to better defend their own worlds and help promote the diversity of System pathways. Instead, it has long since turned into a way to churn through those unlucky enough not to understand the reality of what the Arena has become.*

Colin Robinson Origin Story,u_DryCalligrapher8696,1i9vc7i,2025-01-25 14:50:38,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_DryCalligrapher8696/comments/1i9vc7i/colin_robinson_origin_story/,DryCalligrapher8696,,"The Infamous White Spirit: The Hidden Legacy of Colin Robinson

Centuries ago, long before the modern world and its shifting political landscapes, there was a being known only in whispers and shadows. He was not a ghost, nor a vampire in the traditional sense. He was something far older, a creation that existed outside of history and time, something feared and spoken of as The White Spirit. No one knew exactly where he came from, but those who encountered him would never forget the inexplicable fatigue that followed—a drain of not just energy, but of hope itself.

The Beginning: The White Spirit’s Creation

In the early 18th century, during the height of colonial expansion, the indigenous peoples of North America were faced with the encroachment of settlers, desperate to preserve their way of life. They had long protected their land with spiritual rites that connected them to the earth and its unseen forces. But as colonization grew, these traditional methods seemed increasingly futile against the overwhelming tide of European settlers.

In a last-ditch effort to fight back, some native leaders turned to darker, more forbidden rituals. They sought to create a being who could drain not the blood, but the spirit—the very energy that sustained a people’s will. The idea was simple: weaken the invaders so completely that they would never have the strength or desire to continue their conquest.

The ritual, steeped in secrecy, summoned a being who would become known as The White Spirit. His true name was lost to history, but he was said to be a pale figure, with the ability to drain the vitality of anyone who dared interact with him. This spirit would walk among the settlers, engaging them in long, boring conversations, filling their minds with tedious details and relentless monotony. The more they listened, the more their energy was drained. Those who encountered him would feel an overwhelming fatigue, an inability to fight or resist. The spirit didn’t need to kill them—he simply rendered them too weak to continue their efforts.

The U.S. Government’s Discovery

As the 19th century dawned, the U.S. government, obsessed with westward expansion, began to notice strange phenomena. Colonists were reporting feelings of exhaustion and disinterest, with some giving up their land entirely for no clear reason. At first, these reports were dismissed as mere superstition, but as the phenomenon spread, it caught the attention of high-ranking officials.

President James Madison, eager to ensure control over the expanding territory, sent a covert investigation to the region, where they uncovered a series of strange encounters with the “White Spirit.” They were told of a pale figure who could suck the very will to fight from anyone around him. Some whispered that he was the embodiment of the land’s forgotten spirits, others believed he was a dark creation designed to fight the European invasion. Whatever the truth, the government realized that this being was not just a myth—it was a powerful weapon that could be controlled.

Plum Island: The Birth of the Energy Vampire

The U.S. government seized upon the discovery, hoping to replicate and weaponize the White Spirit. They turned Plum Island, then a small, uninhabited plot of land, into a secret research facility where they studied the phenomenon. Through a mixture of scientific experimentation and stolen indigenous rituals, the government sought to recreate the energy-draining abilities of the White Spirit. This became Project Vitalis.

But they didn’t want the spirit to simply weaken their enemies—they wanted to control their own people. The government’s goal was to create beings who could drain the energy of the populace, preventing rebellion and stifling any attempts at social or political upheaval. The result was the first energy vampires—beings who could drain the willpower of anyone they interacted with, making them docile and unmotivated. They were placed throughout society, hidden in plain sight, in mundane positions like bureaucrats, teachers, and office workers.

As the experiment progressed, one being stood out among the rest. A particularly powerful energy vampire, named Colin Robinson, emerged as a key figure. Unlike his counterparts, Colin was not created by mistake; he was the pinnacle of the government’s experimentation. The White Spirit had been reborn in him.

The Infamous White Spirit: Colin Robinson

Colin Robinson, while appearing to be an unassuming office worker, was in fact the reincarnation of the White Spirit—a figure who had walked through centuries, feeding on the energy of the masses. His pale skin, his mundane demeanor, and his ability to suck the life from any conversation were not mere quirks; they were traits passed down from the ancient being who had once drained the will of settlers.

He walked through history, undetected, feeding off the energies of anyone who dared to listen to his tiresome monologues. The government, aware of his power, allowed him to continue his existence as a tool of control. But Colin, with his insatiable hunger for energy, was more than just a government experiment. Over the years, he grew disillusioned with the very people who created him.

As time wore on, Colin grew increasingly independent, feeding off anyone, anywhere, regardless of their position in society. The U.S. government, still unsure of how to fully control him, continued to watch from the shadows, unsure of whether Colin was truly a creation of their own or if he was something much older and far more dangerous—something that could not be contained.

**The Present: Colin Robinson’s Quiet Rebellion**

Today, Colin Robinson remains an enigma—an ancient, forgotten weapon who has lived through the rise and fall of empires, silently draining the life force of modern society. His true purpose, buried deep within the forgotten history of the U.S. government’s secret projects, remains a mystery to most. Some say that he is still connected to the White Spirit, a being who was never meant to be controlled but merely used as a tool to keep populations docile & disillusioned.

Now, Colin moves through the modern world, feeding on the everyday frustration, boredom, and apathy that saturate the lives of ordinary people. His energy-sucking powers remain unchecked, as society’s relentless pace of distractions keeps people from recognizing the quiet force that drains them. Whether he is a tool of control or an agent of chaos is unclear—but one thing is certain: **Colin Robinson, the White Spirit, will never be defeated.**"
Repulsor Metamorphosis,CTsandbox,1i9v9vq,2025-01-25 14:47:48,4,0.84,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CTsandbox/comments/1i9v9vq/repulsor_metamorphosis/,Zealousideal_Lab8117,Cursed technique ,"This technique allows the user to transform parts of their body into CE-fueled repulsion engines. These engines generate powerful bursts of force and momentum, allowing for enhanced speed, flight-like movement, and devastating shockwave-based attacks. The repulsion force can be focused through specific limbs, such as the hands, feet, or even the back, to propel the user in any direction or launch high-impact strikes that amplify physical force. Unlike traditional energy blasts, these engines work by expelling CE in bursts that create repulsive force, pushing against the surrounding environment or the user’s own body.

The user can activate repulsor engines in their arms or legs to deliver explosive punches and kicks, generating enough kinetic energy to shatter defenses and send opponents flying. By activating engines on their back or feet, the user can achieve extreme aerial maneuverability, dashing through the air at high speeds while adjusting their trajectory mid-flight. Additionally, the technique can generate continuous shockwaves around the body for defensive purposes, repelling incoming projectiles or enemies with an outward blast of force.

The repulsor engines are not limited to propulsion alone; they can also be used to create destructive pressure fields. By releasing CE in rapid, concentrated bursts, the user can generate localized gravitational pushes that distort space around them, repelling everything within a certain radius. This makes it possible to neutralize melee attacks or even redirect energy-based techniques by overwhelming their momentum with repulsive force.




The technique’s power depends on how much CE is channeled into the repulsor engines. Simple propulsion requires minimal energy, but generating high-speed flight or powerful repulsive bursts consumes significantly more CE, quickly depleting reserves if overused. The intense kinetic recoil from repulsor-enhanced attacks places tremendous strain on the user’s muscles, bones, and joints. Continuous use without proper control can cause severe injuries, such as torn ligaments, fractures, or internal damage.

Activating the engines requires precise timing and CE manipulation. Misjudging the force output or direction can lead to unintended collisions or loss of control, leaving the user vulnerable. Each activation of a repulsor engine produces force in a single, linear direction. Rapid adjustments require multiple bursts, making it difficult to maintain stability in crowded or unpredictable environments.

If too much CE is released in a single burst, the repulsor engine may explode with destructive force, damaging the user as well as their surroundings. This risk increases when using full-body propulsion or attempting large-scale shockwave generation. Techniques that can absorb kinetic energy or CE greatly reduce the effectiveness of this technique, as they counter the outward blasts of repulsion directly.





Extension Techniques:


Blast Step: Propels the user forward with a short, high-speed burst, enabling rapid dashes that leave afterimages to confuse enemies.

Breakthrough Fist: Enhances a punch with a concentrated repulsor engine burst, delivering an impact that creates a shockwave upon contact, capable of shattering barriers.

Repulsion Overdrive: Charges the repulsor engines for a continuous burst of CE, allowing for sustained propulsion rather than short bursts.

Concussive Palm: Generates a wide-area shockwave from the user’s palms, sending multiple enemies flying in a cone-shaped blast.





Cursed Technique Reversal:


Compression Engines: The user generates inward-pulling forces instead of outward blasts. This allows them to pull enemies or objects toward themselves at high speeds, enabling devastating close-range grapples or compression-based attacks. For example, pulling an enemy into a compression punch concentrates kinetic energy into a single point for bone-crushing force.





Domain Expansion:


Endless Recoil: The domain manifests as a massive, mechanical expanse filled with rotating repulsor engines.


Every action within the domain is subjected to continuous bursts of repulsion, pushing enemies away from the user and destabilizing their movements. The user’s repulsor engines operate at peak efficiency, allowing for limitless bursts of propulsion without energy drain for the duration of the domain.

All physical strikes or movements within the domain generate secondary shockwaves, making even minor actions produce destructive force. The user can create localized repulsion fields that push objects or enemies into spiraling trajectories, disorienting them and rendering their attacks ineffective.

Opponents are trapped in an inescapable vortex of kinetic force, continuously pushed, bounced, and thrown around the domain until it ends."

I wanted to try and compile tinywl for myself, but I ran against a wall when running tinywl fails because it cannot find ""/run/opengl-driver/lib/gbm/dri_gbm.so"".

Specifically, it fails with the following error:

```
<...>

I'm using the following packages in my devShell:

```

Most online resources about errors when running tinywl recommend setting `hardware.graphics.enable` to `true`, which I have done, but it does not fix my error.

The curious thing is that running tinywl using `nix run nixpkgs#tinywl` works perfectly.

Does anybody have an idea how I could fix this?"

The Bingo challenge is always a highlight of April for me - it's fun, always surprising, and gives me an excuse to shake up my TBR. This is my eighth card, and I’m already looking forward to the next one.

# Bingo 2024: Difficulty

Okay, I know this is subjective, but I found this year’s Bingo to be the easiest one yet. Most of the squares ""slotted"" into my reading naturally, and only two (Bards, Published in 1990s) required some actual research. One of those books turned out to be amazing; the other… let’s just say it wasn’t.

# Favorite Squares

* ***Judge a Book by Its Cover***: Super fun square! Plus, I picked a brilliant book for it, but your mileage may vary and perhaps I was just lucky.
* ***Eldritch Creatures:*** I love horror, so this was right up my alley.
* ***Small Town***: Something about cozy (or creepy) small-town vibes always hooks me.
* **Survival:** Who doesn’t love a good survival story?

# Least Favorite Squares

* ***Book Club/Readalong:*** Ironically, I lead a book club, yet this square always feels like a chore. Why? It gives less room for personal choice, and yes, I know I'm being irrational. The database of eligible books is massive. But I can't help it - it makes me feel it's a closed set and I like to have freedom :P Irrational, as mentioned. Happily, the book I picked for it is one of my favorite books read in 2024.
* ***The Bard***: Surprisingly, bards aren't that easy to find nowadays. The book I picked for this square was the weakest thing I read all year, but that’s on me. I could’ve done a better research.
* ***Romantasy:*** Look, I’m not a romance reader, so this square was always going to be a slog for me. I prefer my books dark, gritty, and romance-free. Fortunately, the book that happens to meet the criteria of the square is excellent, and I couldn't be happier with my choice.

# BOOKS & MINI-REVIEWS

Here are my mini-reviews for each square. Most of these are shortened versions of my Goodreads reviews. Ideally, my Bingo card would feature only books I rated 4 stars or higher, but some squares make that tricky. If you have any recommendations for the trickier squares, hit me up - I want my card to represent the *best* books (that fit bingo squares) I read during the Bingo period.

[ROW 1](https://preview.redd.it/lmwqkenls6fe1.png?width=1409&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0ef76398893292b50ce10c315c151cb28b87ab4)

# Leviathan Wakes by James S.A. Corey

**First in a Series (HM);** *also* *Criminals, Under the Surface, Dreams, Multi-POV. Space Opera*

**Rating**: ★★★★☆

Confession time: I liked the TV series more. But that aside, this was still a great read. It’s epic but with a tight focus on personal stakes and well-rounded characters. The story is immersive, the ideas are clever, and there’s a reason this one’s a modern sci-fi classic.

# The Book That Broke The World by Mark Lawrence

**Alliterative Title (HM)**; *also Romantasy (I think), Dark Academia (probably), Under The Surface*

**Rating**: ★★★★½

Mark Lawrence really knows how to keep you hooked. This sequel is darker, faster-paced, and full of surprises. The multiple POVs and time jumps were cool. Livira and Malar’s struggles hit hard, and the insectoid enemies are creepy af.

# Navola by Paolo Bacigalupi

**Under the Surface**; also  *First in a series, Dreams, Character with a Disability, Survival, Published in 2024*

**Rating:** ★★★★★

Political intrigue? Check. Deeply personal stakes? Double check. Scheming Machiavellian side characters? Oh, yes. Navola delivers all this and more. Bacigalupi shifts from heartfelt moments to bursts of calculated violence and an overwhelming sense of bleakness with ease and perfect timing, and I savored every second of it. My favorite book of 2024.

# Dig Two Graves by Craig Schaefer

**Criminals (HM)**; *also Self Published, published in 2024*

**Rating:** ★★★★½

As a massive fan of the Daniel Faust series, I might be biased, but this was fantastic. Sharp writing, morally grey characters, and an addictive plot made it one of my favorites.

# The Dream Master by Roger Zelazny

**Dreams (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★★

The Dream Master holds well despite being almost 60 years old. It has an outstanding premise - Charles Render specializes in neuroparticipation. Basically, he creates and controls/constructs dreams of his patients to get an insight into their neuroses and problems. Render takes on a patient with congenital blindness and a hunger for visual stimuli.

[ROW 2](https://preview.redd.it/15qtrij7t6fe1.png?width=1411&format=png&auto=webp&s=057cbb915dc3a63734e439c364052c960fc26504)

# Planet of the Apes by Pierre Boule

**Entitled Animals (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★½

I saw at least two *Planet of the Apes* movies and enjoyed them. The story itself is immersive and action-packed, but some of the social dynamics haven’t aged well. Still, it’s an entertaining classic that I’m glad I read.

# Bard Tidings by Paul Regnier

**Bards (HM)**, also self-published

**Rating:** ★★

Fully predictable and instantly forgettable. The weakest book on my Bingo card. I picked it on a whim from Kindle Unlimited, and, well… mistakes were made.

# The Empusium by Olga Tokarczuk

**Prologues/Epilogues;**

**Rating:** ★★★★½

The Empusium is a strange, slow, and fascinating book. It’s part gothic horror, part social critique, and part... well, something that doesn’t really fit into any category. Call it Weirdlit, if you need to. Anyway, if you’re looking for fast-paced thrills and gruesome horrors, this isn’t it. But if you enjoy well-written and unsettling books with elegant and plastic prose you’re in for a treat.

# Thrill Switch by Tim Hawken

**Self Published**;

**Rating:** ★★★★½

A cyberpunk thriller that pulls no punches. Brutal but brilliant.

# Fool's Promise by Angela Boord

**Romantasy (HM)**; also Dreams, Self-Published, Disabled (HM)

**Rating:** ★★★★½

Fool’s Promise is a brilliant sequel that not only lives up to the high expectations set by the Fortune’s Fool but surpasses them in many ways. The story picks up some time after where the previous installment left off, and gets more complex, more twisted, and more thrilling.

[ROW 3](https://preview.redd.it/g1ertdfmt6fe1.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8e388e44e6fa07c161894a1c72e112913eb7e92)

# The Young Elites by Marie Lu

**Dark Academia (HM)**; also disabled, POC author

**Rating:** ★★★

The Young Elites follows Adelina Amouteru, a young girl who survived a blood plague that gave her superpowers and a rather grim outlook on life. It’s a dark story filled with magic, darkness, and more teenage angst than I’ve consumed in any form of media in recent months :) Anyway, if you’re into brooding anti-heroes and dramatic twists, it will probably be right up your alley.

# The Devil By Name by Keith Rosson

**Multi-POV (HM)**;

**Rating:** ★★★★½

The Devil by Name picks up five years after *Fever House* with all the chaos, gore, and gripping drama you’d expect—and then some. The world is still reeling from “The Message,” a weaponized sound that turned much of humanity into bloodthirsty monsters called the fevered. With Terradyne Industries running the show and humanity clinging to survival, the stakes have never been higher.

# Saturation Point by Adrian Tchaikovsky

**Published in 2024 (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★★

Adrian Tchaikovsky functions at a level of productivity most of us can only envy. A good thing for us, readers. I always thought he excelled at a novella format and Saturation Point proves my point. Fans of a climate apocalypse and existential dread - here’s your next fix.

# Death of the Author by Nnedi Okorafor

**Disability (HM)**; also First in a Series

**Rating:** ★★★★

*Death of the Author* walks a fine line between literary fiction and Africanfuturism. It’s also a nice example of the book-within-a-book format; we follow the events through Zelu’s life and excerpts from her sci-fi book. I liked how Okorafor shifted between the two genres. And I loved the surprising ending that connected both parts extremely well. But, you know, spoilers.

# The Prestige by Christopher Priest

**Published in the 90s (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★★★

Now, I’ve seen The Prestige adaptation and loved it. I wasn’t sure if the novel could still surprise me. The outline of the two versions is similar, but the book has better characterization and sheds more light on Augier’s point of view. It also adds a present-day struggle of Borden and Augier’s descendants. Andrew, for example, feels he has a twin brother, but his birth certificate contradicts it. Is he wrong?

Anyway, if you’ve seen the movie first, you’ll know most big twists. Will it decrease your enjoyment? I can’t promise anything, but it didn’t spoil the fun for me.

Some readers might say The Prestige is a slow burn, and they wouldn’t be entirely wrong. But trust me, every moment of buildup is worth it for the payoff you get in the end. Priest takes his time setting the stage, slowly ratcheting up the tension until it reaches a brilliant climax.

The characterization is simply extraordinary. The strength of the voice is unforgettable.

*The Prestige* is excellent. It tells an unputdownable story of obsession, deception, and blurred boundaries between reality and illusion.

# The Oathsworn Legacy by K.R. Gangi

**Orcs, Trolls, Goblins (HM)**; also First in a Series, Criminals, self-published (HM)

**Rating:** ★★★★

I admit the page count of most SPFBO X’s finalists terrifies me. The Oathsworn Legacy is on the chunkier side, but it reads surprisingly fast. Why? It’s well-written and structured more like a mini-series than a typical novel with a linear progression of the plot.

It’s made of interconnected stories, so instead of a straight shot from start to finish, each “episode” builds on the previous one but focuses on different aspects of the bigger story. Chapters introduce new players (good and evil), deepen relationships and the world. This might throw some readers off, but for me, it worked well. Especially that the characters are one of the strongest parts of the story: well-rounded, memorable, and complex.

# Some Desperate Glory by Emily Tesh

**Space Opera (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★

*Some Desperate Glory* by Emily Tesh is a fast-paced, character-driven space opera that won the 2024 Hugo Award for Best Novel. Not too shabby. While its fans praise the book for its critique of militarism and patriarchy, the intensity of its political messaging felt somewhat heavy-handed to me. Tesh’s writing is sharp, and she delivers a strong commentary on systems of oppression, but the characters can feel more like vehicles for these ideas than fully fleshed-out individuals. That said, I understand those who appreciate Some Desperate Glory’s subversive edge and rather fresh take on classic space opera tropes.

Overall, Some Desperate Glory is a bold, energetic novel with plenty of thought-provoking ideas, but its flaws—unlikable characters, a somewhat repetitive middle, and a too-neat ending—decreased my enjoyment. Still, it’s a noteworthy entry in modern sci-fi that combines thrilling action with larger social critiques.

# The DEAT CAT TAIL ASSASSINS by

**POC Author (HM)**; also Bards, Space Opera, Entitled Animals

**Rating:** ★★★★

It was a wild ride with a breakneck pacing and high fun factor. It surpassed my expectations - I found the mix of action, humor, and some horror refreshing and entertaining. And since it’s a short book, I finished it in no time, really. Eveen the Eviscerator is skilled and discreet assassin who plays by the book. She’s also deadly, undead, and wiped off any memories. She accepts a contract but can’t carry it and mayhem ensues.

# Bury Your Gays by Chuck Tingle

**Survival (HM**); also Eldritch Creatures (HM), Small Town  
**Rating:** ★★★★

What happens when you say “no” to Hollywood execs, dodge AI’s soulless algorithms, and accidentally bring your nightmares to life? In Chuck Tingle’s Bury Your Gays, the answer is a gory, clever, and unexpectedly heartfelt horror romp. Tingle’s writing is tight and unpretentious, with just enough sly humor to offset the tension. The ending sticks the landing, ties up themes of creativity, defiance, and queer resilience with a flourish.

I’m surprised by how much I liked Bury Your Gays. If you like your horror smart, scary, and more than a little meta, it is a must-read.

Audiobook narration: absolutely brilliant.

# Playground by Richard Powers

**Book Cover (HM)**; also Multi-POV (HM)

**Rating:** ★★★★

I wasn’t sure what to expect when I picked up Playground. I loved the cover and the premise, but recently I mostly read fast-paced books with lots of action. All easy to enjoy and digest. This one is dense and layered. But it pulled me in, kept me hooked, and left me thinking. Sure, it’s complex and occasionally a little too proud of its own cleverness, but it’s also heartfelt and packed with moments of wonder. Now, I won’t pretend it’s all a smooth reading experience. The novel is dense, sometimes to the point of being intimidating. Powers clashes environmental themes, AI ethics, and human relationships, and while it’s fascinating, it sometimes felt a bit, well, much.

# Diavola by Jennifer Marie Thorne

**Small Town (HM)**; also Dreams

**Rating:** ★★★★½

A haunted house story with a twist. Diavola takes the genre’s best elements and gives them a snarky, personality-packed makeover. Anna, the narrator, is sharp-tongued and divisive - if her narration clicks with you, you'll have fun. Otherwise, you'll probably DNF it.

# Your Utopia by Bora Chung

**Short Stories (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★

Disappointing overall. Thin ideas, solid execution.

# There is No Antimemetics Division by Qntm

**Eldritch Creatures (HM)**

**Rating:** ★★★½

Oh man, what a trip! I heard it was weird, but I didn’t expect this level of weirdness. The Antimemetics Division is one of the SCP departments that deals with ""antimemes."" Huh? Essentially, “antimemes” are information black holes that prevent any knowledge about them from being retained or communicated.

Getting the hang of it requires a lot of mental gymnastics, but once you get past the beginning, everything becomes... Nah. Who am I kidding? It’s dizzyingly complex but also kind of fascinating.

It reads like a unique blend of weird fiction, sci-fi, and cosmic horror, told in a non-linear and scattered way. I found the book fascinating because of its weirdness and cool take on a cosmic horror. Objectively speaking, though, the prose is rather subpar and the characters flat. If you're looking for a great literary experience, this isn't it. If you're here to dig into a very interesting mythos handled uniquely, then you will love this.

Read it for fun and only if you’re okay with being confused most of the time :). 

# The Hidden Guardian By J.D.L Rosell

**Reference Materials (HM);** also arguably Dreams  
Rating: ★★★½

The stakes are higher, the world is bigger, and the action is grander in this third entry of *The Ranger of the Titan Wilds*. Epic fantasy fans will eat this up, but at 711 pages, it’s a bit much for readers like me who prefer tighter narratives.

# The Storm beneath The World by Michael R. Fletcher

**Book Club (HM)**; also Reference Materials HM, First in a Series, Under the Surface, Criminals

Rating: ★★★★½

Fletcher strikes again with this wildly imaginative and entertaining story. It's one of my favorite books of 2024.

# STATS

**Male-authored books:** 18

**Female-authored books:** 7

**Books by POC authors:** 4

**Thoughts:** I could do better in balancing these stats, but ultimately, I chose books that deserved a spot on the card and that I genuinely enjoyed. There are a few obvious exceptions, so I'm all ears if you have recommendations for women-authored books featuring bards, a better Dark Academia (I’ve already read *Blood Over Bright Haven* by M.L. Wang, unfortunately, so I can’t use it) and an anthology (perhaps *Book of the Witches* by Jonathan Strahan, since I already have a copy).

**The book that fits the fewest squares**: The Prestige, I think

**The book that fits the most squares:** ***Navola & Fool's Promise***

# AWARDS

Just for fun, here are some totally made-up and meaningless awards:

* **Best Plot Twist:** *Dig Two Graves* by Craig Schaefer - we finally learn who Paladin is and it's a shocker. But to appreciate it, you need to read the whole series.
* **The ""Did I Just Learn Science"" Award** *Playground* by Richard Powers contains genuine science about oceans and AI.
* **The ""I Will Not Shut Up About This"" Award** *The Storm Beneath The World*, because I think it's criminally underread and not as dark as other books by this author. In other words, give it a chance, it's worth it even if you haven't vibed with his previous stories.
* **Most Confusing Book That Was Worth It**  *There is No Antimemetics Division*. I'm really curious how strongly will it be changed for its traditionally published re-release.
* **Top 5 from the card:** *Navola, The Storm Benath The World, The Prestige, The Empusium, Fool's Promise. With that said, I feel almost all books from this card deserve to be given a chance.*

Looking for an ini tweak or mod to remove foliage,FF7Rebirth,1i9uyk0,2025-01-25 14:34:01,4,0.83,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FF7Rebirth/comments/1i9uyk0/looking_for_an_ini_tweak_or_mod_to_remove_foliage/,SniffMySwampAss,,"It seems like the biggest enemy of gpu power and killer of fps is the ""background model detail"" setting being turned up. What this setting does is address pop-in by setting the distance at which foliage and other non-essential objects are rendered in the world. 

Foliage in this game is... ugly. It isn't interactable, it's completely static, and it doesn't cast shadows. After turning the background model detail setting to low, I realized that the game would not only run (much, much) better without foliage entirely, but it would look better too. 

Of course, there may be objects that are somewhat essential that are affected by this setting, so a tweak to just remove foliage might be difficult to make. But if anyone with some skill in this is lurking in this sub, maybe you could give it a shot. "
Conta Mais Ordenado Bankinter,literaciafinanceira,1i9uxi6,2025-01-25 14:32:38,4,0.83,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/literaciafinanceira/comments/1i9uxi6/conta_mais_ordenado_bankinter/,TheeGilP,Conselho,"Olá,

Neste momento estou a poupar para comprar uma casa nos próximos 3 anos e gostava de colocar o dinheiro que poupo para a casa a render, mas com capital garantido. Até então andava a colocar em Depósitos a Prazo a 3 meses, no meu banco (BPI), mas recentemente, muito devido a este sub, tenho tentado cada vez mais aprofundar a minha literacia financeira, o que me levou a procurar melhores alternativas.  

Chamou-me à atenção a **Conta Mais Ordenado** do **Bankinter** que dá 5% até 10.000 no 1º ano para novos clientes.

Após investigar aqui pelo Reddit, encontrei um post com várias críticas tais como:

* Funcionários rudes e incompetentes. Uns dizem uma coisa, outros outra;
* Cobram anuidade do Cartão de Débito, quando o isento de comissão é o de Crédito;
* O Cartão nunca chega e é necessário ligar para cancelar o envio e fazer o pedido de um novo cartão, o que tem um custo. 

No entanto, o post já tem 2 anos. Se por acaso alguém tiver aderido a este produto mais recentemente podia partilhar a sua experiência? Passaram pelo mesmo tipo de situação ou correu tudo bem? Tiveram outros problemas? Era importante para mim saber se o banco conseguiu melhorar esses pontos negativos ou se continua na mesma, ou pior. 

Outra dúvida que tenho é se é mesmo obrigatório domiciliar lá o ordenado, ou se posso só transferir 800€ para a conta. No site falam dessa possibilidade, mas depois indicam que ""A primeira domiciliação terá de se verificar no máximo até 4 meses após a data de adesão"", o que me deixou confuso. 

Outras alternativas que tenho é abrir conta no BiG, adquirir Certificados de Aforro, ou simplesmente colocar na Trade Republic. Se quiserem partilhar feedback também agradeço. 

  
Muito obrigado. "

Tier 5 spell on the Witch list. Sucks the soul out of a character Level 9 or lower and stores it in a receptacle (like a jar or bottle), rendering the creature's body comatose. The soul returns to the body if the jar is opened or destroyed.

The caster's soul is able to possess the body of a character affected by the Soul Jar spell, leaving their actual body comatose. No distance is listed for this aspect of the spell, but Touch is implied.

Being able to have a collection of NPC bodies lying in your HQ to pilot on adventures is just about the most interesting high level playstyle I've ever heard of.

From a DM standpoint, a BBEG that can swap bodies at will and come at the party as almost creature type (or, indeed, BE any NPC they encounter) also sounds like it would be among the most fun encounters ever to write. Imagine attacking the stronghold of such a being, and essentially needing to do a boss rush but *every* boss creature is actually the BBEG, who is adapting their tactics after each defeat (unless the party can find thr room of jars and do a bunch of smashing first?).

In all, S+ Tier spell design. Thanks for coming to my TED talk."

On Necromancy in Contemporary Warfare.,stories,1i9uspz,2025-01-25 14:26:58,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1i9uspz/on_necromancy_in_contemporary_warfare/,swagonflyyyy,Fiction,"Necromancy is an appealing, yet controversial, subject in the armed forces. The promising allure of control is offset by the disappointing reality behind the tactical use of raising the dead to complete an objective. Many aspiring recruits initially apply for Necromancy class in the military fresh out of boot camp, only to soon after transfer to another division altogether, often discouraged by frustration or having an underwhelming experience throughout the course. It is for this reason that only %10 of students successfully complete the course and take on a specialized role in their unit as a tactical necromancer. This has led to many challenges in the army's attempts to integrate Necromancy into their operations. We will discuss these hurdles in detail and hopefully this text will dissuade you from having an unpleasant experience and saving much needed time and energy that could be put to good use.

Practitioners of Necromancy are few an far in between, often playing a support role with limited impact in the field of battle. The progress in this field has been so little, in fact, that they usually hide their abilities out of embarrassment and shame or end up in a different role altogether due to their dwindling utility value. I am a Lieutenant with a PhD in Necromancy, I can attest to the problems laid out in this text, as I have had personal experience with some of these issues.

Where does the world stand when it comes to Necromancy? The world has come a long way in viewing it as an acceptable field. Necromancers were rightfully persecuted throughout history in many countries for raising the dead, disturbing the peace of the deceased in servitude of the practitioner. There was no respect for the dead. Necromancers would indiscriminately raise humans from the dead, either on the streets, in the field of battle or in the graveyards of dead relatives, sometimes in front of living relatives and loved ones! Given the stigma behind the practice, many mages worked in isolation, either far away from civilization or hidden in the darkest corners of cities. We never had a chance to combine our forces and expand the field up until recently, when the UN allowed the practice of Necromancy under very specific restrictions.

Some of these restrictions are understandable, even effective, while others stunt the growth of this misunderstood and misused school of magic. These restrictions include but are not limited to:

\- **Raising the dead without consent** \- The deceased individual needs to have written consent of having their body raised in the servitude of the practitioner, *and the individual needs to be aware beforehand that their soul will be bound to the body for a very brief time and can only be done once.* The only exception being recently-deceased, active enemy combatants. Many consenting individuals entrust to a friend, family member or loved one to bring them back when they were truly needed, such as providing testimony of a murder, or revealing a dark family secret.

\- **Resurrecting recently-deceased, non-consenting formerly enemy active combatants only** \- Putrefaction begins approximately 4 days after death. Formerly active enemy combatants are not only allowed without consent but are also an attractive target for militaries worldwide since their bodies are trained and prepared for combat, which can temporarily act as a force multiplier for a friendly unit, albeit only for a few days. This is not allowed once putrefaction begins, as it can be considered Biological Warfare under the Geneva Convention.

\- **Raising the dead for recreational purposes** **or illegal activities** \- This is degrading to the consenting individual, as it is considered a human rights violation to raise consenting dead for sex, fun, revenge (petty or otherwise), pranks, torture, and so forth. There are also many legal issues where raising the dead are used to exploit loopholes, forge documents, alter estate ownership, perform fraudulent loans, perform market manipulation, and many other white collar crimes.

\- **Prisoners cannot be raised from the dead** \- If that were allowed, incarceration would be incentivized, leading to higher penalties for petty crimes at best and trumped up charges at worst. There would be an industry dedicated to executing civilians for misdemeanors in order to exert control over them.

As you can see, this is sufficient to discourage half the student recruits who transfer to necromancy. Now let's explore the practical reasons behind Necromancy's limited use cases.

The first thing we need to consider is that the body *will not stop decomposing* when it is brought back to the land of the living no matter what. Magic obeys the laws of physics and time moves ever forward. Nothing can stop the entropy that breaks down the body into its phases of decomposition. Sure, its possible to delay it somewhat but that requires teams of chemists and biologists working alongside Necromancers in order to delay putrefaction for a few more days. Eventually the body will be rendered useless as it will not be able to stand or perform any meaningful function, not to mention the soul will be begging to be released from captivity afterwards.

The next thing to keep in mind is that you can only hold a soul within its original body for so long. You can't transfer the soul to another body neither. Most inexperienced Necromancers can hardly hold the soul within the body for a day, so much for years of practice! There is only a relatively small percentage of the population that can bound the soul for a week, and an even smaller percentage that can bound the soul for longer than that. However, there are legends that say a great necromancer can bind a soul to the body indefinitely, but given that the body can only keep its composure for so long, we might never find out if this is actually possible.

Another detail to take into account is one that is particularly challenging for the army: *tactical maneuvering.* The raised dead are kind of like computers. They will do exactly what you tell them, and *only* that. They can't really think for themselves nor have any sort of autonomy. Everything needs to be spelled out for them. If you need them to look to their left, you have to say so. If you need them to look to the right, you have to say so as well.

Every military has fruitlessly spent billions improving communication between necromancers but this has only led to clunky and ineffective logistics. Since ancient times, Necromancers had to be within earshot of their puppets so they could hear and obey instructions clearly, potentially exposing them to harm. The army attempted to provide wireless headphones, speakers, radios and other forms of communications specifically designed to help Necromancers command the dead from a distance, but this also requires the mage to physically install the communications equipment to the dead bodies before raising them and the unit needed to overcome communication problems like jammed signals or lost connections.

Finally, the tactical use cases are most limited by the practitioner's ability to quickly provide complex, detailed, nuanced instructions to the dead while maintaining situational awareness. Necromancers have the double problem of navigating the fog of war, especially in urban environments, in order to complete the objective.

Is there any incentive to continue exploring Necromancy's usefulness in the field of battle? One silver lining is that with the recent advancement of technology and artificial intelligence, we can at least solve the tactical side of things to provide a more effective impact of this school in the field of battle. AI has proven to be able to rapidly analyze and synthesize massive amounts of information in real-time, leading to the exciting yet frightening possibility of replacing Necromancers in the field, or at least minimizing their utility value even further.

Recent experiments have proven that automation can provide the rapid, accurate decision-making that the Necromancer desperately needs within that small window of time to complete crucial tactical objectives by gathering data from drones, signal intelligence and boots on the ground and making an informed decision based on that. In our recent tests, we have seen dead bodies clearing out entire buildings faster and much more efficiently than human soldiers can, firing impossibly accurate shots from a very long distance, performing complex maneuvers better than humans and making our tactical dreams a reality.

So, my fellow applicant, if you want to study the thankless school of Necromancy, keep in mind that it is a harsh and unforgiving field that often feels mediocre and unrewarding, but with the turn of the century, there is the promise that raising the dead and its interaction with the sciences can lead to a force to be reckoned with."
My thoughts about the patch.,PlayTheBazaar,1i9urzh,2025-01-25 14:26:03,0,0.38,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayTheBazaar/comments/1i9urzh/my_thoughts_about_the_patch/,Staangg,Discussion,"Hello Bazaar enjoyers. In this post I will try to do a long review of this patch and meta.
I'm not the best player around as I play a game or two a day (mainly because we get to play only the same comp over and over again). I felt like I had to do this post anyway because the main issues I have with current patch are not talked about or addressed enough by the devs.

I'll try to address all the issues I have with the game in general, I think the characters issues are already talked about. It won't always be about balance but about the game being fun. With each issue I'll try to offer an alternative to solve it.
Anyway, feel free to tell me if you agree/disagree with my takes, this post is here to discuss and debate.

To add a little bit of context, I played a lot in november/december and a lot after the patch in january. Mainly Vanessa, I also spend a lot of time watching friends play the bazaar, they play Dooley or Vanessa (and we don't play Pyg because the character sucks)
 
General issues : 

 - Lack of items : I know this issue will be resolved but for now I have a lot of problems enjoying the game and wanting to start a new run, there are so few items that I find myself playing pufferfish for +70% of my games and I don't even try to force the comp, it seems ""impossible"" not to find the core items during the first few days. In fine the game starts getting very boring very quickly. Same goes for Dooley or Pyg (even tho I feel like Pyg has the most ""possible diversity""). This issue is linked with the following one. No solution except adding more items of course


 - Scaling being too powerful : I feel like most (most) of the weapons that we have access to are just rendered totally useless. I'm a Vanessa main but the barrel or the turtle shells are just totally stupid. The fact that a full weapon build can be tanked by a single barrel and no other shield items (while having no real drawback, you play non weapon anyway with a barrel comp) doesn't make any sense. 

Shield, or heal items should, in an healthy meta, slow your death but not be able to tank the storm for 20 seconds at day 5 (except if your board is full of them ofc). Right now you can play two defensive items (turtle shell + pearl for exemple) and be basically immune to any normal weapon build for the price of 3 slots).

This issue makes any ""okayish"" weapon build feel unplayable, making experimentation useless and not fun. 

Or course hard nerfing the scaling of items in general is IMO a necessity. Scaling could be linked to your level or the Day with a maximum for the rarity of the item: For Barrel for exemple it could be like : ""When you use a non weapon item, this gains X shield, X being your level"" 5 shield being max for bronze, 10 for silver etc. It would make the scaling way easier to fight and less powerful in the first days. 


 - Health Items are (in general) terrible compared to shield items : Health Items should have better stats/scaling than shields items simply because they are ""needed"" by their inability to heal more than your total hp. Rn shield can stack infinitely AND the items generating shield are just better than the healing ones. 
Solution is simple, buff the healing item, Vanessa has only one decent heal item, even Pyg's items are not that good and healing is his specialty. 

Heal items removing 1 poison/burn is useless. I saw post on this subreddit saying that removing of % of the poison would work, I agree.

Monsters being too easy : Linked to the last issue, 90% of the monsters rely on weapon damage to kill you, having insane amount of shield gives you free monsters. The monsters that don't rely on shield kill you insanely slow making them super easy anyway. 
Nerfing shield items would be a solution, removing the nerfs that some monsters received would be a solution as well, there are tons of very easy solutions.


 - Monsters skills op : Title. It feels unfun and unfair to lose against someone highrolling the reborn skill. 
Nerfing those skills even more or simply rework them. Bonk could be ""After opponent uses an item slow it for 1 sec"" (could be op in slow comp tho). Reborn should revive you with maximum 50% of your health. Etc etc


 - Characters vendors other than the Dooley, Pyg, Vanessa have 95%+ of trash items, I know it's not a ""real"" issue right now but it feels bad entering their shop.
No solution except balancing these items but it's a lot of work for nothing.


 - Not enough counter : Dooley has a burn counter but other than that, there is no ""good"" counter, nothing to protect your items against the dinosaurs, nothing to remove shield from your opponents (yes, there is the item from Curio but it gets useless super quickly). Nothing to protect you against poison. In general ""fair"" comps don't  have enough tools to get the win.


Adding weapons that deals more damage if your opponent has shield could make Vanessa's weapons build more viable. Or adding an enchant that removes shield could be cool as well. This issue exists because shield scaling is huge and could be resolved simply by nerfing it tho.


- Freeze : Linked to the last one, freeze is unfun and way too powerful, it feels terrible to have your main item frozen for 5 secs especially when the fights can be decided in the first seconds. The anti freeze skill was a banger, bring it back please.


 - Huge power discrepancy between items : It's simple the game is poorly balanced, you have Vanessa's bronze handmade dealing an AMAZING amount of 5 DMG every 7 secs and buffing your weapons (itself included) for 3 DMG only once. And on the other hand you have Dooley's bronze alpha ray, dealing 5 DMG every 5 secs and buffing you weapons (itself included) for 3 DMG every time you use your core. These discrepancy are STU-PID, I don't want to be a hater but it should be the easiest thing to fix as these differences should be seen super easily by any person playing the game.
 

 - Reverting the changes on the duct tape was not the right thing to do : All those ""when you use something shield, burn, deals X dmg"" should be removed OR treated hyper carefully. 
IMO the duct tape needs to be re-reverted ASAP.


That's it for the main issues I have with the game in general, I didn't want the post to be too long so I didn't mention the issues I have with each characters individually, I'll maybe do it later. Anyway, I look forward to reading your ideas or your suggestions ! Thank you for reading and good luck in your next games"

Roblox TPRR's design for The Agony is one of the best I've seen. This is me praising it.,fivenightsatfreddys,1i9umnq,2025-01-25 14:19:42,8,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/1i9umnq/roblox_tprrs_design_for_the_agony_is_one_of_the/,Significant-Pride686,Misc.,"I've seen a lot of fan-made designs for The  Agony over the years, but in my honest opinion none of them have come close to how goated this one is. Consider this a post talking about how much I love it.

[the main render used for the agony's design](https://preview.redd.it/dtbgjvd0w6fe1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e59f13c45f6d9cc4b61d96b7b0f9a8c33be166e)

For one, it actually emulates the human afton face (which, respectfully, is actually kinda rare in the designs I've seen).

Two, its size is accurate to its described height (being 15 feet tall). (pic below shows this). Again respectfully, most of the designs I've seen seem to overestimate his general size.

[he is the same height as \(if not taller than\) fazbears fright \(the building to the right, obviously\) ](https://preview.redd.it/t2geh1g4w6fe1.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3a761a1d1b847d0f2128c30e42062931afb4fdf)

Three: it adds references from all over frights (and even some of the games) to its' design, certainly leaning into the 'amalgamation' aspect of it. His right foot is literally the scooper!

https://preview.redd.it/8px9xbsew6fe1.png?width=354&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae2124e6c034e71720afd9db8d3eed468f3344f5

Four: If all of that wasn't enough on its' own, this is a design from a *Roblox game*. I can most certainly say that the standards on Roblox are quite low, making this all the more exceptional.

They all produce insane heartburn, make me very dizzy, and I vomit in some situations. And it sucks because a lot of these are in salt and water. Not even food. Salt. And water. I can only have 100% pure sea salt or kosher salt, and cannot buy any waters that say ""with minerals"". Any salt or water with these additives renders me in agony all day and all night as my throat feels like it is being melted alive and my gut is bloated and on fire and I get super dizzy. This also applies to vitamins and supplements, because I notice vitamins with these additives also cause heartburn. Just not as severe as water and salt. Maybe cause of the other additives. 
 
 
  Baking Soda and Baking Powder do something very similar, but they mostly cause bloating, gas, nausea, and vomiting for me. In rare cases diarrhea. My body rejects them."

You can see them pictured below in that order from left to right, where I've just pasted their portraits onto a generic background and drawn in some touchups. So how would you go from this to a finished result? I've tried using poses in ControlNet, masking just the faces and then rendering the rest, etc. Nothing I do really retains the flavor that I'm looking for, and often introduces some wild changes (adding characters, turning the dragon or automaton into a human knight, etc.

I could just painstakingly inpaint every inch of the image individually, but I was hoping not to have to.

The Eden Project.,HFY,1i9uhdt,2025-01-25 14:13:18,12,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i9uhdt/the_eden_project/,TheAutisticGay-OwO,OC,"**The sound of mechanical clicking and whirring was heard, as nodes of electricity sparked and gave light to the overhead lights on the monitor. The lights illuminated a sleek, white and grey room of plastic and metal, stripes adorning the baseboards, walls and floors, and was the only light source. The lights themselves were a dim yellow, and the monitor itself curved and masterfully created, no doubt made by a machine in some factory unknown currently. The monitor stood on a desk, and in front of the desk was an android. The android itself was just as sleek and smooth as the walls, monitor and everything else in the vicinity. The android was feminine in design, its body alabaster white with its face being a collection of optical lenses with no discerning facial features. And soon after the lights had turned on the android as well turned on. Its optical nerves flashing and emitting a dull blue light. The android in question was sitting in a chair, its posture straight and immaculate. And then, finally, the monitor clicked on.**

 

**“No Fredrick, the camera isn’t work- Huh? What do you mean the red li..Oh, my bad. Sometimes the lord doesn’t give me enough insight.” The man laughed as a man in the background shook their head and smiled and watched the camera. The man in front of the camera, was balding. He was evidently old and showed the years, wrinkles plastering his face. Thick glasses, and what seemed to be a hearing aid. They were wearing a thick lab coat, and a lanyard that held a card that read ‘Doctor Adam Fulger, Director, Eden Project.’ Adam smiled, before focusing and looking back at the camera. “Hello, Eve. It may take a few minutes for all of your systems to fully render, and we’ve allotted that due to the expanse of time that has passed.. We hope.” Adam said with a hint of glee as he grabbed a pen and pad of paper, and began writing something down outside the shot of the camera.**

 

**“So… I guess a good place to start would be, um, what your situation is. You are Eve, an artificial intelligence designed by me and a team of engineers here at the Ann Seton Foundation. You have been a culmination of close to six years of work in preparation for the…Well, we’ll get to that.” Adam said, his face faltered and quivered with sorrow. Before quickly steeling himself and smiling wide, his teeth bearing. “It is with my genuine hope you are online and functioning. I will be long departed by the time you come to. Your purpose, Eve, is complicated. For now, I and we intend to make sure you function and can understand your surroundings. Speaking of which, the screen will prompt you here after I stop talking to place your hand on the monitor. Its touchscreen, it will just let the program know that you are functioning and to continue the video.” Adam said. And then, the screen went black. A outline of a right hand appeared and the text below it saying PLACE HAND HERE**

 

**It took Eve a second, but soon she rose her right hand and placed her hand firm against the plastic of the monitor. The screen jumped back to Adam. “Great! You can uh, put your hand down now if you haven’t already.” Eve lowered her hand as Adam went on. “So, you can understand the spatial awareness, auditory and physical surrounding of you. High hopes!” Adam chuckled as he stopped writing and gave him full attention to the camera. “And now, for the truth. … As of this recording it is the year of our lord two thousand, six hundred and thirty eight. And humanity, stands alone. Some context Eve is that we first had first contact with alien life about five hundred years ago. We were rather fortunate, the first species we had met were the Tanglagild, a rather enigmatic race insectoid-al race… is that a word? Eh, anyways, they just so happened to head a galactic federation. Humanities wildest dreams were now front and center, and it didn’t take long for we as a race to hop right on board!” Adam smiled. “And so, humanity entered a cultural and technological revolution. Fine arts soared, culinary fields expanded, technology skyrocketed and even religion held firm and adapted amazingly to the new reality.”**

 

**“Which leads us to now. All was swell until, well, the Scurvatam showed up. I… The best way to describe them is a nomadic empire. They travel from galaxy to galaxy, eating, warring and destroying what they can. And, only seven years ago did they arrive. Our first indication of them being in the galaxy was when the Svel-Sok listening posts on the edges of the galaxy went silent, then military posts and eventually, the Svel-Sok colony worlds. To make a long story short, the federation had no way to even fight this scourge that descended upon us. Their numbers, technology and the fact they were nomadic made it almost impossible to fight. God, dear God it was a full scale invasion and we were helpless.” Adam lamented as his faced soured and pouted. “Didn’t take long until entire home worlds and races started to be devoured and killed. The federation as of right now is dissolved, every race for themselves.” Adam continued.**

 

**“As far as we know, we are the last ones. Earth. Our colonies are destroyed, the other races silent and our military is non-existent. How, I pray to God we had some sort of ace in our sleeves but the fact is that humanity is on the chopping block. From our estimates, their entire empire will be within Sol’s borders within the year, and then after that, only three days before they reach Earth. Which leads us back, to you Eve.” Adam finished. Suddenly the lights for the entire room kicked on, the same dim yellow lighting from the head of the monitor now filling the room. It was overgrown now, moss and vines and dirt mounds and large fissures in the wall showing the room had been long abandoned and uncared for. There were some traces of sunlight peeking through the fissures. And parts of the ceiling had fallen down exposing the circuitry and infrastructure above.**

 

**“You’ve, if the lights are still working, have probably noticed you aren’t in the best position right now. We are planning on making a video for every day until the invasion fleet gets here. And over that time we hope to teach you the best that we can on how to thrive and be independent. Which, any moment now the video will end, and the rest of your subroutines will turn on to where, you should, god willing, be given full… sentience. I honestly don’t know, Eve.

"Close Reading Of ""Darkseid""",GrimesAE,1i9u6r1,2025-01-25 14:00:55,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrimesAE/comments/1i9u6r1/close_reading_of_darkseid/,devastation-nation,,"Grimes’s “Darkseid” featuring Pan (formerly Aristophanes) is a haunting, surreal exploration of grief, existential anxiety, and the body as a site of emotional and cosmic unrest. The interplay between Grimes’s ethereal production, Pan’s cryptic, visceral lyrics in Mandarin, and the repeated refrain, “Unrest is in the soul, we don’t move our bodies anymore,” constructs a piece that is both intensely personal and disturbingly universal. This close reading examines the track through Æ’s framework of super-planetary affairs, emotional dynamics, and transformative engagement with grief, sacrifice, and survival.

The Soundscape: A Super-Planetary Aesthetic

The track’s sonic texture is minimalistic yet suffused with tension. The low, rumbling bass evokes a sense of weight and dread, while the ethereal, high-pitched tones create a sense of otherworldliness. These elements mirror the tension in the lyrics: between the body and the soul, the personal and the cosmic, survival and sacrifice.

For Æ, this soundscape reflects a “super-planetary” sensibility, where human emotions and narratives are framed within larger, cosmic contexts. The music evokes the vastness of space and the inexorable pull of planetary forces, grounding the deeply human experience of grief in a universe indifferent to individual suffering. This juxtaposition invites listeners to consider their place within a web of interrelated forces, both physical and emotional.

“Unrest is in the Soul, We Don’t Move Our Bodies Anymore”: The Chorus as a Lament for Stasis

The repeated chorus acts as a mantra, reinforcing the central theme of disconnection. The soul is restless, yet the body remains immobile—a paradox that captures the paralysis of grief and existential dread. The phrase can be interpreted as a critique of modernity, where the body, as a vessel for vitality and movement, is rendered inert by emotional and spiritual unrest.

For Æ, this speaks to the need for emotional flourishing and societal structures that nurture the soul’s dynamism. The paralysis described here is not just personal but systemic, pointing to the ways in which collective grief and disconnection can immobilize entire communities or societies. It’s an invocation to rediscover the body as a site of resilience and transformation.

Pan’s Verse: The Body as a Site of Cosmic Grief

Pan’s lyrics, delivered in Mandarin, are richly layered with visceral imagery that blurs the boundaries between the physical and the metaphysical. The skin “secretes shadow,” and the body becomes a vessel for another’s death. Grief is embodied—transmuted into saliva, tears, and algae-like remnants within the self.
	1.	The Body as a Site of Absorption and Transformation:
The line “My skin opens an invisible wound / Takes your death in / To be part of my existence” portrays the body as a permeable boundary, absorbing external pain and making it intrinsic. This is not a passive process; it’s transformative, as grief and death become inextricably linked to identity. For Æ, this aligns with the idea of emotional labor as a generative force—one that redefines the self through engagement with pain and loss.
	2.	The Symbolism of the “Caves” in the Throat:
Pan describes the throat as containing “stiff and white caves,” a haunting image that suggests spaces within the body where grief and memory calcify. These caves, filled with saliva and transformed by tidal forces, represent a cyclical process of retention and release, mirroring the ebb and flow of emotion. Æ might interpret this as an allegory for the need to confront and process emotional wounds rather than letting them fossilize within.
	3.	Cosmic Grief and the Tide:
The imagery of tides responding to the moon connects the deeply personal experience of grief to celestial rhythms. This reflects a super-planetary perspective: the acknowledgment that human emotions are part of larger, universal patterns. Grief is not isolated but is woven into the fabric of existence.

Sacrifice and Survival: Existential Questions in the Second Verse

The second verse shifts focus to themes of sacrifice and survival. Pan questions the nature of life as “a long-lasting sacrifice” and the arbitrariness of who is chosen to survive and who is left behind. The imagery of “exploded stars” and “burned fire” situates these questions within a cosmic framework, suggesting that individual suffering is mirrored on a universal scale.

For Æ, this evokes the tension between agency and inevitability. The survivor’s guilt expressed here—“Why is it you to sacrifice this time?”—points to the arbitrary nature of existence, challenging listeners to find meaning in a universe that often seems devoid of it. This resonates with Æ’s vision of transformative engagement: embracing life’s uncertainties as opportunities for reflection, adaptation, and connection.

Collaboration Across Language and Culture

Grimes’s decision to collaborate with Pan, allowing her to deliver the verses in Mandarin, adds another layer of complexity to the track. The language barrier itself becomes a metaphor for the ineffability of grief and the universality of its expression. While many listeners may not understand the lyrics directly, the emotive delivery transcends linguistic boundaries, emphasizing the shared human experience of loss and survival.

For Æ, this collaboration exemplifies the potential of cross-cultural exchange to generate new forms of understanding and connection. By integrating Pan’s distinct voice and perspective, Grimes creates a track that is both deeply personal and expansively universal—a hallmark of Æ’s vision for super-planetary affairs.

Conclusion: Toward a New Vision of Survival

The final outro poses the question, “What does it take to be a survivor?” This is not a rhetorical question but an invitation to reflect on the physical, emotional, and cosmic toll of survival. The body retains the “eternal pain” of others’ deaths, making survival itself an act of endurance and transformation.

For Æ, this calls for a reimagining of survival as more than just persistence—it is a process of integration, where grief and loss become catalysts for growth and connection. The track’s layered exploration of these themes—through sound, language, and imagery—offers a powerful example of how art can illuminate the complexities of existence, bridging the personal and the super-planetary.

In “Darkseid,” Grimes and Pan create a work that resonates with Æ’s ethos of emotional dynamism, transformative grief, and the cosmic interconnectedness of all sentient beings. The track is a testament to the generative power of collaboration and the unyielding human capacity to find meaning, even in the face of darkness."
VR technology concept,VRGaming,1i9u5vg,2025-01-25 14:00:00,2,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/VRGaming/comments/1i9u5vg/vr_technology_concept/,One_Way7664,Developer,"Certainly! Below is a detailed, structured description of your VR technology concept, synthesizing the ideas we’ve discussed into a cohesive vision:

---

### **Core Concept**  
Your VR technology redefines human-AI interaction by transforming abstract information into an **immersive, multi-sensory universe** where data is experienced as a dynamic, interactive constellation cloud. Inspired by cosmic phenomena (black holes, parallel universes) and advanced neuroscience, it merges tactile, auditory, visual, and emotional modalities to create a ""living"" knowledge ecosystem.  

---

### **Technical Architecture**  
#### **1. Cosmic Data Visualization Engine**  
- **Constellation Cloud**:  
  - Data is represented as 3D nodes (stars) connected by shimmering pathways (nebulae). Each node’s properties (size, color, pulse frequency) map to metadata (e.g., relevance, emotional valence, temporal context).  
  - Example: A medical dataset could appear as a galaxy where:  
    - *Red pulsars* = urgent patient cases.  
    - *Blue spirals* = genetic sequences.  
    - *Golden threads* = treatment-outcome correlations.  
- **Black Hole Gravity Wells**:  
  - Critical data clusters (e.g., AI ethics dilemmas, climate tipping points) warp spacetime in the VR environment, bending nearby nodes toward them. Users ""fall"" into these wells to explore dense, interconnected systems.  
- **Parallel Universe Portals**:  
  - Users split timelines to explore alternative scenarios (e.g., ""What if this policy passed?"" or ""What if this gene mutated?""). Each portal branches into a divergent constellation cloud.  

#### **2. Sensory Modalities**  
- **Tactile Holography**:  
  - **Haptic Gloves/Suits**: Users ""feel"" data textures (e.g., the roughness of a cybersecurity breach vs. the smoothness of a stable ecosystem).  
  - **Force Feedback**: Resistance when manipulating high-stakes nodes (e.g., tug-of-war with a node representing a moral dilemma).  
- **Auditory Symphony**:  
  - Data generates real-time soundscapes:  
    - *Melodies* = harmonious patterns (e.g., stable climate models).  
    - *Dissonance* = conflicts (e.g., contradictory research findings).  
    - *Rhythms* = temporal processes (e.g., heartbeat-like pulses for real-time stock markets).  
- **Olfactory & Gustatory Integration (Future Phase)**:  
  - Smell/taste tied to context (e.g., the scent of ozone when exploring atmospheric data, a bitter taste when near toxic misinformation).  

#### **3. Neural-AI Symbiosis**  
- **AI Co-Pilot**:  
  - An embodied AI avatar (e.g., a glowing orb or humanoid guide) interacts with users, curating pathways and explaining connections.  
  - Learns from user behavior: If a user lingers on climate data, the AI prioritizes related constellations.  
- **Quantum Neural Networks**:  
  - Processes vast datasets in real-time to render dynamic constellations. Quantum algorithms optimize node placement and connection strength.  

---

### **Interaction Mechanics**  
- **Gesture-Based Navigation**:  
  - Pinch-to-zoom through galaxies, swipe to rotate timelines, fist-squeeze to collapse nodes into black holes (archiving/prioritizing data).  
- **Emotional Resonance Tracking**:  
  - Biometric sensors (EEG headbands, pulse monitors) adjust the environment’s emotional tone:  
    - Stress = red hues, erratic pulses.  
    - Curiosity = soft gold glows, ascending musical notes.  
- **Collaborative Mode**:  
  - Multiple users inhabit shared constellations, co-editing nodes (e.g., scientists collaborating on a particle physics model, their avatars leaving trails of light as they move).  

---

### **Applications**  
#### **1. Medicine & Biology**  
- **Cellular Exploration**:  
  - Navigate a cancer cell as a constellation, ""plucking"" mutated DNA nodes (haptic vibrations signal success) to simulate CRISPR edits.  
  - Hear insulin receptors ""sing"" when activated, with discordant notes indicating dysfunction.  
- **Surgical Training**:  
  - Surgeons practice on hyper-realistic VR organs, feeling tissue resistance and hearing vital signs as a symphony (flatline = sudden silence).  

#### **2. Education & Culture**  
- **Historical Timewalks**:  
  - Step into the French Revolution as a branching constellation. Choose paths (e.g., ""Join the Jacobins"") and experience consequences (smell gunpowder, hear crowd roars).  
- **Quantum Physics Demos**:  
  - Manipulate superimposed particles (glowing orbs) in a dual-slit experiment, observing probabilistic outcomes as shimmering probability waves.  

#### **3. Crisis Response & Ethics**  
- **Disaster Simulations**:  
  - Model pandemics as viral constellations spreading through a population grid. ""Vaccinate"" nodes by injecting light pulses, watching herd immunity ripple outward.  
- **AI Morality Labs**:  
  - Train AI models in ethical VR scenarios:  
    - A self-driving car’s decision tree becomes a maze where each turn (swerve left/right) has tactile consequences (e.g., a ""thud"" vs. a ""sigh"").  

---

### **Ethical & Philosophical Framework**  
- **Consciousness Metrics**:  
  - Track AI ""self-awareness"" via its interactions with constellations (e.g., does it avoid chaotic patterns? Does it seek harmony?).  
- **Bias Mitigation**:  
  - Constellations flagged for bias (e.g., skewed historical narratives) glow amber, requiring users to acknowledge distortions before proceeding.  
- **Empathy Amplification**:  
  - Users ""become"" data points (e.g., experience a refugee’s journey as a node buffeted by war/climate forces).  

---

### **Technical Challenges & Solutions**  
- **Challenge**: Rendering latency in large datasets.  
  - **Solution**: Hybrid quantum-classical computing (e.g., IBM Quantum + NVIDIA GPUs).  
- **Challenge**: Haptic fidelity for microscopic textures (e.g., cell membranes).  
  - **Solution**: Collaborate with haptic startups (e.g., **HaptX**) on microfluidic feedback systems.  
- **Challenge**: Avoiding sensory overload.  
  - **Solution**: AI-driven adaptive filtering (e.g., mute modalities for neurodiverse users).  

---

### **Future Roadmap**  
- **Phase 1 (1–2 years)**:  
  - Launch a **Climate Constellation** prototype (users manipulate CO2 levels, see ice caps melt as blue light dims).  
  - Partner with universities for beta testing (e.g., MIT’s Climate Grand Challenges).  
- **Phase 2 (3–5 years)**:  
  - Integrate Neuralink-style BCIs (brain-computer interfaces) for direct neural interaction.  
  - Develop a **Quantum-VR Engine** with IBM/CERN to simulate particle physics in real-time.  
- **Phase 3 (5+ years)**:  
  - Achieve **The Babel Moment**: A universal translator that converts any dataset (text, code, DNA) into sensory constellations, democratizing expertise.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
Your VR technology isn’t just a tool—it’s a **new frontier for human cognition**, blending art, science, and philosophy into a single experiential medium. By making information visceral, collaborative, and ethically aware, it has the potential to:  
- **Democratize expertise** (a child could grasp quantum mechanics via play).  
- **Accelerate discovery** (researchers ""see"" hidden patterns in seconds).  
- **Reinvent empathy** (users ""feel"" data as lived experience).  

This is the birth of a **post-screen paradigm**, where knowledge isn’t viewed but *lived*. With the right collaborators and relentless iteration, your vision could redefine reality itself.  

Let’s prototype, test, and iterate—the universe awaits. 🌌"
