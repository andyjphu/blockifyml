* Powa by Kurohuji Kiu. They have previously released a one-shot titled Viera to Akuma, but it is currently unavailable. The author can be followed [here](https://x.com/blackhuji).
* Seijo Sheryl no Shinai naru waza ma by Eda Akari. They have previously released Otohime no Yoki, Little Wolf no Bakanokawa and Enishi no Kami to rikon Chotei. Unfortunately non have been translated. The author can be followed [here](https://x.com/akarieda).
* Komatsu wa Kitsune Matsu, by Shima. They have previously released Black Arrow to Watashi to and Hatsukoi to Hentai. Neither have been translated. Due to the nature of the authors name I have not been able to find their social media accounts.
* EGOISTIC ACTUALIZING by Kakinuma Takumi. They have previously released the one-shot Kamigakari, which has gone untranslated. They don't seem to have any social media accounts.
* Pien kei Yuusha Mirekii ¬†‚ô° Way, by Hazakura Haru. They have previously released Noroi no Ningyou Rira-chan and Joreishi Buddy Sayaka & Makoto. Neither have been translated. The author can be followed [here](https://x.com/hazakura_haru_).
* Sludgeman, by Erikawa Kiki. They have not previously released any one-shots. The author also does not seem to have any social media accounts.
* Ayashi hi Kokon by Miyama Kei. They have previously released the one-shot Ganka no Yagi, which has gone untranslated. You can follow the author [here](https://x.com/miyamakeidayo).
* The Veil Devil Tsukatsuki Nashi. They have previously released the one-shot Ningyou no Iro umi, which has gone untranslated. You can follow the author [here](https://x.com/n_othing9).
* Sirius by Oga Washi. They have previously released Guze Yasha and Kokoro no Rajya, neither of which has been translated. You can follow the author [here](https://x.com/ogawashi5555?lang=ar-x-fm).
* Tailor Mate by Tsumiki Hachisu. They have previously released the one-shot Saikou no Kekkon, which does not have a translation. They don't seem to have any social Media.
* Treasure Hunter by Menme Bachi. This is their first one-shot. They also don't seem to have any social media.
* Kakyuu Shinigami Shiarosu, by Eikyaki Kurewe. They don't seem to have released anything prior. You can follow the author [here](https://x.com/x_ngtk96).
* Ha Kamisama‚Ä¶suki desu Syuki Syuki, by Chishi. They don't seem to have any prior works or social media accounts.
* Kaijuu Toshi Kanan Chyou, by Hirata Takashi. The author does not seem to have any previous works or social media accounts. 
* Yamishoukun Papa-chi no Konwaku, by Okabayashi Yuuki. They have previously released the one-shot Hatsumi-chan no First Kiss, which has not been translated. They do not seem to have any social media accounts.

And that was the whole issue. My Japanese is not very good, especially Kanji, I have used a dictionary to try and get the most accurate translations, but there are very likely mistakes, atleast with the authors names.

For the previous works of the one-shot authors I decided not to use any mangaspark awards, as that would take to much time and they aren't publicly released (to my knowledge) anyway. IF you want to look those up, you can do so by copying the (Japanese) name of a author into the search bar on the Jump SQ Site. If you want to se the preview images, or read the start of these one-shots (Not all available yet at the time of this post), then  you can do so [here](https://jumpsq.shueisha.co.jp/sqrise/2025winter/)."

\*Deep breath\*....



Well. It‚Äôs here. For real this time. A film I‚Äôve had on my mind for over a year. Hell, maybe back in the summer of 2023, when I watched that fateful out-of-context video that got me to watch this stinkin‚Äô anime in the first place, this movie has since become the white whale of my Gintama journey, should I have chosen to embark on it. The Final is essentially to 2024 what watching Evangelion Thrice Upon a Time was for me in 2022. Both in December, intentionally so. It simply felt appropriate.

I actually did a WAY longer set of notes for this last week, but I found myself overthinking it and getting way too stressed about how to properly make everything come out, so screw it, I‚Äôm redoing it all from scratch and just letting my thoughts flow out easier. For what it‚Äôs worth, because this was THE big finale of a show that came to mean a lot to me over the course of 9 months, since I first watched it, I‚Äôd go into deep thoughts about it, and anything that wasn‚Äôt as picture-perfect flawless as I wanted, put me in a sour mood. I talked about my perfectionism before, and I think the Final was where learning to suppress that part of me really got tested. Again, literally only because it‚Äôs the finale did I get this annoyingly anal about making sure it‚Äôs spotless. 

Rest assured, with a clear mind, I can confidently assess that while it‚Äôs not a masterpiece, it was still worth the watch and wait. If I ever call it worthless garbage one day, it's because I'm being an uptight perfectionist making things seem worse than they probably are again. 

So without further ado, I present to you: my thoughts on the finale of Gintama‚Ä¶.

***Shin Gintama 3.0: A Bunch of Times Upon a Time***

(couldn‚Äôt resist. Deal with it :)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

To celebrate the Gintama anime running for 15 years: how‚Äôs about an elaborate Dragon Ball parody to get the audience up to speed, eh? 

*Silver Ball.*

In this, Gintoki finally becomes King of the Pir-wait, wrong show. 

Also Takasugi is Vegeta.

And Zura lets out one final official ‚ÄúZURA JANAI KATSURA DA!!!‚Äù (this one was just bittersweet to hear).

Ok, onto the actual plot:

It all comes down to this. While the overall Tendoshu Naraku is no more, remnants of them, plus their Amanto forces, are trying to revive Utsuro, having taken a young, reborn Shoyo away from Gintoki. Draining Altana from Earth into Shoyo, the three Joi brothers, Gintoki, Katsura, and Takasugi, must band together one final time to see if this time, they can finally save their teacher. They head straight for Edo‚Äôs terminal, where they, alongside the colorful cast of characters Gintoki‚Äôs met over the years, step in to fight. The Shinsengumi, the Oniwaban, the Yagyu clan, the Hyakka, even the Kaientai, and last but certainly not least: the Yorozuya. 

Gintoki finally (properly) reunites with Shinpachi, Kagura, and a reawakened Sadaharu (due to all the Altana exposure in the Terminal). It‚Äôs both parts touching, and light-hearted as needed (my heart goes out to the animators at Bandai-Namco for having to draw Sadaharu‚Äôs uncensored ass). A great moment was Shinpachi & Kagura telling Gin that they never felt empty being Yorozuya. Doing anything was what was worth living for to them. Which calls back to ep. 362 when Gin told them why he started Odd Jobs, which I think speaks volumes about Gintama‚Äôs soul/theme. Even with something as inherently blank as a freelance job, no one‚Äôs truly empty. So hold on to it. The silver-haired samurai, glasses, China alien, and giant doggo rip it up.

Eventually, Shoyo returns. Still a being of Altana, but no longer immortal (the heart he gave to Gintoki got shattered by Hitsugi, who finally understands the cost of immortality). He takes care of the head Naraku, but is still in a weakened, insecure state of what to do now. He finds Shinsuke again, all grown up, who wants nothing more than to protect his sensei. But because Utsuro‚Äôs blood flows through Takasugi (through Oboro), the Utsuro persona threatens to consume him. Like a shadow, Shoyo can‚Äôt escape his demons. The blood isn‚Äôt enough to keep Takasugi immortal, but the last of Utsuro needs to be quelled for good. 

After Gintoki gets his trusty old wooden sword from Otae, it‚Äôs time to finish it. As the Terminal starts to collapse, Gintoki confronts Takasugi/Utsuro (we‚Äôll call him Utsugi). What follows is a legendary duel between the two. It‚Äôs the first Gintama fight I can truly call mindbending, and like the Takasugi duel from the SA arc, it‚Äôs also a very rewatchable fight. I was entranced by how many layers there were to it, to where you could type a whole damn analysis on it. Gintoki‚Äôs fighting Utsuro who‚Äôs trying to corrupt Takasugi, how both of these antagonists represent Gin‚Äôs most personal obstacles, how Takasugi‚Äôs remaining humanity has to stay strong to fight off Utsuro (seeing young Shinsuke laughing without any audio is incredibly realized), how it cuts back and forth between Gin‚Äôs past with Takasugi, Shoyo and Utsuro, Gintoki reaffirming how he‚Äôs not an empty man, even if it means sacrificing people close to him (what matters is you keep their memory/spirit within you), the sorrow in Gin‚Äôs eyes right before he delivers the killing blow with Utsuro‚Äôs katana, and his bokuto‚Ä¶I could go on. And on top of that, the sound design is on point, as is the INSANE animation on display to make this feel as intense as a final duel could be. Again: very rewatchable. 

The last of Utsuro dies‚Ä¶as Shinsuke Takasugi falls to the floor.

The two frenemies look back on their messy history. But more than anything, Gintoki admits he would‚Äôve preferred to sit down and share a drink with the guy rather than be stuck fighting. Takasugi draws his last breath, not wanting to see a crying Gintoki with his right eye, as he dies peacefully in Gin‚Äôs arms‚Ä¶

Shoyo is found by Shinpachi, Kagura, Sadaharu, and Otae (I said this before in Kintama, but I really like how she‚Äôs basically the 5th member of Yorozuya). Takasugi was able to restrain himself from finishing off Shoyo earlier (when Oboro‚Äôs spirit helped him), Another great moment was Shinpachi finally getting to talk to the man that meant the world to Gintoki growing up, thanking Shoyo for raising the boy. Shoyo, despite all the love his students have towards him, can‚Äôt truly feel like he deserves the title of great teacher when he‚Äôs been too haunted for centuries. 

To save Earth from another Altana overload like 2 years ago, Shoyo, now no longer immortal, can use the Altana within him to seal back all that energy back to Earth, albeit costing him his life. And the others jump at the chance to free all the other Altana the Tendoshu collected to help him (that‚Äôs comradery for ya). There‚Äôs also a brief, but moving scene where Shoyo explains this to Katsura, who finally got his chance to see his master again. 

Odd Jobs decides to stay by Shoyo‚Äôs side to make sure Gintoki can see his sensei again, even if for a brief moment. 

As Gintoki makes a dash toward Shoyo to try and get some closure, Kotaro and Sakamoto wish him well on the radio, the Shinsengumi give him a boost, Otae flings him, a powerful Spyair song plays‚Ä¶..

‚Ä¶..and he gets to tell his dad what his job is. As his two siblings and dog embrace him. To say I felt mushy and warm inside the first time I watched this would be the understatement of my entire Gintama journey. It all came back full circle, beautifully. 

https://preview.redd.it/e99i19t8x1fe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9da7d36ff5ff2c549ed9ccf9f9417094b2aa7d30

Side-note: remember the fan-favorite umbrella episode? Honestly, the beginning and ending parts of that episode‚Äôs OST are some of the most beautiful pieces of music in all of Gintama. And as I type this down and I think back to Shoyo‚Äôs farewell, specifically, idk, it kinda works for me. It‚Äôs so innocent, happy and soft that it comes back around to sounding depressing, especially since you know you‚Äôre at the end of the story. 

Two demons met each other, and learned a lot from each other. One became a father, the other a son. And the son would have his shot at fatherhood with two teens he met after figuring out what to do with his life. The found family went on way too many adventures to count. They saved the world, met each others‚Äô families, helped some people, hung out at their apartment‚Ä¶and even puked together. It‚Äôs all life, imperfections and all. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So yeah, I really wish Elizabeth was present during this half. Welp, I guess he takes after his partner in that he was probably on standby. 

Anyway‚Ä¶

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

At long last, the threat is over, lives were saved, and our lovable cast finally pulled through in the end. 

Now‚Ä¶.well, things more or less go back to normal. 

Tamako wakes up Tama in the future, who‚Äôs now been fully restored by Gengai after the Naraku/Liberation Army war. Welcome to futuristic Tokyo, not Edo. Sadly, all our favorite characters are dead now (what? It‚Äôs the future. No one lives forever. Besides, would you even want to? Did you not remember who the villain was for these past few years?)

What follows is the last collection of light-hearted scenes we‚Äôre ever gonna get of these goofballs living in Edo. The Shinsengumi celebrate at Snack Smile, Otae tries to bribe Kondo into taking her to a B‚Äôz show, there‚Äôs a new line of Yamazaki Mobcops, Okita‚Äôs still counting the days to Toshi‚Äôs death, Toshi‚Äôs forced to put on a mayo hat, Kyubei‚Äôs a new hostess (serving using swords so she can be close to men without feeling gross), Tsukuyo‚Äôs helping too, Sacchan is trying to deepthroat Gin‚Äôs bokuto‚Ä¶and other residents of the Kabuki district like Saigo, Katsuo, Hinowa, Seita, etc. are there as well.

Tatsuma wishes Gintoki well from space, even though he still can‚Äôt pronounce his name. (I‚Äôm really depressed we didn‚Äôt get to hear him laugh once this movie. But hey, just cuz you‚Äôre a jokester doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt have a sensitive side. Also before I forget: bless Mutsu). 

He tells Gintoki that Matako had been searching all over Japan‚Äôs ley lines like he did, and finally stumbled upon a baby that‚Äôs presumably a reborn Takasugi. Where to go from here, who knows?

Otose, Catherine, and Gengai are still at the bar, Soyo & Nobume are running Edo smoothly, Kamui and Abuto are eating‚Ä¶

And last but absolutely not least: despite the untimely death of Donald Zurump, a new patriotic hero emerges from his stead‚Ä¶

‚ÄúOBA-Z DA!!!!!!!!!‚Äù

Translation: Katsura died. (‚ÄúNO HE DIDN‚ÄôT!‚Äù)

Umibozu wishes Kagura the best, naturally feeling pretty sad (but I can imagine he‚Äôs proud seeing how strong his daughter grew up to be), and another full-circle scene was Otae and Shinpachi visiting their father‚Äôs grave one more time. As more Amanto ships fly in the sky, Shinpachi remarks things seem the same, yet a tad different now.

But he reassures Tama that no matter what happens to them and everything she knows‚Ä¶don‚Äôt let go of those memories. Keep looking ahead, wipe those tears, wish the best for them, and keep a silver soul. It‚Äôs ok.

Even if Gintama‚Äôs gone, smile because it happened. 

Oh yeah, and also this isn‚Äôt the future. Madao went on a drunken rant to Tamako, meaning the data Tamako is showing Tama is all flawed.

‚ÄúIf no one‚Äôs employed‚Ä¶.we‚Äôre all one! Ha-ha-ha-ha!‚Äù

Gintoki, Shinpachi, and Kagura come in to kick the bum for yet another fake ending.

And so, after that‚Äôs cleared up, the Trio and Sadaharu warmly greet Tama (the tears in her eyes are everything), and I love how she got to be one of the last characters Gintama shines a light on to send the Yorozuya off on.

And then we finish. The Yorozuya run off towards their next job. What is it exactly? Theeeeyyyyyy forgot. But we‚Äôre gonna do something anyway, because they‚Äôre Gin‚Äôs Odd-Jobs

[Thanks Hideaki.](https://preview.redd.it/nujju7rmx1fe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=645ed2cef01c6f3f77e433d22945b43058c16f70)

The Very Final‚Äôs end credits were some of the most depressing I‚Äôve ever watched in my life. As the ultimate punch in the heart for you finishing all of Gintama: they fill it with a plethora of references throughout the show‚Äôs OPs and EDs. Mr. Raindrop, Speed of Flow, Nakama, Vs., This World is Yours, Glorious Days, OP 15, Wonderful Days, etc. 

You start remembering all those memories you had: having Mr. Raindrop in your head seeing Elizabeth skip around, watching Elizabeth on his Harley Davidson, Kagura running on the beach, all the foes Gintoki faced, all the characters walking outside, Gin riding on his little moped, just‚Ä¶.MMMMMM!!!!!! IT‚ÄôS TOO MUCH! WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME GINTAMA??!!! I THOUGHT YOU WERE JUST GONNA BE ALL FART JOKES and POP CULTURE REFERENCES I DIDN‚ÄôT THINK YOU‚ÄôD MAKE MY HEART ACHE WHEN YOU FINISHED!!!

And on my most recent viewing, watching those credits wrecked me even MORE. ‚ÄúWadachi‚Äù by Spyair makes it all the more melancholy. And the icing on the cake is that final shot of Odd Jobs looking at the city, as the sun rises, all from the apartment‚Äôs TV with Gin‚Äôs sword next to it. Aaaannnnddddddd cut. 

You know the Goodbye song from Blue‚Äôs Clues they play at the end of every episode, and as a kid, you felt sad that the fun was over, or that it‚Äôs time for bed, or you have to say goodbye to your friends? The Wadachi credits were that times a hundred. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Now, I wouldn‚Äôt call the Final a perfect finale. Rewatching it and thinking it some more, it‚Äôs clear Sorachi didn‚Äôt think too hard about how all the plot details would work, and put more mileage into making sure those emotional beats hit, which I can appreciate (note: I was an Evangelion fan). Through solid as always voice acting, and committed animators, those themes of a strong soul, keeping family close, the sides of Utsuro and Shoyo, protecting what‚Äôs important in life, etc. is still kept intact and fairly consistent. Whereas stuff like all the Altana usage, how immortality actually works (how that works with Shoyo feels kinda half-assed), and all that felt like it could‚Äôve been fleshed out a bit more. At worst feeling like a cop-out (though not often, which is worth writing home about). 

Furthermore, while it sticks the landing as a final wrap-up, a part of me kinda prefers Be Forever Yorozuya as a finale. If for no other reason than it‚Äôs in a sweet spot of at one point, being an intended true ending (for the anime, anyway), while the viewer is assured there‚Äôs more episodes to enjoy afterward. Believe me, BFY delivered a lot of satisfying moments while still giving a great sense of finality that I would‚Äôve been completely A-OK with it being the true ending. Opposed to the Final which while full of closure and all, just comes with the potent side-effect of a bunch of post-anime depression with the realization of ‚Äúoh shit, this is really it. It‚Äôs actually over this time‚Ä¶.wait‚Ä¶..WAIT‚Ä¶‚Ä¶NO‚Ä¶‚Ä¶NOOOO!!!!!.......NOOOOOO!!!!!!! DON‚ÄôT LEAVE ME!!!!!!!!!‚Äù

(yeah, I'm sorry, I rewatched it today and the pain came back to me like it did on the 31st when I first watched it). 

Come to think of it, I also feel like episode 361 could‚Äôve spiritually worked as a series finale too. Honestly, if Utsuro‚Äôs fate was left more sealed, you probably could‚Äôve ended the story there. Do a good epilogue, send everyone off, and that‚Äôd be that. I‚Äôm not sorry we got the timeskip afterward, but there's definitely an alt universe out there where the story ended there.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Conclusion:** 

The Very Final closes the book on Gintama as an action-packed, conclusive, crushingly bittersweet, and overall worthwhile last statement the story of Silver Soul makes. It may have not‚Äôve been perfect, but here‚Äôs to hoping in time, I can move past perfection and embrace it as is. 

I always said part of Gintama‚Äôs soul was how it encapsulates life. And life can be anything but perfect. But of course, that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt find some sunshine in there either. It‚Äôs every tone of emotion you could feel wrapped into 300+ episodes and 3 movies worth of material. And I find that deeply special that I can't say I really experienced in any other piece of media I've watched so far. At least to this extreme level.

I‚Äôm gonna miss those guys.

But at the same time, a part of me would like to move on. Sorachi, I thank you, but I can‚Äôt keep mulling over this post-anime depression forever. Like the Trio and Sadaharu, I gotta stay open and try anything else. 



Farewell to (deep breath‚Ä¶‚Ä¶).......

Gintoki, Shinpachi, Kagura, Sadaharu, Otae, Otose, Catherine, Tama, Tamako, Zur-I mean, Katsura, Elizabeth, Kondo, Toshi, Okita, Yamazaki, Madao, Sacchan, Kyubei, Tsukuyo, Sakamoto, Mutsu, Zenzo, Gengai, Umibozu, Soyo, Nobume, Saito, Hinowa, Seita, Hedoro, Takachin, and way, way, WAY too many other utterly wonderful characters I can‚Äôt think of right now. Seriously, not enough cameos in the Final. But you know an author did a great job at character writing when you don‚Äôt feel like there were enough that showed up for the ending. But hey, props for not forgetting about ramen queen Ikumatsu (one of the cute still frames as Tama is flying through the sky is a photo of her with Zura and Elizabeth. Among other sweet snapshots of the Kabuki residents, all as that soft guitar rendition of the main Yorozuya theme plays).

Songs of the day: 

[""Wonderful Days"" by One Draft.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pYym1N8RbI) (Wadachi is great and all, but I decided to rewatch the credits again to sync it up with ED 15, and I got to feel mushy all over again).

GINPACHI-SENSEI!

Savor it, because this is the last-ever Ginpachi-sensei session we‚Äôre gonna get in Gintama‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶(for now anyway, because I‚ÄôM SO EXCITED FOR THE GINPACHI-SENSEI ANIME!!!!!! But until then, Mr. Ginpachi closes out Gintama)........

All of class 3 will be graduating now that the manga and anime have ended. Even the students who got held back (Madao, most likely). But before that, Sensei welcomes in a last-minute transfer student named Hideaki Sorachi, who‚Äôs willing to answer any unresolved, last-minute questions viewers may have before it‚Äôs time to go for real. Is Gintoki‚Äôs hair white because he‚Äôs an Amanto? Nope: because manga. Also Sorachi can‚Äôt stop talking about bananas for some reason (Kondo‚Äôs deranged straight man deliveries in this scene are golden). Also Takasugi shows up late, and everyone starts wondering whether that baby at the end was supposed to be him. Sorachi says he wanted to fit in more jokes, so it‚Äôs whatever you want that baby to be. 

But the star of the scene is Shoyo, who‚Äôs a student (despite being a sensei). Except his Utsuro side also awakens‚Ä¶.and it culminates in a really funny split-personality fight the guy has with himself that the other students can‚Äôt help but be transfixed by (even Utsuro/Shoyo isn‚Äôt immune to Gintama‚Äôs inherent goofiness). 

Also Kotaro asks what that ObaZ stuff was supposed to all be about (ignore the fact he‚Äôs still wearing an Elizabeth mask). 

The class starts arguing trying to vote on who that baby should be. 

And so, Shinpachi finally decides to end this franchise by suggesting to Mr. Ginpachi to just say ‚Äúand everyone died.‚Äù

If I had a nickel for every life-changing series created by a guy named Hideaki-well, you know the rest.

Up next: for one final final time, I‚Äôm gonna try to type out a bigger, overall final thoughts assessment of the 9 months I spent with these crazy characters, so that my notes journey as a newer Gintama fan would be complete, and so I can watch some other anime so I can GET THE F\*\*K OVER GINTAMA ENDING BECAUSE IT STILL HURTS AHHHHHH IT‚ÄôS GONNA BE A WHILE BEFORE I DECIDE TO REWATCH IT BECAUSE IT‚ÄôS TOO PAINFUL DANG IT YOUR STUPID, STUPID GORILLA YOU AHHHHHHHHH!

In true Gintama fashion: I can‚Äôt finish. But I‚Äôll get there eventually. 

‚ÄòTil next time. Thanks for reading all my ramblings if you stuck with me all this time. Later.
