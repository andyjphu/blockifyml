The CT legislature is having a hearing this week about whether to continue funding the Connecticut Governor's Foot Guard.

For those who do not know, the Governor's Foot Guard is the longest continuously serving military unit in our nation. If you frequent parades in our great state, you have probably seen the grenadiers of the foot guard marching with pride.

I posted the link below if you would like to show your support by signing the petition. It only takes a minute and could mean the difference between keeping history alive, or the end of an era that spans over a quarter of a millennium.

Thank you for your time

Higher-Level Review vs. Appeal for 30% Mental Health Rating,VeteransBenefits,1i9xiwh,2025-01-25 16:27:31,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/comments/1i9xiwh/higherlevel_review_vs_appeal_for_30_mental_health/,AggravatedSister,VA Disability Claims :claim:,"My partner is currently rated at 30% for mental health, and we‚Äôre trying to decide between pursuing a Higher-Level Review (HLR) or going straight to an appeal with supplemental evidence. We're at a bit of a crossroads because his claims agent and we have differing opinions on the best approach. We‚Äôd really appreciate any insights from those of you who‚Äôve been through a similar situation.

**The Situation:** His claims agent is recommending going straight to an appeal and submitting additional evidence, but we feel there‚Äôs already plenty of strong evidence in the initial claim that wasn‚Äôt thoroughly reviewed or was outright ignored by the C&P examiners and initial reviewers.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the evidence that was submitted with his initial claim:

Personal Statement: He detailed the severe impact of PTSD and insomnia on his daily life.

**Witness Statements:**

* From me (his partner of 5 years), describing his daily struggles.
* His best friend, who lived with him immediately after leaving the military.
* A childhood friend who has known him for decades.
* An ex-girlfriend (2-year relationship during service) who was in his unit, witnessed his symptoms, and corroborated his efforts to seek mental health care during service.
* Three friends from his unit, discussing the lack of prioritization or access to mental health care within their unit.
* Psychologist‚Äôs Letter: A 3-page letter from his private licensed psychologist, detailing his PTSD diagnosis per DSM-5 criteria, including examples of how it severely impacts his relationships, sleep, work, and social interactions. The letter also highlighted the psychologist‚Äôs credentials, specialty in PTSD/trauma, and extensive experience with veterans.

**Why We‚Äôre Considering an HLR:** After reviewing the C&P exams, we found numerous inconsistencies and misleading statements that don‚Äôt align with the submitted evidence. Here are a few examples:

**Misrepresented Diagnosis:**

**C&P Note:** ‚ÄúThe veteran was diagnosed with PTSD by Dr. X due to an incident in 2017. Veteran‚Äôs reported symptoms during this examiner‚Äôs evaluation did not meet the diagnostics for PTSD. **Reality:** His private psychologist explicitly outlined how he meets all DSM-5 criteria for PTSD, including avoidance, hypervigilance, and recurrent intrusive thoughts.

**Social Support:**

**C&P Note:** ‚ÄúAlthough the veteran does not have many friends, he has one or two individuals he trusts.‚Äù **Reality:** This was never discussed during the exam. Seven witness statements from friends and loved ones highlight that while he has a broad social network, he is reclusive and experiences significant anxiety in social settings.

**Work History:**

**C&P Note:** ‚ÄúSince his 2020 discharge from the military, the veteran has held two jobs, with the longest tenure being one year in construction.‚Äù **Reality:** Both jobs combined totaled less than one year. This is corroborated in my witness statement as his partner.

**Sleep Issues:**

**C&P Note:** ‚ÄúThe veteran reported sleeping 7-8 hours a night but often wakes up several times throughout the evening.‚Äù **Reality:** He stated he sleeps 7-8 hours throughout the day (not in one stretch), waking multiple times and often staying awake for hours. This fragmented sleep pattern is corroborated in my witness statement.

**Relationship Status:**

**C&P Note:** ‚ÄúVeteran remained single during service.‚Äù **Reality:** He was in a 2-year relationship during service, corroborated by his ex-girlfriend‚Äôs statement included in the evidence.

**Our Concern:** We feel an HLR could potentially address these discrepancies, as it would involve a new reviewer looking at the existing evidence. However, the claims agent believes an appeal with supplemental evidence is the better route.

Has anyone had success with an HLR in similar situations?

Would submitting supplemental evidence strengthen his case, or would it just complicate things further?"

Design your own products,3Dprintingbusiness,1i9xhll,2025-01-25 16:25:51,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprintingbusiness/comments/1i9xhll/design_your_own_products/,RedditUser240211,,"I just watched a YouTube video (sorry, no link: I don't want this sub to look like a plug for Etsy or Shopify), where the speaker explained how his popular product got copied and sold by a competitor and what he had to go through to stop the offending action.

I suspect this is more common than we think, especially when some of us download an STL, pay for a commercial license, print and sell. The truth is some people make money from selling designs: they make more money by selling the same designs (or a commercial license for the same designs). YOU are not alone and do not have exclusive rights (rarely, unless you paid a lot of money for that right).

""*But, I don't know the first thing about designing!*"" Neither did I when I started, but it didn't take long to learn how to design simple products on TinkerCAD. I realize TinkerCAD may not be the answer.

So, I'd like to offer two suggestions:

1.  Learn. I set a personal goal this year to learn how to model. I have installed Fusion360 (the license is free for personal use, until you start making money) and Blender. Both offer tutorials. You can also find tutorials and support in r/Fusion360/ and r/blenderTutorials.
2.  If you are in the United States, you can pay someone to create models for you and as long as you pay for all their time, you can claim copyright as a ""*work for hire*"". In countries that do not recognize ""work for hire"", you can add a clause to your contract that payment constitutes an irrevocable license to the product. This is now contract law, not copyright law, and you could add all the clauses you think are necessary (within reason, or the designer may not agree).

Can anyone think of ways or means to protect a product?"

(United States)",Antiques,1i9xfi0,2025-01-25 16:23:11,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Antiques/comments/1i9xfi0/jonathan_winters_original_sketch_do_i_need_to_get/,Reginald_Eggplant7,Advice,"My mom recently passed away, so I'm starting to clear out old items, collectibles, etc. 

For longer than I've been alive, my dad had this sketch (see picture).  It was sketched by Jonathan Winters (comedian/actor) and given to my dad. My dad (and mom) worked at the Institute of Living psychiatric hospital in Hartford CT back in the late 50s early 60s. 

Jonathan Winters was a patient there, apparently 2 separate occasions. Anyway, he made this sketch and gave it to my dad (who was a psych provider).  It's a very unique sketch, because it's not about some random surrealistic image, I think it's possibly a self-portrait of Jonathan winters himself, plus the subject matter and story is kinda cool (sketched while in a mental institution).

I'm wanting to sell, and I'm guessing a local auction house in Connecticut might be the place, since there might be more local interest here in Connecticut, because of institute of living connection, however, I may think about posting it online. Maybe an online auction house?

**QUESTION**:  if I ended up selling it online, would I  (or should I) have to get some certification by some well regarded entity, that this sketch is in fact an authentic sketch from Jonathan Winters? Would the online auction house certify it? I could put it up on Ebay, but I don't wanna ship it to somebody and then I hear complaints that they think it's not real or something. 

The sketch is on a scrap piece of paper, and is approximately 8"" x 5""

I was born in the United States but me and my family moved to Ontario when I was 3 years old and have lived in Ontario ever since. My parents are not American citizens themselves. I have never lived in the United States, never paid US taxes, and last time I visited was 15 years ago. I have Canadian and American citizenship and passports. 

I want to invest on Wealthsimple but am required to diclslcose if I am us person. I know there are some complicated legal areas with duel Canadian American citizenships with US tax obligations. Resulting from IRS and FATCA laws. 

Where can I go to find information about dual citizenship in my situation wanting to invest in investment products (FHSA, indexs, etfs). "

As a person who has traveled extensively for the majority of my life and dealing with immigration issues I find that many don‚Äôt understand the difference between documented and undocumented immigrants. 

Your coworkers are documented immigrants. They entered the United States legally, thru proper border crossings and given work authorization upon entry. They are not a target for any immigration enforcement. When it comes to undocumented immigrants. They entered the country illegally, their presence inside the United States is unknown. They do not have work authorization. They are the target of the Trump administration.

Illegal migrants chose to enter the country illegally because trying to do so legally wouldn‚Äôt have been possible because of past or current legal troubles.

During the Biden administration Amazon absorbed thousands of migrants from around the world and gave them employment and opportunity. This is something that should be applauded of any employer. Amazon associates have nothing to fear. You won‚Äôt see any ICE raids in any Amazon facility."

the CATTB also can change its Height and can lean itself just like the Type 10

CATTB only has the 140mm  Cannon so now Machine gun

# History for anyone who is intrested :)

The **CATTB** (Component Advanced Technology Test Bed) was an experimental tank developed by the United States in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was part of research initiatives aimed at exploring advanced technologies for next-generation main battle tanks. While the CATTB never entered production, it served as a platform to test cutting-edge innovations, some of which influenced later tank designs like the M1A2 Abrams and other advanced armored vehicle projects.

# Key Features of the CATTB:

1. **Main Armament**:
   * Equipped with a **140mm smoothbore gun**, much larger than the standard 120mm on the M1 Abrams. This was intended to counter advances in Soviet armor technology and provide significantly greater firepower.
   * The larger caliber offered improved anti-tank capability but required significant modifications to the turret design due to its size and recoil.
2. **Autoloader**:
   * The CATTB incorporated an **autoloader** to handle the large 140mm rounds, reducing the need for a human loader and allowing for a reduced crew size.
   * The autoloader helped improve the rate of fire and saved space inside the turret.
3. **Advanced Armor**:
   * The tank featured upgraded **composite armor**, with possible use of experimental materials to enhance protection against kinetic energy penetrators and shaped charge warheads.
4. **Propulsion**:
   * It utilized an upgraded version of the **Honeywell AGT1500 gas turbine engine**, potentially with more power to handle the increased weight from the larger gun and enhanced armor.
5. **Fire Control and Electronics**:
   * Advanced fire control systems, possibly precursors to those later implemented in the M1A2 Abrams.
   * Integration of sensors and targeting systems aimed at improving accuracy and battlefield awareness.
6. **Crew Layout**:
   * The tank likely had a **three-man crew** due to the inclusion of the autoloader, eliminating the need for a dedicated loader.

# Legacy:

* The CATTB was not intended for production but was used as a testbed for advanced technologies.
* Lessons learned from the CATTB program informed the development of later upgrades to the M1 Abrams and other armored platforms.
* The 140mm gun concept, while offering superior firepower, was deemed impractical for widespread use due to its size, weight, and logistical challenges. The 120mm smoothbore gun remains the standard for most Western main battle tanks today."

I'm mainly looking for people in the United States or Canada, just easier because of time zones etc.

I don't wanna spill all the beans about myself, so I'll list off some things I like to do and we can talk more if you are interested! I'm pretty shy and introverted, I'm 5'8, 148lbs, long dark brown hair, and dark brown eyes.

I like exercising, fishing, hunting, camping, archery (Just started) playing video games, watching TV shows and movies, astrophotography (Only started recently), and more!

I'd love to hear about your interests! We don't have to have the same exact interests, I'm open minded and open to learning and hearing about other people's hobbies.

I'm not really picky in terms of looks, but the only thing I do ask is that you are at a relatively healthy weight. I don't mean that to sound rude or that you have to be super fit or something, but it's the only thing I care about in terms of looks really. That and obviously be 18+"

The CT legislature is having a hearing this week about whether to continue funding the Connecticut Governor's Foot Guard. 

For those who do not know, the Governor's Foot Guard is the longest continuously serving military unit in our nation. If you frequent parades in our great state, you have probably seen the grenadiers of the foot guard marching with pride.

I posted the link below if you would like to show your support by signing the petition. It only takes a minute and could mean the difference between keeping history alive, or the end of an era that spans over a quarter of a millennium.

Thank you for your time

I got twenty percent for my back after I got eighty percent. What if my back goes up to 40% or even higher? Will that increase my overall percentage for my va disability?



Has anyone else dealt with this before.
Also, if so did it work out for you.Did you get a higher disability percentage, and did you get more back pay?
In context, I just got my back pay yesterday, I got 15k.
Also, apparently on this post, we're supposed to get our february pay on the 27th of January. 
Is that true? And I just got my backpay, will I still get my regular payment on the 27th."
I (20F) was traumatized by my boyfriend's (21M) fraternity and don't know how to move forward,relationship_advice,1i9x7uh,2025-01-25 16:13:49,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i9x7uh/i_20f_was_traumatized_by_my_boyfriends_21m/,Scubadubadue,,"My boyfriend and I have been dating half a year or so. Although I've always had strong thoughts about ""frat bros,"" I gave my current boyfriend, Aaron (fake name), a chance because he wasn't off-put by forwardness of wanting a real relationship -- something hard to come by on a small college campus that's mainly greek life. We started dating, and things have been wonderful. I've never been with a man who treats me this incredible. He spoils me, dotes on me, does anything I ask and is very open and honest. Or so I thought. About a month in, his Big, Brady (also ake name) joked about his nicotine addiction. To my knowledge, although I knew he drank, I was upfront at the beginning about how I disliked smoking, so he said he smoked occasionally in high school but it wouldn't be a big deal to eliminate it from his life. Although he had been trying to quit since starting to date me, he had been lying and still smoking vapes from his friends when offered. He promised to never do it again and to be honest, and I believed him, especially because my friends actually liked him and said that he clearly loved me and that addiction is hard to overcome and be honest about.

Another incident a month or two after that was during ""girls night."" He was the honorary ""waiter"" for our alcohol and was more than welcome to have some. Although I'm mostly over it now, it was a horrible night for him that led to him totally blacking out and projectile vomiting into my eyeball, all over my bed, breaking my shower, etc. And during Christmas, he got blackout and spam called me Christmas night. Ater this, he swore he'd start AA if he couldn't learnt o start moderating his alcohol. After that, it's smooth sailing. I'd like to preface that the only issue I've ever had is with his substance use, in which I honestly know that he loves me and treats me well and that he will follow through with his promises.

We roll around to roughly a week ago on his 21st birthday. I give him spectacular gifts and have fun plans for the following day. I hugh him before he's about to go to a bar with his friends to have a max of two drinks at each bar (there's a maximum of 4 bars in this small college town, especially within walking distance). I reach into his pocket and there it is: a vape that he stole from his frat brother. I confront him, and we get into an argument. However, I confirm with he girls that his addiction isn't something worth breaking up over. I feel pretty alright after getting a second opinion that even now, I agree with. He goes to the bars.

Three hours roll by. I ell asleep in his bed. The door suddenly slams open, and here he comes slumping into the room. He immediately knocks over his television, and upon doing so, crushes the 70 dollar vintage train set I got for his birthday. He's stumbling around like a total drunkard. I'm so upset that he'd betray me in this way, but more so about the 70 dollars instantly going to waste. I'm also a little worried because he'd never been that energetically blackout before, if that makes sense. I put on my jacket and whatnot and run out of the room. all of his fraternity brothers are drunk and confused, especially when he runs out in nothing but underwear after me in -8 degree weather. He grabs onto me on the walkway and is just muttering nonsense. The only things I can make out cohesively enough is that he'll ""die without me"" and ""kill himself if I leave him."" I'm terrified and he refuses to let go of me. I start with whispering clamly but he keeps dragging me back toward the entrance. Some of his brothers are watching and laughing. I text his Big almost complete terrified gibberish with only ""please help me"" and ""get him off of me"" being readable. He finally gets off of me and his brothers let him in. I am a sobbing mess and they simply look over me, telling him about ""woah man, you really outdid yourself"" and stuff like that.

I walk home at 3am in terror because I couldn't even see -- I had taken out my contacts or bed and, in a rush, obviously didn't put them back on. I'm scared there might be other drunkards walking around. Two of his brothers contact me to ask if I'm alright and that it's safe for me to come back, knowing that I had a situation that my dorm was currently taken by a visiting graduated friend. I go back, those two brothers out of the 9 that went out are still drunk but are taking care of both me and him and are pissed at his behavior. I end up sleeping in one of their rooms.

I wake up to loud shouting and laughing by four of the people -- one of them being Brady -- about how funny Aaron was last night -- how he received texts from me, but how harmless the situation actually was. I am so mad and angry. Brady hadn't even asked what the situation was or texted to see what happened. He didn't care, quite frankly. Aaron woke up with a hangover, and upon learning about the situation, is super apologetic. He says he'll start AA right away. He does everything right following this incident. However, at this point, I trust that he loves me and will do what he needs to to keep me.

However, I'm still piping mad at the 7 fraternity brothers that did nothing. I'm mad at the four that stood and watched when I could've been assaulted or could've fallen on the ice and got a concussion. I'm mad at the fact that nobody had the common sense to get him to the state of blackout and consider being remotely sober or it. There's so many intricate details to their behavior afterward when sober that just points to them being selfish, stupid, irresponsible pieces of shit -- because frats are supposed to ""put women first"" and ""protect women."" They made light of the situation, even after finding out from Aaron the full details of what had happened. Even when drunk the two brothers that took care of him saw the seriousness of Aaron's and their brother's state and even apologized for a situation that they had no accountability in. One of them hadn't even gone to the bars with Aaron.

Yes, objectively, things did not go as poorly as they could have. I didn't get assaulted. I didn't end up with a concussion or something. But I felt so betrayed when I saw them laughing and watching when I was calling to them for help. I felt so alone and scared. And their behavior when sober makes me hate everyone except the two nice ones hate them with every fiber of my being, especially Brady.

Apparently Brady had kept buying Aaron drinks when Aaron told him to stop. Arron was already blackout, and Brady bought him six more shots and the strongest drink at a bar. He then went to bed instead of dealing with the situation at all, having gotten extremely drunk himself. Brady failed both of us that night, and I hate him for that. He kept making jokes about it the morning after, and Aaron told me that he had made an announcement of his sobriety to the entire fraternity and explained what happened. Only the two nice guys and Aaron took responsibility. to everyone else, it was ""no big deal"" and he was ""being too hard on himself."" Brady especially kept inviting Aaron over to drink afterwards, and even after two asks from Aaron to apologize to me, he refused, saying he would when he ""next saw me in the house."" Aaron had previously said that I would not be over at the house until god knows when. I received a bullshit excuse literally a week after the incident, but it was just full of excuses of why what happened happened. 

I hate that place and I hate 3/4s of the people there (as it's a decently small chapter on this campus). Everytime he mentions having to do something or I think anything frat related, I'm brought back to that night. And Aaron just today understood that it's no longer about ""us."" It's about them.

I genuinely don't know what to do moving forward. I love Aaron so much and I know nothing similar will happen again, but I don't know how to cope with him being close friends with the people that abandoned me that night and I can't even get a real apology out of any of the seven that failed me. Even sober, they're utter pieces of human filth.

It would be unfair to hate something and the people that takes up the majority of his week. With that night, I lost all respect, likenes, trust, and care for the majority of those people and that place for their irresponsibility both during and after that night. I keep having flashbacks and panic attacks that take me back to that night. The only way I could move past it is for him to eliminate the fraternity from his life entirely, which he's willing to do -- but that would be unfair to him, as that's the only people he is close to on this campus. And the fraternity has somehow ""made him a better person"" and given him ""great opportunities,"" even if all he is is surrounded by womanizers, liars, cheats, addicts, and immature, irresponsible fuck faces, in my humble opinion.

It feels like an ultimatum situation, quite frankly. It would be unfair to force him to sever ties (even though I don't understand why he still couldn't be close friends with literally the four good guys in that place) and isolate him by making him quit the fraternity, but it would also be unfair to both of us for me to hate a major part of himself. I know the easy answer is to break up, but I see a rich and happy future with this man. I just don't know how to disconnect him from the fraternity. 

How do we, or simply I, move forward from this?"

$TRUMP Analysis from  former bank regulator and long-time crypto follower.,OfficialTrumpCoin,1i9x3ox,2025-01-25 16:08:36,6,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OfficialTrumpCoin/comments/1i9x3ox/trump_analysis_from_former_bank_regulator_and/,TrumpDynastyCoin,General,"I want to share my perspective on $TRUMP with you all. I was a risk management bank examiner at the FDIC from 2008 to 2020. I came in after college. 

When Bitcoin started making headlines, I would ask senior examiners what they thought of it and the ambition of the Bitcoin community to ""replace the banking system"" as the community was promising.

Consensus was, since this is not a government backed financial instrument, it is instead a very risky commodity because the government can shut it down (see China for details of a country doing just that).  If there was any threat to the Federal Reserve system or the US's ability to manage inflation, the government would end the currency unless they decided to adopt their own.

Their assessment has been correct thus far. Modern banking is a system of institutions taking deposits and lending them to creditworthy borrowers. None of the crypto coins even touch this function. The only lending going on that I'm aware of in crypto (without fiat conversion) is trustless margin loans.  This means that no one is going to lend to you for your house or your car or your business because they would have to perform trust analysis (credit analysis) that you are good for paying them back.  To this day, crypto is a trustless system. Actual banking is a trustful system, where the repayment capacity of a borrower and the repayment history develops that trust.

Instead, crypto is a highly price-volatile money transfer system. That's it. None of the utility functions or communities create any value (distributable profit) that meaningfully justifies these coins beyond hype pumping. As a result, the crypto that isn't used as a transfer system, are instead casino games where the exchanges are the casinos.

All this being said, I believe that $TRUMP has the power of media in the U.S. and the power of MAGA to force it into government adoption.  I also think that Trump will wisely try to regulatory capture a coin or two, meaning that he will dismiss all other coins and continue to call crypto a fraud, besides the selected coins that he names as legitimate. He has a multi-billion dollar incentive to make his coin one of the regulatory captured cryptocurrencies. Dumping $TRUMP or sitting on the sidelines is a bet that he won't do this.

So far, the senior examiners I worked with have been 100% correct about Bitcoin and crypto. They will still be correct about it if the U.S. government adopts crypto, because that is what they said is lacking to legitimize it as a real currency. For now we are dealing with the equivalent of buying and selling digitized pokemon cards. Trump has the power to change that and he will if it means he and his people stand to make billions (hint, at 80% ownership, it stands to make the Trump dynasty trillions). MMW

So, why do these examiners opinions matter? They have 40+ years evaluating the financial viability of financial institutions. Most people in these subs don't even know that a deposit to a bank is a liability on a bank's balance sheet (a loan from the borrower to the bank). 99% of the crypto community are gamblers but they don't even know what game they are playing. Are you one of them?

Trump can initially bring $TRUMP into the ""digital asset reserves"" and then his family can try to use his crypto-king wealth and MAGA following to copy Elon and appoint future presidents. A line of future presidents can eventually adopt $TRUMP as the U.S. currency. He could also use levers over inflation (such as his tariffs) to destabilize trust in the USD to advance the likelihood of adoption.

The last paragraph is my speculation. It's not a long con. It's Trump saying, ok... congrats Bitcoin, you have proven that crypto is a viable currency. I will take it from here, the first US crypto will have my name and face on it. It is the legitimization of crypto that we have all been anticipating. Place your bets wisely, because all crypto outside of the regulatory captures coins will be devastated."

"[REVIEW] Lacoste polo-sweater, 1/3 zipper sweater & high neck tee",MulebuyFans,1i9wyn3,2025-01-25 16:02:18,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9wyn3,Moist_Demand1052,üìÉReviewüìÉ,"I'll first talk about my favorite, the brown jersey-pole. In my opinion it is a great piece, very versatile, you can wear it either with jeans or with more formal pants, I wear it with nothing underneath and with a feather jacket and I like it, the interior material is comfortable, on the outside it is like a pole but very thick.

The jerseys with a 1/3 zipper, I saw in some Reddit publications that spoke highly of them, they have an old money style that I really like, if I'm honest I can't say anything bad about this garment, but I would like that if you see something wrong tell me, I am dressing it with total confidence and if there is something wrong I would not like that.

The high neck shirt is a little more special, in the aspect that the fit is a little strange in my opinion, I would think that I would stay a little tighter, maybe you like it but I am not wearing it much, maybe it's my body or my perspective. The fabric is fine, it looks like pure cotton.
Everything is TTS, size L, except the green 1/3 zipper, wich is XL.

I have sent everything with Mulebuy together with the other part of my Haul that I published previously, it was a 7kg package and I paid for the shipment 135 USD with free insurance, I think it is the shipment that has arrived the fastest so for the moment everything well with Mulebuy.

Depression is making me so agitated and frustrated every single day. I don't know how to deal with it anymore,therapy,1i9wy0o,2025-01-25 16:01:33,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1i9wy0o/depression_is_making_me_so_agitated_and/,AngryHippo3920,Vent / Rant,"Things were really bad last year. I was living in a slum land, I could barely afford the rent, I was about to end up homeless. In the past several months things have improved significantly. I was able to move to a new place where the rent is affordable, they fix things when they break. I finally have a working shower for crying out loud! Things have improved so much, yet I feel more depressed than ever? I don't understand it and have no clue how to fix it.  I get agitated and frustrated so easily, and it can be over the smallest things. Like today my mom woke me up at 7am to ask me to go to the dollar tree with her. So right there I'm agitated that she woke me up early and that I'm not feeling well enough to go out. I said I'd go with her, but it would have to be after a package that was supposed to come today was delivered. 

I get a text an hour later that my package was delivered in a cluster mailbox. I rush to the mailboxes to get it and there is nothing besides junk mail. I just wanted to scream and cry. Once I'm in this agitated headspace it feels impossible to get out of it. Right now I've done everything in my control as far as finding my package, and you'd think that would be enough for me, but it isn't. I already know this package is lost because that's how it always goes for me when a package is marked delivered but not in my mailbox. I'm also frustrated because the package was a childhood stuffed animal that meant a lot to me. It couldn't have been the box of toothpaste I ordered, could it? It had to be this package. I almost feel like I subconsciously knew it was going to happen because I woke up with really bad anxiety and dread this morning. I tried to suck up my bad feelings and went to the dollar tree with my mom like I told her I would do. When I'm in an agitated state I have a hard to paying attention or focusing on other things. I had forgotten to turn the lights off in my apartment and forgot to grab my purse. Then on our way back a car almost hit me, but my stopped me and warned me. I just said that I don't even care if they run me over at this point. After hours of being in this headspace I realize I'm probably overreacting pretty badly, but I just find it so hard to care in the moment or control my emotions. Therapy isn't working for me, meds don't work for me. I just want to shut my mind off. My mind is just a torture device at this point. "

How Circes vision could be the first step in the formation of The Justice League,DCU_,1i9wwo8,2025-01-25 16:00:01,10,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9wwo8,Aware-Couple-108,Theory,"In Creature Commandos, we see a vision that Circe shows Amanda Waller that all the heroes die at the hands of the Princess and Gorilla Grodd. At the end of the season, it‚Äôs revealed that the vision was true but could have, potentially, been perverted by the Bride killing the Princess. But I believe this vision is gonna play a bigger part in the DCU and could potentially lead to the formation of The Justice League. 

  Let‚Äôs start with Amanda Waller. We do know that Waller is going to play a big role in the DCU, with her even getting her own show. I could see, in the Waller show, Amanda having to deal with not just the fallout of what happened in Creature Commandos but constantly being haunted by those visions given to her by Circe. These visions could lead Waller down a much darker path and leading her to potentially working with Lex Luthor. 
 
   I can see Waller sharing this vision with Lex and him taking it and twisting into his own personal gain where he uses it as excuse to rid the world of Metahumans, once and for all, leading to his campaign to become the next President of the United States, with Waller as his Vice President.  I remember Gunn saying in an interview that meta human population was growing, by the time we see Superman and this could be seen as an issue. I could see the growing number of meta humans and the tension between humans one of the main through lines, as it reaches its boiling point similar in stories like Kingdom Come and Justice League: The Nail.
 
 Because of this rising tension between the human and metahuman/super-powered community, thanks to President Luthor, a new team of heroes form that is strictly outside of the government called The Authority. After an event that involved countless destruction and death, at the hands of The Authority, everyone has now had enough of meta humans and the super powered community which gives Luthor enough ammunition to sign a new act called The Metahuman Protection Act which orders any being with super abilities (Meta, Amazons, Aliens, Magicians, etc.) stepping on American soil are no longer an American citizen and will be forced to relocate. 

Those that don‚Äôt come quietly will either be killed or taken to a secluded super-human prison, located in Gorilla City. With this new act in place, this forces all the remaining superheroes to come together and stop both Luthor and Waller and in this case forming the Justice League. This is just basically the cliff notes of my theory but this is how I believe Circes vision could be the first step into forming The Justice League.

This is perhaps the first big weekend for drag racing this year. Drag racing action will be streaming from the United States, Australia, Bahrain, and Qatar, so there is a lot to look forward to.

Beginning with the United States, the U.S. Street Nationals at Bradenton Motorsports Park just outside Bradenton, Florida, will be the unofficial start to the major racing season in the country. This year it serves as both the second round of the inaugural Drag Illustrated Winter Series for outlaw Pro Mod and the second round of the 2024/2025 Radial Outlaws Racing Series for several radial tire classes. The categories to be contested are Pro Mod, Pro 275, X275, Limited Drag Radial, No Time Shootout, No Time Truck Shootout, Ultra Street, Outlaw 632, Limited 235, and 5.50, 6.50, and 6.50 Index classes.

Additionally, NHRA Summit Racing Series bracket racing is getting started across the country. North of where the U.S. Street Nationals are taking place, the Scorpion E.T. Series will get underway with races 1 and 2 at Gainesville Raceway near Gainesville, Florida. On the opposite side of the country, near Phoenix, Arizona, Team Firebird races 1 and 2 will take place at Firebird Motorsports Park.

Over in Australia, the postponed but long-anticipated NDRC New Year Nitro race will take place at Willowbank Raceway in Willowbank, Queensland. Top fuel dragsters and funny cars will be the main event, while the Aeroflow Sportsman Series also competes over the weekend.

In Bahrain, the third round of the Bahrain Drag Racing Championship will take place at Bahrain International Circuit in Sakhir, Bahrain. The Bahrain1 team will be expected to perform well in the Pro Mod class there.

Finally, in Qatar, Round 3 of the Arabian Drag Racing League will be conducted at the Qatar Racing Club's dragstrip in Doha, Qatar. I'm personally interested in seeing if NHRA Top Fuel driver Shawn Langdon can continue his win streak in the 4.50 Index class there.

**Chapter 10: Blazing spear:**

As Kosma walked back to the courtyard, Jed saw a marker appear on one of the gunships,

¬†

""Hey Kosma... looks like you get to ride in that thing, sure beats walking!"" her face lit up as Jed said that. Kosma started to run excitedly towards the plane when she felt something pulling at her backpack.

¬†

""NO, YOU DON'T!"" said Kalax as Kosma stared back at him, flicking her ears back and giving the captain a glare.

¬†

""It's so damn cute when you do that..."", Jed admitted, which only made Kosma angrier,

¬†

""Shut up!"" she squirmed in Kalax's iron grip as he finally let go, causing Kosma to fall to the ground with a loud thud. It took restraint, but Jed made no comment.

¬†

""The enemy has set up anti-aircraft batteries around the pulse cannon, we have already lost three of our dropships to them,"" Kalax explained as he displayed a holographic map from a projector on his shoulder while the troopers gathered around it. There was a heavy anti-aircraft battery protected by small armor at each corner of the cannon's platform. Kalax pointed to a large road that rose above the jungle, connecting the control center to the position of the anti-orbital gun.

¬†

""We'll take this logistics highway all the way to their position, but if our scouts are right, we should expect very heavy resistance. We only need to take out one of those batteries and our transports can land... AM I CLEAR TROOPERS!"" the troopers quickly replied with a resounding ""YES SIR!"", with a metallic ""clank"" as their left hand slammed against their chest as they performed the Indaran salute.¬† Horror washed over Kosma's face at the thought of having to walk all the way to the pulse cannon, and Kalax only confirmed that the path would be littered with enemies. It would be a long slog.

¬†

""If you want, we can stop here. Doesn't look like any enemies are coming,"" Jed said, seeing how beaten Kosma looked,

¬†

""No, let's just do this... it would be incredibly annoying to try to sleep with the warzone atmosphere all around, I mean, blow up the enemy mothership with the cannon and we win, right?"" she asked with a nervous smile.

¬†

""I really hope this is the end of the level, this seems like a fun place to stay... you know, when there aren't murder-bots everywhere..."", Jed replied as Kosma nodded in agreement.

Kosma followed the group as the troopers chatted among themselves. They might only be simple AIs, but the fact that they were robots made it ironically a little easier for Kosma to pretend they were real. As they walked past a cargo bay full of containers and automated vehicles sitting idle at their stations. Kosma ran quickly to try to activate one of them, but to no avail,

""COME ON!... I really don't want to slog through this on foot. Jed, does a prompt appear to interact with any of these?"" asked Kosma as she hooked a cable from her wrist terminal into one of the trucks and randomly tapped things on the interface.

¬†

""At least you have the robots with you... what's left of them,"" Jed replied with a hint of sadness as Kosma resigned herself to walking to the enemy position. As the huge sliding doors leading to the highway opened with a loud hydraulic hiss, Kalax turned to look at Kosma,

¬†

""Trailblazer, I have some very distressing news,"" his tone was incredibly dark and made her fear what information he was about to give her,

¬†

""Y...yes?"" she asked out of pure reflex, though she knew he would continue his dialog anyway,

¬†

""I know how much it meant to you to walk over 8000 meters of bridge, but I ordered APCs to carry us as it will be safer,"" the Captain explained ironically, Kosma tilted her head to the side as she imagined the non-existent mocking grin on his mouthless face. His eyes, however, managed to express the joking tone as he pointed at a pair of incoming Sadurian defense force transports,

¬†

""Son of a..."" Kosma exclaimed, her face lighting up as she watched the transports descend before them, dropping a pair of six-wheeled APCs before flying away. The boxy vehicles were covered in angular armor, the logo of the 118th Battalion stamped on the side next to the vehicles' serial numbers. As the doors opened, she noticed that the transports had room for a gunner, a driver, and eight passengers.

They could see the battle raging throughout the facility, with the defense turrets on the control building shooting down enemy dropships and squadrons of defense drones fighting some kind of enemy equivalent. Still hopelessly outnumbered, the defenses would at least hold the line until they shot down the mothership. Deep down, however, Kosma and Jed knew that the battle was nothing more than a skybox, albeit a convincing one.

The APCs had been delivered with just enough troops to fill every seat, including hers and Kalax's. He turned to Kosma and pointed to the vehicle on the left,

""Get on the turret of the rampart,"" the captain ordered as Kosma boarded the vehicle, relief washing over her. She knew they would have to fight through a bunch of enemies to get to the other side, but at least it would not necessarily be easier. The rampart APCs would make it faster, especially if she didn't have to drive. The interior was a bit cramped, but that was to be expected from a military transport, Kosma was just glad to have a comfortable padded seat.

The moment she got into the vehicle, the camera zoomed in as Kosma got into the gunner's seat and stared at the controls, unsure what to do, when a popup appeared with the controls for Jed.

¬†

""Uhhh... yeah, because of course I can operate military hardware without training..."" as she spoke, Jed tested the controls, her hands automatically reaching for a joystick at her side and pressing a button that lowered a screen showing a camera view of the turret.

¬†

""It says... I can transform the weapon?"" Jed said a little confused as he pressed the middle mouse button. The APC's weapon rotated, transforming into something shorter but wider as Jed fired a large burst of blue energy bolts at it, which spread out in a cone pattern. Switching back to its original mode, the barrel lengthened and the weapon's struts retracted, making it appear thinner as ventilation slits opened on the sides. This mode fired a concentrated burst of energy, presumably designed to take out armored targets, while the other mode was designed to hit groups of smaller enemies.

¬†

""Now that's weird..."" said Jed, switching between modes, firing at lampposts and inactive driverless vehicles to test the weapon.

¬†

""Jed... get your hands off that keyboard. I always wanted to fire one of those things!"", Kosma excitedly fired the weapon, riddling a nearby car with holes from the dispersal mode, then firing a concentrated blast at the engine, causing it to erupt in a fiery explosion,

¬†

""YESSSH!"" Kosma exclaimed with a sadistic grin, feeling like she could take on anything with this turret,

¬†

""Hey psycho, when you are ready to go give the word,"" Jed playfully replied, making Kosma frown, she tried to look at the camera but could feel it was somehow outside the vehicle.

¬†

""Well, let's go... I want to see what this thing does to the robots!"" she made the turret face forward as Jed pressed the interaction button to close the tutorial popup. Shortly thereafter, a female robot voice exclaimed

¬†

""Next stop, anti-orbital cannon!"", the transports began to move forward, side by side. The APC was driven by a slightly smaller and thinner trooper with a less angular design and a vaguely feminine shape.

¬†

""What the hell? Who's driving?"" asked Jed, slightly confused.

¬†

""Another trooper?"" Kosma replied as she moved the turret from side to side, scanning for enemies.

¬†

""Why would they make female and male robots?"" wondered Jed aloud.

¬†

""Originally they all had the same voice, but the support troopers were made smaller and with lighter armor to fit better on vehicles and be more mobile, the soldiers kept calling them female troopers soo... on the next versions they just gave them a girly voice, pretty silly if you ask me,"" she explained while trying to adjust the turret seat to a comfortable position.

¬†

""It probably helps morale, she sounds kind of cute!"" said Jed, oblivious to the jealous look Kosma shot at the driver.

¬†

""JED! ARE YOU HORNY FOR A PIECE OF MILITARY HARDWARE?"" yelled Kosma as she poked her head out of the turret hatch.

¬†

""I just said she looks cute, I can't even see what she looks like from this angle... Get back inside, I see something approaching!"", Kosma grumbled as she got back inside and closed the hatch. Seeing that a group of heavy walkers and spider-bots had set up a roadblock, she quickly opened fire, Kalax's transports following shortly after.

¬†

""DON'T CHANGE SUBJECT ON ME, BOY!"" a very jealous Kosma shouted as she blasted the roadblock with the turret.

¬†

""Can we discuss this when we're not in combat!"", Jed replied, starting to raise his voice, he didn't want Kosma to get killed over such a stupid argument.

¬†

¬†""Relax, this thing is bolt-proof, ironically it feels like playing a video game. I'm not really mad,"" she said in a cheerful tone, easing Jed's worries, although she was a bit jealous of this driver-trooper.

¬†

They spread out easily to take care of groups of small robots, adjusting their spread pattern based on the distance to the targets. Sending shards of metal everywhere as their power cores exploded violently on impact. One of the heavy walkers locked its weapons on Kosma's APC, firing large bolts of energy into the armor. The attack shook the transport, nearly knocking Kosma out of her seat and making her regret that she hadn't used her seatbelt, something she quickly set about correcting. However, the attack only managed to dent the plating and take a small portion of the vehicle's health bar.

She fired back using the turret's armor piercing mode, which didn't seem to be very effective against the machine's thick front plating, sending sparks and a burst of plasma on impact as the bolts dissipated against it.

¬†

""Aim for its ocular sensor to stun it, if you have bad aim, shoot for the legs,"" the captain advised over the comms as Kosma struggled to aim the weapon while taking enemy fire.

¬†

""Need help?"", Jed offered.

¬†

""No, no... otherwise I'll never learn"", after a few seconds of fiddling with the control joystick she managed to blow three legs off the walker, causing it to collapse to the ground and burst into flames shortly after.

¬†

""NICE SHOT!"" Jed and Kalax shouted simultaneously, making Kosma dizzy.

¬†

A Sadurian gunship, followed by a pair of enemy fighter drones, began to fly parallel to the transports,

¬†

""Get these things off me, sir!"" the pilot yelled over the comms as Kosma turned the turret and began guiding the targets and peppering them with disperse mode.

¬†

""WHAT ARE YOU DOING P-26!? YOU ARE APPROACHING AN ANTI-AIRCRAFT BATTERY!"" By the time the pilot heard Kalax's warning, it was too late as a missile hit the gunship in one of its engines. It spun out of control as it barreled toward the bridge, Kosma's APC narrowly avoiding it. The gunship's fuel tank exploded as it hit the pavement.

""Damn... no survivors, don't stop,"" Kalax said in his usual stern voice as the drones turned their attention to the transports and began to follow them.

The drones fired salvos of rockets at the APCs as Kosma swung the turret to face them. She heard one of the missiles explode right next to the vehicle, causing it to lurch sideways as the suspension did its best to absorb the shock.

¬†

""AAAHHH!"" Kosma exclaimed as the jolt made her head hit the screen hard, shattering the glass. Had she not been wearing her helmet, she probably would have broken her nose. At least the screen was still working.

She alternated between intercepting the missiles and firing at the drones themselves, with Jed helping her aim. One of the drones crashed into the jungle as she managed to inflict critical damage, while the other rammed in front of the transports and into a truck loaded with energy cells, causing it to explode in an azure blast of energy and electric arcs that temporarily disrupted the vehicles' electronics. The drivers stopped immediately,

¬†

""DAMN IT!"" yelled Kalax as he stared at the massive gap created by the explosion, as a voice came over a nearby PA speaker as a security camera stared at the APCs,

¬†

""I would appreciate it if you would stop damaging my facility more than the invaders! However, I know a way you can cross, let me angle the solar panels,"" the voice belonged to the Indaran technician monitoring their progress from the control facility. Soon gaps opened in the ground at the sides of the road and large photovoltaic panels appeared, angled toward the transports with one side raised toward the abyss.

¬†

""Do they want us to..."" said Kosma in a worried voice, noticing that the solar panels were wide enough to fit the entire APC,

¬†

""YOU HEARD THE MAN! PUNCH IT!"" shouted Kalax in a commanding voice, but the vehicles didn't move an inch. Meanwhile, Kosma saw more enemy drones approaching from the front and prepared herself,

¬†

""Sir... are you suffering from suicidal impulses?"" the driver of the captain's APC replied in a condescending tone.

¬†

""KOSMA! GET YOUR TROOPER OUT OF THE DRIVER'S SEAT AND TAKE OVER!"", Kalax yelled as she heard shifting noises and troopers complaining over the comms,

¬†

""SIR! SEEK A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL! WHAT ARE YOU DOING!??!"", Kosma heard the driver protest as she got out of the turret seat and made her way to her driver,

¬†

""Uhh... can you please go to the turret?... why am I even talking to this thing..."" she said, staring at the round face of her driver, when to her surprise the trooper answered, mainly thanks to Jed pressing the ""change seat"" button prompt,

¬†

""Ooo, I get to shoot the bad guys now!"" the trooper exclaimed excitedly as she got to the turret. Meanwhile, Kalax was having trouble with his own driver,

""Hey Trailblazer, just for the record, I would never hit a real woman,"" Kalax said over the comms before she heard a loud ""CLANG"" as the captain promptly slapped the trooper to take her place. Kosma could hear Jed laughing audibly over her head,

""ALLRIGHT, YOU TAKE THE LEFT, I TAKE THE RIGHT!"" Kalax ordered as his APC barreled towards one of the solar panels, Kosma staring at the wheels and pedals a bit confused,

¬†

""Jed... do you mind? It's been a long time since I've driven anything with wheels..."" the nervousness in her voice was palpable as the enemy drones were already firing missiles at her vehicle. Fortunately, the soldier on the turret was doing a good job of intercepting most of them,

¬†

""Absolutely!"" said Jed after a quick glance at the popup for the driving controls before accelerating towards the improvised ramp,

¬†

""CAPTAIN YOU ARE THE WORST OFFICER I'VE SERVED WITH!"" shouted Kalax's former driver as her APC flew over the cap, Kosma's soon to follow. She felt the suspension bounce violently on contact with the ground as Jed lost control of the vehicle and veered toward a gap in the bridge's walls.

She screamed in terror as the transport plunged into the jungle below, Jed watching in horror as the APC crashed into some jagged rocks. For a few seconds, the camera hovered over the wrecked vehicle, the last checkpoint loaded as she was about to jump the gap,

¬†

""Kosma... I..."", Jed said as Kosma was about to tear off the steering wheel from the sheer stress of hyperventilating,

¬†

""I know Jed, I know,"" Kosma said with a deep, long sigh, ""No matter how many times it happens, it's still horrible... let's... LET'S DO THIS!"" she exclaimed, trying to keep her brave face on. She knew Jed understood her pain and stress, but it was something she mostly did to trick herself into moving forward without having constant breakdowns.

¬†

""Are you sure you want me to drive?"" asked Jed hesitantly as a missile hit the back of the APC, knocking Kosma to the ground,

¬†

""YES, YOU IDIOT!"" she shouted as Jed regained control and heard Kala's ex-driver repeat her voice line as her vehicle jumped with him following through the left solar panel. This time he made the jump, this time maintaining control of the vehicle as they barreled down the highway. Dodging enemy attacks as the trooper in the gunner's seat did her best to keep enemy drones off their tail.

¬†

While Jed hadn't exactly kept the APC intact, it was still running, and Kosma herself remained in one piece. They were almost at the anti-orbital cannon. A gigantic piece of artillery with a rectangular barrel the size of a skyscraper, secured by three pairs of struts along its length. It stood on a square pyramid-like base surrounded by fortifications that had been taken over by the enemy.

Kosma saw a pair of vanguard units at the base of the pyramid's access ramp. Their gunner was busy targeting something behind them, so Jed simply accelerated toward one of them. As was probably scripted, Kalax ran for the other, and the vanguard eliminators were crushed under the weight of the armored vehicles,

""WOOOHOOOOO!!! That was cathartic, this thing is unstoppable!"" shouted Kosma as she felt the last pair of wheels crush the robot,

¬†

""You... really don't want to know how much health we have left..."", Jed said with a hint of concern in his voice as he stopped abruptly in front of a row of pylons along their path,

¬†

""EVERYONE GET OUT OF THE TRANSPOT, WE MUST FOLLOW ON FOOT!"", Kalax shouted as the troopers started to get out of both vehicles. Reluctantly, Kosma got out of the driver's seat as she stared in shock at the sorry state of her APC. The few pieces of armor that hadn't fallen off were riddled with holes and dents, blackened from the fire and explosions, one of the rear wheels was missing entirely, and the headlights had been shot out. On the other hand, Kala's vehicle was spotless, as if it had just rolled off the assembly line,

¬†

""JED YOU ARE A HORRIBLE DRIVER!"" exclaimed Kosma as she pointed with both hands at her barely functioning ride,

¬†

""Unlike us, his was probably indestructible... I got us here in one piece, didn't I?"" replied Jed,

¬†

""That's... technically correct, when you rammed a rock through the cabin, I was only crushed by it, but not split in half,"" Kosma replied cynically,

¬†

""Please don't joke about such things,"" Jed replied in a hurt voice, feeling extremely guilty about the accident,

¬†

""Look, it's either cynical humor or crying... these batteries aren't going to blow themselves up, let's just get this damn level over with... I need a very long shower,"" Kosma said, trying to summon up the courage for the coming battle, as one of the Troopers pointed to something in the sky,

¬†

""INCOMING!"" he shouted as Jed saw red bullet-shaped symbols appear below them, causing Kosma to immediately move out of the way while Kalax pushed one of his troopers out of one of the circles. A single large shell split into a few dozen fragments mid-flight, landing exactly where the circles had predicted, blowing up the APCs and taking out a couple of troopers,

¬†

""YOU HIT ME IN THE FACE AND DESTROYED MY VEHICLE! YOU ARE THE WORST OFFICER EVER!"" one of the drivers yelled at Kalax as he ran for cover,

¬†

""HAD I LET YOU KEEP DRIVING WE WOULD ALL HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, NOW SHUT UP AND RUN TROOPER!"", Kalax replied,

¬†

""Can you see the icons too?"" asked Jed as Kosma froze in shock after a grenade exploded a few meters away from her,

¬†

""WHAT ICONS!?"" she yelled in confusion,

¬†

""The game will tell me where the shells will land, just give me full control, even if I make you stand still, okay?"" said Jed as he saw another set of circles appear, causing her to move slightly to the side. Kosma saw the grenades explode around her again, only a few meters away from turning her into red mist,

¬†

""Okay... that's not scary at all..."", Kosma said with a nervous laugh as Jed pushed her forward.

¬†

""Ma'am, I just wanted to let you know that I do not blame you for losing my vehicle..."", Kosma's former driver said in the sleepiest voice her voice modulator could produce. Kosma completely ignored her, having other priorities at the moment.

¬†

At the top of the pyramid, around the massive rotating base of the anti-orbital gun, the enemy had placed AA batteries at the four corners of the structure. The anti-aircraft weapons were large three-legged machines that bore a resemblance to heavy walkers, except they replaced the heavy repeating blasters with an array of missile tubes that fired at incoming security drones from the facility. Protected by dozens of spider-bots, the Heavy Walkers' vanguard units and battle drones, along with transports flying overhead, made Kosma wish she had stayed in the underwater facility.

Running from cover to cover, dodging mortar rounds, Kosma already felt defeated and braced herself for another long series of deaths,

¬†

""Jed... do you have a plan? because I doubt 16 troopers are going to do much against all of... THAT!"" she exclaimed as Jed made her dodge an incoming burst of enemy fire from a walker that took out a trooper behind her, ""15 troopers..."" she said amidst panting,

¬†

""I have a plan, but you won't like it, you've played your share of video games, right?"" asked Jed, struggling to concentrate on dodging the grenades and the conversation at the same time,

¬†

""Yeah..."" she nodded confused,

¬†

""You know when you get frustrated from dying too often and just run past the enemies to complete the objective?"" he asked as Kosma took a split second to give him an incredulous look,

¬†

""HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DESTROY THE AA BATTERIES WITHOUT GETTING ANNIHILATED BY EVERYTHING IN THE SURROUNDING!"" she shouted as a piece of shrapnel clipped one of the tips of her tail, making her squeal,

¬†

""Those mortars are relentlessly targeting you, and if you don't stop to attack something and spam your dodge move, we can just trick them into bombing their own robots!"" shouted Jed as a stray shot hit Kosma in the chest, her armor managing to absorb most of the impact,

¬†

""Ouch... good, now focus!"" said Kosma, crushing her last vial of regen-gel and shaking her head at how rude that came out, ""I mean it sounds like a decent plan, but enough chatter... let's do this!¬†

¬†

With her thruster-assisted dodge and rocket boots, she quickly outpaced Kalax and the troopers. Running into the middle of the enemy formation, Jed had them running in circles for a moment that felt like an eternity to Kosma as energy bolts came at her from all directions. Once she was surrounded, Jed waited for the markers of the next mortar strike and let her boost jump out of the way, the explosions from the barrage pushing her further.

She landed awkwardly, belly up, with burning robot parts raining all around her. She used her back-mounted thrusters to immediately get back up and continue her mad dash for the AA tripod,

¬†

""JED, I HATE YOU SO MUCH!"" she shouted as she parried a blow from a vanguard unit's blade before lunging backwards to see it torn apart by a blast from a heavy walker meant for her. She threw herself into the air again, and in a clearing in the jungle below, she caught a glimpse of the machine responsible for the mortars. Like its AA cousin, it was clearly based on the Heavy Walker, but thicker to support the weight of its massive armament. It had ground anchors that pinned it to the ground, presumably to keep it from tipping over from the recoil of firing the weapon.

¬†

""TRUST THE PROCESS!"" he replied, letting her slide right under the AA battery as the enemies swarmed around her. She heard the mortar fire and, sword in hand, dashed out from under the tripod. Skewering a spider-bot through its optical sensor, and fueled by adrenaline, she lifted the blade with the inert robot still impaled. She planted one foot on the ground and used the thrusters on her other boot to spin herself. Kosma gained enough momentum to slam the spider-bot into a vanguard eliminator, completely destroying its upper body along with her blade.

¬†

""KOSMA, THAT WAS THE COOLEST THING I'VE SEEN YOU DO!"" cheered Jed as he carried her out of the blast zone. She couldn't help but look back at the clustered group of enemies before the cluster shell rained death upon them.¬† The charge from the mortar rounds combined with the rockets in the tubes of the AA battery to create an explosion so massive that the reflective visor of Kosma's suit lowered to protect her eyes,

¬†

""Yep, that's what I was going for,"" Kosma bluffed, not wanting to admit that her blade had gotten stuck in the spider-bot's eye and she was shaking it because she couldn't get it out, the same went for her missile boot, which accidentally went off and sent her spinning out of control. And Jed pretended to believe her.

¬†

""STELLAR JOB KOSMA!"" she heard Kalax say over the radio,

¬†

As she set off to clear the remaining enemies from the position, the troopers had already caught up to her and opened fire on a group of spiders as they rushed the position,

¬†

""I WANT THAT ARTILLERY PIECE CLEARED FROM THE FACE OF IRUX!"" the captain ordered, putting a pair of fingers to the side of his head as he took cover from an incoming mortar barrage. Soon after, a gunship fired a volley of missiles at the mortar-bot, causing it to explode in a blast that knocked down the surrounding trees with its shockwave.

A large group of gunships and air transports, escorted by security drones, approached. They unleashed a dizzying amount of bolt fire and missiles, utterly destroying the few enemy aircraft patrolling the area. Kosma felt relief wash over her as the small fleet landed around them,

¬†

""Cavalry's here, Captain!"" a female soldier's voice, probably the pilot of one of the transports, exclaimed excitedly as a platoon of robot soldiers disembarked from the dropships. As the transports unloaded two heavy tanks, the ground shook as they separated from the aircraft,

¬†

""85 TONS OF NAROKAN ENGINEERING WITH A MINIATURIZED INDARAN PULSE CANNON!"" said Kalax, his fists on his hips, staring proudly at the armored behemoths. Then he wrapped his arms around the shoulders of the troopers originally assigned to drive their APCS,

¬†

""Ladies, we weren't able to assign drivers to the bulwarks, so I guess it's you,"" he explained as the troopers' faces literally lit up, before giving the captain an Indaran salute and rushing to the tanks' hatches,

¬†

""I went out of my way to order them without drivers, I know how those things get attached to their vehicles... let the troopers know and I will skin you alive and turn you into a fur coat to remind me of my days among the organic..."" the captain said in a somber tone, poking his finger into Kosma's chest plate,

¬†

""Awwww.... has a sweet spot!"" said Kosma as she brought her palms to her chest,

¬†

""Hell, I'd have a hot spot for those things too....have you seen her hips!"" she snapped her head at the camera the moment he said that, going so far as to raise the visor on her helmet to make sure he saw her scowl,

¬†

""If I could reach through the screen, I'd knock those stupid glasses right off your face..."" she muttered angrily,

¬†

""Kosma... we both know something completely different would happen if you could reach through the screen,"" Jed replied with a grin that Kosma couldn't see but felt in his voice, making her laugh nervously as she lowered the reflective visor so he wouldn't see her blush,

¬†

A robot with bulkier armor and a distinctive pauldron with the insignia of a planet orbited by two moons, probably indicating his rank as a lieutenant, approached the captain and saluted,

¬†

""Sir, we'll take it from here!"" the lieutenant shouted before turning to bark orders to his platoon to storm the remaining enemy positions.

¬†

Kosma saw a pair of engineers enter the pyramidal structure, and Kalax stopped her from following by extending his arm in front of her,

¬†

""Yes, I know the control room is in there, but if you fire that thing from inside... you won't be able to see the fireworks,"" the captain calmly explained as a broad smile formed on Kosma's face,

""Ohhoho no way.... NO WAY!"" she exclaimed excitedly as the struts along the barrel of the weapon disengaged. The entire structure vibrated as the massive pulse cannon aimed itself at the enemy mothership with a mighty mechanical roar. An amber glow spread through the cannon, emitting a low hum as unfathomable amounts of energy flowed into it, filling the air with static.¬† The captain looked at Kosma, his face projecting a simplified smiling emoticon hologram as he removed his wrist-mounted terminal,

¬†

""Say, do you want to do the honors?"" he said in the friendliest tone she'd ever heard him use, while handing Kosma the wrist terminal, which showed the hologram of a large red button,

¬†

""I DO!"", Kosma grabbed the device and hovered her finger over the button. Climbing onto a wrecked heavy walker to make sure she had the best possible angle, she turned to face the camera and raised the visor,

¬†

""Hey, I couldn't have done this without you... would you like to do the honors?"" said Kosma as a prompt to press the interaction button flashed on the screen,

¬†

""No way, you heard the man, he wants you to do it,"" Jed replied, surprised by Kosma's gesture, knowing how much firing powerful weapons meant to her. He couldn't possibly deny her the chance to fire the mother of all directed energy weapons,

¬†

""We do it at once, when I say fire, we both press it,"" she took a deep breath and looked at the enemy mothership,

¬†

""THREE, TWO, ONE... FIRE!"" they shouted as she placed her finger on the button while Jed placed his on the interaction button. Rings of energy shot from the cannon's body as a sphere of pure energy formed at its tip for a second before unleashing its power. A golden beam of concentrated pulse energy shot from the mighty weapon as it tore through the skies of Irux at the speed of light. Causing a cataclysmic explosion of amber light that split the enemy ship in half and sent it plummeting to the oceans below.

The shockwave from the explosion took a few seconds to reach the island, shaking the leaves of every tree in the jungle and causing Kosma's ears to flap in the wind as she removed her helmet,

¬†

""WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!,"" Kosma cheered alongside the troopers as the enemy units began to shut down after losing the control signal from the battleship. While the vanguard eliminators were independent enough to function without the control signal, they had no choice but to surrender as they were outnumbered and outgunned by the Sadurian defense forces.

¬†

She took the liberty of stealing a working blade from one of the captured vanguard units and scavenging for some regen-gel to heal her tail before hopping on a gunship to take her back to the control center,

¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶ was intense, I don‚Äôt know how it looked from the screen but‚Ä¶ damn I felt that shockwave go through me‚Äù, she said while staring at the tropical landscape from the window of the gunship,

¬†

‚ÄúI bet it was way cooler in person, you were incredible back there‚Äù, Jed complimented as he sighed in relief that Kosma was finally safe, when her intercom buzzed to life,

¬†

‚ÄúKosma, land on my carrier in orbit, we have to‚Ä¶‚Äù, Kalax was cut off as Kosma deactivated her intercom, and simply enjoyed the view as they flew her to the landing pad where she had parked her ship,

¬†

‚ÄúJed, if you don‚Äôt mind, I will put off adventures for a few days and relax here‚Ä¶ its beautiful, and all to myself‚Äù, Kosma said as she gave Jed a tired smile,

¬†

‚ÄúAbsolutely, it will be nice to put off the madness for a few days‚Ä¶ or weeks. Didn‚Äôt you say something about stealing food and candles? Maybe we could watch a movie together, I have to show you human science fiction‚Äù, said Jed excited about what she would think,

¬†

""It will be nice not to be torn to pieces for a change... when you get off I will take a looooong shower, raid the cafeteria and tomorrow I will steal a boat and go to the beach!"" she smiled excitedly as she laid out her plan,

¬†

""Sounds great, see you tomorrow Kosma, sorry about... all those deaths,"" Jed replied in a slightly sad tone as Kosma sat at the edge of the landing pad, just like when they came to the comms array,

¬†

""I'd still be having a nervous breakdown on Octanor Station if it wasn't for you, goodbye Jed"", Kosma said and waved at him before Jed closed the game and went on with the rest of his day, but not without taking some time to do some drawings of Kosma's journey in his sketchbook.

Analysis from former bank regulator and long time crypto follower.,trumpcoin,1i9wrjt,2025-01-25 15:53:53,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/trumpcoin/comments/1i9wrjt/analysis_from_former_bank_regulator_and_long_time/,TrumpDynastyCoin,,"I want to share my perspective on $TRUMP with you all.  I was a risk management bank examiner at the FDIC from 2008 to 2020.  I came in after college.  When Bitcoin started making headlines, I would ask senior examiners what they thought of it and the ambition of the Bitcoin community to ""replace the banking system"" as they would call it.

Consensus was, this is not a government backed financial instrument. It is a risky commodity because the government can shut it down (see China for details of a country doing just that) if there was any threat to the Federal Reserve system or the US's ability to manage inflation, the government would end the currency unless they decided to adopt their own.

Their assessment has been correct thus far. Modern banking is a system of institutions taking deposits and lending them to creditworthy borrowers.  None of the crypto coins even touch this function.  The only lending going on that I'm aware of in crypto (without fiat conversion) is trustless margin loans, meaning that no one is going to lend to you for your house or your car or your business because they would have to trust analysis that you are good for paying you back, and crypto is a trustless system.  Actual banking is a trustful system, where the repayment capacity of a borrower and the repayment history develops that trust.

Today, crypto is a highly price-volatile money transfer system.  That's it.  None of the utility functions or communities create any value (distributable profit) that meaningfully justifies these coins beyond hype pumping.  They are all casino games where the exchanges are the casinos.

That being said, I believe that $TRUMP has the power of media in the U.S. and the power of MAGA to back it.  I also think that Trump will wisely try to regulatory capture a coin or two, meaning that he will dismiss all other coins and continue to call crypto a fraud, besides the selected coins that he names as legitimate.   He has a multi-billion dollar incentive to make his coin one of the regulatory captured cryptocurrencies.  Dumping $TRUMP or sitting on the sidelines is a bet that he won't do this.   

So far, the senior examiners I worked with have been 100% correct about Bitcoin and crypto.  They will still be correct about it if the U.S. government adopts crypto, because that is what they said is lacking to legitimize it as a real currency.  For now we are dealing with the equivalent of buying and selling digitized pokemon cards.  Trump has the power to change that and he will if it means he and his people stand to make billions (hint, at 80% ownership, it stands to make the Trump dynasty trillions).  MMW

So, why do these examiners opinions matter?  They have 40+ years evaluating the financial viability of financial institutions.  Most people in these subs don't even know that a deposit to a bank is a liability on a bank's balance sheet (a loan from the borrower to the bank).  99% of the crypto community are gamblers but they don't even know what game they are playing.  Are you one of them?

Trump can initially bring $TRUMP into the ""digital asset reserves"" and then his family can try to use his crypto-king wealth and MAGA following to copy Elon and appoint future presidents.  A line of future presidents can eventually adopt $TRUMP as the U.S. currency.   He could also use levers over inflation (such as his tariffs) to destabilize trust in the USD to advance the likelihood of adoption.  

The last paragraph is my speculation.  It's not a long con.  It's Trump saying, ok... congrats Bitcoin, you have proven that crypto is a viable currency.  I will take it from here, the first US crypto will have my name and face on it.  It is the legitimization of crypto that we have all been anticipating.  Place your bets wisely, because all crypto outside of the regulatory captures coins will be devastated.

In my opinion it is a great piece, very versatile, you can wear it either with jeans or with more formal pants, 1 wear it with nothing underneath and with a feather jacket and I like it, the interior material is comfortable, on the outside it is like a pole but very thick.

The jerseys with a 1/3 zipper, I saw in some Reddit publications that spoke highly of them, they have an old money style that I really like, if I'm honest I can't say anything bad about this garment, but I would like that if you see something wrong tell me, I am dressing it with total confidence and if there is something wrong I would not like that.

The high neck shirt is a little more special, in the aspect that the fit is a little strange in my opinion, I would think that I would stay a little tighter, maybe you like it but I am not wearing it much, maybe it's my body or my perspective. The fabric is fine, it looks like pure cotton.
Everything is TTS, size L, except the green 1/3 zipper, wich is XL.

""Hello, I was a short-term missionary (volunteer) recruited to the U.S. East Coast, Class of 2013. And I will tell you the reality of what it was like being a volunteer there for a year (though I ran away after 6 months).

**The Good News Corp is founded by Ock Soo Park, the leader of the Good News Mission Church.**

While I was in New York as a volunteer, I saw another volunteer turning psychotic and crazy because the church told him that he had to ""change his personality"" (essentially to break your heart to be obedient). He was treated like a psychotic, assaulted by imprisonment, and the pastor told said that God would solve his psychosis.

**The average sleeping hours for short-term (volunteers) are 4 hours**, the pastor's wives only have about 3 hours. That's why there are a lot of accidents while driving. Why? If you go from New York to Miami or Canada, it takes 36 hours by car, so most Americans use a plane. But except for New York pastors, the rest of American pastors do not have the luxury to do so. They'd have to be in a cramped car/bus and the pastor and his wife would drive in two shifts, not sleeping nor eating in the car for 36 hours.¬†

**They take away your passports and visas**, in case of people running away. **Manhattan pastor** is in charge of US East Coast volunteers. When I told him I wanted to leave, he slapped me on the cheek, grabbed me by my hair, and said, ""I'm hitting you and you still don't know what you're doing wrong!"" He told me that the church was close with NYPD and that I wouldn't be able to get away, and that I had signed a one year contract as a volunteer.

I wanted to begin a formal investigation, but I didn't want to waste money on the trial, and just left a record of the incident at the Korean embassy there. The embassy directly told me that a lot of Korean parents are asking for help because of the organization, and as of 2014, the atmosphere was actually rough. If there was another incident, the church was warned that the embassy could no longer give away visas to Good News Corp students.

If you ever think about going as a volunteer, please remember to take:

1. Recorder (secretly rechargeable)
2. Diary (If you hear abusive language, threats, or strange doctrines, it is intended to be written- diary is legally recognized as 'evidence' in the United States)
3. Two passport photos under the shoe insole + local money of about 200,000 won
4. A piece of paper with the address of the local embassy
5. As for an interpreter at the police station.""

Two men enter, one man leaves. That was my desire with this game. 1v1 e-sports are dead outside of fightan, and I wanted to make a 1v1 strategy game that looks like Chess, but adds a whole layer of modern strategy game mechanics on top of it.

I thought this game would only have niche appeal, and have been working on this as an on again off again hobby project for over 3 years, but after the 2k upvotes and reddit award I got it was a huge wake up call that I need to do something to get this game made.

This game is still a work in progress, in particular, at the time of this writing, the Evil Black army has been signfificantly reworked and untested, and because of the complexities of being a SSI recipient in the United States, I'm still trying to figure out how this project crowdfunded, get the permission of certain bands to use their music as background music for Youtube videos, as many of their tracks haven't been DMCAed on Youtube for years and years.

I am an elder god of the internet, nearly 40 years old, grew up on Quake and Brood war, and formerly had a widespread reputation on the internet known as the Administrator of Hell, the webmaster of www.oddwebsite.com, which you can find in the wayback machine, if you want to see some legendary shitposting, but I can't reactivate it for four reasons. The entire site was dependent on flash which has been deprecated for security issues as it's too powerful, it would take one DMCA from Nintendo to knock out all their chiptune music and knock half the site out, I can't afford hosting, and I am clueless to how modern HTML works. 

I made a career pivot to becoming a paid moderator for MLG, where they contacted me, and asked me if I was really Zanno, because I didn't act like I did on oddwebsite, and I explained to them professional gaming is one of my passions and I take it very seriously. Then I made the second most popular 1v1 map in Halo 3, Greenhouse, but it was before the era of Twitch streaming and no one ever remembers the second most popular thing, so it has been lost to history. During the Halo 3 era, it was agreed within the community, Octagon was a test of aim, and not much else, while Greenhouse and its sister maps that used the MLG Forge 1v1 ruleset and item layout was a scaled down version of the MLG ruleset and was for serious tryhards.

I encourage you to post anything you want in my sub that follows the rules of my sub, reddit rules, and United States law. While I am new to running a reddit sub, I am not new to running forums, so I am going be a based moderator who will be totally chill unlike other mods who just clamp down on the slightest silly thing or anything tangential to the topic of their sub."
"Need Help - CPA Didn't File Forms 8621 and 8938 with My 1040 Last Year, Confused",tax,1i9wnxu,2025-01-25 15:49:28,0,0.5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/1i9wnxu/need_help_cpa_didnt_file_forms_8621_and_8938_with/,Icy_Albatross7659,,"I recently discovered that my cross-border CPA failed to include Form 8621 (for PFICs) and Form 8938  in my 2023 US tax return (Form 1040 + NY state tax return). I'm trying to figure out the best way to fix this and would love your advice.

# Background

* I'm a Canadian citizen living in the US, and I became a US tax resident in 2023.
* I have a Canadian investment account that peaked at \~$57k USD in 2023, with \~$38.3k USD in PFICs (Canadian ETFs VFV and VEQT) at year-end.
* In 2023, the PFICs generated \~528 USD in income/dividends and there are \~$5.1k USD in unrealized capital gains since inception as of EOY 2023. The unrealized capital gains have continued to grow to \~17k USD.
* My total foreign assets exceeded the $50k threshold for Form 8938, but I was only aware of the FBAR requirement, which I filed.

# Tax Filing

* I provided a cross-border CPA with T3 tax slips and Canadian Trust info for the dividends I earned from the PFICs. I previously had them file my 2022 tax returns for Canada and the US.
* They reported the income/dividends as income on my 1040 but didn't file Forms 8621 or 8938. They didn't report any of the unrealized gains from the PFICs (VFV + VEQT). They also filed a Form 1116 for Foreign Tax Credit.
* The CPA firm never mentioned PFICs, Form 8621, or Form 8938, even though they prepared my Canadian and US taxes for 2022 and mentioned I would become a US tax resident in 2023.
* I filed an FBAR for all my foreign accounts in 2023 after they mentioned it would be needed.
* I was invoiced \~1k USD for ‚Äúpreparing 2023 CDN & US personal income tax returns for one state and employment income only"" and paid extra for ""preparing 2023 CDN & US personal income tax returns for investment income.‚Äù

# Questions

1. **How Do I Fix This?**
   * Should I file a 1040-X for my 2023 and include a letter explaining my situation? My CPA did reported the PFIC income/dividends as income earned through interest + dividends and filed the FBAR, so I‚Äôm hoping the IRS won't penalize me for non-compliance. I might also need to fix the NY state return for the PFICs but haven't done enough research.
2. **CPA's Responsibility**:
   * Should I ask my CPA why they didn‚Äôt file Forms 8621 and 8938? When I asked near end of December, they just said they ""reported accordingly per info received and request"".
   * Are they potentially liable if I receive penalties? Should I request a partial refund for improper services?
3. **Filing Advice**:
   * Does anyone know good tax software to help me amend my return with Forms 8621 and 8938?
   * For 2024, if I sell one of my Canadian ETFs (PFICs), do I only report the sale as capital gains on Form 8621?
4. **PFIC Elections**:
   * When I amend my 2023 return, should I elect QEF or no election since Vanguard provides the info for PFIC calculations such as linked below (https://www.vanguard.ca/content/dam/intl/americas/canada/en/documents/VFV\_9563\_PFIC\_C032024.pdf)? From doing some reading, I saw it might be hard for the IRS to accept a retroactive election, so I might just do no election for 2023, and look into doing an election in 2024. I don't want to be taxed like crazy but thinking of the pros and cons.
5. **Future Plans**:
   * To simplify my tax returns, I‚Äôm planning to sell all my PFICs within the next few weeks. I might also transfer my cash and securities to US accounts to avoid future cross-border complexities. Does this make sense?

This has been a really stressful lesson in cross-border tax compliance. I just want to get back on track with the IRS and avoid penalties. Any advice would be deeply appreciated.

Thanks for your help!"

# What is the Bermuda Digital Nomad Visa and How Does It Work?

Imagine working from a laptop while gazing at turquoise waters and pink sand beaches. Sounds like a dream, right? With the¬†**Bermuda Digital Nomad Visa**, this dream can become your reality. This unique program allows remote workers to live and work in Bermuda for up to one year, blending productivity with paradise. But what exactly is this visa, and how does it work? Let‚Äôs dive in.

# What Makes the Bermuda Digital Nomad Visa Unique?

Unlike traditional work visas, the¬†**Bermuda Digital Nomad Visa**¬†is designed specifically for remote workers, freelancers, and entrepreneurs. It doesn‚Äôt require you to secure a job with a Bermudian employer.

# Cost of Living in Bermuda: Is It Affordable for Remote Workers?

Living in Bermuda as a remote worker can feel like a dream come true. With its pink sand beaches, turquoise waters, and year-round sunshine, the island offers a lifestyle that many crave. However, before packing your bags and applying for the¬†**Bermuda Digital Nomad Visa**, it‚Äôs essential to understand the cost of living. Is it affordable for remote workers? Let‚Äôs break it down.

# Housing: The Biggest Expense

Housing in Bermuda is notoriously expensive. Whether you‚Äôre renting or buying, prices are significantly higher than in most countries. A one-bedroom apartment in a central location can cost anywhere from $2,500 to $4,000 per month. If you‚Äôre looking for something more spacious or closer to the beach, expect to pay even more. For remote workers, this can be a major consideration, especially if your income isn‚Äôt adjusted to match the island‚Äôs high costs.

# Tips for Saving on Housing

* Consider sharing accommodations with other digital nomads to split costs.
* Look for rentals in less touristy areas, which are often more affordable.
* Negotiate long-term rental agreements for potential discounts.

# Groceries and Dining Out

Since most goods are imported, groceries in Bermuda can be pricey. A loaf of bread might cost $5, and a gallon of milk could set you back $10. Dining out is equally expensive, with a meal at a mid-range restaurant averaging $30-$50 per person. For remote workers who enjoy cooking at home, shopping at local markets and buying seasonal produce can help reduce costs.

# Budget-Friendly Food Options

* Shop at local markets for fresh, affordable produce.
* Limit dining out to special occasions.
* Cook meals at home to save money and enjoy healthier options.

# Transportation: Getting Around the Island

Bermuda is a small island, but getting around can still add up. Public transportation, including buses and ferries, is reliable and relatively affordable, with monthly passes costing around $70. However, owning a car is expensive due to high import taxes and limited space. Many residents opt for scooters, which are cheaper to maintain and easier to navigate on the island‚Äôs narrow roads.

# Transportation Tips for Remote Workers

* Use public transportation to save money and reduce your carbon footprint.
* Consider renting a scooter for short-term stays.
* Walk or bike whenever possible to enjoy the island‚Äôs scenic views.

# Utilities and Internet

Utilities, including electricity, water, and internet, are another significant expense. The average monthly cost for utilities in a small apartment can range from $200 to $400. Internet speeds are generally reliable, which is crucial for remote workers. However, plans can be costly, with prices starting at around $100 per month.

# Ways to Lower Utility Costs

* Use energy-efficient appliances to reduce electricity bills.
* Limit air conditioning usage and opt for fans or natural ventilation.
* Bundle internet and phone services for potential discounts.

# Healthcare and Insurance

Healthcare in Bermuda is of high quality but comes at a premium. Expats and digital nomads are required to have health insurance, which can cost several hundred dollars per month. While the island has excellent medical facilities, the cost of care can be steep without proper coverage.

# Healthcare Tips for Remote Workers

* Research international health insurance plans that cover Bermuda.
* Compare plans to find one that fits your budget and needs.
* Take advantage of preventative care to avoid costly medical expenses.

# Entertainment and Leisure

Bermuda offers plenty of activities, from snorkeling and hiking to exploring historic sites. While some activities are free, others, like boat tours or golfing, can be expensive. Remote workers should budget for leisure activities to fully enjoy the island‚Äôs offerings without breaking the bank.

# Affordable Ways to Enjoy Bermuda

* Explore public beaches and hiking trails for free outdoor fun.
* Attend local events and festivals, which often have low or no entry fees.
* Take advantage of happy hours and special deals at restaurants and bars.

# Is Bermuda Affordable for Remote Workers?

The answer depends on your income and lifestyle. While the cost of living in Bermuda is high, many remote workers find the island‚Äôs beauty and quality of life worth the expense. By budgeting carefully and making smart choices, you can make island living work for you. The¬†**Bermuda Digital Nomad Visa**¬†opens the door to this paradise, but it‚Äôs up to you to manage your finances wisely.

Ultimately, Bermuda offers a unique blend of work and play that‚Äôs hard to find elsewhere. If you‚Äôre ready to embrace the island lifestyle, start planning your budget today to ensure a smooth transition to this tropical haven.

# Exploring Bermuda‚Äôs Lifestyle: Beaches, Culture, and Connectivity for Nomads

Whether you‚Äôre looking to relax, swim, or explore, there‚Äôs a beach for every mood. Horseshoe Bay is a favorite among locals and visitors alike, offering calm waters and stunning views. For a more secluded experience, head to Warwick Long Bay or Jobson‚Äôs Cove.

These beaches aren‚Äôt just for leisure‚Äîthey‚Äôre also great places to work. Many digital nomads find inspiration in the natural beauty of the island, often setting up their laptops at beachside cafes or under the shade of a palm tree.

# Immersing Yourself in Bermudian Culture

Bermuda‚Äôs culture is a blend of British, African, and Caribbean influences. The island‚Äôs history is preserved in its UNESCO World Heritage Site, the town of St. George. Wander through its cobblestone streets, visit the historic forts, and learn about Bermuda‚Äôs role in the Atlantic trade routes.

Music and dance are integral parts of Bermudian life. The Gombeys, a traditional dance troupe, perform at festivals and events throughout the year. Their vibrant costumes and rhythmic drumming are a must-see for anyone looking to experience the island‚Äôs cultural heartbeat.

# Staying Connected in Paradise

One of the biggest concerns for digital nomads is staying connected. Bermuda addresses this with its robust infrastructure. High-speed internet is widely available, and coworking spaces like The Hub offer a professional environment for remote workers. Many cafes and restaurants also provide free Wi-Fi, making it easy to work from almost anywhere on the island.

For those who prefer a change of scenery, Bermuda‚Äôs compact size means you can work from a different location every day. From beachfront cafes to quiet parks, the options are endless.

# Exploring Beyond the Beaches

While the beaches are a major draw, Bermuda has much more to offer. The island is home to lush nature reserves, crystal-clear caves, and world-class golf courses. The Bermuda Railway Trail, a scenic path that spans the island, is perfect for hiking or biking. For history buffs, the Royal Naval Dockyard offers a glimpse into Bermuda‚Äôs maritime past.

Foodies will also love Bermuda‚Äôs culinary scene. From fresh seafood to traditional dishes like fish chowder and codfish breakfast, the island‚Äôs cuisine is a treat for the taste buds. Don‚Äôt forget to try the famous Dark ‚Äòn Stormy cocktail, made with Bermuda‚Äôs own Gosling‚Äôs Black Seal rum.

A film analysis on Brokeback Mountain,TrueFilm,1i9wko3,2025-01-25 15:45:33,5,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1i9wko3/a_film_analysis_on_brokeback_mountain/,gilderman228,,"Is this allowed? I wanted to share an analysis I wrote while baked on one of my favorite films with fellow cinephiles. It‚Äôs as follows below:

In the film Brokeback Mountain, the two central characters are Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist. Jack wants to be free from the limits of society, deciding to live on the ‚Äúmargins‚Äù‚Äîa mountain. And not just any mountain: Brokeback Mountain, isolated in the wilderness from the modern world. Although it was only his job, in reality, he envisioned it as an ideal life for himself: his own plot of land where he could live with someone he loved. Free from the expectations of heteronormativity, he would not have to reckon with his attraction to men and simply exist as who he truly felt he was, thus freeing him from the worry of homophobia and homophobic violence.

This is why he brings it up to Ennis at multiple times in their lives‚Äîeven after they don‚Äôt have much of their families left after getting divorced from their respective wives. They‚Äôve ‚Äúfailed‚Äù the goal of heteronormativity‚Äîthe idea that heterosexuality is the right way of living, and that even if your sexuality differs, you should still seek to conform. They struggle to accept their attraction to each other throughout their lives but it‚Äôs undeniable. Brokeback Mountain represents freedom for them: a place away from the heterosexual world. Yet, it‚Äôs a temporary space that soon becomes mythologized, because as marginalized people, the queer community can never truly escape the heterosexual world. Thus, we must create our own permanent microcosms (our homes and communities) before making a more accepting macrocosm (the wider world).

Jack once again is reminded of the control of the heterosexual world, by having Brokeback Mountain‚Äîhis mythologized place of queer freedom‚Äîtaken away from him at a time in his life when he really wanted it: his youth, namely his 20s to be precise. This is before the expectations put upon by heterosexual society‚Äîthat is, heterosexual marriage and child-rearing, especially in a time when same-sex marriage not only was illegal but quite frankly unheard of and thus unbelievable. 

Aguirre, the boss of the sheep ranch where  both young men worked, knew exactly what they were doing after watching them from afar on the mountain one day‚Äî‚Äústemming the rose,‚Äù an explicit euphemism for homosexual intercourse. Ennis appreciated Jack's comfort because of his loneliness throughout his life‚Äîloss of his parents, then separation from his brother and sister, who‚Äôd raised him for a time. Ennis understands queer attraction under the veneer of ‚Äústraight‚Äù society‚Äîusing its words and lingo to describe his personal world (as in calling him and Jack fishing buddies and performing their personal ritual of drinking and smoking before Jack‚Äôs arrival to his home). And we see that this at least removes Ennis‚Äôs anxiety of performing heterosexuality, allowing him to have that feeling of freedom that Brokeback Mountain provided. 

Of course, it must be said that it does look a bit strange that being under the influence of drugs brings into question idea of consent‚Äîbut we see his attraction to Jack even in his moments of sobriety, so perhaps this is the narrative‚Äôs way of letting it feel ‚Äúokay‚Äù‚Äîthough naturally, one would want given consent over implied. 

Once the two get married to women, the movie brings up a new and interesting perspective‚Äîhomosociality, the enjoyment of the company or friendship of the same sex. And often throughout history, homosocial and homosexual spaces have sometimes crossed‚Äîbecause homosexuals enjoy the company of their own sex just as homosocial heterosexuals do.

Ennis speaks of his and Jack's relationship under that veneer of homosociality‚Äîbecause remember, he understands his queerness through heterosexual language. So in his mind, men can have these all-male spaces temporarily, but permanence crosses the line and deviates from heterosexuality and thus the expected heteronormativity of men. Because even if a man enjoys the company of other men, and even may prefer it to that of women, it is seen as a homosexual trait to desire it exclusively instead of the integrated (albeit limited) nature of heteronormative society‚Äîeven if the man himself is undeniably heterosexual. 

For closeted bisexual men and those bi-curious, it causes them to want to decide between ‚Äúmen‚Äù or ‚Äúwomen‚Äù. When Ennis gets divorced, Jack immediately goes to visit him, expecting that they would now have their mythologized life he envisioned on Brokeback Mountain‚Äîbut because Ennis has his children with him the day Jack visits, he denies Jack‚Äôs request and Jack leaves, heartbroken but still expecting to see him next month. He runs away to Mexico, with Mexicans being another historically marginalized group in the US. 

But Mexico has also been another mythologized place in the US‚Äîin older cowboy and western films, it was viewed as a land of escape, a place to be free from the United States. He releases his sorrows there and when he returns, he assumes the power of a presumed heterosexual man, which displays that he‚Äôs reconciled his fate in life within the heteronormative world.

Ennis‚Äô wife, at Thanksgiving, reveals to Ennis that she saw the truth of his ‚Äúlie‚Äù‚Äîboth to her and to the existence of Ennis' freedom/escape from heterosexuality. He responds with violence and anger, having to confront that part of himself within the realm of the heteronormative world. Afterward, a montage of him and Jack riding through Brokeback is shown, transitioning from him being defeated in the ‚Äúheterosexual‚Äù hell to the apparent bliss of his private homosocial/homosexual ‚Äúheaven‚Äù. 

Here, Ennis is able to let go of his worries, confiding in Jack about his fear of homophobic violence while living within heteronormative society. Jack (bless his still yearning heart) suggests that they escape, to which Ennis responds with a ‚Äútall tale,‚Äù saying that maybe Alma would let Jack adopt their daughters so that they all could live on a ranch together‚Äîthe idea of a family of same-sex fathers raising children being near unthinkable at this point in history.

Jack again is dejected, having his desire for permanence in his ‚Äúheaven‚Äù denied again by his, undoubtedly, one true love. For Ennis, the heteronormative world is inescapable‚Äîagain and again, he is reluctantly pulled back into it and it is evident in his hesitance to initiate his first sexual interaction with a woman other than his ex-wife. When Jack attends a rodeo party, he meets another man and begins to emulate a homosocial bond through talking about women. In his effort to have a connection with another man, he hears the same ‚Äúcode‚Äù he speaks to Ennis‚Äîa sort of language that exemplifies the hidden queer yearning of men in his time. 

Yet, before he can answer, their wives exit the building, thus bringing them back to heterosexuality and ending that possible escape for Jack. For Ennis, his temporary escape from heterosexuality is enough for him, even if he loses the connections to his children or the women he attempts relationships with‚Äîbecause Jack was the first person to make him truly feel like he wasn‚Äôt alone. And here, Jack confesses his loneliness to Ennis‚Äîthat when he‚Äôs away from him, it becomes unbearable. 

Both of these men suffer from depression and loneliness because they are denied the permanent company of their intimate relationship with each other. They have crossed the threshold of homosociality and now are evidently homosexual, if not in identity then in behavior, which is looked down upon at this point in real-world history. Yet on Brokeback Mountain, they can have their peace and happiness away from it all‚Äîthat being the trappings and struggles of performing heterosexuality while dealing with internal sexual and romantic conflict. 

When Ennis tells Jack that he likely won‚Äôt see him again till November, Jack gets upset and suggests that they go to Mexico, again attempting to trade one mythologized place for another. Ennis suggests more of their rituals from Brokeback Mountain, because this temporary space is safe within the heterosexual world‚Äîremoved but not separate, because he views it as inescapable. (Because he‚Äôs divorced, poor, and paying child support). 

Since Ennis rejected Jack‚Äôs offer of a permanent queer escape, their possibility of it now is nigh impossible. Ennis has kept Jack at arm‚Äôs length outside of their times on Brokeback Mountain. Understandably, Jack has an outburst, scolding Ennis for shaming him for wanting a permanent queer escape. We see Ennis break down and admit that he hates leaving this temporary escape, even though he feels compelled to. A flashback plays of a moment when Ennis was the shepherd and Jack stayed in their base camp: Ennis gives him a long goodbye, holding him with incredible tenderness. Jack‚Äôs wistful gaze lingers after him.

When a letter that Ennis wrote to Jack comes back with a deceased stamp on it, he calls Jack‚Äôs wife to pay his respects. She tells him that Jack died because of an exploded tire‚Äîbut only the audience sees that Jack, who yearned for a permanent queer escape from the possible dangers of heteronormative society, was beaten to death by a group of men. It can be inferred that they presumably attacked him in response to his homosexuality, whether he made advances on one of the men or they heard of his homosexual exploits. 

His wife tells Ennis that she doesn‚Äôt even know where Brokeback Mountain is, which highlights Jack‚Äôs desire for it to remain separate from the heterosexual world. She herself even mythologizes it, saying Jack could have thought it was a place ‚Äúwhere bluebirds sing and there‚Äôs a whiskey spring.‚Äù When Ennis goes to visit Jack‚Äôs parents, Jack‚Äôs father tells him that Jack desired the idea of an actual relationship with Ennis even outside of the confines of Brokeback Mountain‚Äîhe wanted his reality to not be that of the heteronormative ‚Äúhell‚Äù (with its violence and repression) and preferred the comfort of his familiar homosexual one. 

Ennis goes into Jack‚Äôs childhood bedroom, perusing his former lover‚Äôs belongings, and finds the clothes that Jack died in. He cries, holding them close. Near the end of the film, we see Ennis living alone in a trailer park, seeming to have chosen the lonely life he was familiar with before he met Jack. With a visit from his daughter, the viewer can infer that he desires to not be alone anymore, deciding to make the best of the relationships that he still has left. 

He keeps Jack‚Äôs clothes in his closet next to a picture of Brokeback Mountain, a testament to what could‚Äôve been‚Äîthe hope for their queer heaven now just embers within the heteronormative world. Ennis tears up here, perhaps feeling emotions of sorrow and regret for having turned down Jack‚Äôs offers all those times before. Nevertheless, this memory of a bond he had‚Äîwith a man both his friend and infrequent lover‚Äîwill likely stay with him for the remainder of his life.

Please feel free to leave any questions or feedback! I truly do enjoy talking about this film :)
