We were driving up hill and I went over a speed bump and I heard grinding in the back that I've never heard before. She go out of the car with all her mite and the car leveled out. She left the car smelling like bacon. According to Google fat people can damage your car so should Uber allow drivers to surcharge fat paxs?

""An obese person can potentially damage a car by putting excessive strain on the car seat, causing it to sag or break down, and may also affect the car's suspension system if they regularly occupy the same seat, potentially leading to uneven tire wear and impacting the car's handling due to the added weight distribution on one side; however, a single ride with a heavy passenger is unlikely to cause significant damage to a standard vehicle."" -Google"

Etiquette for feeding vendors?,DesiWeddings,1i7msg3,2025-01-22 16:40:20,10,0.78,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesiWeddings/comments/1i7msg3/etiquette_for_feeding_vendors/,Effective_Wheel8928,,"Hi! I’m getting married in a few days and am really confused about the right etiquette to feed the vendors that doesn’t hurt the vendors as well. My parents usually feed all the vendors standard buffet but we also come from small town where additional 5 pax is affordable. My boyfriend is from a metro city and mentioned that it’s customary to let the vendors free for an hour or so window for them to have food and come back.

I’ve read about international approach and found vendor menu to be a great solve. Although, looks like vendor menu isn’t a famous thing in India. If you got married, how did you feed your vendors? If you’re a photographer or full day decor artist, what do you respectfully expect?"

Global Entry Vs Precheck ,tsa,1i5969p,2025-01-19 16:10:52,27,0.76,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/tsa/comments/1i5969p/global_entry_vs_precheck/,JayManY2K,TSA Pre Check/CLEAR [Question/Post],Fellow TSO here. In my airport which is fairly small we do get about 2-3 million Pax a year. We only have Precheck lanes nothing else. When I’m in TDC every so often I’ll have a Pax come up in the Precheck dedicated lane explaining how they are global entry not Precheck and that they are able to use that instead. I scan their ID and they ALWAYS come up as standard and I have to redirect them to the standard lane right after they verbally abuse me lol. So my question is what the hell is global entry and why do people with global entry automatically assume they get Precheck privileges. Thanks

"Finally, Getting Great Shots EVERY Time",CafelatRobot,1i3b132,2025-01-17 02:21:43,3,0.8,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CafelatRobot/comments/1i3b132/finally_getting_great_shots_every_time/,Pax280,,"I've spent about a year getting good to very good shots and the cocasional great shots.

Tried courser / finer gind, pull time, pressures etc. But shots were always on the bitter side of perfection to my taste.

I've been using one to two or 3 ratios.

I decided to try a ristretto shot as I read they were good for milk drinks and I want to try some latte art.

I had never tried 1:1 pulls thinking they would be even more bitter.

I was way wrong! The shot was bold but smooth, round, and balanced.  Delicious black or with my Cortada.

As someone else here commented, my only lament is the 18 ML shot is so small.

I know I can't get a standard double shot but it would be cool to get a 25ML single that tastes this good. 

I could pull two for my latte art base. 

Any suggestions, e g., 20g in/25 out and grind courser?

I'm brewing with medium dark Flores Island from Happy Mug. Good as filter or espresso.

Should I go custom or IKEA Pax?,ikeahacks,1i1zjld,2025-01-15 10:12:49,6,0.88,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/ikeahacks/comments/1i1zjld/should_i_go_custom_or_ikea_pax/,SarcasticFringehead7,help,"Long time lurker of this sub. Not sure if this is the right place to ask this question. 

I live in a studio/micro-apartment in NYC. Because of some difficult circumstances she is going through, my sister and her dog are moving in with me Feb 1 for an extended period of time.

I have been racking my brain to find more space in this apartment to store her things, but I’m finding it really hard. I work from home part of the week, so I need my dedicated desk setup. She works long hours and will be gone most of the day, and I will taking care of the dog the days I’m home. 

I was thinking of buying the narrow tall Pax from IKEA that’s 13x80” to create an informal “room divider” but because there’s only one window, the other side of the room would get no sunlight. I was thinking custom(?) half-height frames that would fit the IKEA Pax/Komplement shelving might be the way to go, but I have no idea where pricing would even begin. But it’s important to me that she has a dedicated space to store her belongings so she feels more “at home” for the time being. 

My budget is maxed at $2,800-3,200. Is this enough to get a pax-style cabinet made? Or would standard IKEA be the best way to go in that price range? "

Tampers for Robot,CafelatRobot,1i08iwy,2025-01-13 02:11:29,6,1.0,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/CafelatRobot/comments/1i08iwy/tampers_for_robot/,Pax280,,"I bought the Robot  partially because I didn't want to be tempted with all the accessories that conventional machines can use.

But I'm curious about the Cafelat leveling tamper OR the Orphan Express collar screen
tamper.

I use the thumb tamping technique with the standard tamper and check with a bullet level and the bed is almost dead even 99 out of 100 times.

Shots are good to excellent.

What value would a tamper upgrade offer? Which of the two options offers the most improvement in taste (?) or work flow?
Other options I might consider? 

Or, should I save my money and buy some nice beans from S&W or B&W?


Edit: Thanks all. Ordered the OE tamper and filters instead of the Cafelat tamper and will get a nice bag af B&W beans with the difference,

Ashes Fall 

https://preview.redd.it/bxqj2oevcoce1.png?width=938&format=png&auto=webp&s=81ff70aa2e51303c7e9a25b4e6f577d3493e9a6f

  
   What I feel is that Deacon Frost is a victim of his own prior accomplishments here. Now this book is really solid. I like the characters, the story was engaging. It just felt like the pacing was really off. 

  Things happen really fast, like the author was like this is a trilogy and we need to get from A-B in 3 books...but then they have a huge vision on how they want the characters to end up. That means a lot of stuff that should have taken awhile and get fleshed out just got ran through like a 20$ escort during feet week. 

This is not limited gaining levels and powers but also things like  the relationship with Tala jumping from 0-100. It felt like there was no build up.  Now with the gaining of powers and levels that too felt like there were huge jumps. The MC was constantly leveling up (as well as his girls) and it never felt like they get set or used to one power or skill before boom heres more. 

  Other thing I did not like was the death of Michael. It just felt to me like the author wrote a dude who was in the MC's age bracket that was not a jack ass and had a sister and her friend with him. So he had to go so the MC can gain the sister and said friend. 

  Now another point of contention I had was how PAX is handling the situation with Sin. His touch literally changed her to something she had no control over and now she can not be too far away from him or bad things happen to her. So what's his thought process when she has episodes like this 

>Pax began walking alongside Sin, and he glanced over at her. “Excited to meet other elves?” he asked. 

>To his surprise, she snorted and let out a sharp laugh. “I’m only an elf because of you,” she pointed out. 

>“Your touch is what changed me to this.” 

>Then she walked a touch faster, making it clear she wasn’t going to answer any further questions. 

>I’m really going to have to make her talk at some point, he thought to himself. But first, let’s see what else Asterfal might come across.

>

>Frost, Deacon. Ashes Fall: Hollow Earth Apocalypse 01 (p. 350). Obsidian Tome LLC. Kindle Edition. 

  And all I can think is she probably feels really really violated right now. And the person who violated her (in her mind...it was a accident) is now trying to be buddy buddy. It feels like Pax here has a low EQ when it comes to Sin and we don't see this when he interacts with anyone else.

  Now all that being said the book is very very good. The fight scenes are really well done. The author has a way with showing us the change in the world that is really awesome.  Now if this was any other author this book would have been rated higher but if you read Deacon Frost other works you would expect they can do better. At least to me. Still it is worth the read and I am absolutely going to pre order the next book as soon as it comes available.  Maybe they will hit that power plateau and can slow things down a bit. 

  
Dungeon Bound 6

https://preview.redd.it/yhindvl5koce1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=985e644f1442b3123ed0fb03e99b23cdb672bab6

   I have really enjoyed the series so far. I was really surprised the author got this out  being how they usually take much longer to write and this book is on the longer side.   

  Now I think this book did some things that should have been done way way earlier. Like we find out that MC is a chosen and was found in a dungeon by his troll mother. We get lot's and lot's of lore dumps ...for things that should have really been a book 2 or maybe three not a book 6. Another thing that seemed really wierd was it was like Kimko got heavily nerfed. She was much stronger in the other books before and it never seems to be addressed.

  What we also see here is a lot of character growth of the FMC's. Mainly Kimiko and  Brynja but I came away knowing all the girls a bit better.  The MC goes mask off kind of and we see maybe two more potential love interest.  We also find that MC is not the biggest dick around. The last book or two outside of the skittering dark Gabe has been face rolling everything, it is good he got shown there is room to grow.

  Lot's of resolutions happened and I was ok with how the series is progressing. 



Mage Of Waycross



 

https://preview.redd.it/ck0c2uemooce1.png?width=938&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5bee285e0d167eb89abc7a70c60d44f418bf6e5

  This authors SOL series always gives me feeling of that Cowboy Dan song by Modest Mouse.  

  Now a lot of this story is fantastical... not because of magic or goblins or trolls or the MC getting all the hot girls he encounters as a 40 year old divorce. No what is fantastical is that his divorce was approved in like less then a year and he is cool with his ex. He has a 8 year old son that does what he is told. I mean you can tell him hey if you hear anything crazy you dont go out you come get me....and that works.  

  Now the story itself is pretty good....but this is Jack Bryce and I think he has the whole slice of life thing on lock.  I do like that he did not have the MC holding secrets from the people who are important to him and he is asking for help....except that Librarian he could have told her sooner.

   All in all pretty good book. 



Returners Defiance 2

  

https://preview.redd.it/eds9xiz9roce1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4f866d8bd15f9fcf2789a275573b66e3d30f21a

   Good book.  This is the standard of quality you expect from this author. The characters are interesting.  The world is still developing, now usually in these stories we have something that speeds up the timeline (MC started with two years to prepare but changes were made and now they have a month or some such) but we have not seen it yet. 

   I don't feel there was a lot of character growth here. The MC pretty much face rolls everything and everyone goes goo goo eyes for how awesome he is. Author does not make clear what the relationship between mom and dad is. Like does she actually like him or what. 

  Still this is pretty decent. This is Bruce Senetar book so you know how it is ending.

  Nyx is awesome. I really think MC should have not gotten with her though. Sure he is in his 18 year old body and like he says several times she is a dumb 18 year old teenager. I like Snake girls as much as the next guy but she does not even really fill a spot on the team that needed filling. 

  Also he should be mature enough (at over 500 years old) to have understood what his mom was putting down and why. It just seems so immature of him. 

  
  Hearthomancy 3

  Really good book.   I love Lorelei's taste in movies. She probably spends her down time watching Tubi to see all the great movies of the 80's and 90's lol.  

  This books really just maintained the constancy of the previous. We get the story to be driven forward some and we met the next love interest.  

  I like how the author has combined certain classes and found a way to make it work. I also like how it was actually addressed and shown that it is odd but not really outlandish. My only point of contention was with the way CC Thompson did Lorelei voice...it was grating as hell. 

   With the way this book ended there can be either two more book or 6. I guess it all depends how far the author wants to go but I don't remember them doing any more then 6 books in a series.  Anyway it was a really hard choice but this was my recommend for the week.



Like I said in the opening all the books were really good. All were really well written and none of them will you regret reading in my opinion. "

I am booking a trip for our family of 5, YVR-DXB-MRU-LGW/LHR-YVR and the cost is over $20K if booked directly with the airlines, but only $11K (!) booking the same flights/airlines with Expedia. Traveling with 3 kids, alot can go wrong. I'm 35K with AC, called them to inquire about possible price-matching but was told OTA's purchase bulk seats and the airline can't match their prices. I've heard/read the horror stories dealing with third parties, but the difference in cost is huge. I don't know what to do. I guess I'm hoping for validation from ppl that have used Expedia many times and have had positive experiences. WWYD? TIA!

Edit: I should add some additional details. 

All flights are standard economy, both with Expedia and direct with the respective airlines.  

YVR-DXB is with Air Canada with a multi-night stop; DXB-MRU is with Emirates with a multi-night stop; MRU-LGW is with Air Mauritius with a multi-night stop; LHR-YVR is with Air Canada. 

According to Expedia itinerary each pax is permitted a carry-on and 1 checked bag. "

(I would include a photo, but it seems my photo upload privileges have been revoked) Anyways, PAX ordered a standard lift at a grocery store. I pull up to the pin, there are four people, and a cart full of groceries. Thankfully, I drive standard lift and XL. The upfront pay, was already an abysmal $4.05. (I have my reasons) After all the waiting for them to load and unload all their groceries, I ended with a whopping $4.11. That is opposed to $0.70 per mile.

How functional is the shallow 35cm PAX wardrobe?,IKEA,1hv9ve8,2025-01-06 16:06:07,2,1.0,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/IKEA/comments/1hv9ve8/how_functional_is_the_shallow_35cm_pax_wardrobe/,foxxxxxygirrrl,General,"
I’m considering the 35cm deep PAX wardrobe for a space where the standard 58cm depth won’t fit. For those of you who have the shallow version, how functional do you find it for storage?

Can it comfortably store clothes, like folded sweaters or hanging shirts?

Are the accessories (like pull-out trays or baskets) still useful at this depth?

Any clever hacks or configurations you’ve tried to make the most of the shallow depth?

Would love to hear about your experiences before I make the purchase!

[rev-share] Pixel Artist/Partner needed for point-and-click adventure,INAT,1hubqao,2025-01-05 12:10:59,7,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/INAT/comments/1hubqao/revshare_pixel_artistpartner_needed_for/,nappy-doo,Artist Needed,"I'm looking for an artist/partner to start a game possibly more. While I have ideas for a the first game I think I would like to build, I am open to exploration. Let's start off with the idea:

* Monkey-Island style point and click adventure. As this would be my first game, I'm looking to minimize difficulty, while maximizing the likelihood of success (more on this later).
* The main character is a dog, living in a suburban world. You can do standard dog things: bark, sniff, dig, etc.
* The dog is the star of the show. He acts in very dog-like ways. (ie, if he's inactive in-game for a while, he starts chasing his own tail, or stretching, eventually falling asleep. During gameplay, he sniffs, his tail wags at exciting things, etc.) He's the main character. He has to pop on screen.
* Again, I have in mind that the adventure is very Monkey Islandy. Little puzzles, but solved from a dog's point of view: eg, early in the game, you have to bark at the door to get people to let you out, sitting on the couch will spread fur on the couch possibly causing the owner to vacuum the couch, sometimes the dog will sniff the ground while walking, telling the player there's something buried there, etc.
* I am starting the story as we speak, but don't want to get too far into this, because I want the artists' vision to come to the project too.

Who am I/what do I offer?

* I am a early retired long-time SWE (25+ years experience). You don't know it, but you have used my software on hundreds (or thousands) of occasions in life.
* I have done it all in the software world, except games.
* I've worked at multiple FAANGs and been writing software for most of my life.
* I've been an engineer, a tech-lead, a manager, and a manager of managers – I've seen it all.

What do you offer?

* You're an artist, with a vision, who wants to develop games.
* You can work remotely with the Eastern (US) Time Zone. (I can't be up past about midnight my time, but I can meet you on your schedule some due to the fact that I'm retired.)
* I care less about experience, more about the desire to create something that hasn't been built before. I've seen more engineers that I can count solve problems that were harder than I thought they could, and I imagine the same is true of artists.
* You can collaborate. I want this game to be our vision.
* If rev-share isn't something you can live with, different arrangements might be made for the right person.

Timeframe:

* I would like to get started on fleshing out the story and story-boarding scenes. I would like us to see if it's going to work as an idea. It could be this idea is junk, and we should consign it to the scrap-heap.
* Assuming our collaboration works, I'd love to start demoing at PAX next year. I think marketing is important for game companies, and I would like us to be successful there.

HMU if you're interested. I'd like to get started on things."

How do I check the amount of ammo I spawn in with?,HuntShowdown,1ht1rem,2025-01-03 19:32:18,2,0.75,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HuntShowdown/comments/1ht1rem/how_do_i_check_the_amount_of_ammo_i_spawn_in_with/,IlllIIIIIllIlIII,GENERAL,"Started playing this game after my break from this game that began before the hunt 1896 update. I hate the UI but it’s bearable, but there is one thing that has annoyed me a lot. It says that when I spawn in with a standard Pax Trueshot, I get 6/12 ammo, but when I equip high velocity ammo I spawn in with 6/9 or something like that. I don’t have an issue with spawning in with less ammo but is there a way to check how much ammo I spawn in with when I’m using special ammo?"

> In the forty-year history of Star Trek, none of the television show's actors are more beloved than DeForest Kelley. His portrayal of Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy, the southern physician aboard the Starship Enterprise, brought an unaffected humanity to the groundbreaking space frontier series. Jackson DeForest Kelley came of age in Depression-era Georgia. He was raised on the sawdust trail, a preacher's kid steeped in his father's literal faith and judgment.

> Captain Kirk and the U.S.S. Enterprise join the Klingons to avert disaster in the Taygeta V system, where a time/space warp has swallowed a spaceship without a trace. Spock suspects a link between the anomaly and the inhabitants of Taygeta, semi-aquatic creatures killed for the jewel-like tears secreted at the moment of death. But a mutinous Klingon officer threatens the vital mission, as a desperate Kirk and Spock race to save the Taygetians, the Federation, and the entire universe.

> Years ago, Lt. Uhura befriended a diplomat from Eeiauo, the land of graceful, cat-like beings. The two women exchanged songs and promised never to reveal their secret. Now the U.S.S. Enterprise is orbiting Eeiauo in a desperate race to save the inhabitants before a deadly plague destroys them. Uhura's secret songs may hold the key to a cure -- but the clues are veiled in layers of mystery. The plague is killing humans, threatening other planets -- and Kirk must crack the code before the Starship Enterprise succumbs!

> The planet Sanctuary is a fabled world in unexplored space thought to be the last refuge of the persecuted, home to both the justly and unjustly accused. Though its name has been translated into every language in the galaxy, Starfleet has never known its exact location. The crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise is assigned to capture a dangerous criminal named Auk Rex, and their pursuit takes them to an unexplored sector of space. Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock, and Dr. McCoy continue the pursuit in a shuttlecraft, following Auk Rex to the surface of the planet, Santuary. Kirk and his crew are locked in a life and death struggle on the mysterious planet, which harbors deadly secrets and never releases its visitors.

> While on a routine mission to retrieve a research drone for recycling, the U.S.S. Enterprise encounters a Romulan space station adrift within Federation borders. Exploring the lifeless station, the crew finds ghostly apparitions flitting at the edges of sight. Soon the U.S.S. Enterprise is also inexplicably without power. Captain Kirk and his crew must now solve the mystery of the strange apparitions before the Starship suffers the station's fate. The situation becomes desperate when a Romulan warship arrives looking for the station, and the Romulan Commander accuses the Federation of treachery. Before Captain Kirk can save the Starship Enterprise from complete destruction, he must avoid becoming drawn into a deadly shell game, a game that will leave no winners and no survivors.

> A prophecy leads Jake Sisko on a desperate search for his missing father. Instead, what he finds at his journey's end is totally unexpected...In the climactic closing episode of the final season of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Captain Benjamin Sisko, his destiny inextricably linked to that of the alien entities known as The Prophets, was last seen plunging into the depths of the Bajoran Fire Caves, locked in combat with Gul Dukat.

> They were created to be killing machines. Highly intelligent, resourceful, and deceptively complex, the Jem'Hadar are a species engineered for war and programmed at the genetic level for one purpose: to fight until death as soldiers of the sprawling stellar empire known as the Dominion. No Jem'Hadar has ever lived thirty years, and not even their masters, the shape-shifting Founders, know what such a creature is capable of becoming were it to be freed of its servitude. One Founder, however, has dared to wonder. Appointed by Odo himself to learn peaceful coexistence aboard Deep Space 9 Taran'atar, an Honored Elder among the Jem'Hadar, had for months been a staunch, if conflicted, ally to the crew of the station, ever struggling to understand the mission on which he was sent . . . until something went horrifically wrong. Consumed by self-doubt and an ever-growing rage, Taran'atar has lashed out against those he was sworn to aid. While Captain Kira Nerys and Lieutenant Ro Laren both lie near death aboard DS9, their assailant has taken a hostage and fled into Cardassian space, pursued by Commander Elias Vaughn on the U.S.S. Defiant. But as the hunt unfolds, Taran'atar's true objective becomes increasingly less certain, as the rogue Jem'Hadar leads the Defiant to a discovery even more shocking than his crime.

> Half a decade after the Dominion War and more than a year after the rise and fall of Praetor Shinzon, the galaxy’s greatest scourge, the Borg, returns to wreak havoc upon the Federation—and this time, its goal is nothing less than total annihilation. Elsewhere, deep in the Gamma Quadrant, an ancient mystery is solved. One of Earth’s first generation of starships, lost for centuries, has been found dead and empty on a desolate planet. But its discovery so far from home has raised disturbing questions, and the answers harken back to a struggle for survival that once tested a captain and her crew to the limits of their humanity. From that terrifying flashpoint begins an apocalyptic odyssey that will reach across time and space to reveal the past, define the future, and show three captains that some destinies are inescapable. For Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the U.S.S. Enterprise, defending the future has never been so important, or so personal—and the wrong choice will cost him everything for which he has struggled and suffered. For Captain William Riker of the U.S.S. Titan, that choice has already been made—haunted by the memories of those he was forced to leave behind, he must jeopardize all that he has left in a desperate bid to save the Federation. And for Captain Ezri Dax of the U.S.S. Aventine, whose impetuous youth is balanced by the wisdom of many lifetimes, the choice is a simple one: there is no going back—only forward to whatever future awaits them. . . .

> Pax Galactica. Enemies become allies. Old secrets are at last revealed. Long-held beliefs and widely accepted truths are challenged. Man turns to leisurely pursuits. In this golden age, two old friends are drawn together. They seek to understand, and wonder how what they have long believed, what they have been taught, was never so. Over two hundred years ago, the life of one of Starfleet's earliest pioneers came to a tragic end, and Captain Jonathan Archer, the legendary commander of Earth's first warp-five starship, lost a close friend. Or so it seemed for many years. But with the passage of time, and the declassification of certain crucial files, the truth about that fateful day -- the day that Commander Charles ""Trip"" Tucker III didn't die -- could finally be revealed. Why did Starfleet feel it was necessary to rewrite history? And why only now can the truth be told?

Cunning, ruthless, driven by an instinct for violence and defined by a complex code of honor, they must push ever outward in order to survive, defying the icy ravages of space with the fire of their hearts. They are the Klingons, and if you think you already know all there is to learn about them...think again. From its highest echelons of power to the shocking depths of its lowest castes, from its savagely aggressive military to its humble farmers, from political machinations of galactic import to personal demons and family strife, the Klingon Empire is revealed as never before when the captain and crew of the I.K.S. Gorkon finally return to their homeworld of Qo'noS in a sweeping tale of intrigue, love, betrayal, and honor.

> Some say the line between good and evil is narrower than we imagine -- a divide as subtle as a mirror, and perhaps just as deep. To peer into its black, reflective glass is to know the dark potential we each possess, and we cross that obsidian boundary at our peril . . . into a world where we no longer recognize who we are or what we believed ourselves capable of. In the late twenty-fourth century, decades after the fall of the once-mighty Terran Empire, the Klingon-Cardassian Alliance dominates the worlds that, in another reality, made up the United Federation of Planets. Humanity and its former subject races are now bound together by their shared oppression, slaves to their cruel and brutal conquerors. But a downtrodden few have found the courage and the strength of will to act. Inspired by visitors from another continuum to fight for their freedom, they have rekindled hope . . . and rediscovered an ancient truth: that every revolution begins with a vision. Star Trek: VOYAGER A rebel ship commanded by a former slave named Chakotay attempts to evade pursuit in the Badlands . . . only to encounter a strange ship that was catapulted seventy thousand light-years across the galaxy. On board the craft are two aliens, one of whom has the potential to completely alter the balance of power within the Alliance. But as both sides of the struggle race to get to the stranger first, treachery throws all schemes into a tailspin. Star Trek: NEW FRONTIER Following the Terran Empire's collapse, its longtime rival, the Romulan Star Empire, has absorbed many of the fringe civilizations spread across that part of the galaxy. One of the Romulans' slaves is M'k'nzy of Calhoun, a savage and unpredictable Xenexian who dreams of death . . . and who learns the value of freedom from the unlikeliest of teachers, a Romulan named Soleta. Star Trek: DEEP SPACE NINE One fallen dictator's struggle to regain her power and her position leads to the discovery of a bold rebel plan for a decisive military strike against the Alliance. But while Kira Nerys navigates the dangerous road of politics, sex, and military intrigue that she believes will lead her back to reclaiming the Intendancy, cracks form in the rebel leadership, leading to a showdown that will change the course of the Mirror Universe.

But the message reached Federation space too late to save the planet or its people. Or so it was believed.... Generations later, Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the Enterprise-E are stunned to discover the last of the Dokaalan -- now only a colony fighting to stay alive in a decrepit asteroid mining complex. Although their home planet was destroyed long ago, the survivors hope to someday transform a nearby planet into a new home for their people. But bitter divisions exist among the Dokaalan, sowing the seeds of sabotage and terrorism -- and placing Picard and the Enterprise in the middle of an escalating crisis that can only lead to total destruction!

> At the height of the Dominion War and unknown to all save those in the highest levels of command, the Federation secretly armed the neutral planet Tezwa with devastating weapons -- part of a contingency plan against the Dominion if the front lines collapsed. But Tezwa also lies near the border of the Klingon Empire...making the Federation's covert strategy in direct violation of their fragile peace treaties,and creating the potential threat of scandal and all-out war.

> Following the scandalous Tezwa affair, the Federation president's resignation forces an election, with the future of the United Federation of Planets to be determined by who emerges victorious from a hotly contested vote. But it is the fate of the entire galaxy that may actually be decided on Qo'noS, as the Federation embassy is seized by terrorists whose actions expose intrigue reaching the highest levels of Klingon government -- and it will take all of Ambassador Worf's skills to keep the fragile Federation-Klingon alliance from collapsing. And while this potential intergalactic chaos looms, Commander Riker finds his plans for command and marriage soured by a brutal, high-level inspection of the ship from which the crew may not escape unscathed.... The epic miniseries comes to a shocking conclusion -- one that will leave the Star Trek universe changed forever!

> Located far beyond the boundaries of explored space, the Goeg Domain is a political union of dozens of planets and races. When the U.S.S. Enterprise arrives in its territory to investigate an interstellar phenomenon, Commander Laspas of the Domain Defense Corps is at first guarded, then fascinated to discover the existence of an alliance of worlds much like his own, and finds a kindred spirit in Captain James T. Kirk. And when the Enterprise is attacked by the Domain’s enemies, crippling the starship’s warp capability and leaving its crew facing the prospect of a slow, months-long journey home, the Goeg leader volunteers the help of his own ship, offering to combine the resources of both vessels to bring the Enterprise to a nearby Domain facility to make the necessary repairs. But what at first seems to be an act of peace and friendship soon turns out to be a devil’s bargain, as Kirk and the Enterprise crew learn that there are perhaps more differences than similarities between the Federation and the Domain. When the Goeg’s adversaries strike again, the Enterprise is drawn deeper and inexorably into the conflict, and Kirk begins to realize that they may have allied themselves with the wrong side....

One Founder, however, has dared to wonder. Appointed by Odo himself to learn peaceful coexistence aboard Deep Space 9 Taran'atar, an Honored Elder among the Jem'Hadar, had for months been a staunch, if conflicted, ally to the crew of the station, ever struggling to understand the mission on which he was sent . . . until something went horrifically wrong. Consumed by self-doubt and an ever-growing rage, Taran'atar has lashed out against those he was sworn to aid. While Captain Kira Nerys and Lieutenant Ro Laren both lie near death aboard DS9, their assailant has taken a hostage and fled into Cardassian space, pursued by Commander Elias Vaughn on the U.S.S. Defiant. But as the hunt unfolds, Taran'atar's true objective becomes increasingly less certain, as the rogue Jem'Hadar leads the Defiant to a discovery even more shocking than his crime.

> Half a decade after the Dominion War and more than a year after the rise and fall of Praetor Shinzon, the galaxy’s greatest scourge, the Borg, returns to wreak havoc upon the Federation—and this time, its goal is nothing less than total annihilation. Elsewhere, deep in the Gamma Quadrant, an ancient mystery is solved. One of Earth’s first generation of starships, lost for centuries, has been found dead and empty on a desolate planet. But its discovery so far from home has raised disturbing questions, and the answers harken back to a struggle for survival that once tested a captain and her crew to the limits of their humanity. From that terrifying flashpoint begins an apocalyptic odyssey that will reach across time and space to reveal the past, define the future, and show three captains that some destinies are inescapable. For Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the U.S.S. Enterprise, defending the future has never been so important, or so personal—and the wrong choice will cost him everything for which he has struggled and suffered. For Captain William Riker of the U.S.S. Titan, that choice has already been made—haunted by the memories of those he was forced to leave behind, he must jeopardize all that he has left in a desperate bid to save the Federation. And for Captain Ezri Dax of the U.S.S. Aventine, whose impetuous youth is balanced by the wisdom of many lifetimes, the choice is a simple one: there is no going back—only forward to whatever future awaits them. . . .

> Pax Galactica. Enemies become allies. Old secrets are at last revealed. Long-held beliefs and widely accepted truths are challenged. Man turns to leisurely pursuits. In this golden age, two old friends are drawn together. They seek to understand, and wonder how what they have long believed, what they have been taught, was never so. Over two hundred years ago, the life of one of Starfleet's earliest pioneers came to a tragic end, and Captain Jonathan Archer, the legendary commander of Earth's first warp-five starship, lost a close friend. Or so it seemed for many years. But with the passage of time, and the declassification of certain crucial files, the truth about that fateful day -- the day that Commander Charles ""Trip"" Tucker III didn't die -- could finally be revealed. Why did Starfleet feel it was necessary to rewrite history? And why only now can the truth be told?

> They have been the Federation's staunchest allies, and its fiercest adversaries. Cunning, ruthless, driven by an instinct for violence and defined by a complex code of honor, they must push ever outward in order to survive, defying the icy ravages of space with the fire of their hearts. They are the Klingons, and if you think you already know all there is to learn about them...think again. From its highest echelons of power to the shocking depths of its lowest castes, from its savagely aggressive military to its humble farmers, from political machinations of galactic import to personal demons and family strife, the Klingon Empire is revealed as never before when the captain and crew of the I.K.S. Gorkon finally return to their homeworld of Qo'noS in a sweeping tale of intrigue, love, betrayal, and honor.

> Some say the line between good and evil is narrower than we imagine -- a divide as subtle as a mirror, and perhaps just as deep. To peer into its black, reflective glass is to know the dark potential we each possess, and we cross that obsidian boundary at our peril . . . into a world where we no longer recognize who we are or what we believed ourselves capable of. In the late twenty-fourth century, decades after the fall of the once-mighty Terran Empire, the Klingon-Cardassian Alliance dominates the worlds that, in another reality, made up the United Federation of Planets. Humanity and its former subject races are now bound together by their shared oppression, slaves to their cruel and brutal conquerors. But a downtrodden few have found the courage and the strength of will to act. Inspired by visitors from another continuum to fight for their freedom, they have rekindled hope . . . and rediscovered an ancient truth: that every revolution begins with a vision. Star Trek: VOYAGER A rebel ship commanded by a former slave named Chakotay attempts to evade pursuit in the Badlands . . . only to encounter a strange ship that was catapulted seventy thousand light-years across the galaxy. On board the craft are two aliens, one of whom has the potential to completely alter the balance of power within the Alliance. But as both sides of the struggle race to get to the stranger first, treachery throws all schemes into a tailspin. Star Trek: NEW FRONTIER Following the Terran Empire's collapse, its longtime rival, the Romulan Star Empire, has absorbed many of the fringe civilizations spread across that part of the galaxy. One of the Romulans' slaves is M'k'nzy of Calhoun, a savage and unpredictable Xenexian who dreams of death . . . and who learns the value of freedom from the unlikeliest of teachers, a Romulan named Soleta. Star Trek: DEEP SPACE NINE One fallen dictator's struggle to regain her power and her position leads to the discovery of a bold rebel plan for a decisive military strike against the Alliance. But while Kira Nerys navigates the dangerous road of politics, sex, and military intrigue that she believes will lead her back to reclaiming the Intendancy, cracks form in the rebel leadership, leading to a showdown that will change the course of the Mirror Universe.

Years ago, William Riker was part of the Starfleet delegation that opened Imprima to the Federation. Now the disappearance of an old friend -- Teller Conlon, who also served on that team -- draws Riker and the Enterprise across the galaxy, back to Imprima. Because the jewel known as Fortune's Light -- one of Madraga Criathis's most priceless possessions -- has been stolen. And Teller Conlon stands accused of its theft. Now Riker must discover the truth behind the disappearance of both his friend and Fortune's Light, no easy task on a world where treachery and intrigue are commonplace...and where even an old friend's embrace may conceal the deadly bite of a dagger's blade.

> More than two centuries ago, the Dokaalan sent an unmanned probe into the void, bearing a distress call for anyone who could save their doomed world. But the message reached Federation space too late to save the planet or its people. Or so it was believed.... Generations later, Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the Enterprise-E are stunned to discover the last of the Dokaalan -- now only a colony fighting to stay alive in a decrepit asteroid mining complex. Although their home planet was destroyed long ago, the survivors hope to someday transform a nearby planet into a new home for their people. But bitter divisions exist among the Dokaalan, sowing the seeds of sabotage and terrorism -- and placing Picard and the Enterprise in the middle of an escalating crisis that can only lead to total destruction!

But Tezwa also lies near the border of the Klingon Empire...making the Federation's covert strategy in direct violation of their fragile peace treaties,and creating the potential threat of scandal and all-out war. Now Tezwa's power-hungry prime minister is all too eager to flex his newfound military muscle, menacing a nearby Klingon border world.

With time running out and billions of lives at stake, only one man can avert the looming disaster -- Ambassador Worf, who must choose between his oath to the Federation and his loyalty to Martok, Chancellor of the Klingon Empire....

> Located far beyond the boundaries of explored space, the Goeg Domain is a political union of dozens of planets and races. When the U.S.S. Enterprise arrives in its territory to investigate an interstellar phenomenon, Commander Laspas of the Domain Defense Corps is at first guarded, then fascinated to discover the existence of an alliance of worlds much like his own, and finds a kindred spirit in Captain James T. Kirk. And when the Enterprise is attacked by the Domain’s enemies, crippling the starship’s warp capability and leaving its crew facing the prospect of a slow, months-long journey home, the Goeg leader volunteers the help of his own ship, offering to combine the resources of both vessels to bring the Enterprise to a nearby Domain facility to make the necessary repairs. But what at first seems to be an act of peace and friendship soon turns out to be a devil’s bargain, as Kirk and the Enterprise crew learn that there are perhaps more differences than similarities between the Federation and the Domain. When the Goeg’s adversaries strike again, the Enterprise is drawn deeper and inexorably into the conflict, and Kirk begins to realize that they may have allied themselves with the wrong side....

Pax River is the nation’s top Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Center for Naval Aviation. This $40 billion enterprise employs over 22,000 professionals working on cutting-edge technology, including drone systems and cybersecurity innovations. That kind of leadership experience is rare and can’t be overstated.

Why does this matter? Pax River is at the forefront of drone technology and cybersecurity. It plays a key role in developing unmanned systems that are secure, reliable, and mission-ready. It’s also a hub for testing advanced systems that require robust cybersecurity protections. Having someone who commanded this operation brings CTM a unique advantage. Glen Ives not only understands the technology but also has a deep network of high-level contacts in defense, government, and technology sectors. These connections give CTM access to opportunities that other companies can only dream of.

CTM’s locations also make a difference:

* **Bethesda, MD**: Just 10 miles from the Pentagon, 27 miles from NSA and U.S. Cyber Command, and 9 miles from DARPA—key hubs for defense and cybersecurity.
* **Vienna, VA**: Right in the Dulles Technology Corridor, a hotspot for defense and tech innovation.

These locations help CTM:

* Build relationships with decision-makers and secure contracts.
* Collaborate with federal agencies and military branches.
* Tap into a top-tier talent pool and advanced resources.

CTM also stands out because of their recent success with **OASIS (One Acquisition Solution for Integrated Services)** contracts. They were awarded **all four unrestricted domains** they pursued under the OASIS Unrestricted IDIQ Contract. These contracts are incredibly exclusive and only given to companies that meet high standards for providing professional services to federal agencies.

What makes OASIS contracts special? They open the door to massive opportunities across defense, cybersecurity, and technology development. Being awarded all four unrestricted domains means CTM can compete in a wide range of federal sectors without limitations. These domains cover services like cybersecurity, advanced systems engineering, and defense solutions. This allows CTM to secure long-term, multi-million-dollar projects without constantly rebidding. It’s a reliable revenue stream and a way to scale operations significantly. Simply put, these contracts validate CTM as a trusted partner for federal agencies and position them to thrive in a competitive industry.

Why does this matter? Pax River is at the forefront of drone technology and cybersecurity. It plays a key role in developing unmanned systems that are secure, reliable, and mission-ready. It’s also a hub for testing advanced systems that require robust cybersecurity protections. Having someone who commanded this operation brings CTM a unique advantage. Glen Ives not only understands the technology but also has a deep network of high-level contacts in defense, government, and technology sectors. These connections give CTM access to opportunities that other companies can only dream of.

CTM’s locations also make a difference:

* **Bethesda, MD**: Just 10 miles from the Pentagon, 27 miles from NSA and U.S. Cyber Command, and 9 miles from DARPA—key hubs for defense and cybersecurity.
* **Vienna, VA**: Right in the Dulles Technology Corridor, a hotspot for defense and tech innovation.

These locations help CTM:

* Build relationships with decision-makers and secure contracts.
* Collaborate with federal agencies and military branches.
* Tap into a top-tier talent pool and advanced resources.

CTM also stands out because of their recent success with **OASIS (One Acquisition Solution for Integrated Services)** contracts. They were awarded **all four unrestricted domains** they pursued under the OASIS Unrestricted IDIQ Contract. These contracts are incredibly exclusive and only given to companies that meet high standards for providing professional services to federal agencies.

What makes OASIS contracts special? They open the door to massive opportunities across defense, cybersecurity, and technology development. Being awarded all four unrestricted domains means CTM can compete in a wide range of federal sectors without limitations. These domains cover services like cybersecurity, advanced systems engineering, and defense solutions. This allows CTM to secure long-term, multi-million-dollar projects without constantly rebidding. It’s a reliable revenue stream and a way to scale operations significantly. Simply put, these contracts validate CTM as a trusted partner for federal agencies and position them to thrive in a competitive industry.

Trip Report - 18 Days Solo in December w/ Photos,JapanTravel,1hqcb3y,2024-12-31 05:48:57,100,0.95,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1hqcb3y/trip_report_18_days_solo_in_december_w_photos/,Jigumina0929,Trip Report,"Hi everyone, I just came back from Japan a few days ago. I've sort of lost count of the number of times I've been to Japan, but it's definitely in the double-digits now. However, this is my first time writing a trip report so I hope you enjoy reading it! I did also have to trim this down a lot as reddit gave me an error saying I'd gone past the character limit with my original report. Feel free to ask questions if you have any!

# Itinerary Overview

* Day 1-2: Tokyo
* Day 2-5: Nisekohirafu
* Day 5-6: Otaru
* Day 6-8: Sapporo
* Day 8-10: Noboribetsu
* Day 10-11: Hakodate
* Day 11-12: Nikko
* Day 12-18: Tokyo (Enoshima/Kamakura day trip on Day 16)

# Background

* Took ¥300K in cash but used my credit card for some of the larger items during the trip.
* Booked a flight using points.
* Brought a check in and carry on and didn't end up using luggage forwarding services, but this is mainly because I enjoy bringing my luggage around with me. I even feel a bit uncomfortable when hotel staff offer to carry the luggage for me to my room. However, I definitely recommend that most people use it.
* 25 years old and pretty introverted.
* Bought the 30 day 25GB Ubigi eSim, of whicn I used 19GB of, and the connection was fine.
* I can read Hiragana and Katakana. I can also read Kanji and understand the meaning but don't know the onyomi/kunyomi for most of them, and if I do, sometimes not knowing which one should be used when.
* Packed about a week's worth of clothes and planned on buying more as needed during the trip. Also brought my own toiletries as I prefer them to the ones provided by hotels.

# Itinerary

I'll be linking albums of images for each day and linking them in the heading for each day. Also, I'll be separating the cost of accommodations from all other expenditures.

[**Day 1: Tokyo (Steps: 11771 / Cost: ¥7216 / Accommodation: ¥8687)**](https://imgur.com/a/1HAlvDp)

* Arrived at Narita Airport made it through immigration in about 30-40 minutes.
* Took the Keisei Narita Skyaccess to Daimon Station and checked into my [hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C2N5dRxJFwjqD4b67). It was just your standard business hotel.
* Went to Shinbashi Station to get my SUICA (which I thought was funny seeing ""様"" (sama) added to the end of my name), then had udon for dinner at [Oniyanma Shinbashi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2Dy4LrNGpwgW5Lzr6). It was very average but warmed me up as it was chilly that night.
* Walked back to my hotel and stopped along a LAWSON along the way.
* Had melatonin pills to help me adjust time zones from EST to JST (just make sure to only take the recommended dosage).

[**Day 2: Tokyo / Nisekohirafu (Steps: 16778 / Cost: ¥8687 / Accommodation: ¥11230)**](https://imgur.com/a/ht2DRXz)

* Went to **Meiji Jingu** early in the morning. It was super quiet and peaceful without the crowds, and I highly recommend coming here before it gets boisterous.
* Walked to **MEGA Don Quijote** in Shibuya to buy some things I hadn't packed like the Senka facial foam and Rohto Mentholatum lip balm. Was basically a ghost town in the morning.
* Returned to my hotel to check out and took the Tokyo Monorail to Haneda Airport.
* Got on an ANA flight to New Chitose Airport, then took the train to Kutchan Station. Tons of trains were delayed that day from the weather and snowfall, and the lines in the airport bound for Sapporo were about 150-200m long, so barely made one of the last two trains heading to Kutchan that evening.
* After arriving, I took the free bus to Hirafu then dragged both luggages across the snow and ice to my [hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/79yfsin34a3Vo3Lz5). The rooms were surprisingly spacious and came with a small kitchenette.

[**Day 3: Nisekohirafu (Steps: 13650 / Cost: ¥16873 / Accommodation: ¥11230)**](https://imgur.com/a/wkU4nGB)

* Ate breakfast at the hotel as it was included as part of my booking. Was a buffet style and was pretty forgettable as there weren't many options.
* They offered free rides to the ski resort, which I took advantage of, then acquired my 2-day resort pass along with ski rentals for **Niseko Tokyu Grand Hirafu**.
* The snow was a bit used up and icy, and I ended up falling a couple times at the beginning of the day, but the weather was sunny and mild.
* For both lunch and dinner, I ended up getting an assortment of things to eat from LAWSON on the walk back to my hotel.

[**Day 4: Nisekohirafu (Steps: 10865 / Cost: ¥2559 / Accommodation: ¥11230)**](https://imgur.com/a/ghOJutR)

* It snowed a ton during the night, so the fresh powder in the morning was amazing. As it was the early season, a lot of it remained pretty unused as there weren't too many people on the slopes. This might've been the best snow I've experienced in a few years which is even more surprising as this was part of the early season.
* There were snow storms on and off during the day, and when it was heavy, I could barely see 10m in front of me, but also didn't feel scared coming down.
* Had similar meals for lunch and dinner as the previous day by dropping by the LAWSON.

[**Day 5: Nisekohirafu / Otaru (Steps: 21344 / Cost: ¥55991 / Accommodation: ¥12181)**](https://imgur.com/a/PZVVzxr)

* Woke up early and the staff were kind enough to drive me to Kutchan Station (getting a taxi in Nisekohirafu's pretty difficult and would've cost about ¥5000) and I caught a train bound for Otaru at around 08:00.
* Dropped off my luggage at my [hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6A1bAmx7nWt2rXaPA) then headed to **Sankaku Market**. The hotel was pretty new and I appreciated the relatively tall ceilings in the room.
* Had the Takinami Don at [Takinami Donburi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tR5rgWbRVa9dehTXA) inside the market. The seafood was super fresh and I had just beat the crowd as I was able to be seated immediately but there was a line of 20+ people by the time I left.
* Got ice cream from [Yamanaka Dairy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FA633YNtcKZRCs8c6) on my walk down to **Otaru Canal** and it was pretty good.
* Walked along the canal then headed to Sakaimachihondori where most of the glass stores were located. Spent a few hours walking around and looking at cups I wanted to purchase.
* At the end of the street, I stopped by **LeTAO** for dessert. This place was a massive disappointment, and personally, I think people who say the cheesecake here's good haven't had good cheesecake.
* After, I took a look inside **Otaru Orugoru** to find any music boxes I wanted, and ended up purchasing two: songs from Mononoke Hime (hands down the best anime movie) and Laputa.
* I also bought four cups from **Kitaichi Glass** that were super cute.
* I went to [Yabuhan Soba](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hEzZpRPJhpD8s4eY7) for dinner and got the uni soba along with tempura. It was some of the best soba I've had and really warmed me up after spending most of the day out in the cold.

[**Day 6: Otaru / Sapporo (Steps: 15864 / Cost: ¥77580 / Accommodation: ¥8874)**](https://imgur.com/a/YcBTSEf)

* As breakfast was included, I ate at the hotel before checking out to take the train to Sapporo.
* Before leaving Sapporo Station to go to my hotel, I purchased some train tickets I would need in advance (Sapporo to Noboribetsu, Noboribetsu to Hakodate, Hakodate to Nikko).
* After dropping off my luggage at the [hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GrnM7PaJV8hAvYsm8), I just wandered around the Susukino and Odori Park area. As I had a bit of time, I visited the **MEGA Don Quijote** and bought a few lighter items I'd be bringing back tax-free.
* When it was just past sunset, I headed to **Sapporo TV Tower** to get a view of the city illuminated at night. Odori Park was especially beautiful with all the Christmas decorations glowing.
* After spending about half an hour observing the city, I went down to the Christmas Market right in front and it was interesting seeing how many European themed stores there were.
* For dinner, I had みそバターコーンらーめん (miso butter corn ramen) and a side of gyoza at [Sapporo Ramen Haruka](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NenVj2EcP196b7Bh6), and it was definitely worth the half hour wait. They were even kind enough to distribute hand warmers to everyone in line although it wasn't particularly cold that evening. If there's anything I regret, it was not getting additional butter as they provided a generous amount of corn.

[**Day 7: Sapporo (Steps: 20848 / Cost: ¥46976 / Accommodation: ¥8874)**](https://imgur.com/a/QV4EtKS)

* Early in the morning, I headed to **Nijo Market** to get 三色丼 (uni, crab, ikura don) at [Daiichikaisenmaru](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5bVaaMDEWcQvnL73A). It was pretty good and the crab legs were super sweet.
* After breakfast, I went around the market and bought some strawberries before returning to my hotel. They were some of the sweetest strawberries I'd had in a while.
* I then took the Sapporo Shiden to **Sapporo Fushimi Inari Shrine**, and it was super empty. I saw three people during the 20 minutes or so I was there.
* Went to **Hokkaido Jingu** which was mostly tour groups from China, but it was pretty quiet as it didn't seem like there were any guides leading large groups of people.
* Took the subway back to Odori Park and wandered around the area some more, buying nailclippers at **Tokyu Hands** and Kessoku Band We Will album at **animate** before taking a break at my hotel.
* For dinner, I went to [Sushisai Wakichi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PR2MZR8QTk3WyY8H6) (Tabelog Bronze and 4.31/5). I arrived about 15 minutes early and ended up striking a conversation with someone else who was also there for the second seating at 20:30. When the staff noticed us, they led us to a waiting room a served us tea before guiding us to the main dining counter. By coincidence, I was sat next to the person I had been waiting with outside, and she and I talked throughout the evening (I apologize for my terrible conversational abilities as an introvert) while enjoying the amazing dishes. The staff were also helpful and handed out cute cards with paintings of the seafood along with the names in Kanji, Furigana, and English. I'd say my favourite course was either the flounder with monkfish liver or the uni and I highly recommend you visit this place if you're in Sapporo.

[**Day 8: Sapporo / Noboribetsu (Steps: 8942 / Cost: ¥1154 / Accommodation: ¥24195)**](https://imgur.com/a/WK6yG17)

* Spent the morning repacking some of my luggage then reading for a couple hours.
* Checked out and took the train to Noboribetsu Station. By the time I arrived, it was snowing a ton.
* As my [accommodation](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2SJKKVGCgxPvyNVx6) offered free shuttle service to and from the station, I took advantage of it and it was a 15 minute ride.
* I went to check out **Jigokudani** near sunset then had some black sesame ice cream from [Milky House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Z4Z11yjfiZnA51AFA) on the walk back.
* The room was very spacious as it was normally intended for 3-4 people, but as ryokans are usually priced on a per person basis, it was relatively cheap. They also had free sake and alcohol during the day in the lobby along with other free drinks well into the evening. Also, the place was clean and the staff were super friendly.
* The dinner service was pretty good and the chestnuts and mushroom in the rice was a nice touch. I do always feel uncomfortable during ryokan meal service though as I personally feel like they're overly respectful with all the bowing and taking care of even the most minor things themselves.
* Spent the night soaking in the onsen for a couple hours as I was able to easily cool myself from the heavy snowfall that night. It was also surprisingly empty as I had the onsen to myself for most of the time there.

[**Day 9: Noboribetsu (Steps: 12623 / Cost: ¥9860 / Accommodation: ¥24195)**](https://imgur.com/a/SPPAm1H)

* Woke up early to hit the onsen before breakfast service. Breakfast was pretty good but I was also very full and decided to skip lunch for the day.
* Ended up reading and watching youtube throughout the day and soaking in the onsen a couple times to relax as this was the middle of my trip.
* Also went to walk to Jigokudani as the weather was much nicer than the previous day.
* As I had skipped lunch, I ended up ordering mackerel and snow crab in addition to the regular dinner course, and it was definitely worth it. It was also nice that it was pretty fairly priced at ¥2200 for both.
* Hit the onsen one last time late at night.

[**Day 10: Noboribetsu / Hakodate (Steps: 15949 / Cost: ¥6849 / Accommodation: ¥7003)**](https://imgur.com/a/3QMXHAF)

* As I had to catch an earlier train, I requested to have my breakfast service at 07:30 and went to the onsen beforehand at around 06:00.
* Got a ride to Noboribetsu Station and took the train to Hakodate Station.
* Dropped off my luggage at the [hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jgiP86hL1M2FCn6b7) which was right next to the station (another standard business hotel), then took the streetcar to **Goryokaku**.
* I did a full lap around before walking inside the fort, which was pretty empty, then went up **Goryokaku Tower** to get a better view of the fort from above. Due to the snowfall, it wasn't the best view, but the weather did marginally improve after I waited about half an hour.
* Afterwards, I headed back to my hotel to check in then went to **Hakodateyama Observatory** via the ropeway. The view was really nice as the day turned to blue hour, but it was absolutely crowded by tour groups as I guess they didn't have much else to do at this time of day.
* As the sky was turning dark, I made my way back down the ropeway, then walked towards the area around **Kanemori Red Brick Warehouse** via a detour along **Hachimanzaka**.
* For dinner, I had Hakodate shio ramen and gyoza at [Shinano](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dEdokgCezVvN1PVY8), which was only a block away from my hotel, and it was a good way to warm myself up after spending much of the day in the cold.
* As I felt warmed up, I went for a walk around the **Daimon Yokocho** area, which was surprisingly empty considering it was past 19:00, before heading back to my hotel to cap off the day.

[**Day 11: Hakodate / Nikko (Steps: 12039 / Cost: ¥5094 / Accommodation: ¥11880)**](https://imgur.com/a/iGOxQjN)

* Woke up early to get breakfast at **Hakodate Morning Market**.
* Both restaurants I wanted to try were closed even though it was a day of the week they were normally open on, so I settled on eating at [Ajidokoro Kikuyo Shokudo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4siLTArQgRqwShxk8). Once again, I ordered the donburi with uni, crab, and ikura and it was great.
* Spent a bit of time walking around the market and seeing what the different shops had on offer.
* Went back to my hotel to check out, and got a bento from [Mikado](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jVHeqwuGtYTbgCeQ8), before embarking on my 6 hour long journey south to Nikko.
* The hosts of the [accommodation](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5EuCzpN28TGDEHb46) I was staying at were some of the nicest people I had ever met, and I also got an entire building to myself for a pretty good price.
* As it was near sunset by the time I arrived in Nikko, I went to quickly scout the area I'd be in tomorrow by walking along the Daiya River to the Nikko Toshogu area before making my way back along the main road, and getting myself a bento from FamilyMart (which I think might be the only convenience store in town) before walking back to my room.

[**Day 12: Nikko / Tokyo (Steps: 30196 / Cost: ¥13901 / Accommodation: ¥10050)**](https://imgur.com/a/tGek7vJ)

* I checked out and left my luggage with the hosts just early enough to arrive at **Nikko Toshogu** at opening time. The weather was super nice and there weren't too many people, so it was nice and peaceful while appreciating how the gold glimmered from the sunlight. I'm also glad I came early as the weather got cloudier as the day went on.
* As there was still some times until restaurants opened in town, I walked around the area for about an hour or two before making my way back to town.
* Unfortunately, like Hakodate, a lot of stores I had on my list were closed on a day they shouldn't have been, but I found one yuba restaurant on my list that was open, so I went there.
* I had the 日光生ゆば懐石膳 (which I think they just called the special yuba course in English) at [Nagomichaya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mLSchYrdWCoW2KeT9), and I think even people who aren't fans of tofu or yuba would enjoy this meal.
* As I still had some time left before I needed to take the train to Tokyo, I went for a walk to **Kanmangafuchi** and it was completely empty. I didn't see a single person during the hour or so I was there, and it was amazing.
* When I went to pick up my luggage, the hosts were kind enough to drive me to Tobu-Nikko Station, where I took the train to my [hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dUo1JvMN9e1FK5NX7) for the next five nights. It was another standard business hotel.
* As it was close to Akihabara, I went to [Sushiro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/viwdk3A2iSf2b4ZY8) for dinner. I'll never understand the people who say conveyor belt sushi being better than sushi back home. Sure, it's very affordable, but the fish quality's pretty average, and it's less like sushi and more like a piece of fish being thrown on top of rice here. Still a decent meal if you're looking for something cheap and quick though.
* After dinner, I began my scouting for anime goods in Akihabara, seeing what each store had to offer and at what price. I also ended up getting [three Bocchi the Rock bookmarks](https://www.reddit.com/r/BocchiTheRock/comments/1hhr5v5/btr_in_akiba_ended_up_with_3_nice_bookmarks/) and a Hoshino Ai keychain before calling it a day.

[**Day 13: Tokyo (Steps: 30369 / Cost: ¥127716 / Accommodation: ¥10050)**](https://imgur.com/a/2rRHlXg)

* Arrived 30 minutes before the opening time for **teamLab Borderless**, and luckily, I was the first one in when they let me in 20 minutes before opening. The atmosphere was completely different from the previous time I was here when it was packed, and honestly, was infinitely more enjoyable this way. It took me around 40 minutes to make one round of the place, where by the time I had gotten to the area with the waterfall, it was completely packed. Personally, I think that if you want to experience this exhibit at the fullest, try coming early as there's a chance you might be allowed in before the official opening hours.
* Afterwards, I walked to Shinjuku to look at some used cameras, but first went for lunch at [Fuunji](https://maps.app.goo.gl/A3MdK7NRCjDYCwmAA). Honestly, this place isn't worth the wait in line, and the ramen was just average.
* After visiting several camera stores in Shinjuku, I ended up buying an A6400 from **Map Camera**.
* Took the train to Kichijoji Station, and the streets around it were completely packed. I had originally planned on walking around and looking at the different shops here, but ultimately decided against it, and went to **Inokashira Park** after making a quick round of the streets. This was definitely the right call as I had an amazing time just relaxing near the pond and even went around it a couple times at a very relaxed paced.
* As it was getting close to sunset, I opted to walk to Inokashirakoen Station instead of Kichijoji as I didn't feel like re-entering the crowds, then took the train to Shimokitazawa to have a walk around the area. This place was also pretty crowded, so I didn't end up spending much time walking around where most of the clothing shops were, but from quick glances, it looks like this place has devolved to become more ""touristy.""
* However, I was mainly here to visit **Village Vanguard** and scout the area around **SHELTER**, so I hopped back on the train after only half an hour or so. As I was heading up north, I stopped at [Ippodo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Wgn2wRoT89z4JVHJA), where I bought two tins of matcha and ten bags of hojicha, then walked the rest of the way back to my hotel.
* For dinner, I had unagi at [Nodaya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7dcmSQ1zqDfryox58). The eel here was seasoned just right for my tastes and cooked extremely well. Although this place is on the more expensive side, it definitely made up for it with the massive eel portions.
* I had originally planned to get some takoyaki right next to Iriya Station after dinner, but I was super full and ended up taking a walk to **Sensoji** instead. Sensoji still had some crowds, but nowhere near the chaotic mess it is during the day, and it was actually quite pleasant walking around.

[**Day 14: Tokyo (Steps: 24274 / Cost: ¥61104 / Accommodation: ¥10050)**](https://imgur.com/a/tnClbmI)

* Started off the day similar to the previous day, but going early to **teamLab Planets**. They only opened the exhibit about 5 minutes early so there was a line, but luckily, I was able to still navigate through most of it without seeing anyone. If you only have time for one of the two main teamLab exhibits, my vote would be to visit Borderless as I find it more impressive and immersive.
* Planned on going to Tsukishima for lunch, but there was still some time left to kill, so I walked to **Tsukiji Market** to see if anything had changed since previous times I've visited. And it was for the worse. The only way I can describe it is that it's now at least the 8th level of hell and is a complete tourist trap that was completely packed with crowds. The only enjoyment I got out of this place was looking at all the ridiculous prices and names of things at different shops and laughing inside that there were lines for these places. My advice is that you should definitely skip the market.
* For lunch, I went to [Koboreya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pat7F8MDhfUxZFDE9), which is a bit off of the main monja street, but I'd say this was the best monjayaki I've had. I was also lucky as every seat but one were all taken by Japanese customers who reserved in advance, and I was there to snatch the remaining seat. I ordered 旨辛坦々 as I wanted something a bit spicy, and the spice level was mild and pleasant. The only downside was that I ended up smelling like grilled meat from the ground meat that was part of the monja I ordered. As I was walking to Tsukishima Station after my meal, I noticed that some of the more popular monja shops were fully booked for the day, so it might be worth reserving a spot.
* Quickly went to Shibuya to visit **Tower Records** to buy Into the Light and Re:Kessoku Band to complete my Kessoku Band album collection along with the Mononoke Hime OST.
* Took the subway to Kudanshita Station then slowly made my way east to my hotel while visiting the various old and used book shops. As a bonus side quest, I tried to find 将太の寿司 (Shotanosushi) without any assistance, but I failed. Maybe I'll find it next time I search around.
* Took a shower and a break at the hotel before taking the train out to Kawaguchi Station in Saitama. I actually really like the vibes of the area right outside the station.
* For dinner, I had reserved a seat at [Sushi Inomata](https://maps.app.goo.gl/83guQ3bnYfbNAhbz5) (Tabelog Silver and 4.43/5), and the best way to summarize the meal is that this is the best sushi I've ever had. However, if I had to choose my favourite course, it'd be the snow crab (he only serves it only about 2 months of the year) which was served hot and an explosion the crab's sweetest in my mouth. Even though it is a bit out of the way from Tokyo, it's definitely worth visiting.

[**Day 15: Tokyo (Steps: 22010 / Cost: ¥90464 / Accommodation: ¥10050)**](https://imgur.com/a/39PHPDP)

* Started the day a bit later as I planned on going to Kappabashi and most stores didn't open until around 10:00. Took the subway to Asakusa and walked west.
* Spent a good few hours looking at various stores. Ended up buying a matcha brush as my existing one had already worn out a decent amount and also bought a 130mm petty with a SPG Strix blade from [Kiwami](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DBufEjKEeEd94uhZ7). The staff were super friendly and helpful there while putting no pressure at all on making a purchase, and they're definitely worth checking out.
* Walked to Ueno for lunch and Ameyoko was absolutely packed and I didn't even try to walk through there. For lunch, I had 上ロースかつ定食 (special pork loin cutlet) at [Tonkatsu Yamabe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FV6Gam6nvtf4tY6Y8), and although there was a very short line, I was seated within 10 minutes. It was pretty good and priced pretty affordably.
* Until sunset, I roamed around Akiba once again scouting for anime merch.
* I had soba for dinner at [Kanda Yabu Soba](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BfV5DuEo1NXpYSHs8) and it was pretty mediocre and slightly overpriced. The only positives were that it had a ton of seating and it was a way to warm up.
* I then headed to Ippodo to buy another couple of matcha tins then spent the rest of the evening walking around Marunouchi to observe the Christmas illuminations.

[**Day 16: Tokyo / Enoshima / Kamakura (Steps: 20287 / Cost: ¥9420 / Accommodation: ¥10050)**](https://imgur.com/a/PAxOs8C)

* In the morning, I took the train to Katase-Enoshima Station.
* Went for a walk along the beach next to Enoshima Aquarium before heading for lunch.
* I've enjoyed shirasudon previous times here, but [Enoshimakoya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3oYcqLU3WhCdop3w9) was out of ingredients for the day, so I ended up ordering the makanaidon, and it was amazing. The fish was super fresh and they served very generous ratio of fish to rice compared to most seafood donburi restaurants.
* Walked across to the island, and although the main street leading up to **Enoshima Shrine** was pretty crowded, the crowds immediately disappeared once I got up the stairs.
* Enjoy walking around and slowing making my way to **Chigogafuchi**. Ended up getting some takosenbei and Cremia along the way there.
* After walking up and down a bunch of stairs and sitting next to the ocean for a bit, I made my way to Enoshima Station to take the Enoden to Kamakura. It was super empty, but a massive crowd of people flooded on board at Kamakurakokomae, and my guess is that they were all there for the next new trendy social media clip. Personally, I think they're wasting their time because the best part of the Enoden Line is just to relax and enjoy the views of the oceans and neighbourhoods you'll see.
* Made my way up **Komachidori** with haste to spend as little time within the crowds and went to **Tsurugaoka Hachimangu**. I really like the view from the top of the stairs looking down Kamakura towards the ocean.
* While walking around the many different paths around the shrine, I spotted a couple students holding birds and taking pictures, and some tourists also joined to take photos of their own which I found kind of funny.
* Made my way back to Kamakura Station along **Dankazura**, and took the train to Shimokitazawa. I had dinner and killed a bit of time at McDonald's then went to [SHELTER](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1y9aXgPjbjy5tyjb6) for a concert \[[reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BocchiTheRock/comments/1hp8kv5/i_went_to_watch_bocchi_irl/)\].

[**Day 17: Tokyo (Steps: 26552 / Cost: ¥36880 / Accommodation: ¥104363)**](https://imgur.com/a/R4leRo3)

* Spent the morning being a bit lazy by reading while having youtube on in the background.
* After checking out, I brought my luggage to the [Imperial Hotel Tokyo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xH4SRh3RDtkdeZ2p6) for my final night of this trip. I left my luggage with the front desk then went to do some last minute shopping. I went to Don Quijote to get a couple of sake (Dassai 39 and Choya Yuzu), then went to Akiba to buy Oshinoko Volume 16 Special Edition along with a Raiden Shogun acrylic.
* While in Shibuya, I went to [UobeiGoulabe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MTxgdLTT6qdwsqmq9) for lunch, and it was very similar to Sushiro, with items costing about 5-10% more here but there being a few more options. I'd say I would personally prefer Sushiro, not due to the food, but because I can get a table, whereas the staff will seat me at a counter seat here. The ginger was definitely fresher here though!
* After returning to check in, I took a bath, then spent the rest of the day relaxing, before heading out for dinner that night.
* I reserved a seat a [Ginza Kitagawa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/f5MyUinpJedwnvGD9) (Tabelog Silver and 4.36/5). The meal was excellent, and I think this had the most memorable restaurant atmosphere I've ever been to. I think it might be some of the most interaction the chef had with the non-Japanese customers, and I really appreciate that considering that he said he's not very comfortable with English. It also helped on this occasion that there was a Japanese couple who were very proficient and made the communication even smoother. Definitely gets a recommendation from me.
* I was pretty full so I wandered around Ginza and Shinbashi for a bit before returning to my room for the night.

[**Day 18: Tokyo (Steps: 10338 / Cost: ¥19063 / Accommodation: N/A)**](https://imgur.com/a/l5cHDPm)

* Woke up pretty late and played the great game of luggage tetris where I try to organize my luggage to fit everything nicely while not exceeding the check in luggage weight. Surprisingly, it wasn't too difficult this time around.
* Took both a bath then a shower before checking out and leaving my bags with front desk to head out for lunch.
* I went for yakitori at [Omino](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VYbJ9NMu2xFMz786A) and it was the most disappointing meal I've ever had above ¥10000. The presentation of everything was decent, but I'd say the food all kind of tasted similar from course to course, and I've had better yakitori for less than half the price. Maybe the main store near Tokyo Skytree's better, but I personally wouldn't come here again.
* As I was feeling pretty full, I walked back to my hotel, but stopped in **Hibiyakoen** for about an hour to enjoy the moment and digest the food.
* Picked up my luggage and took a taxi to Hamamatsucho to take the Tokyo Monorail to Haneda. Ended up reading near my gate before waiting to board the plane.

# Thoughts & Miscellaneous Points

* Maybe it's because I've been to Japan a fair number of times, but for me, I don't really feel like I miss Japan once I get back home. I'm actually glad to be back home. But it also doesn't mean I didn't have fun, as I definitely had a blast. Not sure how to describe that feeling though.
* As someone who's used to snowy winters, it isn't something I think about too much, but you should bring a decent amount of moisturizer (e.g., lotion, hand cream, foot cream, etc.). Also, make sure to bring sunscreen and sunglasses. You'll thank me when you're out on a sunny day where there's a ton of snow on the ground.
* Although I didn't focus much on affordable meals during this trip, you can definitely find a ton of restaurants for about ¥1000 or even less that are going to be pretty good. Don't think that you have to spend a ton for meals.
* For long distance transportation, don't forget that there are options outside of the shinkansen. The only reason I took a 6 hour train from Hakodate to Nikko was that it wouldn't be much better to take the plane to Tokyo then take the train to Nikko (although I guess you could make the argument to stay in Tokyo then make it a day trip on another day).
* Try not to have too many things planned for the day, and even if you have something planned, being flexible's a good idea. Some of the best time I have is just wandering around. Also, it's okay to feel like sometimes you're not doing much. You don't have to always be doing something (e.g., I just saw X and there's an hour until we booked tickets to Y, so I have to fill this gap with Z). You're on vacation so enjoy your time. I won't say don't do the timetable thing if you enjoy that though because I know there are some people who like packing their day and trying to do as many things.
* There are definitely more non-Japanese people working in customer facing jobs (at least within Tokyo) than I remember seeing in past trips so maybe it'll be easier to use English, but it's still probably a good idea to know some basic Japanese phrases.
* If you're staying in one accommodation for a while, it might be worth looking at supermarkets or grocery stores as alternatives to convenience stores to see if they're available, as they'll both have more variety of drinks and snacks from my experience and probably be a bit cheaper. You can even get ingredients to cook with if you have access to a kitchen or kitchenette."
"Jack From BioShock (STR, INT, LCK, MELEE, GUNS, EXPLOSIVES)",Fallout4Builds,1hpyqkq,2024-12-30 17:00:05,3,0.8,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout4Builds/comments/1hpyqkq/jack_from_bioshock_str_int_lck_melee_guns/,CausalLoop25,Luck,"**ROLEPLAY**

* Jack is known for being a silent protagonist, so make your dialogue options as neutral and concise as possible. I recommend downloading a mod that removes your voice from dialogue for maximum immersion. Also, I don't know if anyone in the game says ""*Would you kindly*"" but if they do, you MUST do anything they ask of you without question.
* As for what faction to join, I'd say The Railroad fits because they help genetically engineered people who have been ""*mind controlled*"" (*via synth components*) live free lives, which I know is a bit of a stretch, but I think Jack would sympathize.
* Quests that may fit the character are Diamond City Blues, Here There Be Monsters, Human Error, Last Voyage Of The U.S.S. Constitution, and the Far Harbor DLC in general.
* This build does not use companions, as Jack goes through Rapture almost entirely by himself. He does have people like Tenenbaum who help him, but nobody actually fights by his side. You can use unofficial companions like hacked robots, as Jack can hack security drones to fight for him, and I guess Dogmeat is ok as he doesn't count against the Lone Wanderer perk.

**WEAPONS**

* WRENCH - The **Pipe Wrench** is spot on to the one in BioShock, even sporting the same red color. It does 13 damage, costs 35 AP, and swings at a Medium rate. I recommend getting **Big Jim**, which has a 20% chance of crippling the target's leg. Because it swings at a decent rate, you can proc this effect often, leaving your enemies defenseless. If you add the Extra Heavy modification, it becomes even more ridiculous, as you not only gain extra limb damage and a higher chance to cripple, you gain +15 damage, making it solid for both stealth and open combat. If you can find one with the Freezing effect, mimicking the Frozen Field Tonic, that's even better, as using this build's high Luck, you can stunlock enemies to your heart's content with extra damage to boot.
* PISTOL - The **.44 Pistol** or **Western Revolver** is the closest match to the Pistol from BioShock, as they are all revolvers. The .44 Pistol does 48 damage with an AP cost of 35 and decent accuracy/range. The Western Revolver does 60 damage with a lower AP cost of 28, slightly better accuracy, and vastly better range. To represent the damage upgrade from BioShock, I would give both of them an Advanced Receiver, which also increases the rate of fire.
* MACHINE GUN - The **Submachine Gun** is closest to the Machine Gun in BioShock, as they are both based on the Thompson. It does 10 damage with a very high fire rate, an AP cost of 35, and decent range/accuracy. To represent the damage and recoil reduction upgrades from BioShock, I would give it a Powerful Receiver and a Recoil Compensating Stock.
* SHOTGUN - The **Double-Barrel Shotgun** is closest to the Shotgun in BioShock. It does 45 damage with an AP cost of 30 and poor range/accuracy. It excels at close range against squishy weak spots like enemy heads, although you have to use it wisely as you only get two shots before reloading. To represent the fire rate and damage upgrades from BioShock, I would give it an Advanced Receiver, which improves damage, rate of fire, and trigger sensitivity. If you get one with the Explosive effect, not only does it represent the Exploding Buck from BioShock, it also makes it a judiciously effective weapon as each pellet explodes for separate damage.
* GRENADE LAUNCHER - Unless you use weapons from the Next-Gen Update, specifically the **Chinese Grenade Launcher**, there is no good equivalent to the Grenade Launcher in Fallout 4. I recommend not using it simply because it's overpowered and makes the build moot.
* CHEMICAL THROWER - The Chemical Thrower uses several different ammo types, so several different weapons are required to match them all. For Napalm, the **Flamer** fits the most, specifically when fitted with the Napalm Tank modification. For Liquid Nitrogen, the **Cryolator** fits the most, with the Standard Barrel, Recoil Compensating Stock, and Glow Sights. For Electric Gel, the **Tesla Rifle** fits the most, although this one is more of a stretch considering it is not a heavy weapon like the others. Modify your Tesla Rifle with an Automatic Barrel for the closest match.
* CROSSBOW - There is no good equivalent to the Crossbow in Fallout 4. The closest thing you can get is the **Syringer**, which also ties into your Plasmid abilities quite well.
* RESEARCH CAMERA - There is no good equivalent to the Research Camera in Fallout 4 since it has no **Codac R900** like in New Vegas, so just ignore this one.

**""PLASMIDS""**

* ELECTRO BOLT - Electro Bolt is already covered by the Tesla Rifle. However, **Pulse Grenades** also make for a good substitute, dealing 150 Energy Damage to both organic and robotic targets. Just keep in mind they aren't affected by Demolition Expert.
* ENRAGE - The best fit for Enrage is the Syringer with **Berserk Syringes**, which have a chance to frenzy targets for 30 seconds, making them attack anyone nearby.
* HYPNOTIZE BIG DADDY - Since there are no Big Daddies in the game to hypnotize, the best fit is the Syringer with **Pax Syringes**, which have a chance to make targets peaceful for 30 seconds, meaning they won't attack you unless attacked first.
* INCINERATE - Incinerate is already covered by the Flamer. However, **Molotov Cocktails** also make for a good substitute, as they inflict decent damage upfront and lingering burning damage in an area, and are quite common and easy to craft.
* INSECT SWARM - The closest equivalent to Insect Swarm is the Syringer with **Bloatfly Larva Syringes**, which cause Bloatflies to spawn from killed enemies.
* SECURITY BULLSEYE - Security Bullseye is best represented by the **Total Hack** magazines, as you can make turrets, robots, and spotlights turn against your enemies.
* SONIC BOOM -The closest equivalent to Sonic Boom is definitely **Lorenzo's Artifact Gun**, which creates a telekinetic blast of force that staggers, damages, and cripples opponents. Opponents that are knocked down will be tossed around, it can hit the shells off Mirelurks without killing them, and even hit a Sentry Bot's Fusion Cores through its armor. While it has rare and expensive ammo, it packs enough utility and power to make up for it in spades.
* WINTER BLAST - Winter Blast is already covered by the Cryolator. However, **Cryogenic Grenades** also make for a good substitute, dealing 101 Energy Damage and slowing down anyone caught in their blast radius. While it doesn't exactly freeze them solid, it's still pretty useful to keep your distance from fast enemies like Feral Ghouls and Deathclaws.

**APPAREL**

* Since there is no white sweater like Jack wears in-game, the **Sweater Vest And Slacks** are the closest match I can think of. They provide no armor but give +2 to Charisma, making trading and passing Charisma checks easier due to this build's low natural Charisma. They can be found at General Atomics Galleria, the Jamaica Plains Town Hall basement, and Fallon's Department Store. Once you unlock Ballistic Weave, you can upgrade them to have 110 Damage and Energy Resistance, making them much more viable for regular use.
* The **Covert Sweater Vest** is a ""*unique*"" variant of the Sweater Vest And Slacks awarded to you by P.A.M. for each DIA Cache mission you complete. They provide 10 Damage and Energy Resistance and only +1 to Charisma. Compared to a fully Ballistic Weaved Sweater Vest And Slacks, they are worse in every way. They can't even be upgraded with Ballistic Weave.
* If you want to go by the Big Daddy outfit Jack wears at the end of the game, the **Rescue Diver Suit** is your best bet. It provides 10 Damage Resistance, 10 Energy Resistance, and 250 Radiation Resistance as well as the ability to breathe underwater. Both it and the Big Daddy's suits are based on the general old-timey diving suit design, so I think it works quite well."

Weekly Discussion LI: 2024 Member Survey RESULTS & comments on the year ahead,monarchism,1hp0sik,2024-12-29 12:23:48,16,1.0,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/monarchism/comments/1hp0sik/weekly_discussion_li_2024_member_survey_results/,ToryPirate,,"Earlier in December we posted our semi-annual member survey. We had 126 responses. This is half the number of responses received in 2022 (which itself was a drop). Fewer responses as the subreddit continues to increase in size is not a great trend and some thoughts will be shared regarding this after the survey results. This is the first survey since Uberbobo7 stepped back from active moderation so it was a bit rough around the edges as the mod team decided to try new things. Overall, it had its hiccups but I think some useful data was collected.

This post covers roughly the first 20 questions from the survey. The remaining questions are a bit more 'in the weeds' and would benefit from cross-referencing other responses. That is more work than I'm willing to do in under a month. Those results will be released at a later date.


---

**Results**

---



**Question 1: How active are you on r/monarchism?**



I post and/or comment rarely, and mostly lurk. (49) 38.8%

I only lurk. (42) 33.3%

I post and/or comment regularly. (32) 25.3%

I neither post and/or comment nor lurk and visit r/monarchism rarely. (3) 2.3%



Overall, the numbers are encouraging with fewer lurkers and more engagement with the subreddit. Of course we can't discount the possibility that lurkers simply didn't fill out the survey this year but they have in the past.



**Question 2: Why do you visit this sub?**



To get news about monarchies/monarchism (103) 

To learn about monarchism (70) 

To discuss monarchism (68) 

For the memes (55)

To find resources related to monarchism (49)

Other (14)



The numbers are pretty consistent with the last survey. Discussion of monarchy took a bit of a hit which is something to watch going forward. These numbers are cumulative and most members come here for more than one reason.



**Question 3: How did you find r/monarchism?**



By searching for monarchism on Reddit/Google (87)

In a history sub (10)

In a political sub (8)

Elsewhere on Reddit (14)

On a Discord server (1)

Other (6)



These numbers continue a historical trend of people finding this subreddit because they are actively seeking out monarchist communities.



**Question 4: How long have you been a member of r/monarchism?**



Under 1 month (11)

1-6 months (19)

6-12 months (18)

1-2 years (38)

2+ years (40)



Its kind of crazy that the number of people who have been here less than a year is roughly equal to those who have been here 1-2 years which is itself roughly equal to those who have been here 2+ years. Still, I'd expect the +2 year crew to be larger. However, this trend isn't overly inconsistent with previous years.



**Question 5: Do you like the current look of r/monarchism? (e.g. banner, icon)**



I like it (41)

I like it, but wouldn't mind if it was updated (63)

I don't care either way (16)

I don't like it, but I don't think that it should necessarily be updated (2)

I don't like it, and think it should be updated (4)



Not much to say here. If you guys are happy with it we're happy with it. However, it is great to have general agreement we can change it if a cool design idea comes along.



**Question 6: On a scale of 0 (very bad) to 5 (very good), how satisfied are you by the way r/monarchism is moderated?**



5/5 (37)

4/5 (62)

3/5 (21)

2/5 (2)

1/5 (2)

0/5 (2)



We probably want to cross-reference this question with the one on political leanings at some point but for now sufficed to say people are mostly happy with the moderation. We will be looking to add at least a few moderators in the first quarter of 2025 to keep up with subreddit growth.



**Question 7: What is your age group?**



0-12 (1)

13-18 (37)

18-25 (61)

25-35 (20) 

35-50 (6)

50-65 (1)



Much like in 2022 the 18-25 category dominates.



**Question 8: What is your location?**



Europe (including Asian parts of Russia) (61)

North America (39) 

\-Canadians (11)

Asia (excluding Near and Middle East) (9)

Australia/Oceania (9)

South America (3)

Near/Middle East (2)

Other/Prefer not to say (3)



I was able to add in the numbers for Canada using the answers to another question. I'll have to double-check but this may be the lowest percentage of Americans...ever. In 2022 Americans constituted 31% of the subreddit population. They now stand at 22%.

It would be nice to know where this growth is centered and next year I believe we will return to asking for specific countries.



**Question 9: What is your ethnicity? If you are American, state the ethnicity of your ancestors.**



European (Caucasian) (94)

Asian (11)

Mixed (5)

African (Black) (4)

Hispanic American (4)

Near/Middle Eastern/North African (4)

Native/Aboriginal (1)

Other/Prefer not to say (3)



This is largely consistent with previous surveys although the increase in Asian members may be statistically significant. This is another question I feel would benefit from additional options.



**Question 10: What kind of country do you live in?**



My country is currently a monarchy. (54)

My country abolished its monarchy and is currently a republic. (45)

My country is a republic without a monarchic past. (27)



**Question 11: Ideology Chart (see image)**

This experiment with combining two previous approaches to measuring the political make-up of the membership turned out rather well. A few interesting trends:

Groupings - Social Democrats and Libertarians (along with Centrists and Moderates) displayed fairly well-defined ideological groupings. Conservatives, Traditionalists, and especially Reactionaries had much less defined positions. This may indicate that more precise terms need to be used or that the relative traditions admit a more broad array of beliefs.

Liberal vs 'Liberal' - Similar to the previous point, Liberals were all over the place. Apart from the ideological diversity there is in that tradition there is also the added wrinkle that 'liberal' is short hand for left-wing in the American political tradition. 

Extremism - Despite a recent criticism regarding this subreddit that 'fascists and theocrats' are taking over the subreddit, this marks a new low for the support of both. The last survey that asked for ideological self-identification was 2020 when \~3% identified as fash. This has dropped to 1.5% of the total. A further 1.5% identified as Theocrats. If these numbers are to be believed the subreddit is in no danger of take-over by extremists. If you look at positioning on the compass instead, you have three who occupy the general areas on the compass you'd expect to find fascists (0,+10). The presence of a self-described Fascist in the Libertarian quadrant is also questionable. In short it is arguable that extremism has continued to decrease since 2020.

\+10 and -10 - I don't view any of the responses at the edges of the graph to be overly trustworthy. Some seem to be trolling, others are political statements, and one strikes me as a person being insecure about their ideology and putting the response that says 'I'm the best at my ideology, please believe me'.

Left-Right Spectrum - Okay, this may only be interesting to me but along with the typical left-Libertarian to Right-Authoritarian axis we have a somewhat less well-defined Left-Authoritarian to Right-Libertarian axis present. As far as I'm aware no country has this political axis (personal theory is its too unstable) so it was a treat to see one show up in the data. 

This graph is one I intend to keep around as a) its a pretty neat way to display the data and b) it covers the short-comings of either ideological or political compass positioning on their own.



**Question 12: What are your economical beliefs?**



Social capitalism (European/Nordic model) (45)

Free-market capitalism (26)

Mixed economy (25)

Corporatism (12)

Distributism (8)

Feudalism (3)

Socialism (3)

Communism (1)

Other/Prefer no to say (3)



How would I describe these results? You all aren't exactly anti-capitalism, more like 'capitalism wary'.



**Question 13: What is your religion?**



Christian (81)

\-Latin Catholic (49)

\-Other Protestant (Baptist, Evangelical, Methodist etc.) (9)

\-Anglican (7)

\-Eastern Orthodox (7)

\-Christian (Other) (5)

\-Lutheran Protestant (4)

Atheist (21)

Hindu (2)

Muslim - Sunnite (2)

Baha'i (1)

Buddhist (1)

Other/Prefer not to say (18)

In what, is in my mind, an incredibly unsurprising result; members of a political subreddit are more political than average. Cue Surprised Pikachu Face.

The relations between the religious and non-religious on this subreddit has been a recurring issue over the last year. Overall, there is a pretty even spread from super religious to not religious at all. I'd argue this is a good thing (different perspectives and all that) but it does mean that there isn't really an amount of religious content that will make everyone happy. The faithful need to realize that for many monarchy is a separate ideal from religion but the secular too should also realize that for many monarchy is, if not an obligation of their religion, at least tied to it. I suppose this is just a ramble-y way of me saying ""Can't we all just get along?""



**Question 16: What political or philosophical thinkers do you like (if any)?**



Saint Thomas Aquinas (8)

Aristotle (6)

Thomas Hobbes (6)

Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn (5)

Joseph de Maistre (5)

Plato (5)

Philosophers are listed above by how many people listed them and then alphabetically for ones mentioned only once. Despite some people only using partial names there is only one whose identity is uncertain. As one poster noted, just because you like a philosopher does not mean you necessarily agree with them which is a very mature mindset in my view.



**Question 17: What current content creators/YouTubers in the monarchist sphere do you like (if any)?**

 

Lavader (21)

Charles A. Coulombe aka. Tumblar House (4)

TMC (3)

Matt Baker aka. UsefulCharts (2)

Dave Green aka. The Distributist (1)

Imperial Britannia

Le catho de service

Monsieur Z

Pax Tube 

Pilgrim's Pass

Rudyard Lynch aka. Whatifalthist

Sacred Kingship

The Two Cities Podcast 



A few interesting results. Charles A. Coulombe is the only person to show up both on this list and the list of philosophers. Also, many of these channels listed can be more accurately described as 'traditionalist' or 'right-wing' rather than 'monarchist' in any meaningful sense.



**Question 18: What type of monarchy do you support?**



Ceremonial (4) 3.17%

Constitutional (29) 23%

Positive Semi-Constitutional (44) 35%

Negative Semi-Constitutional (19) 15%

Traditional (18) 14%

Absolute (8) 6.34%

Other (3) 2.38%

This question has for several years needed an update but at the same time the lack of change has allowed shifts in opinion among the subreddit's membership to be observed. We finally updated it this year but tried to do it in a way that maintains the usefulness of previous survey data. We did this by splitting categories. Constitutional was split in two with Ceremonial being added. Likewise, Semi-constitutional was split into two based on whether the law primarily defines what the monarch can do or whether the law defines what the monarch can't do. The Traditional category made it through and has been joined for the first time by an Absolute category. Aristocratic and Religious monarchy were removed as categories for the practical reason that neither really measures how much power a monarch should have like other categories do. The Religious category was further removed due to have fully bottomed out in terms of support. 

2024 continued several long-term trends. Taken together the Semi-constitutional options now has the support of about 50% of the membership, a historic high. Constitutionalism is the main casualty of this trend with a continuing decline. Traditional monarchy had a minor increase over last year but this seems to have come about by absorbing the Aristocratic category. Both ends of the power spectrum; Absolute and Ceremonial, scored low. Overall, the subreddit has slowly converged on a middle option of a monarch with some power counterbalanced with a (presumably democratic) legislature.

Going forward these categories will probably remain unchanged for a while. The inclusion of an 'Other' category would probably be the first to go in any future changes as its not clear to me what other options exist outside the ones presented.



**Question 19: What is your opinion on monarchy?**



I only support certain types of monarchies. (72)

I support monarchy regardless of its type. (53)

I do not support monarchy (I am a Republican). (1)



**Question: 20: Where do you support monarchy?**



I support monarchy globally, including the creation of new monarchies in countries which have no monarchical past. (84)

I only support monarchy where it has a historical basis, certain countries are better off as republics. (41)

I do not support monarchy (I am a Republican). (1)



**Summary of Comments:**

1. Less low-effort content (see below)

2. Less extremism (Based on the survey I have my doubts this is really an issue)

3. Survey too long (it will be shorter next year)

**End of Results**

2023-4 marked a major change in the subreddit. Uberbobo7 stepped back from active moderation. This did leave a bit of a gap to fill as for many years Uber was the senior-ranking mod involved in day-to-day moderation and directing the mod team. That role, as became clear over the course of 2024, has fallen to me. I have made a few priorities: more moderators, more structured debate, make the subreddit a useful tool for monarchists, and a return to doing these surveys after last year's just didn't happen. In this the other moderators have been a great help. **TheFaithfulZarosian** continues to be an absolute beast in dealing with approvals/removals and **HBNTrader** and I have been taking turns with proposing weekly discussion topics. Our newest mods **Blazearmada21** and **TexasJaeger** are fitting in and recently finished their probationary period. Structurally, the mod team is fine and I believe the high level of confidence in the mod team expressed in the survey bears this out.

However, there has been a tension over religious posting and low-effort posting. I will note right off the bat that as long as a post is related to monarchy it doesn't matter how religious it is, it stays. That said, one idea that I am going to be looking to adapt from another subreddit I moderate in the year ahead is 'one post per topic'. Simply put, in any 1-week period the first story posted becomes the 'standard bearer' for that discussion topic. Any other posts on that topic will be removed and its poster directed to the main thread. I would like to see less fractured discussion (and more in-depth discussion) of topics related to monarchism.

On a related note; historical images are going to face more scrutiny. We will be opening up Saturdays as 'Scrapbook Saturdays' where images (with a descriptive title) can be posted. Images posted on any other day must have a paragraph giving the image context (although still subject to the one post per topic rule). I have heard that images can be hosted on a subreddit's wiki page and, barring some technical limit, I want to create a gallery of monarchy-related historical images. 

Regarding the year ahead, I am encouraged by the work **HBNTrader** is doing trying to organize IRL monarchist action. We are in a period of history where republics have never been more challenged by the contradictions inherent to their system of government. Monarchists should be making arguments for their vision of good government because if they don't, if this moment is lost, history will judge us harshly, I feel.

In March we will once again be making an open call for moderators. At current growth rates I think every six months is the right frequency. In the past we tried to have a mix of constitutionalists vs absolutists. That has largely become a dead distinction as the membership converged on semi-constitutionalism. Now, the main axis of debate seems to be progressive vs conservative (because of course it is) and we are endeavoring to keep a balance in this regard.

I would like to thank everyone for making r/Monarchism what it is today and wish everyone a Happy New Year"
ATX Uber Drivers - Beware “M’Beke” in Cedar Park. ,uberdrivers,1hozsjc,2024-12-29 11:40:22,18,0.85,51,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hozsjc,Pariah-6,,"So, I get a ride from downtown to Cedar Park early this morning, about a couple of hours ago. After dropping off the PAX I get a ride back down to north Austin off of N. Lamar. That’s great!! A ride back down to Austin from all the way up north to Cedar Park, I accept the ride. I get to the PAX address and it’s her and her mother (I think). When they get in the car and start driving, the girl says that she wants to add a stop, she then begins to explain that she wants to do a round trip. Now, I’m actually pretty upset, I’m not mad so much as I’m pissed that I’m going to have to come back to Cedar Park. I say, that’ll be fine as she is adding the stop. Driving down wasn’t an issue, there was no traffic, she talked to her mother in a very loud tone and I just focused on driving. When we get about 2 miles to the destination she says that I’m going to have to get into a “line”. I asked her “a line?” And she said, “yeah, you’ll see it”. Now, there was an address but I wasn’t familiar with the address so I didn’t exactly know where I was going or if I was misinterpreting if SHE needed to get into a line. 

When I was driving up north Lamar I see what she means and I see where we’re going. We’re going to the Muslim Community Center and there is a long row of about 35 cars going down the shoulder of N. Lamar. She says that I have to get to the back of the line. I begin to explain that this is not what the add a stop is used for, I explain the add a stop feature is to quickly park, the PAX gets out and makes a quick stop no longer than 5 minutes. She says that previous drivers haven’t had an issue and they’ve done this several times. I said, “okay, is there not a place that I can drop you off and you can wait to get what you need and call another ride?” She says that she’s not getting out of the car and this is to pickup food for her aunt or something. She begins to try to tell me that previous driver cut infront of others that were waiting and maybe we can try that. I tell her I’m not getting into confrontation with people and cut infront front of them. 

So, I’m waiting in the back of the line at a complete stop, the line isn’t moving. I put the car in park and start reading an article on my phone, it takes about 30 minutes for the line to actually move and move from the shoulder of N. Lamar to the actual Community Center. Essentially, it’s a literal food drive, you just stay in your car and pop a trunk and the people place food in your trunk. I didn’t have an issue when the line got moving and the people putting food in the trunk were pleasant and nice and respectful of my vehicle. So, the total time we were stopped was about 40 minutes. 

As we are driving back and I’m gettin on 183, she snaps at me out of nowhere and says “PLEASE, PLEASE DRIVE MORE CAREFULLY!” I asked her what she was talking about and she just repeated herself. I said “well, I’m sorry if there is bumps, there’s construction around here and I can’t help if we hit some bumps”. She says “I know you’re upset, but I have a right as a passenger to tell you to be careful”. It was really bewildering cause I didn’t speed the whole way and I’m a real careful driver. I tell her I’m not upset and she starts to speak over me and says “yes, you are, I know you are”. I just said “whatever you say” and kept on driving. We get back to her house and she doesn’t say anything to me (her mother didn’t even speak to me the whole ride) and I just rated her 1 star and kept it moving. Not even a minute passes and I get an email from Uber about complaints and she marked that I was swerving, distracted by my phone, not polite and communication issues. 

So, for any ATX driver that’s driving up in Cedar Park on the weekends that gets a ride to N. Lamar, DON’T TAKE IT!! It’s a trap. I get the feeling that she orders this ride and complains regardless of the outcome (unless the driver grovels to her every demand). The fact that she still gets to rate people after making a drivers wait more than 10 minutes is insane. The fact that Uber should automatically end rides that have a stop if it goes over a certain amount of time is astounding. I feel some of us as drivers have these issues because the fucking ants out there give into every demand that a PAX has, and when they come into contact with us, who are just trying to make money and follow the proper standards and guidelines of the app get fucked because we’re not bending over backwards for them. 

The real shitty thing is that I’m real hesitant to do rides with stops now that this has happened. I like helping people out from time to time and a pretty understanding guy. The fact this chick is ruining it for the rest of the PAX fucking sucks. I guess I need to start asking before I even start a ride “you don’t need to add a stop, do you?”. Cause if I rider needs to add a stop before o even start a ride, it’s a cancel 100% of the time. If she would’ve put it that it was a round trip from the start I would’ve never accepted the ride. 

Oh, yeah. The whole ride was recorded by my dashcam and through Uber recording the ride through their record feature also. 

TLDR; Pax adds stop after starting the ride making it a round trip. Pax tells me I have to wait in a row of cars for a long time. Pax attempts to bait me into an argument by stating I’m driving unsafe. Pax rates me 1 star and reports that I had an argument with her that never happened. Whole ride was recorded. "
Remembering an Afghan Man on FOB Shank. ,MilitaryStories,1hoj297,2024-12-28 19:03:05,156,1.0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryStories/comments/1hoj297/remembering_an_afghan_man_on_fob_shank/,Impossible-Layer8300,US Army Story,"Not a super crazy story but I think about this guy from time to time. 

In 2014 I was on my first deployment at FOB Shank. I was an Apache Helicopter Repairer so I never left the FOB besides a Blackhawk helicopter flight and a flight on PAX flight on a turbo Prop plane to transfer locations. 
I didn’t really meet any locals other than those at the barbershop and the bazaar on the FOB. 
I’m someone who’s been studying history and collecting Militaria since I was 13, so of course when I was deployed I was looking for souvenirs, mainly from the Soviet-Afghan War era. 
If I remember correctly there were 2 different bazaar areas. One near the Small PX Shopette near the Afghan side and another closer to the barber shop and Defac. It’s been a few years 😅. 
In my company, we set up a days off schedule where every man between Day Shift and Night shift could get a day off every 10 days. For those not familiar with Attack Aviation in a line company, we run 24 hr operations split between our 2 platoons. We did midnight to noon and Noon to Midnight. 12 hour duty days is the standard for all aviation personnel to minimize the effects of  human factors. Safety consciousness is extremely important. Helicopters aren’t humvees or MRAPs. 
If I remember correctly it Takes an O-6 and above to extend Pilot and crew Duty Days on a needed basis due to mission-which happened sometimes. 
So normally on my day off I would sleep in, then go walk around the FOB, catch the Shuttle bus to the PX for my lickies and chewies and cigarettes, go to Kings coffee for a chicken Burger and smoothie, and then walk around the bazaar. Maybe dodge some rockets and mortars along the way. It was a ritual for me. 
At the bazaar I would normally go to the same shop because this guy had Soviet medals, Afghan medals, old money, etc stuff like that. He barely spoke any English but he was very friendly and approachable. He gave off that “Giant Teddy Bear” vibe. Quiet and gentle personality, Pretty big guy, and Always wore a smelly man dress. I got to know him fairly well. He was from Kabul and had a wife and 2 children. He did this job to support his family. If i remember correctly he would travel back and forth every couple days or so. 
Now I would 100% overpay for the stuff I bought from him but I didn’t care. He told me he had picked some of this stuff up when he was young but alot came from other shops around where he lived. I just remember I would walk up and he would get so excited to show me something new he wanted to sell me. I probably spent around $200 over the course of going to his shop-which was probably a fortune to him. I never haggled prices because he was the most genuine seeming shop owner and I knew his personal life-everyone else was snooty and had that eye of greed. I mean I knew he was in it for the money too, I’m not naive. 
One of the last times I saw him, he told me his wife wanted to show me appreciation and bake me a cake. It was crazy to me that he must’ve told his wife about me and they wanted to show a gesture of appreciation. Sadly I never saw him again after that. I had to attend to duties on a different schedule and we also began to shift our mission set and then came the process of transferring everything to Camp Dahlke and close the main FOB. Everything pretty much shut down over the span of days. 

I tell this story because I’ve thought about him more and more after the Fall of Afghanistan. I know that the Taliban hunts anyone who worked with NATO Forces or had any type of relationship with them. I often wonder if him and his family are surviving still or if they made it out of the country. Ive long forgotten this man’s name but I have the most vivid memories of him. 
I still have the items I bought from him, and they’ve long since carried a different type of value to me"

The abuse of peer review and its discontents,academia,1hnuw2j,2024-12-27 20:47:18,21,0.86,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/1hnuw2j/the_abuse_of_peer_review_and_its_discontents/,Superb_Crab_8722,Publishing,"Hi all. Long-time lurker who is finally facing an academic mini-crisis and seeking advice. For an anonymity sake, I have changed the names and dates a bit, and will be vague about some of the specifics.

I am a first-year postdoctoral fellow at an American university studying the application of machine learning and large language models to another scientific discipline. About a year ago, myself and my lab mates came up with an interesting idea for how to apply a new technique to an old problem. We saw that no one else had done this and were excited to have found something unique. We quickly did some basic experiments, wrote them up, and submitted them to a \~mid-tier journal. In my specific field, it's one of the top five-ish journals but is still a specialty journal. It's a sub-sub-journal of something you've heard of.  During their peer review process, author names are visible, reviewer names are not; this is standard in my field. 

We submitted in January of 2024 and deposited a preprint. After that, there was a significant period of waiting, and I found that the journal had to request  16 different reviewers over the course of six months while we awaited our peer review. Eventually, they were able to gather a few reviews and gave us a decision of ""major revisions."" The reviews were mixed, both recognizing the novelty of our work, but also recognizing the limited scope of our (hasty) experiments; they suggested substantial additional experiments which would require months to build out. Because I felt that the journal was a good fit for this project and that the reviewers suggestions would improve the final product, we communicated this to the journal editor and began revisions. In the six months of waiting for review, there had been a couple of preprints that had been released that were related to our initial work, I skimmed them and thought they were mostly complementary - they cited our preprint, used slightly different methods. Overall, I didn't spend much time reviewing them. 

The revision experiments took almost five months. As I wrapped up the resubmission manuscript, I returned to our peer reviewer's comments to do a line-by-line response. I then started to notice something... our reviewer #2 had suggested a weird way to split up our experiments that was identical to one of the related preprints by ""Yen et al."" Yen is a post-doc at another American lab; his lab is very productive. I looked closer and saw some more oddities: reviewer #2 had suggested that we cite two older papers, one of which was partially relevant but whose first author was Yen; he gave a detailed explanation that had minutia about this old Yen paper. Of the five other suggestions reviewer #2 made, all ways to expand our work to broader aims, this Yen et al paper did each of them... making our findings quite a bit less novel. Some of the language was remarkably close--a string of 8 or so words phrased in a weird way to describe a common method. Even a subtle misunderstanding of the work's purpose was present in both the review and in Yen's paper. Interestingly, Yen gave the date for when data collection had started for his paper... two days after reviewer #2 recieved our manuscript. Looking closer at the preprints, I realized that three of the four came from the same lab and ""Yen"" was a 1st or 2nd author on all of them; all been submitted as preprints before we recieved our peer review comments, and one of the papers was recently chosen as an oral presentation at a high-profile ML meeting.

Obviously, I was convinced that reviewer #2 was this Yen character, and I was livid. I felt that the scientific peer review process, and this journal, had betrayed me. This guy had read our paper as part of peer review, suggested novel ways to expand the work, and then went to do them himself before we even had a chance to read his suggestions. He took our ideas to his lab and has now built a little team exploring different facets of this work while our paper languished. 

However - in some ways, I understand that this is partially ""good."" Our idea was solid - solid enough that one of the two people outside my lab who was forced to read our manuscript has now devoted most of his academic energy towards this topic. And in no way does his work constitute plagiarism; he cites our preprint in each of these follow-up papers and most of the ""overlapping"" work wasn't really ideas we had generated, but his suggestions for improvement. But obviously, it has left me disheartened, disillusioned, and mostly just mad.

We submitted our revisions a few weeks ago; I talked to a few mentors about how to handle this situation; each had different takes. Yes -- reviewer #2 is almost surely Yen and he has acted in a way that is antithetical to the peer review process. But making a claim like this is difficult, and if there is some chance I was wrong, we would look insane / paranoid. It's overall a bit of a faux pax to dig this much into a reviewer's identity. So, in our response, we decided to phrase it something like this: ""A few papers have been released that we consider to be in direct competition with ours (cite); these authors should be excluded from reviewing our revised manuscript as they have a new conflict of interest"". I think this allows the journal  editor the option to dig if he was interested, but if he doesn't care, then he probably wouldn't have cared either way.

However, emotionally, I am still struggling with this. I want to know if it truly was him, and I want him to be publicly shamed for abusing peer review. I know reviewing articles is a hassle, is unpaid etc, but I really try to help the authors (and journal) when I'm asked to review an article, and it kills me to know that some people are out there using it to farm ideas. 

For anyone who has been through this (likely all-to-common) scenario, how have you dealt with it? How do I get over this sense of being mistreated and continue in a productive way?"
Recent chances on winning a bid to upgrade to business class?,emirates,1hmv640,2024-12-26 13:56:58,1,0.6,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/emirates/comments/1hmv640/recent_chances_on_winning_a_bid_to_upgrade_to/,Consistent-Laugh8176,,"For those that have recently flown from MNL-DXB, what are the chances of winning a bid set to Poor (or the minimum) for a business class seat?

I’m planning to fly with my family (4 pax in total) but I want us all to experience flying business for the first time. Not sure if there would be enough available seats for everyone so I’m unsure if we should still try bidding. Wouldn’t want 1-3 pax to get upgraded with the rest left behind in economy.

Should we just buy biz class seats on the onset? Is it even worth upgrading with the standard pricing (roughly 3x economy prices)?

Thanks in advance for the feedback!"

Opponent was PaxInBello, they played solely legendary human creatures that interacted in really cool ways and got removal through ETB effects. I'd love to find the list (from a quick search the 5C legendary decks I'm finding online are a bit older/not exactly what I played against) or at least give props, rare to see a non-combo based unique deck at diamond and it was fun to lose to it!"

"Your ""Root Cause"" and do you really need to find it to heal?",SIBO,1hlnplf,2024-12-24 17:10:36,0,0.31,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1hlnplf/your_root_cause_and_do_you_really_need_to_find_it/,Available-Gas-6494,,"From my book-ready very soon-and FREE

 

**Your ""Root Cause"" and do you really need to find it to heal?**

I have no doubt what my root cause was. A lifetime of too much wine, over exercise, a type ""A"" personality, always ""on the go"", trauma from childhood, a ""not bad"" but not ""Great"" diet.

Your ""root cause"" could include all the above and perhaps many things connected to your current:

Diet-not only what we eat but what we read, listen to and watch.

Our beliefs.

Our environment-external as well as internal. Which may include the two above points as well as external factors/chemicals/pesticides/mould/drinking water/stress-a real biggie be it in the form of physical, trying to do too much or being a ""people pleaser"" and not setting time to nurture ourselves. Emotional-the demands that others place on us the way we handle our relationships, mental- the way we think and our internal dialogue.

It could be a simple case of food poisoning that sets things off. So you can see that the list goes on and on.

You can however overhaul your diet as well as your lifestyle by working on whatever YOU think needs your attention!

I feel too many people place to much emphasis on trying to discover why they feel the way they do rather than trying to fix the way they feel.

I've read posts where people ask for advice on whether or not one specific protocol/supplement etc  will fix all their issues. It may well be the case that it's possible.  
  
It's just that I've never read about it. Given that to date I've spent over 3000 plus hours reading, watching and listening to books/posts/podcasts, videos etc.

I believe the truth is that for many of us the way to help alleviate and fix the issues that plague us is simply to overhaul our diet. Most peoples diet=S.A.D -standard Australian or American diet)

Folks a lifetime of shitty eating/boozing/smoking/anger management issues(and it  is it easy to get angry when you've got a bunch of muppets running the country and petty little bureaucrats who delight in taking away your rights and shoving reams of red tape up your ass-okay kim that's enough..deep breathe.. LOL!) 

And overhaul our lifestyle.

I get it, and I understand that when we're sick we get nervous/anxious/panicky so we want to fix that. Now or at least ASAP!  
  
And we'll reach out to whatever the nearest ""quick-or ""quack"" fix is that we think is going to help us. I know I spent $5000 with a crap salesman doing a ""health intensive course"" and to be fair it was a legit course that had helped a lot of other people, however it did not help me and looking back now I know why.

The answers lie within ourselves and one of things I personally found I had to do was to ""let go""-Let go of the hatred and contempt I felt for a Government department that made my life miserable and cost me over $100,000 in lost earnings (The South Australian Transport department) but that's a whole other story and I had a part to play in that as well!  
  
Whilst I don't ""radiate"" love towards this bureaucratic entity I do understand that good people sometimes make very poor decisions -generally driven by others who have never and couldn't run a small business.

Rarely are things as simple as fixing your gut with a bit of ""Akermansia.""

For many of us we didn't get sick overnight. Its been a lifetime of accumulated bad habits that have finally brought us to the point where we're currently at.

So if you want to look for your specific ""root cause"" then go for it.  But while you're doing that, work on the things in your life that you can change-there will lots of small things that you can do that will all add up cumulatively to improving your overall mental, physical and spiritual wellbeing.

And the things you can't change?

Let them go, you'll feel a lot lighter!

(Insert deity of choice) Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change.

The courage to change the things I can.

And the wisdom to know the difference.

 

Pax Vobiscum.

 

 

The book is FREE for 2 weeks then I'll ask for a nominal $7 towards some of the time, considerable money and effort it's taken me to put this together.

I would really appreciate it if you feel that you have benefited from the content you could reach out and let me know(PM me)

I have finished my book  
  
""The Best Non Antibiotic Sibo Treatments (You May have) never Heard About""

I have listed of 50 different supplements from sleep aids to peptides-I have tried over 90% of these in my effort towards healing.

 

Many of the products listed are designed to help the bodies immune system with  improving mitochondrial function and lowering inflammation. It is my belief that we treat the body as a ""whole"" and rather than trying to micromanage the incredibly diverse gut bacteria by selectively using a specific strain of probiotic to ""heal the gut""

I'll also explain further non conventional therapies that may also help you physically as well as mentally.

Currently to date I have spent over $20,000 in the last 4 years and spent over 3000 hours reading and listening to books, podcasts and watching videos about how to ""get better.""

And as I have found out there is no doctor that I have ever been too that has been able to come remotely close to being able to help me resolve these issues. Many of them are about as much use as a chocolate teapot, and we can't blame them. The medical system (unless you have a great deal of money) is about 10-15 minutes in a doctors office with a complex health issue that cannot remotely come close to being diagnosed in that time so we are given a  prescription for some drugs all of which have side effects and may help or may make things worse.

Our health is in our hands.

The truth about this healing journey means that I had to completely overhaul my way of thinking, the way I dealt with my illness while waking up at 4am and going to a very physically demanding job every morning while at times feeling like I hope it ""all ends soon""-either my life or the illness I didn't care!

And while my digestive issues have mostly resolved I have other issues(car accident resulting in badly torn shoulder muscles and lots of inflammation) which meant that I had to completely change my approach to exercise which I love doing. As I have found out inflammation is not localised but rather systemic and this can cause gut ""flareups""

All of which made me not only look at my gut issues but has taken me on a real ""Bio-hacking"" journey. At the age of 65 I feel I have a lot of living left to do and as the father of a 15 year old daughter I'd like to one day walk her down the aisle without using a walking frame or stick!

I have personally found that using supplements is only a small part of the SIBO healing process. A complete change of diet and lifestyle as many of us have found is the answer.

I cover a range of topics associated with the buying and trying of these supplements. They are mostly all OTC(Over the counter) a few may be a ""practitioner only product"" which may require you to register for a session with a naturopath or a another healthcare practitioner before purchase, the rules on this are ever changing and I have found that 99% of the products I have used I simply buy from one of my trusted sources listed

·         How to take them

·         Benefits-What they do

·         Should I get ""tested""-The pros and cons

·         Ways to ""reframe"" your thinking and being very careful about what you read in forums.

·         Where to buy-trusted sources

·         Ways to overcome fear of taking supplements

·         Links to further information and videos!-The very best podcasts I have listened to for the quality of the information AND the way that information is delivered-no ""fear inducing"" rhetoric no highly scientific jargon that confuses the hell out of you.

·         Easy enough for just about anyone to understand and implement.

·         Free courses that you take that will help you understand your digestive system

The book may well give you ideas and tips to manage any chronic health condition, I hope it does know many people have suffered and are suffering far worse than I ever have and I honor their struggle. You can and will get well. You must believe that.

# Aboard the Pax Vindicator

Kyra Venh was a very good pilot, which was the entire reason she was on this state-of-the-art smuggling corvette turned biolab after all.  That, and a few poor decisions that essentially made returning home to the CIP out of the question for a good long while.  Really, just a little cocaine smuggling along with her actual job shouldn't have been such a big deal, but Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service on Albian Centauri disagreed.  It wasn't like a couple hours of detox and a week in rehab ever did anyone any real harm.  However, that royal pain in semi-honest businesswomen's asses had enough clout to make sure she wasn't safe across the whole coalition.  Sure, she was able to keep moving product on her own in a personal ship for a while, especially with the authorities focused on bigger problems, but without the legitimacy of flying for disaster relief, said authorities were getting closer and closer to hemming her in.  In comes a biologist from Pacifia with a job offer.  What could be a safer way to lay low than to fly a pacifist biologist around terraforming candidates?  These days trouble with the authorities wasn't so scary.  Dr. Persephone Morn wasn't so pacifistic as her countrymen anymore.

Dr. Morn's ""work"" had taken Kyra extremely far from nice, safe, empty planets in need of evaluation for future terraforming, and extremely close to the bigger problems that had taken up so much of the authorities' focus.  That problem being, of course, the ongoing war with the insane genocidal Dominion of Axxaakk.  Most people got their name wrong on purpose, but Dr. Morn had ruthlessly squashed that practice.  She called it ""looking at evil without flinching,"" but Kyra thought she didn't want anyone treating the Axxaakk with any humor in any way.  The good doctor had her reasons for that.  Any Pacifian would have reasons to want the Axxaakk taken seriously.

""Maintain orbit,"" Dr. Morn was saying softly as Kyra eased the yolk to make tiny adjustments in the ship's orbital trajectory, ""I need to be sure the deployment was successful.""

""The canisters landed in a huge farms and their tractors won't find them for like six weeks, if then.  Didn't you say they're a couple months away from harvest?""

""I said they're most likely two to three months away from optimal harvest time.  However, they might cut the grain early to ship it under ripe and ripen it via exposure to a catalyst upon arrival for processing.  More importantly, I need to know whether and how many delivery devices failed.""

Kyra adjusted the orbital path again to avoid a derelict satellite and said, ""The longer we stay here the more likely they are to notice we're not bumping into their orbital debris…""

""I realize that, Ms. Venh, but I require confirmation.  If you believe we are detected, please utilize your skills to make good our escape,"" Dr. Morn explained as Kyra glanced at her reflection.  Kyra thought that the dim glow cast by the various displays into the shadows of the cockpit gave her employer a sinister cast.

""It's not like we're sticking around to watch your… your… *creation* take effect,"" Kyra said, ""all we're getting is a signal from each canister, and for all we know that could have malfunctioned.""

""No, we are not waiting for Bloodblight to fully blossom, and we know that the deployment detection systems are resilient enough that malfunctions will be unlikely.  We'll perhaps never know for sure if we succeeded in removing an enemy agri-world, or perhaps we shall find out after the war,"" Dr. Morn was saying while Kyra quite involuntarily noticed her employer's eyes tighten at the corners and her mouth twitch upward in the reflection on one of the viewscreens in the cockpit.  ""Maybe we'll read their records of massive crop failures, inability to properly feed their slaves, and a noticeable drop in production of war materials at several of their industrial worlds.  Maybe we'll even read about what alternative food sources they resort to, local pests or vermin, perhaps just like the ancient Soviets, they shall turn to one another for vital calories.  Perhaps we'll never know for certain, but if I have confirmation of deployment, I shall be able to infer success.""

""You're talking about starving an entire planet.""

""No,"" interrupted the resident Digitan, L4m14, via speakers for her use, ""she's talking about starving several planets.  Just got pings from all sixty canisters, boss-lady.""

""Doctor,"" Dr. Morn corrected coolly.

""Sorry, doctor boss-lady,"" the feminine Digitan chirped cheerily, ""Anyway, it's a widely believed fact that an army marches on its stomach, so taking away their food will mean they can't march.  I'm not sure how that would help anything, since I'm pretty sure you can't march with internal organs and nobody marches in space anyhow, but organics are weird.""

""Those sub-sapient *creatures* systematically slaughtered every last man and woman on Second Chance, and they would have murdered the children too if they could.  They have proven as much on several planets.  Do you believe creatures capable of such an act should be left to persist in slaughter?""  As she was speaking, Dr. Morn began unconsciously tapping her foot, and her voice took on a cool hard quality that Kyra could only notice due to her familiarity with Dr. Morn.  Kyra thought there was hot hatred beneath that icy exterior, and had no desire to break through.

""No.  They need stopping, I won't argue with that,"" Kyra said quickly.

An alarm chimed, a display flashed, and Lam14 helpfully said, ""Four incoming patrol vessels, I'd say they're roughly equivalent to light system watch vessels, or maybe tugs with guns if we're comparing them to Republic of Terra vessels.  I know you're a CIPpie, but there's not a lot of standardization in the Coalition.""

""If you don’t mind Doctor, I think I'll get us out of here before we get caught.""

""Please do, begin our course to the fallback point and come to the dining room once you've made translation.  We shall discuss the available options for our next target then.""

""Mess it's called the mess,"" Kyra grumbled under her breath as her employer got out of her way so she could do her job.

When the *Pax Vindicator* was safely in hyperspace, Kyra stood up from the pilot's seat and stretched.  She only reveled in the satisfying way the popping sensations ran up her spin for a few seconds, and started making her way to the mess as requested.  The clean, smoothly paneled corridor was well lit, and gave the illusion of being in a nice building rather than a ship, probably because the previous owners wanted to smuggle in comfort.  They made Kyra feel as if she was in a clinic rather than at home in a ship.  Dr. Morn never gave orders, she merely requested certain actions be taken, and those requests were simply fulfilled.  Well, unless someone had a good reason the request could not be fulfilled and could explain it, and they'd better not waste any time in explaining it.

Dr. Morn and Thalys Grae were already seated at the elliptical table cleverly bolted to the deck.  Thylys was half-lounging on the cushioned seating built into the wall in his customary comfortable looking sweats while Dr. Morn sat rigidly in one of the two chairs opposite from the bench, and the pair were already eating what Thalys alleged was nearly as good as authentic Italian cooking.  Kyra realized she was starving, and even if she had no clue how close this pasta was to authentic Italian, it smelled heavenly.

""L4m14, are you available for a staff meeting?"" Dr. Morn asked the air.

""Sure thing, doctor boss-lady.  Point of order, please hire an engineer, you organics are surprisingly good at ship maintenance and emergency repair.""

""That course of action remains under consideration,"" Dr. Lumia answered, ""In the meantime please make use of Mr. Grae's assistance and the robotic frame.""

""Okie-dokie.  Just bear in mind that the lack of an engineer is a strategic weakness in your mission, and there is only so much I can do with systems management.""

""I continue to note your advice, could you please load the file 'Population Dense Targets' for me on a holographic display?""

Kyra was busy dishing up as much pasta her bowl could hold as the display flickered to life above the table, and she felt obliged to scoot her meal out of a translucent moon.  ""I guess you're going to ask me what kind of samples I can get you from these kinds of targets?"" Thalys asked as he used his pasta laden fork to call up a text description on one of the holographic planets.

""Indeed, Mr. Grae.  Again, if you can obtain samples of existing pathogens on the planet in addition to samples of blood and hair from the population, that would be ideal.  Fungal samples could also be useful, as well as samples of the local drinking water and food stores.""

""What's our focus?"" the squat, gruff man asked as his eyes scanned the text.

""Disruption of industrial capacity.  This can be accomplished via either disabling the production equipment or disabling the labor force, ideally I would like to achieve both in tandem.""

""Do you have what you need to engineer an organism to damage infrastructure aboard?"" Kyra asked after making absolutely certain there was no food in her mouth.

""Potentially.  It depends on what Mr. Grae is able to find on the planet we select.""

""Speaking of,"" Kyra mused, ""A planet full of industrial parks isn't going to be as easy to sneak around as a planet covered in farmland.""

""Indeed, Mr. Grae, do you feel confident in your abilities to infiltrate one of these targets?""

""Generally, yes.  So long as I don't need to actually interract with the locals, I should be fine.  The missionaries describe these places as half abandoned.  Lots of hiding places and ways to get around unseen in the lower levels.  Nothing jumps out to me as any easier than the rest, so the choice is probably gonna be up to whichever one you can sneak us close to,"" Thalys said to Kyra soberly.

She nodded and aggressively spun pasta around her fork, ""I'll need a couple of hours to study what you have on that.  It's probably all wrong again, but maybe it'll help me predict where and how they reinforced.""

Dr. Morn nodded and asked, ""Do we have any further concerns?""

""Supply,"" Kyra said instantly.  ""We have maybe another month's worth of fresh food aboard, and if we can't find another ice body soon water will start becoming a problem.  Then there's fuel, most of the viable gas giants behind enemy lines are just as valuable to them as they'd be to us.  More, since they're in a war against the Republic and the CIP and probably all the xenos too, and we're only one ship.""

""I suggest you plan our escape rout from whichever target you choose with resupply in mind,"" Dr. Morn said at length.  ""Now if you don't mind, I shall take the rest of my meal in my lab and begin some preliminary analysis.""

""Please add an engineer to your supply list,"" L4m14 chimed, ""It would suck if the ship got a reactor leak I couldn't fix and you all died since then the radiation would slowly corrupt my files, and that would mean I'm alone and crazy when I died which doesn't sound fun.""

""You have made your point Lamia,"" Dr. Morn said as she got up, ""and I will see if we can find an engineer available for our kind of work.""

""So, you think you can get me in?""

""Like I said, Thalys, I have to look over the data and then make my best guess about what holes in their security they've plugged.""

""Oh, so it's that you're worried about whether you can do the job?  Maybe you don't have what it takes to outfly these half-blind arrogant fools?""

""As apposed to?""

""Second thoughts.""

Kyra tapped her fork on the edge of her bowl and said, ""It started with contaminating one of their big lubricant sources.""

""Which is a bigger deal than most organics realize,"" L4m14 agreed cheerfully, ""ships and weapons have tons of moving parts that can break if not properly lubricated.""

""Yes, I agree.  Then we gave a couple of planets the sniffles.""

""Which lead to a supply shortage on the front that translated to dead Axxaakk,"" Thalys observed.

""Yeah, but now we're starving entire planets.""

""Yes, and?""

""I don't know, maybe we shouldn't starve billions of beings to death on purpose?""

""Hey Lamia, could you please pull up the latest posts in the Republican SAR Corps please?  The ones from that camp they found on that Clans planet?""

""Sure thing, buddy!"" she replied as the holographic display of potential targets was wiped away and replaced by a facsimile of a screen on which a video played.  It was obviously a feed from a helmet cam from how the view jostled and shifted from moment to moment.  The person who had recorded it was muttering a string of Catholic prayers as he swept his gaze across a scene of horrors.  The locals, a race of beetle-like people, were penned like animals, though any farmer would have balked at the conditions they were kept in.  The pens were choked with waste and corpses, the survivors were mutilated, and the purpose of the place was clear from the ichor covered sacrificial altar near the camp's center.

Kyra shut her eyes and said, ""I know, they have to be stopped.""

""Not just stopped, stopped forever.  And you know why I help the good doctor?  It's because the high-and-mighty, oh-so-moral Republic of Terra will eventually let those freaks surrender,"" Thalys punctuated his point by jabbing a fork full of twisted pasta at Kyra before continuing, ""They'll let the freaks have a second chance.  There's only one way to stop them forever.  Grow some backbone.""

""You ever been hungry, Thalys?""

""I can't get hungry!"" L4m14 very helpfully added.

""We know,"" Thalys said with an involuntary grin playing across his features for a brief moment.  ""I expect you mean more than have I ever wanted to hurry to my next meal?""

""Yeah, I mean like you ever had to make a loaf of bread or a half-rotten hunk of beef last a week or two?""

""No.  I expect nobody these days has gone through that.""

""As advanced as we are, all across Terran space, bad things still happen.  People still lose everything in fires, or storms, or quakes.  Ships still crash, stations still fail, and people fall through the cracks even in very wealthy systems with strong planets to support them,"" Kyra explained softly.

""I take it you were one of those fallen people?""

""Yup!"" L4m14 exclaimed, ""It was a whole big de-""

""Thank you,"" Kyra almost shouted over her digital crewmate's enthusiasm, ""but the point is I know what it's like to go hungry, and if I had to choose between dying in a battle and starving, I'd pick the bullet every single time.""

""And I'd agree with you,"" Thalys said easily as he spiraled his fork in his bowl, ""if we were talking about starving people.  Besides, our next target won't be starvation, the good doctor will come up with something quicker.""

""Exactly, since they're not Terrans, or allied with Terrans, and killing Terrans, who I like, they don't count as people, so it doesn't matter how they die!"" L4m14 agreed with chipper enthusiasm.

Kyra glanced toward the video being displayed and said, ""I'd like the targets back please.  I have a lot of work to do.""

""Okie-dokie,"" L4m14 said before rambling, ""Speaking of targeting, I think a new episode of One Piece just dropped.""

""I thought the pirates found the treasure island or whatever,"" Kyra said as her mind struggled to shift gears.

""Well duh,"" Thalys said in the superior tones of a nerd who watches a niche show, ""But then the original crew found another island with a portal to-""

""Well, if you weebs are going to nerd out,"" Kyra interrupted with all of the patience of someone who does not care about niche shows, ""I'm going to take my pasta to my room and go over this data in peace.""

""Sure thing, I'll send the files to your desk,"" L4m14 said as Kyra did just as she said she would.

""I should have the target picked before we're out of hyperspace,"" Kyra told Thalys.

One study and planning session, and a second trip through hyperspace later, and Kyra was imitating orbital debris entering the atmosphere of what Dr. Morn had called ""industrial target six,"" and was aiming for a section of the planet which was likely deserted for a landing.  Once again, she found herself wishing they could figure out how the Republic's scout's stealth drops worked.  From what a scan of the planet had revealed, debris crashing to the surface from orbit wasn't unusual, so the locals probably wouldn't glance twice at the *Pax Vindicator* until she could fly her below the planet's radar floor.  Hopefully nobody had noticed the scan, but then again, the Axxaakk ships and some of the derelicts in orbit were constantly sending out signals, so their scan was probably lost in the noise.  Even so, the cockpit was entirely silent.  In fact, other than Kyra herself, it was completely unoccupied.  Despite their inexperience with such things, they appreciated her vivid description of how difficult it was to make a ship appear to be another chunk of debris on uncontrolled entry while actually maintaining tight control, and just how horribly wrong such a maneuver can go.

Once they'd made it to the planet's surface, Kyra hovered until L4m14 let her know that Thalys and his vehicle were safely disembarked, and then she activated the ship's built in jamming equipment and hoped that nobody would be looking for a dead zone moving away from the planet in their sensors.  Most  authorities overlook that possibility, and likely this Dominion had very little of its own smuggling to worry about if what the Republic said about their culture was to be believed.  From what Thalys told her, Kyra could believe that everyone who needed a bit of extra food was too terrified to try their hand at her trade.  She didn't exactly like being grateful to the rulers for their brutality, but that did mean nobody was looking correctly as she escaped the planets gravity well and settled into orbit around a barren and unutilized planet in the system.

Then, so long as the local Axxaakk didn't suddenly realize that checking unoccupied bodies is how you make sure you don't have clandestine bioterrorists lurking around, her job was done for a week.  Even so, every day she awoke with the mantra, ""Complacency kills, kills you dead,"" and shrugged into her flight suit and blearily stumbled her way to the cockpit to review a report of the nights activity L4m14 had prepared for her, and then settled in to the riveting task of watching the target planet to make sure there wasn't a patrol headed their way.

""You know,"" L4m41 chipperly said by way of her usual greeting, ""I can totally do this for you and you can keep sleeping.""

""Sure, sure, and if you need my tallents you can totally wait half an hour for me to get my coffee and finish waking up.  Speaking of coffee…""

""I remembered,"" L4m14 said and caused the lights around the cockpit's coffee machine to flash in pattern.

""I don't care what the cops say, you're an angel, Lamia,"" Kyra nearly sang as she filled a spill-proof thermos tumbler with the black gold before adding an obscene amount of sugar and milk.

""My old ship had this really great espresso setup,"" the digital voice lamented, ""and a neat little robot arm I could use.  I got pretty good at making lattes.""

""Thalys might have an aneurysm if we put a robot arm in his domain.""

""If he didn't have good taste in anime, I'd resent him for not sharing.""

""There's no such thing as good taste in anime,"" Kyra teased as she sipped nectar of the gods.

L4m14 affected hurt and affronted as she replied in kind, ""Blasphemy!  How could you say such a thing about the highest art form?""

""Maybe I don't like looking at a show where only the main characters have interesting character designs and the rest of the screen filled with animated tits.""

""I'll have you know that Thalys and I only appreciate the finest of animated boobies,"" L4m14 replied haughtily.

""Speaking of Thalys, any word from him yet?""

""Yup.  Apparently he's found an absolute treasure trove of pathogens already, both viral and bacterial,"" L4m14 cheerily announced.

""Any chance we can pick him up early and retreat to give the good doctor a chance to work?""

""Maybe, he's started some cultures, but he wants to see about fungal opportunities.  His report says there's already a lot of illnesses around where he's collecting already, so the population already has poor immune systems.  Basically, there's a chance he'll want to get samples of everything he suspects if he can.""

""It's more important to be smooth than it is to be fast,"" Kyra reminded herself as she took another sip of heaven.

""Yup,"" L4m14 agreed, ""and smooth retrieval will mean more effective pathogens, which will mean we can more effectively take out this production center.""

""Pathogens?""

""Yeah, from the preliminary samples, it's looking like disabling the population will be the way to go this time,"" L4m14 told her cheerfully, ""especially since these Axxaakk are vulnerable to pathogens in the first place.""

Kyra fell silent and focused on the images from the extermination camp in her memory to remind herself who deserved what in this war.

And so the week proceeded.  Kyra made sure the enemy didn't know they were there, L4m14 maintained the ship's systems, and Dr. Morn began preparing to modify the pathogens being cultivated by Thalys on the ground.  Of course, there were those little moments of stand out events from the routine.  L4m14 needed assistance from Kyra to fix a leak in the air conditioning system, and Dr. Morn made another of her disastrous attempts at a casserole, for example.  But otherwise, the week seemed to slide by into the past with all of Kyra's other mistakes until she found herself imitating debris again.  This time with a different target in mind, and this time right under the belly of a patrol vessel to give herself the widest possible window of escape.  A week of watching the enemy had given her a pretty good understanding of their patrol pattern, after all.

Extraction went smooth, and so did leaving the system in favor of a star with a few useless planetoids in its orbit where Dr. Morn would be able to ply her talents without fear from the Axxaakk.  It was one load off of Kyra's shoulders, since the most dangerous part of the operation was behind them, at least the most dangerous part concerning her particular skills.  She suspected that even the slightest slip in the lab from either Dr. Morn or Thalys might kill them all, but Kyra tried not to worry overmuch about things outside her remit.  The less she knew about just how dangerous the pathogens were, the happier she'd have been.

However, Dr. Morn saw no reason to hide anything from her, and consequentially, progress of her work was a frequent topic of conversation.  Kyra didn't blame her though, because it wasn't as if she had much else to talk about.  ""Sample B forty-two shows promise,"" Thalys was saying, ""The models show it could severely weaken an Axxaakk for over a month if they're healthy, and the population at the target is anything but.""

""I'm leaning more toward sample G thirty-three,"" Dr. Morn replied with a flash of her eyes, ""the models show it has the potential to cause more damage over a shorter time frame.""

""It also shows that the spread will be limited since the host population is likely to die out before it spreads to another planet,"" L4m14 chimed in.

""Aren't we trying to disrupt their war effort in the widest way we can?"" Kyra asked as she tried to order her belly to stop turning summersault inside her.

""Certainly,"" Dr. Morn answered smoothly, ""but we are also experimenting.  A swift extermination reduces the chance of spreading, but also reduces the chance of the virus mutating to become less deadly, and reduces the chance of the Axxaakk developing countermeasures.  If we can confirm planetary effectiveness, we can begin to develop the pathogen for use across their blood-soaked empire.""

""And if they're all gone, they can't go around killing innocent kids for their insane god anymore,"" Thalys agreed before saying darkly, ""But if they do develop countermeasures, they'll have realized we're here.  Or that someone is attacking them the way we are.  It's one hell of a risk, Dr. Morn.""

""I like the ship I'm living on not being blown to bits and killing me and the organics I like,"" L4m14 said, ""but the fewer enemies there are, the more likely the war will be over soon, and the organics can go back to only fighting pirates and cartels and stuff like normal.""

""What you're talking about means more than just confirming some bacteria got released into some grain fields,"" Kyra said carefully.

""A longer  observation period would be ideal,"" Dr. Morn acknowledged, ""and I should like to record the effects of the Weep for future reference.""  Kyra suppressed a shiver at the upward twitch of Dr. Morn's lips and the warmth of her voice at the pet name for her latest creation, and listened to Dr. Morn, ""however I shall leave the judgement about the when and how of our escape to you.  Data would be useful, but is not strictly necessary.""

""When do you want to begin our insertion pass?"" Kyra asked as L4m14 helpfully pulled up a holographic display of the target planet with updated details from their sampling visit.

""Begin immediately,"" Dr. Morn said with a flash of canines, ""I shall be finished by the time we exit hyperspace.""

# Deep within the habitation areas of the forge world Nisibis

It was the end of days.  The Priest-Masters and Priestesses had failed to appease Axzuur, may the stars tremble at his steps, with sacrifice, and thus he had stretched out his hand to draw blood.  Blood that Laborer 10 72 8435 knew was his due, for who could argue when a god stretched out his hand?  Even so, he abased himself before a shrine to the Empress, and begged her to intercede for his unworthy planet such that they may be instructed why they were being punished.  It was a thin hope, but all the hope he had.

The Priest-Masters believed that sacrifice in sufficient quantity would quell the god's rage, and so all over the planet Laborer 10 72 8435 knew that the sacrificial altars were slick with the blood of laborers like him, and even the Initiate-Highborn were not safe from the knife.  Meaning, they were even more likely to be selected than usual, for none stood above the duty of sacrifice.  However, it mattered not how much or from whence the blood flowed, the punishment was unceasing.

All and sundries were afflicted, weakness of body, inability to eat without vomiting, and tears of blood flowing without restraint no matter how lofty a personage was afflicted.  Truly, they must have done something of great offense to Axzuur, may the stars tremble at his steps, to merit such a punishment.  Indeed, though Laborer 10 72 8435 was uncommonly hale for a serf, he was already feeling weakness drag at his limbs and food did not sit well in his belly.  He knew that his blood would be spilled to sate Axzuur eventually, either upon the altar or from this punishment, but he harbored a secret hope that Axzuur, may the stars tremble at his steps, might be sated before he succumbed.

Before Nisbis had given offense to Axzuur, may the stars tremble at his steps, Laborer 10 72 8435 had harbored loftier goals.  To provide such worth that he be allowed and required to mate and sire offspring, and the private hope that such an offspring might be a warrior or even a priestess.  However, he dared not even cast his mind back to such dreams, for it might have been such grasping above their station that had offended Axzuur, may the stars tremble at his steps, in the first place.  Indeed, he tried to forget how his habitation district used to smell without the sour tang of vomit in every stairwell, the metallic scent of blood in the very air, and even the rank odor of the dead left where they fell, for the crematoriums were overburdened with the Initiate-Highborn alone.

Thus, Laborer 10 72 8435 endeavored to provide worth despite the punishment.  He did, even still, allow himself to weep durring his abasement, for the Empress was not offended by grief and tears.   When Laborer 10 72 8435 passed before a reflective surface and saw the blood dripping down his face, he realized that he had not merely been weeping as he abased himself.

**1. Introduction, Something Isn't Working:**

So to start, yes, obviously I have no life and this is all just my opinion. Next, I'm a nobody and don't know squat about game development. Third, this will be long, if you don't have interest or time to listen to me yell at clouds that's cool. Last, its totally fine if you hard disagree with me, this isn’t a call for the return of ‘classic’ Hunt, I’m not here to argue. I don’t think Hunt is dying but I want to see it thrive and right now I do feel the game has lost its identity a little. Now grab your pitchforks and torches and get ready for some red hot takes. 

Perhaps I’m alone in feeling a lot of matches in Bounty and Clash frequently come down to passive campfests. In all lobbies, I play them all. Crytek has stated that they wanted to make matches more decisive, unless that was a fever dream. I can see their efforts in this regard over the past events. The problem is that they aren't seeing why so many of these recent ideas make the game feel unsatisfying or infuriating in a way Hunt has never felt before. Yeah, they have managed to make fights more decisive, but not in ways that feel particularly good to the loser.

To be clear, losing never \*feels\* good but as long as you can understand your mistake and learn it makes that loss a lot more palatable. It taught you something. Was that a bad/unlucky rotate by me? Did I hit an arm but they hit my head? Or did I forget to clear a corner? Did I repeek that Marathon for the tenth time? Going back in my head in any fight I can often see why I ended up with a floor POV.

The game should never make you completely helpless. You should be punished for mistakes, yes, but you should never be completely helpless through no mistake of your own. Yeah, the winning feels great but how did the loser feel? Are they going to re-queue?

Take Blademancer, I’m all for a strong pullout game but come on, I know Crytek plays their own game. Getting shot by a bow, a silent weapon that applies bleed, while the shooter ducks behind a brick wall and instantly kills me feels awful. It’s nothing like getting tapped by a Sparks and finished with a Pax, stalker beetle or even nade. At least I new my enemy had to sweat for it, or out skill me or wait for my mistake. 

Getting hit by an arrow and instantly knowing you are dead does not feel like being out-skilled. My brain says I shot him, he shot me, we both got to cover and can reset. The only ‘mistake’ I made was pushing a bow and not hitting head. They missed their shot but got to press a ‘go back to lobby skill issue lol’ button. They weren’t even incentivized to aim for head or chest in the first place. This takes experience and knowledge and makes them irrelevant to the fight. New players are just confused and experienced players are annoyed by the lack of counter play. Why is there no cast time? Why doesn’t bandaging prevent the rip out? Why wasn’t it tried with tools first? This is like introducing Fast Fingers as a trait that instantly kills people if you shot them in the chest with a Sparks or Springfield when you enter Dark Sight. And thats not even as strong as the bow currently can be with Blademancer.

**2. What Creates Stale Matches:**

First, IMO matches are stale because the game is designed around bounty. The flaw to this as a catalyst is that the bounty tokens have little game changing value in the middle of a match. Logically, leaving the boss to get health back makes sense. There are at least three other teams to fight, you will take losses. What’s more, it poorly balances the risk vs reward ratio. You wont always have Dark Sight, but you will always have lightning over your head until its literally pried from your cold dead hands. 

Next there is Hunts blisteringly fast time to kill. An essential piece of the games identity and feel and a large part of that heart pounding tension of the PvP. Unfortunately this also creates a paradox of sorts. Once you are downed and aware of the loadouts in a fight that TTK shrinks from a forgiving two to three tap to an easy one shot to the torso. Essentially, most meta weapons become a Nitro without the butthole of death. Which is why they are meta. And more of these weapons are released every patch. That is not the problematic part.

Ten seconds of Dark Sight can easily be kited out. If you can't loot a body then you get no resources back to continue engaging. If you are banged up from actually picking a fight with a team and know another team is camping extract with Mosins you are screwed or forced to run across the entire map. I love the current change to allow the bounty instinct to proc without burning seconds. Sight is for smoking out campers, it doesn’t help you at all if you are surrounded by two or three teams who wont fight.

This is when hunters start to play scared. You can no longer push or initiate without instant punishment in the form of death. Two deaths? Now almost every gun, including pistols might as well be Nitros. The game is now giving you no reason to push aside from bloodlust or brain damage. Too many players shutdown here because the game doesn't do anything to restore balance in a reasonable way. Tactically speaking these players are not wrong either. This is what common sense in the situation dictates.

The risk is always on the pushing team, the person doing something. They are making noise and revealing their position to everyone. Opening themselves to a third intervention from the bushwookies scrolling reddit while they wait. Now you can peek at the perfect moment to surprise the pushing player. All players want to join a fight, and nobody wants to start one for the common sense reason of advantage. You need to incentivize people if you want them to take risks. A shot to restore a health bar is a frag you don't have to clear an entry or get a kill. It relies on your team getting a secure rez but offers them rez bolts and Necro to do so.

Players value their stats and stars as a method for measuring skill and progress. It is a fine and human reason to play the game. It’s not possible to take them away or hide them. Nobody plays for total bounty, maxed out hunters, teams wiped, etc. You can't stop players who want to farm stats to feel like the suffering is for something or get their dopamine hits. Especially with the state of prestige. Essentially, Crytek still has yet to find a way to make the game feel rewarding outside of its core gameplay identity and having their art team bribe us with battlepasses. Neither of those things move the stale meta we’ve been slipping deeper into.

If we look at successful PvP shooters like CS/Valo or Fortnite extremely briefly a part of the reason for their reach lies in the simplicity of the game. Deep breaths, this is to make a point, these games are nothing like Hunt. What I’m trying to illustrate is their core design. Doing nothing is a scheduled loss. The map border shrinks, plant the bomb or lose, defuse the bomb or die. There isn’t a door to head home. There isn’t a chill 45 minute timer.

Items like Restoration Med Kits encourage you to skulk off from a fight to top off, even if you won your fight. Restoration Shots deprive you of a resource to give you advantage in your first fight. An actual frag is cheaper! Making bosses harder to kill makes people ignore the boss the second the POI turns red. I dare you to team fight in the Assassins’ lair and not get bad touched to death while he pop and locks on the ceiling. 

**3. General Mechanical Suggestions:**

Now, get ready to really grab your torches and pitchforks. 

Bring back restoring one health bar from looting a dead hunter. Make this a base mechanic and not a trait. Limit it to once per enemy hunter at first. Make kills have more value than just Dark Sight. Health should be attainable \*but\* you should have to do something to earn it. Often you completely surrender the loot and ground you fought for because you died once while winning it. Wiping a team should be enough to fully restore your team to fight again. If you get caught in an early team fight and bounty banishes on a one boss map how is  that motivating? That should just be a no brainer reset. But you cant do that because you made no money because you looted four fire bombs off the last team! Now go push that team of Krags and Mosins sitting on bounty.

Increase the skillcap for passive players. I'm sorry, I know this will hurt some players feelings but MMR and KDA in particular are farmable to a degree and aren't a firm indicator of skill. Please don't take that as an accusation of being a bad player, obviously stars mean something. But it very much rewards selfish and passive play. 

Add a brief slow to hunters that have been crouched for more than a set amount of time when moving . The hunter can give an audio warning cue for this like exhaustion to warn you to uncrouch. This is just realistic, crouch walking is not physically easy for long periods. 

Make stamina a valuable resource and less of a convenience tax. Remove the large stamina shot leaving only the 5 minute one. It should be used for bosses and early advantage or escape and not a 200 dollar match buff/money sink. I barely take the stamina related traits because I double stam shot. I feel the same about the poison. Make it a meaningful choice not a convenience tax for experienced players. 

Allow players to purchase and equip a backup primary weapon. You can make it accessible in one of those scoped weapon crates at resupply. I’m willing to spend and lose the money and weapon if I die. I don’t need an entire loadout but if I bring an expensive sniper and get fog its annoying to go hunting for random shotguns or rifles.

**4. Adjusting Bounty Clash:**

With the end of the last event bounty clash has begun to suffer from similar stale matches. Almost solely because of the restoration being removed/changed and the same problems bounty has. A suggestion for this mode is to have it end like soul survivor. Last team up and holding bounty is saved, no extract required. If your team does not possess bounty you all die to corruption. You can still extract in the match but if the timer expires you do not need to get to extract, you just hold out and win. 

In Hunt you are very often rewarded for passivity/patience. Clash will always eventually end up mirroring Bounty Hunt as it is just Bounty Hunt with the hunt part removed. Soul Clash or Wellspring Clash would work better IMO.

**5. Trait Suggestions:**

* Demolitionist/Short Fuse: Reduces the full cook time of all throwables by 2 seconds. 
* Beekeeper: Friendly hive bombs will not lock on to team members.
* Bloodless: Also reduces frag bomb and all frag damage similar to bulwark including stalker beetles. Frag damage is very prevelant right now. Increase price. Or make a trait the lowers rending damage. 
* Burn Traits: Remove remedy and necro from the Hellborn pool, make it an expensive purchasable trait similar to necro.
* Bolt Thrower: Now works on Bomblance. New poon great but Bomblance is still trash since shotgun buff.
* Martialist: Hurl two throwing knives at once/ two handed fast double stab that does 150 damage but you loose the knives in the body. Add a blunt club attack to the back of the throwing axe or a trick throw for blunt damage, give the saber a blunt pommel strike or bash for it's light attack. 
* Field Medic: First aid kit charges heal team members for 75 health instead of 50. You can heal poisoned team mates. Increase the duration of shots used on yourself. Always restore one first aid kit charge when looting an enemy hunter or tool box. 
* Footpad/Soft Step: Reduce, not remove the sound when moving over glass or hanging sound traps. Horses will not react to you as long as your are crouched. You can crouch walk over traps. 
* Kite skin: reduced sound when dropping down and falling, increase price.
* Marksman: You can interact with empty work benches. Placing a scoped weapon onto the bench and picking it up removes any attached scopes. Can not be reattached. Scope will be restored after match. It can be a long animation like ammo swap. 
* Reapers Reach: You can loot enemy hunters from distance as long as you have line of sight and receive one second of dark sight. You do not receive consumables or tools back. Can be used on still burning hunters. 
* Apex Predator/Tracker: You are completely deaf to all sound while in dark sight but can hear the heart beats of nearby enemy hunters giving some indication of direction. 
* Poacher: You can also trigger your traps by interacting in dark sight. Increase the price to 3. Synergy with the crouch walk trait or triggering the second trap if you hear a disarm. 
* Blademancer: Tool blades only. Who tf thought this was cool with the bow lol? Does not work through walls or requires line of sight or has a 0.5 second cast time or cant be pulled if the person is bandaging. 

**6. Tool and Consumable Suggestions:**

* Standardize the First Aid Kit and take it off the tool bar to allow another slot.  
* Change the poison bomb to a three pack and shift it to a tool slot.
* Shift beetles to tools, maybe make it a two pack and double the price or let it scale with Frontiersman. Reduces beetle spam. Tool boxes do not resupply but beetle pods will give you the beetle type you brought in. 
* Merge the fire bomb and liquid firebomb in to one item.
* Shift the chaos bomb into a two pack and move it to a tool slot.
* Release a developer video apologizing to the flash bang for nerfing it out of the game.

**7.Conclusion:**

In conclusion, pulling out is for losers. Get good scrubs. My opinions are right, yours are wrong and you can’t convince me otherwise. The original Sawblade was fine, I barely *saw* it after the first couple of days and its not that different than releasing a new Nitro or Avto type weapon. Skill issue. Thanks for your time."

Extended Warranty Pricing,BMWX5,1hk0mfe,2024-12-22 10:25:52,0,0.5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BMWX5/comments/1hk0mfe/extended_warranty_pricing/,OkPhotograph4472,,"Morning all!

Thoughts on the following price points:

$4,830:  Plat protection 84mos/85K with $250 deductible

$2,998: Tire and wheel 60 mos with cosmetic coverage

$4,499: Ultimate care 60mos/75K 

In speaking with a dealer rep, he mentioned that the X5 50E wheels have embedded sensors which interact with the vehicle’s EV system which means the wheel is more expensive to replace versus a standard wheel. Can’t find anything about this on the interwebs to validate this. 

In the fence about the extended warranty.  Personal experience, a first model iteration can present some unplanned challenges which are corrected in subsequent model years to “better polish” the reliability. I believe the X5 50E is a first of a design.

That being said, I experienced an electrical problem in a 2005 (first design) where water entered into the pax compartment and traveled down the wire bundle and into the top of the computer. $5,500 out of warranty repair. Subsequent model year tweaks had a different gasket and the wire bundle entered the computer box via the bottom (impossible now for water infiltration). Plus it’s a new foray into PHEV. Inclined to purchase the extended warranty because of these thoughts and experiences. 

I get the sense most buyers are not enthused about the extended maintenance program, though. 

Thanks!"
Is there a tip to 'pimping up' standard Paxo stuffing?,UKfood,1hj8mms,2024-12-21 07:11:07,10,0.75,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKfood/comments/1hj8mms/is_there_a_tip_to_pimping_up_standard_paxo/,bornrate9,,"I tried more fancy premade stuffing mixes and they were just 'meh' I guess I'm so used to the basic traditional flavour of Paxo stuffing but let's be honest it's on the bland side. But does anyone add something to it just give it that extra bit of flavour or a twist

Edit: going to chop up some onion, bacon and fresh sage, cook in butter and add to the Paxo. Thanks for the great suggestions!"

# Aboard the *James Lawrence* low orbit over the Republican colony Luck
 
Private Paxton Reeves trembled in the solitude of his drop pod.  His belly roiled, his heart raced, and he was eighty percent certain a large frightened amphibian had taken up residence in his throat.  That was fine, since he always got that way waiting for the drop.  Logically, it wasn't any more dangerous than any other part of insertion, but that didn't matter much to his psyche. To calm himself, he ran through the briefing in his mind again.
 
Just like in training, and in his grand total of one combat drops, the briefing took place in a room big enough to fit the platoon with two to a desk, and LT stood before an interactive holo display built into the front wall.  Pvt. Reeves remembered a sort of tense anticipation charging the room, something he'd missed during his first real briefing.
 
There was a thump, and Pvt. Reeves's pod cycled forward.  That'd be the company commander, his staff would be out next, then the LTs.
 
""The Affat Disposal, or whatever they call themselves, disagreed with our plan to just invade them, so they're trying to stage a counter-counter-invasion here on Luck,"" Lieutenant Rhys Calder said as the display leapt to life to show the planet in question.  A mostly barren globe with little to speak of in terms of either water or vegetation.  ""This is important because Luck is right smack at the widdershins end of the Glassed gulf.""  Pvt. Reeves must not have been the only one to let the concern show on his face because LT had said, ""Yup.  They're trying a flanking maneuver.  Now, while the diplomatic corps tries to convince the Draconian Empire to get off their scaly asses and move some forces up to the front, it falls to us to stop this before it gets going.""
 
There was another thump, and Pvt. Reeves focused on his recollections to stop his hands from visibly shaking his armor.
 
""Luck has barely gotten started, and was a live-on terraforming operation, so there's only one settlement to speak of, maybe some fifty thousand people there.  All of the other residents are homesteaders along the green belt, or active ecology engeneers pushing toward the poles.  We don't have any info on the homesteaders, but the enemy managed to overwhelm a frontier settlement.  I expect you know what that means.""
 
Private First Class Callen Jaro muttered darkly, ""It means they didn't take it unbloodied.""
 
LT nodded and gravely said, ""We have a final transmission from the hold-outs.  They fought to the last man and woman.  A lot of the teenagers weren't taken alive either.""
 
Even in Pvt. Reeves's memory, the anger in that room was almost a physical thing, connecting the infantrymen and pulsing among them, and in the present there was another thump and his drop pod shuddered forward once again.
 
""We won't worry about the homesteaders, our main concern is the settlement, which the enemy is in the middle of converting into a FOB for their attempt to flank down the Glassed Gulf.""
 
Yet another thump, and the drop pod slid forward once again, and the rate of fire picked up. 
 
Good, the deployment was going according to plan. 
 
The display zoomed in to show a small city or large town that was obviously in the middle of being converted into a military base.  ""We'll be dropping here, they don't have much AA set up yet, and if they did our path is out of range, we'll hit, squads will link up, and we'll approach from the south.  The other two platoons will be dropping here, and here and approach from the northwest and northeast.  If you drift outside our LZ, just link up with whoever's closest.  If it's an enemy emplacement, if it shoots at you shoot it dead.  If it surrenders, we are taking prisoners.""
 
Thump, slide, thump, slide, thump, slide, and Pvt. Reeves was that much closer to being in the drop.
 
""Any word on the prepubescent residents?"" Specialist Talia Veyra asked quietly, and didn't quite manage to hide the tears shining in her eyes.
 
Thump, slide, thump, slide, thump, slide.
 
""We know what these fucks do with prisoners,"" a corporal from another fire team growled.
 
Thump, slide, thump, slide, thump, slide.
 
""Not much,"" LT Calder said coldly, ""only some orbital imaging suggesting that they're being held here.  We're also pretty sure this next to it is the enemy HQ
 
Thump, slide, CLANG!  Pvt. Reeves's shaking stopped, and he was slammed against his restraints as the internal inertial dampening field spooled up to compensate for the firing.  Just a few minutes of freefall, and he'd be able to move and fight.
 
He knew he couldn't hear anything, but Pvt. Reeves imagined he could hear the wind whistling as he entered Luck's atmosphere.  Since he was out, he figured he might as well take a look at where he was pointed.  A few quick taps, and his faceplate created the illusion that the drop pod was translucent around him, and some helpful dots and lines highlighted the LZ and his current flight path.  ""Flight path good,"" he muttered.
 
""Keep your eyes out for turbulence,"" Lance Corporal Darius Korran growled over the coms.
 
""He's too busy cryin' over dead Axies,"" PFC Jarro sneered in reply.
 
""Shut the fuck up, Cal,"" Specialist Veyra barked back in an almost perfunctory way.
 
""Hey Pax, tell them why you're here."" Lance Corporal Korran rumbled before a good insulting match could get started.
 
""Do you know what happened on Second Chance?""
 
""A whole pussy planet fucking refused to lift a fucking finger in their own defense and got fucking slaughtered,"" PFC Jaro drawled.
 
Pvt. Reeves tapped at his controls to compensate for the winds pushing his pod off target while he said, ""Does Texan Texas only make idiots like you?  Can you think of a reason a Pacifian who saw the videos out of Second Chance might throw a lifetime of pacifism aside and join the Republican Naval Infantry of all things?  Some of us learned."" 
 
Pvt. Reeves didn't expect telling to change anything, and he wasn't disappointed, ""Well maybe you should learn to keep your fuckin' lunch.""
 
""Eat shit, redneck,"" Pvt. Reeves sighed and made another adjustment.
 
""Love you too, city boy,"" PFC Jaro laughed before getting serious, ""Enemy vehicle patrol approaching LZ.""
 
Suddenly, a zoomed in video from PFC Jarro's drop pod was displayed at the center of Pvt. Reeves's point of view, and he saw that the enemy had appropriated a local's pickup truck and had crudely mounted a heavy weapon in the bed.  ""Doesn't look like they're looking up.  Homesteaders might be making trouble for them,"" he said.
 
""If they are, they're smart enough to be out of sight from orbit, or even from how high up we are,"" LCpl. Korran rumbled, ""try not to land on any civvies.""
 
The team responded at once, ""Aye corporal.""
 
""I think I can adjust and take that truck out…"" Specialist Veyra said.
 
Pvt. Reeves's drop pod struck the ground with a spray of clay and gypsum, and he once again marveled at the fact that he was still alive.  Explosive charges blew the hatch away, and he clambered out, rifle in hand.  ""Silver three, down and active.""
 
Some half mile away, a truck speeding toward him was hit from above, and its cab slid to a halt as Specialist Veyra's hatch opened via explosive charges and stepped out into what was formerly a pickup truck bed occupied by a group of three enemy soldiers as she said, ""Silver one, down and active.""
 
There was a whap-thud-crack of impact off somewhere to Pvt. Reeves's left, and LCpl. Korran said, ""Silver leader, down and active.""
 
Almost on top of him, the last impact rang out and PFC Jaro's cheerful drawl came over the coms, ""Silver two, down and active.""
 
""Silver team, all down and accounted for.  Moving for rendezvous with squad,"" LCpl. Korran said, and Pvt. Reeves began to take long, power armor assisted strides toward Corporal Toba Rinn's beacon to do just that.
 
""Contacts eliminated,"" Specialist Veyra said, ""no new contacts visible.""  Pvt. Reeves didn't have to check her beacon to see she was moving toward the rendezvous point.
 
""Cal, put some speed on and see if you can get eyes on our approach.""
 
""Aye, Corporal.""
 
Pvt. Reeves loped along and watched his teammates' beacons inch along toward Cpl. Rinn's, and in short order he joined the rest of the squad more or less at the same time as the other members where Cpl. Rinn was taking reports from the team leaders.  After listening for a moment he ran the vital information up the chain and snapped out an order, ""They know we're here.  Orbital drops aren't subtle, not  unless you're ADR.""  The squad chuckled in the pause he left for them and he continued, ""So we'll spread out, keep a good fifty yards on your elbows and two miles between teams.  How are we on our recon?""
 
""I sent a man,"" one of the other teams' leaders said.
 
""Me too,"" LCpl. Korran growled, ""He's probably getting a good view of the approach now.  Ah.""
PFC Jaro's beacon flashed, and Pvt. Reeves blinked to bring up his teammate's helmet cam feed.  It was a grizzly sight.  There were charred and bloated corpses scattered across the desolate and burned soil and left to rot.  Pvt. Reeves tasted bile at the back of his throat, and swallowed.
 
More importantly, PFC Jaro was highlighting enemy positions and marking their type.  Infantry, crew served weapons, heavy weapons emplacements, and lookout points.  Nothing they couldn't handle.  However, the enemy wasn't so polite as to patiently wait for the assault to begin.  No, they were very rudely reinforcing their positions.
 
""Alright kids,"" Cpl. Rinn said, ""time to go to work.  Bounce off now.""
 
And so they did.  The infantrymen took off in that odd bouncing lope once again and formed into diamond shaped formations two miles apart, except for Silver and Bronze teams, which were a man down each.  These two teams adopted a wedge formation, and the scouts transitioned to an overwatch role as the squad approached.
 
The RNI cut through the enemy like a plasma cutter through butter.  The heavy weapons couldn't get on target quickly enough, and the RNI troopers put rounds on target on the move taking out their operators at a distance.  It was much the same with the crew served emplacements, and infantry teams stood less than a shadow of a chance.  They seemed to know it too, because when the squad approached, some of them tried to throw their weapons down.  The instant the plasma casters left their fingers, the backs of their necks exploded with sickeningly wet pops.  Pvt. Reeves stumbled as he squeezed the trigger of his rifle and put holes the size of apples through the enemy's chest while the return plasma splashed off of his armor's shields.
 
Then, the squad was amongst the rubble of the former settlement, and the outer perimeter of the base in progress.  Pvt. Reeves was confronted by the left leg of a Doggo settler protruding from a pile of rubble.  A few feet ahead, maggots feasted on what was left of the rest of that poor soul.
 
""Heads up kids,"" Cpl. Rinn called out over the coms, ""The enemy always does something annoying when things are going well.""
Hot plasma from a half dozen infantrymen splashed off of Pvt. Reeve's power armor.  They were actually concentrating their fire, and draining his shield, so he sent a few shots down range at their source before ducking behind what looked like it used to be a column of the town hall.
 
""Behind you, Pax,"" PFC Jaro said, and a sonic boom cracked overhead.
 
Pvt. Reeves didn't waste time dithering, he rolled to another pile of rubble and put more holes in the enemy's cover, and the enemy behind the cover while the air cracked again as PFC Jaro took out another enemy trying to sneak up behind him.  The settlers' corpses had stopped appearing, and Pvt. Reeves tried not to think of how that implied that the Axxaakk had cared enough to not want to be surrounded by rotting corpses, but not enough to bury them, but that was made easier when someone from another team broke in over squad wide coms, ""Man down, armor failure at left leg.  Corpsman required.""
 
Specialist Veyra answered, ""Corpsman on the way, sit tight.""
 
""Pax, tighten up with me.  Cal, cover her,"" LCpl. Korran snapped out, and Pvt. Reeves changed direction and charged the two remaining enemies.  Luckily, they panicked and got up to run.  Which put them right in LCpl. Korran's line of fire.  They realized this, cast down their weapons, and subsequently found their spines exploding just like every other Axxaakk who had tried to surrender.
 
""Joseph, Marry, and all the Saints!"" LCpl. Korran shouted, ""The enemy isn't supposed to be destroyed *after* they decide to stop being the enemy!""
 
""Somebody should tell them that,"" PFC Jaro drawled lazily.
 
""I aim to,"" the noncom growled in reply.
 
""Shields down to seventy percent,"" Pvt. Reeves called out, ""Check your levels.""
 
""Fifty-eight percent,"" Specialist Veyra answered.
 
""Eighty-four here, greenie,"" PFC Jaro added.
 
""Fifty-four,"" LCpl. Korran rumbled.
 
Explosions sent rubble tumbling from the pile Pvt. Reeves was taking cover behind as another appropriated local pickup truck bore down on his and LCpl. Korran's position.  Pvt. Reeves rested his forearm on a chunk of rubble, lined up his shot, and squeezed the trigger.  The truck's windshield shattered, the driver suddenly found himself with an uncomfortable set of holes in his chest, and lost control of the vehicle sending it into a rolling tumble.
 
""Man down,"" said someone from another team over the squad wide coms, ""helmet failure.""
Specialist Veyra's voice carried the most sulfurous string of curses and slurs that Pvt. Reeves had ever heard rang out over the coms in no less the six different languages in addition to Republican Battle Cant that she finished by saying, ""Rejoining team.""
 
""Pushing toward objective,"" LCpl. Korran said, ""Pax, two contacts in building on your left, second floor.""
 
Pvt. Reeves swung his rifle up and to the left and squeezed off a couple of rounds at what looked like an enemy sniper team setting up in a room missing one of its exterior walls.  Pvt. Reeves privately scoffed at the idea of setting up a static position with so little cover.  ""Contact eliminated, on your six.""
 
Pvt. Reeves made sure to sweep the areas above and swiveled to cover behind until Specialist Veyra and PFC Jaro linked up with them as they moved down the street at a brisk walk.  Pvt. Reeves tried not to think about the past ten minutes too deeply and focused on spotting threats that failed to appear as they made their way to a squat, ugly prefabricated metal building boldly occupying the space formerly reserved for the houses of the slaughtered residents now scattered across the outskirts of their once-burgeoning home.
 
The four of them stacked up on the reinforced door barring the entrance to the HQ, LCpl. Korran was on point with his weapon steady at the door, Specialist Veyra stood just behind him at the ready, PFC Jaro had his back against the wall next to the door, and Pvt. Reeves covered their backs.  There was a scream of protesting metal as PFC Jaro utilized his power armor to simply rip the door off its hinges by yanking the handle, and LCpl. Korran and Specialist Veyra opened up on the shocked defenders within.  PFC Jaro took over covering the team's back, and Pvt. Reeves rolled a pair of grenades into the building as his teammates took cover against the doorway.  Pvt. Reeves tried to ignore the pained cries that followed the explosions.
 
Pvt. Reeves followed Specialist Veyra through the door and into what looked like a waiting room.  He checked his shield levels again, and was alarmed to find they had been reduced to twenty percent effective.  There wasn't time to let his armor's shield generators cool off though, and he knew the armor could physically take a few hits from the Axxaakk standard plasma casters.  There was nothing to do but press on into the next room, which looked like an administrative center.  It was given away by the fact that it was a big long room filled with desks laden with consoles and datapads in rows leading to a single ornate door at the back with several less opulent openings along the side walls.
 
""Approaching last known location of enemy commander,"" LCpl. Korran growled over the rat-tat-tat of his own automatic fire ripping the office furniture enemy soldiers were using as cover apart, ""Anybody spot him scurrying away to quarters or some shit?""
 
The answer must have come over the team leaders' coms, because Pvt. Reeves didn't hear it, and he was preoccupied with eight enemies opening fire on him from the four doors on the left side of the room.  He began to take them apart with controlled bursts as they leaned out of cover to shoot, which is why he didn't notice the anti-armor plasma weapon charging up in the last doorway until it had lobbed its payload at him.  He couldn't dodge, or the attack would hit Specialist Veyra, whose armor was already scorched by hits from sidearms.  So, he stretched out his left arm palm forward and tensed his muscles to focus the majority of his armor's shields on his palm.  It only stopped most of it.  Searing hot pain lanced up his body, and his arm suddenly drooped limply to his side as he staggered and shot wildly in the enemy's general direction. 
 
His world went red, then white with pain, and he found himself lying on the floor with Specialist Verya looming over him as she pumped him full of drugs through an access port and his armor applied an internal tourniquet.  It took Pvt. Reeves a minute to realize that she was insulting him, ""…fucking chauvinistic moron, you probably thought that was heroic as fuck…""
 
""Hey, it worked, he blearily muttered as his vision cleared and the pain began to approach manageable.  ""You think the arm can be saved?""
 
Nobody answered him.
 
Pvt. Reeves looked down at the bloody mess of gore and scorched flesh that used to be his left arm and said simply, ""Oh.""  The sounds of battle outside the HQ came in sporadic bursts as the silence hung between the team like an unwelcome guest until he scrambled to his feet and said,
""Well, the objective is right there.""
 
""Cal, check the perimeter, Talia, stow Pax's rifle for him, Pax, tap your fingers to your thumb on your right hand for me,"" LCpl. Korran snapped out.
 
""Aye sir,"" Pvt. Reeves said as he did as ordered.
 
""Don't sir me, I'm a lance,"" LCpl. Korran replied perfunctorily as PFC Jaro completed his circuit with a spent grenade's discharge in one of the doors along the left wall.
 
""Clear,"" he said and joined the door stack in the same position he had occupied on the entrance to the headquarters, but instead of ripping the door off of its hinges, he simply turnned the handle and pushed.  It opened with the squeal of metal sliding on metal, and Pvt. Reeves tasted bile at the sight it revealed.
 
As expected, the enemy commander's office contained a sacrificial alter, but what was not expected was for there to be a girl of eight laid upon it.  Her once caramel skin had gone grey, her once hazel eyes had filmed over, and her once beautiful face was frozen in her final moments of terror and pain.  Pvt. Reeves's sidearm shook in his fist as he stared at the congealed blood spilling from the girl's slit throat.  His breathing became ragged and heavy, his heart pounded against his armor and there was a grinding sound coming from the general area of his teeth.
 
The enemy commander, one of the half priest half nobles swathed in expensive looking robes grinned and held up a small device with a button on one side, and pressed it.  Every last member of the compony outside the room decided it was vital to inform the rest of the company that the enemies had all just blown their own heads off.  ""I surrender,"" came the enemy commander's voice filtered through the translation software built into Pvt. Reeves's helmet.
 
In a fury, he dropped his pistol, drew his bayonet, and crossed the room in the blink of an eye.  His good arm blurred, and there was a sanguine line drawn across the throat of the Axxaakk's scarlet skin.  Then, he promptly retracted his helmet's faceplate, and vomited on the floor.
 
Some three or four hours later, Pvt. Reeves was laid up in a medbay bed back on the *James Lawrence* up to his eyeballs in very good drugs. The drugs were so good, that the most discomfort he felt was a slight itching from what was left of his bicep where the stump of his arm ended.  He was using his remaining hand to pick up a glass of water and scroll through information on his options for replacement arms, and was having sufficient trouble focusing on those two tasks that his mind hardly replayed his experiences planetside at all.  By point of fact, he'd only vomited once since the doctors got ahold of him.  All and all, it wasn't the worst way for a recent amputee to be feeling.
 
He was just getting ready to drift back into hazy dozing when the curtain around his bed parted and PFC Jaro stood in the gap with ears laid back and eyes narrowed to slits.  Without a word, the feline man walked up beside Pvt. Reeves's bed on the left side, and thwacked him upside the head.
 
""OW!"" the aggrieved private said, offended that his teammate would hit him hard enough to feel through the drugs keeping pain and shock at bay.
 
""Who the fuck do you think you are?"" PFC Jaro snarled.
 
""What the fuck, Cal?""
 
""Who are you to just decide, all by your lonesome, to fuckin' execute a prisoner of war?"" PFC Jaro asked with another cuff across Pvt. Reeve's head.
 
Pvt. Reeve's stump flinched as he tried to raise his missing arm to block.  He scowled down at the bandage wrapped stump, then up at the glowering private and rejoined, ""You think he didn't deserve to die?""
 
PFC Jaro punctuated his next statement with yet another thwack upside Pvt. Reeves's head, ""I'm sayin' that ain't your call, city boy.""
 
""Would you stop fucking hitting me?!""
 
""Maybe if somebody had hit you you'd fuckin' know better than to violate the fuckin' Pluto Compact!""
 
""The bloodskins never signed it.""
 
""THAT DON'T MATTER!  WHAT MAKES THEM FUCKIN' BARBARIANS IS HOW THEY FUCKIN' KILL AND KILL AND KILL FER NO GOOD REASON!  THEY'RE FUCKIN' SAVAGES, BUT WE AIN'T!  YOU GET THAT THROUGH YER THICK FUCKIN' SKULL OR I'LL BEAT IT IN!""
 
Pvt. Reeves tried to shrink back from the tirade and lacking anywhere to go, simply made himself small and stared at his blankets.
 
""Look, you weren't thinkin' straight.  High stress, and you'd just lost a fuckin' arm, so them's extenuating circumstances, so I don't figure you'll get drummed out, and that's only a shooting offense if you're an officer or a senior NCO.""
 
""Wait, what?""
 
""You're being court martialed.  Obviously.""
 
""What?""
 
PFC Jaro blinked, flicked his ears, and the tip of his tail twitched.  Then, he said slowly, ""You executed an enemy combatant after surrender were tendered.  What did you figure on happening?  You gettin' a medal?""
 
Pvt. Reeves lay in mute shock.
 
""Holy shit, you really don't know…""
 
""What don't I know, you hick asshole?""
 
""Gimme a second…"" PFC Jaro muttered as he paced in the narrow space between the bed and the curtain.  ""Okay, since you come from pansy-land I figure you ain't never got in a real fight before.""
 
""Pacifia, and I was a champion boxer.""
 
PFC Jaro waved a hand by way of dismissal, ""I mean a real fight to settle things, like an insult you can't let stand, or someone tryin' to steal from ya.""
 
Pvt. Reeves just blinked in bewilderment.
 
""Okay, so I'm right.  So fighting in a war isn't just about killin' all the enemy 'till they're dead.  That's one of the worst ways things can end once blood's bein' spilled.  What we *want* is for the enemy to quit tryin' to kill us and our friends.  That's why the enemy only exists to be destroyed, once they quit bein' the enemy they don't need destroyin' no more.""
 
""So the murders just get to escape justice?""  Pfc. Reeves spat.
 
""No, Pax."" PFC Jaro said quietly, ""Justice comes later, and you deprived the Republic of doling out her terrible justice.  You denied her the chance to interrogate an enemy commander, and you spared him his sentence with a quick death.  Look up debeaconing.""  And with that, PFC Jaro left Pvt. Reeves alone with his thoughts.
