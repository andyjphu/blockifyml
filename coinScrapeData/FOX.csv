Project Kayn Skin idea,KaynMains,1i9xguy,2025-01-25 16:24:52,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/KaynMains/comments/1i9xguy/project_kayn_skin_idea/,GGsandwich123,Discussion,"It came to me in a dream

The whole concept story for him in short is pretty much he acts like Gray Fox from MGS1 with all the psychotic break downs. And its caused by Kayn stealing experimental software called ""Recombinant Host Augmentation and Assimilation System Technology"" or RHAAST  for short (that unsurprisingly turns out to be evil because it's early technology and its unstable for the sake of convenience) to defeat Zed who turned him into a cyborg as far as lore goes in the actual Project story. And because its Zed who made him or assisted in his creation, we have a lore reason why he can pass through walls. My idea is that he splits into pieces or something like that to go through walls  and into the minds of the champions when he ults. 



And the forms are basically:

 Complete Kayn, who throughout the game (maybe in his emotes and recall animation) is shown tinkering with his body trying to ""fix"" the virus, and him transforming basically means he got what he wanted from the start with the stolen tech and software. Which is why he can cast W and make a projection of him self and still move, and why he has better mobility and so on.



And if Kayn isn't successful in time, Rhaast takes over. But because of all that tinkering, a bit of Kayn's mind still remains and is still struggling with Rhaast. Which is why Rhaast can't move as fast but can still use all the tricks Kayn does with the body.



Unfortunately I am not good with drawing and cant give an exact image of what my ideas look like. "

1. [LOVE ME IN THREE DAYS](https://youtu.be/WLNyDhNdmgY?si=9KMnPuX8EH0GCIAm)
Modern Romcom w‚Äô a little supernatural twist, most are convinced that‚Äôs the excuse for all the kissing. And no one is complaining. Funny, cast is good looking in ways, great chemistry, decently acted and shot, weirdly believable. 
2. [READY FOR LOVE](https://youtu.be/3_tFHRTkwOc?si=_aEVjlMg4zSVIUmh) I love a good modern contract marriage romcom and this mini delivers and then some. Literally. They managed to quickly create and deliver several very interesting story arcs. They run an unexpected gambit in a remarkably short time. You will fall in love with the MC as they fall in love, near instantly. It‚Äôs a gift to be able to convey chemistry and the bloom of love in such little time! This series deserves the 36 episodes if they can do this in 10 mins.

Introduction Throughout history, the key has served as a powerful symbol in mystical traditions, folklore, and spiritual practices. Its dual nature‚Äîas both a tool of access and restriction‚Äîconnects it to profound themes of mystery, transformation, and hidden wisdom. Across cultures, the key is a potent metaphor for unlocking doors to new opportunities, guarding sacred spaces, and bridging the gap between worlds. Keys in History and Mythology

1. Ancient Civilizations:

* In ancient Egypt, the ankh, often interpreted as a ""key of life,"" symbolized eternal life and was believed to unlock the gates of the afterlife (Wilkinson, 2003).
* Greek and Roman mythology depicts gods like Hecate, the goddess of crossroads, and Janus, the god of transitions, holding keys. These deities embodied access to hidden realms, marking the key as a symbol of passage and authority (Ker√©nyi, 1951).

1. Medieval  Symbolism:

* During the Middle Ages, keys were emblems of power and responsibility. Guardians of sacred or protected spaces often carried keys as symbols of their authority (Coveney, 1988).
* In alchemy, keys represented the unlocking of esoteric knowledge, marking the transformative journey from ignorance to enlightenment (Fabricius, 1994).

1. Folklore:

* In European fairy tales, keys often appear as instruments of both curiosity and caution. Stories like Bluebeard use keys to symbolize forbidden knowledge and the consequences of seeking it (Zipes, 2013).

The Key as a Mystical Symbol

1. Access  and Transition:

* Keys embody the concept of transition, representing access to new opportunities, solutions, or spiritual realms. They are often associated with liminality‚Äîthe state of being on the threshold between two worlds  (Turner, 1969).
* They also symbolize closure, enabling individuals to lock away past pain,  negativity, or unwanted influences.

1. Guardianship  and Protection:

* Keys have been used as protective talismans. Hung over doorways, worn as jewelry, or placed under pillows, they were believed to ward off evil spirits or misfortune (Danaher, 1972).
* The act of locking something away with a key symbolized safeguarding treasures, secrets, or sacred knowledge.

1. Hidden Knowledge:

* In mystical traditions, the key represents the seeker‚Äôs journey to uncover truths. Possessing a key often implies mastery over knowledge or access to divine mysteries (Chevalier & Gheerbrant, 1996).
* In some magical systems, the design or material of the key carries symbolic weight, such as an antique key representing ancestral wisdom or a modern key symbolizing contemporary insight.

Keys in Witchcraft and Rituals

1. Ritual Tool:

* Keys are often used in rituals to open or close energetic pathways. For example, a key may be used to symbolically ""unlock"" a sacred circle or ""seal"" a spell (Cunningham, 2002).
* They are also employed in spells to unlock opportunities, love, or prosperity‚Äîor to close doors on harmful influences.

1. Crossroads and Choice:

* Keys are deeply tied to the symbolism of crossroads, a common theme in witchcraft. At a crossroads, the key becomes a metaphor for decision-making, transformation, and guidance through life‚Äôs transitions  (Guiley, 1999).
* Hecate often depicted holding keys, represents the ability to navigate these pivotal moments and unlock new paths.

1. Symbolic  Uses:

* A  single key can symbolize simplicity and focused intention, while a ring of keys may represent knowledge, authority, or the ability to unlock multiple possibilities.
* Skeleton keys, in particular, are favored in magical practices for their versatility and association with unlocking any door (Grimassi, 2004).

Cultural Symbolism and Practices

1. Hecate‚Äôs Keys (Ancient Greek Tradition):

* Hecate,  the Greek goddess of witchcraft and crossroads, is often depicted holding keys, symbolizing her role as a guide through transitions and a guardian of thresholds (Johnston, 1990).
* Devotees of Hecate might include a key in rituals to invoke her guidance, often leaving a key as an offering at a crossroads.

1. Roman  Rituals with Janus:

* Janus, the Roman god of doorways, beginnings, and endings, was associated with keys. In Roman tradition, keys were symbolic tools during New Year‚Äôs rituals, representing the opening of new opportunities and the closing of the past (Beard, 1998).
* Celebrants often used symbolic keys in blessings to invoke prosperity and protection for the year ahead.

1. Keys in Marriage Traditions:

* In some Scandinavian and Eastern European traditions, keys were incorporated into wedding ceremonies. The groom would gift a symbolic key to the bride, representing the opening of a new life together or her role as guardian of the household (Murdoch, 2001).
* In  India, the key to the family‚Äôs safe or treasure chest is traditionally given to the matriarch as a symbol of her authority and responsibility.

1. Shinto Shrine Practices (Japan):

* Keys often appear in Shinto shrines, associated with the deities Inari and their fox messengers. These keys, typically held in the mouths of fox statues, symbolize the unlocking of rice granaries and prosperity (Rosenberger, 1992).

1. Key-Carrying Customs in Europe:

* In medieval Europe, women often carried a key as a sign of their authority over the household and its resources. This practice extended into rituals where keys were buried in new foundations to bless the space and ensure protection (Sennett, 1994).

Keys in Modern Symbolic Practices

1. Keys for Manifestation:

* Modern practitioners often carry a small key charm as a reminder of their personal goals, representing the ability to ""unlock"" potential or manifest dreams (Andrews, 2002).
* Vision boards may include images of keys to symbolize opening doors to success or new opportunities.

1. Key Tattoos and Jewelry:

* Key designs in tattoos and jewelry are popular as symbols of individuality,  secrets, or life transitions. They often serve as reminders of the wearer‚Äôs ability to unlock their destiny or protect their own inner ""treasure.""

ConclusionAcross cultures and traditions, the key has played a vital role in rituals and symbolic practices. Whether used to protect, unlock hidden truths, or signify authority, the key remains a universal emblem of transformation and possibility. Its enduring power lies in its ability to represent both access and protection, making it a deeply personal and mystical tool. References

**Celtics vs mavericks**

Celtics injuries - Derrick white GTD

Mavericks injuries - Naji marshall OUT, Klay thompson GTD

Game quality: Very poor

No recent H2H in 2024-2025 season but these two teams have vsed each other a lot last season with Celtics always winning, with only 1 loss. Most these games involved luca doncic, and yet mavericks still could not secure many victories. Mavericks will be playing home today. The celtics have been playing away for the past 3 games and has not been doing well at all recently. Mavericks have also not been too well recently but did just come off a 6 point win over the thunders who are at the top of the league. Both teams are very inconsistent and it is almost impossible to predict the outcome of this game due to no data and so much inconsistency. I am going to leave a prediction here for data collection purposes and this is not recommended for a bet at all, celtics -6.5.

Straights

* Derrick white over 3.5 rebounds
* Kristap over 18+ points (this one is quite worth)

Legs

* Derrick white 3+ rebounds (pretty worth taking, very good history in past 30 and against mavericks, just unsure of their recent unpredictable nature recently but his rebounds seems to be benefiting from it)

**Nets vs Heats**

Nets injuries - Cam thomas OUT, Cameron Johnson OUT, D‚Äôangelo Russell GTD, Zaire williams GTD, Ben simmons GTD

Heats injuries - Jimmy butler OUT

Game quality: Good

Risks: Heats has had some inconsistency recently due to Jimmy butler drama.

One good recent H2H to use. They played 1 month ago. Heats win by 15 points. The lineup was similar for heats who were missing Jimmy butler and terry roizer. On the nets side, they had Cameron johnson, who is their second best player as Cam thomas is still out. Heats win by 15, and this time heats will have terry roizer, while nets will be missing cam thomas and perhaps more such due to many GTDs. Currently pointing towards Heats win. This game was played at heats home, while today‚Äôs game will be at nets home. Nets will have a 1 day rest advantage. Nets have performed quite bad recently due to their injuries and just being not a good team overall, going 1-9 in their last 10. Heats have also struggled a bit but are 4-6. Heats win by quite a lot when they do win, 21 against spurs recently, 16 against gsw. What I like most about this analysis is the fact that they have won recently against nets by 15 and now cameron johnson is also out, and terry roizer is in. This all points towards a heats win. My pick will be Heat -7.5. A riskier pick would be heat first half -3.5 but I don‚Äôt often bet first half markets so I will leave that here for research and practice but not a recommended pick.

Straights

* Nic claxton over 7.5 rebounds
* Kel‚Äôel Ware over 16.5 points

Legs

* Ben simmons 6+ assists
* Nikola Jovic 10+ points
* Nic claxton 5+ rebounds
* Heats win

Riskier

* Kel‚Äôel Ware 20+ points

**Magic vs Pistons**

Magic injuries - Jalen suggs GTD, Goga bitadze GTD

Pistons injuries - Jaden Ivy OUT

Game quality: Poor

Risks: So many varying factors due to injuries

2 recent H2H, one in november 2024 and one at the start of 2025. The one in november had magics beating pistons by 11 points. This was when magics had an entirely healthy lineup with Franz, Moritz, Jalen. In the more recent H2H however, Pistons beat magics by 9 points. This was when magics was without Franz and Moritz, but with Goga and Jalen still. At this time the magics were not doing too bad despite being without Franz and Moritz, still being able to win games such as against celtics, raptors, knicks. It was only when jalen and goga was also out, magics hadn‚Äôt won a single one recently in the past 6 games, now losing to celtics by 27 and raptors by 16. An immense drop off in skill level due to these injuries. Despite Paolo returning from injury, he is on a minutes restriction and he still seems like he hasn‚Äôt been able to get back into his previous level yet. Pistons will be playing away this time and they have been doing great playing away, with 10+ point victories over hawks, rockets while being away and win over knicks. Pistons have been one of the hottest teams this year with a 7-3 record in the last 10 games, climbing their way up the ranks by a lot, now in 6th place overall, being around 10th before. Magic however are 2-8 with 6 of it being due to the recent injuries without jalen and goga. Magics have been losing to teams like blazers, raptors. Currently magic injury list has Jalen and Goga as GTD. If these two end up playing, it will be harder to decide as we are unsure of their performance coming back from injury. A significant thing to note is that Franz wagner is now playing, coming back from an injury he will be on a minutes restriction and they lost to blazers the other day despite having franz wagner back in. Now if jalen and goga do not play, at the current odds I would take a pistons + spread, but if they also come back then it is hard to say a winner due to the unexpected performance from people returning form injury. Instead an under points looks good here, under 212.5 points due to the minutes restriction factor and the defensive capability of the magics being the best defence in the league and pistons have a history of struggling to score against them. No player props for this game due to so many different variables of returning injuries etc and low sample size.¬†

Straights

* Total points under 212.5

**Kings vs Knicks**

King injuries - Dearron fox GTD

Knicks injuries - Josh hart GTD

Game quality: Okay

Risks: No H2H data can be used

No good H2H data can be used at all due to a very different lineup from both teams last season. Knicks will be playing home and have a 4 day rest advantage. The only confirmations that can be used here is from recent performance. Kings have been doing very well recently as they are 8-2 in the last 10 with their only losses being 9 point loss to nuggets and 15 point to bucks. Knicks are higher in the standings overall but are 5-5 in their last 5, with a mere 4 point win over nets, 17 point loss to timberwolves, 5 point loss to pistons, 15 point loss to bulls, who are all lower than knicks in standings. It is quite hard to predict a spread here due to no H2H data and knicks being quite inconsistent lately. Thus I will be mainly focusing on player props. My prediction pick here will be kings +6.5 just for research purposes and not to bet.

Straights¬†

* Demar derozan over 19.5 points
* Malik monk 20+ points
* Karl Anthony Towns over 3.5 assists

Legs

* Domantas sabonis 15+points\*\*\*
* Malik monk 15+ points

**Hawks vs Raptors**

Hawks injuries - Jalen johnson OUT, Zaccharie Risacher OUT, Clint Capela GTD, Trae young GTD

Raptors injuries - Immanuel quickley OUT, Ochai OUT

Game quality: Good

Risks: Potential strategy change-up from the hawks which may affect the player props a lot. 

Good recent H2H from a few days ago, the raptors beat the hawks by 3 points playing from away. The prediction I made a few days ago and the analysis for it still remains relevant, the difference maker was RJ barrett as 3 H2H games ago, the presence of RJ allowed raptors to win by 2 points while the H2H 2 games ago was a blowout win by hawks due to no RJ. The raptors will be playing from away again for this rematch. Both have equal rest advantage. Hawks are playing from a revenge position. Raptors have seen the most improvement in the recent 5 games. ‚ÄúRaptors managed to defeat the celtics by13 points while hawks only beat them by 4 points. Raptors lost to knicks by 14 points, while hawks lost by 9. Relative to their current standings in the league, raptors have had good improvement as of late and we could see a much closer game than what the current standings indicate. Raptors in the past 5 games have an offensive rating of 115.8 while their season average is 111.1. Hawks this seas‚Äùn are at 112.2 while they have a rating of 109.8 in their recent 5 games.‚Äù It is hard to say whether raptors will be able to continue this streak from this revenge spot for the hawks. This game doesn‚Äôt deserve a spread bet due to conflicting confirmations, my research prediction however will be hawks -3.5.¬†

Straights

* Dyson daniels over 5.5 rebounds
* Onyeka 15+ points
* Bruce brown 18.5+ PRA

Legs

* Dyson daniels 4+ rebounds
* Onyeka 10+ points
* Onyeka 8+ rebounds
* Scottie barnes 15+ points\*\*\*
* RJ barrett 1+ threes\*\*\*"

**Who**: [UConn](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/connecticut/men/2025.html) (14-5, #19 AP, #18 Coaches, #35 KenPom, #32 T-Rank, #34 NET) vs [Xavier](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/xavier/men/2025.html) (12-8, unranked AP/Coaches, #45 KenPom, #55 T-Rank, #53 NET)

**When**: January 25 at 8:00 PM ET

**Where**: Cincinnati, OH and Fox

**Notes**: Though all the rankings place Xavier below UConn, given that this is a road game against a pretty solid team UConn narrowly beat at home, expect this to be a difficult game that may not turn out the way we'd like. In the previous meeting we were without an important piece, Johnson, which actually led to Reed having arguably his best game as a Husky with 20 pts and 13 rebounds. But Xavier was without an even more important player, Freemantle, arguably their best player."

"Fed employee, big fallout fight with Parents - not sure where to go from here",workingmoms,1i9wtae,2025-01-25 15:55:58,48,1.0,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/workingmoms/comments/1i9wtae/fed_employee_big_fallout_fight_with_parents_not/,Mother_of_Daphnia,Anyone can respond,"First, I want to apologize to everyone here (especially those outside of the US) for making another politically- themed post but you guys always give great advice here and I‚Äôd like to hear your thoughts. Basically, my husband and I are both federal employees living in a HCOL area. As you can imagine, the onslaught of EOs are having a dramatic effect on our day to day lives. Not just the RTO, but there‚Äôs a very real chance one of us could lose our jobs, on top of a list of other things. We‚Äôre trying not to panic and instead come up with back up plans, but it‚Äôs very hard. We‚Äôre watching friends and neighbors spiraling around us. Overall a bad situation. 

Anyway, my parents are big Trump (and Musk) supporters. They‚Äôre good grandparents and our relationship has always been alright, but I wouldn‚Äôt exactly call them my best friends or nominate them from grandparents of the year awards. We‚Äôve always been able to look past these differences in opinion but idk if I can do that anymore. My mom called me this morning and - thinking I could lean on my own mother - I started telling her how we‚Äôre really worried and struggling. She got extremely defensive and started spewing out what sounded like the headline ticker for Fox News. All kinds of racist, sexiest, and completely untrue claims including the typical bullshit of ‚ÄúTrump is going to save us‚Äù and ‚Äúthe democrats want the illegals to run the country‚Äù etc. It was shocking. I new their views were a little backwards, but I didn‚Äôt realize the deep level of hatred they held. She told me we‚Äôd have to ‚Äúget over it‚Äù in reference to how difficult this administration is making our lives. I didn‚Äôt expect that at all. On top of it all, aside from myself and my husband being fed employees (and vets too), my brother is gay and my sister works a union job. I told her that it seems like they are putting their hatred for Democrats (or whatever other boogeyman Fox tells them to hate) over the well-being of their children. She hung up, and basically I don‚Äôt know where to go from here. I tried to write this as concisely as possible, but if anyone has any insight please let me know. I don‚Äôt necessarily want to cut them off forever, but I don‚Äôt know how I can get passed the‚Ä¶ignorance? Cruelty? Idk. "
Any good places to buy used in PNW?,bassoon,1i9wsmp,2025-01-25 15:55:10,2,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/bassoon/comments/1i9wsmp/any_good_places_to_buy_used_in_pnw/,who_dis,,"I was a solid all-state (NC) level player in HS and played semi-seriously through college, had a Fox 240 that I loved but have not played since college (now almost 40).  Sold it to help with a house down payment.  Somehow I still have the serial number memorized haha. 

Anyway, I live in Seattle now and want to get back into it and find a community ensemble to join.  Wondering if there are any good resources to try and buy in person up here?  I‚Äôm thinking staying with Fox since it‚Äôs what I know and maybe getting another Fox in the $5-7k range, maybe more if I found a good deal on another 240. 

Also I used to make/shape my own reeds but want to find a good place to buy them. I don‚Äôt remember much about it all but was going to try a few of the different ones from Bocal Majority (maybe 6, 7 or 8?). Any good tips for buying reeds?

I bring this up for two reasons - NBC doesn‚Äôt get NASCAR broadcasting rights till midway through the season, meaning any fans they draw in have to deal with Fox for a majority of the first half until the debacle of ‚ÄúDo you have ____ streaming service?‚Äù

I just want NASCAR to be shown in a positive light and it appears (at least to me) that NBC does a better job of it even when it‚Äôs not even their broadcast for Daytona they‚Äôre promoting technically. 

Granted, I understand they broadcast the night race at Daytona which is huge and they make it feel like an event. But I‚Äôm curious and yearn what a NBC broadcast 500 would be like. Maybe I‚Äôll be proven wrong this year and FOX does an awesome job, I‚Äôd like to be proven wrong "

Trying to understand Buddhism in Japan,japan,1i9vtgs,2025-01-25 15:11:50,8,0.72,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/1i9vtgs/trying_to_understand_buddhism_in_japan/,GengarPokemonPenis,,"I've been trying to learn more about Buddhism since I didn't really understand it's role in Japan or Japanese history.

Here are some of the things that I have ""learned"" and want to know if there is something I'm wrong about, and if so please correct me.

\- Although there are people that identify as Buddhists, identifying as a buddhist seems more akin to saying you're a member of a cult, like Soka Gakkai.  
Buddhism's presence in Japan seems to be more of a ""thing that exists"". In the west everyone used to identify as Christian, and now it is more of a ""thing that exists"" as well, but in Japan it seems Buddhism has always been very separate from the lives of ordinary people. Or at least since the Kamakura period.

\- Buddhism removing itself from superstition is largely a modern concept.  
Shinto and Buddhism were formally separated in the late 1800s, but before then Japanese Buddhism was overwhelmed by the presence of Shinto and superstitions. For example, in the writings of Zen master Hakuin, as 'recently' as the 1700s he describes a lot of Shinto elements in his writings about avoiding things like fox spirits, demons and ghosts while in the same sentences also preaching Buddhism.

\- Corruption at Japanese temples is quite rampant, or at least perceived as rampant. This may be up for contention since I read this from a western Zen monk in Japan who seemed very critical of Buddhism in Japan. He believed that since most temples are inherited by family lineage, this ends up with a lot of temples where priests have zero interest in Buddhist doctrine and are simply doing it out of obligation.  
Because they rely on donations, this also ends up with a power dynamic where the larger temples become rich and have a much more dominating presence over smaller temples. Because of this practice temples are also largely seen as a family business.

\- Even though meditation is highly valued in Japanese Buddhism (except for Jodo Shinshu), it's actually very rare for people, including Buddhists and monks to practice meditation.

\- It is mainly seen as a funeral service.  
As a result of that there's also a lot of superstition, such as people avoiding monks in the street, and monks wearing robes may not enter hospitals.  
And as temples are seen as a ""place of death"", people would rather marry in Christian churches than a temple despite not being Christian.

\- The average Japanese person has no clue what Buddhism teaches, and only know it as a lot of sitting and people recanting sutras and mantras."

Here's a new edition of ""Directors at the Box Office"", which seeks to explore the directors' trajectory at the box office and analyze their hits and bombs. 

For the first time, the director‚Äôs name was kept hidden. The purpose of the mystery? That‚Äôs up to you to decipher. But it‚Äôs a timely choice.

And so it is time to talk about‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶

Oliver Stone.

As a child, he often spent parts of his summer vacations with his maternal grandparents in France, both in Paris and La Fert√©-sous-Jouarre in Seine-et-Marne. Stone was admitted to Yale University, but left in June 1965 at age 18 to teach high school students English for six months in Saigon at the Free Pacific Institute in South Vietnam. In April 1967, Stone enlisted in the United States Army and requested combat duty in Vietnam. From September 27, 1967, to February 23, 1968, he served in Vietnam with 2nd Platoon, B Company, 3rd Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division. He was wounded twice, for which he earned the Purple Heart. Following the war, Stone suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. Stone graduated from New York University with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in film in 1971, where his teachers included director and fellow NYU alumnus Martin Scorsese. While working as a taxi driver, he worked as a screenwriter before finally being allowed to direct.

From a box office perspective, how reliable was he to deliver a box office hit?

That's the point of this post. To analyze his career.

#**It should be noted that as he started his career in the 1970s, the domestic grosses here will be adjusted by inflation. The table with his highest grossing films, however, will be left in its unadjusted form, as the worldwide grosses are more difficult to adjust.**

#**Seizure (1974)**

His directorial debut. It stars Jonathan Frid, Martine Beswick, Herv√© Villechaize, and Henry Judd Baker. In the film, horror writer Edmund Blackstone sees his recurring nightmare come to chilling life one weekend as one by one, his friends and family are killed by three villains: the Queen of Evil, a dwarf named Spider, and a giant scar-faced strongman called Jackal.
It didn‚Äôt get a proper theatrical release. Star Mary Woronov would later claim that one of the film's producers was gangster Michael Thevis, who partially bankrolled the film in an attempt to launder money, as he was under investigation by the FBI.

#**The Hand (1981)**

His second film. Based on the novel *The Lizard's Tail* by Marc Brandel, it stars Michael Caine and Andrea Marcovicci. It follows Jon Lansdale, a comic book artist who loses his hand, which in turn takes on a murderous life of its own.

The film received mixed reviews and was a box office failure. But Stone still had some clout in the industry thanks to his screenwriting credits, so he would continue having more chances.

- **Budget:** $6,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $2,447,576. ($8.4 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $2,447,576.

#**Salvador (1986)**

His third film. It stars James Woods, Jim Belushi, Michael Murphy, Elpidia Carrillo, John Savage and Cynthia Gibb. The film tells the story of an American journalist covering the Salvadoran Civil War who becomes entangled with both the FMLN and the right-wing military dictatorship while trying to rescue his girlfriend and her children.

Oliver Stone had originally intended to film this directly within El Salvador itself. Having been disappointed with the lack of commercial success for his previous two films, and with a newborn son to raise, Stone was contemplating ideas when a chance meeting with Richard Boyle, whom he considered an eccentric kindred spirit, inspired him to collaborate with Boyle and create *Salvador*. Stone himself was a Vietnam War veteran and frustrated with the war itself, thus allowing him to channel his political disdain for war into the story and characters of the film.

While it wasn‚Äôt a box office success, it received critical acclaim. Woods and Stone received Oscar nominations for the film, allowing him to continue his career.

- **Budget:** $4,500,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $1,500,000. ($4.2 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $1,500,000.

#**Platoon (1986)**

*‚ÄùThe first casualty of war is innocence.‚Äù*

His fourth film. It stars Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, Keith David, Kevin Dillon, John C. McGinley, Forest Whitaker, and Johnny Depp. The film, based on Stone's experience from the war, follows a new U.S. Army volunteer serving in Vietnam while his Platoon Sergeant and his Squad Leader argue over the morality in the platoon and of the war itself.

Development began as early as 1968, months after Stone had completed his own tour of duty fighting in Vietnam. Stone first wrote a screenplay called *Break*, a semi-autobiographical account detailing his experiences with his parents and his time in the Vietnam War. Stone's active duty service resulted in a ""big change"" in how he viewed life and the war. Although *Break* was never produced, he later used it as the basis for *Platoon*. The script was set to music from The Doors; Stone sent the script to Jim Morrison in the hope he would play the lead (Morrison had the script with him when he died in Paris).

After establishing his career as a screenwriter, Stone redeveloped *Break* as a new concept, while still keeping some elements. Despite some success as screenwriter, most studios were still reluctant to finance *Platoon*, because it was about the unpopular Vietnam War. The Department of Defense refused to support the production of the film due to its depiction of American war crimes, claiming the script was ""rife with unrealistic and highly unfavorable depictions of the American soldier.‚Äù Dino De Laurentiis helped Stone in securing Hemdale, but they first wanted him to direct *Salvador*.

When the film was greenlit, Stone offered the lead role to James Woods. While he liked Stone, Woods didn‚Äôt want to experience so many months in the jungle with him. Many actors were interested in joining, like Denzel Washington hoping to play Elias. When Willem Dafoe was cast, he suggested casting Charlie Sheen as Taylor. Jon Cryer, who would later co-star with Sheen in *Two and a Half Men*, auditioned for the role of Bunny, losing to Kevin Dillon. Many Vietnamese refugees living in the Philippines at the time were recruited to act in different Vietnamese roles in the film.

The production made a deal with the Philippine military for the use of military equipment. As a result of the Department of Defense refusing to supply historically-accurate equipment and uniforms, the film instead used equipment belonging to the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Upon arrival in the Philippines, the cast was sent on an intensive training course, during which they had to dig foxholes and were subjected to forced marches and nighttime ""ambushes,"" which used special-effects explosions. Led by Vietnam War veteran Dale Dye, training put the principal actors ‚Äî including Sheen, Dafoe, Depp and Whitaker ‚Äî through an immersive 30-day military-style training regimen. They limited how much food and water they could drink and eat and when the actors slept, fired blanks to keep the tired actors awake.

After a strong run in limited release, the film hit wide release on its seventh weekend, managing to top the box office. It held incredibly well, breaking so many records for Orion Pictures. It eventually closed with a fantastic $138 million domestically, becoming the third highest grossing film in North America for 1986. It received critical acclaim, lauded as one of the greatest war films ever made. The film received 8 Oscar nominations and won 4: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Film Editing and Best Sound. Stone was now a huge name in the industry and was ready for more.

- **Budget:** $6,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $138,530,565. ($396.4 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $138,530,565.

#**Wall Street (1987)**

*‚ÄùEvery dream has a price.‚Äù*

His fifth film. It stars Michael Douglas, Charlie Sheen, Daryl Hannah, and Martin Sheen. The film tells the story of Bud Fox, a young stockbroker who becomes involved with Gordon Gekko, a wealthy, unscrupulous corporate raider.

After the success of *Platoon*, Stone wanted film school friend Stanley Weiser to research and write a screenplay about quiz show scandals in the 1950s. During a story conference, Stone suggested making a film about Wall Street instead. The director pitched the premise of two investment partners getting involved in questionable financial dealings, using each other, and they are tailed by a prosecutor as in *Crime and Punishment*. Stone had been thinking about this kind of a movie as early as 1981 and was inspired by his father, Lou Stone, a broker during the Great Depression at Hayden Stone.

Stone considered Tom Cruise to play Fox, but he already committed to reunite with Charlie Sheen in the film. Sheen also convinced Stone to cast his father Martin as his character‚Äôs father. The studio wanted Warren Beatty to play Gekko, but he was not interested. After Richard Gere passed on the role, Stone went with Michael Douglas despite having been advised by others in Hollywood not to cast him. Douglas was known for heroic roles and was looking for something dark and edgy.

The film was a huge success, earning $90 million worldwide. It also received critical acclaim, becoming one of the most iconic films of the 80s. After overcoming obstacles, Michael Douglas won the Academy Award for Best Actor. Stone was just unstoppable.

- **Budget:** $16,500,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $43,848,069. ($121 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $90,448,069.

#**Talk Radio (1988)**

*‚ÄùThe last neighborhood in America.‚Äù*

His sixth film. Based on the play by Eric Bogosian and Tad Savinar, it stars Bogosian, Alec Baldwin, Ellen Greene, and Leslie Hope. When his show is about to go national, Barry, a controversial radio personality, has to cope with family issues, hate mails and a call from a stranger threatening to plant a bomb.

Despite positive reviews, it was a box office failure.

- **Budget:** $4,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $3,468,572. ($9.1 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $3,468,572.

#**Born on the Fourth of July (1989)**

*‚ÄùA true story of innocence lost and courage found.‚Äù*

His seventh film. Based on the 1976 autobiography of Ron Kovic, it stars Tom Cruise, Kyra Sedgwick, Raymond J. Barry, Jerry Levine, Frank Whaley, and Willem Dafoe. The film depicts the life of Kovic over a 20-year period, detailing his childhood, his military service and paralysis during the Vietnam War, and his transition to anti-war activism. 

Al Pacino expressed interest in portraying Ron Kovic after watching his televised appearance at the 1976 Democratic National Convention and reading his autobiography. He also turned down starring roles in the Vietnam War-themed films *Coming Home* and *Apocalypse Now*, the former for which Kovic would act as a consultant. Kovic met with Pacino in New York, where they discussed adapting the book to film. In September 1976, Pacino's manager, producer Martin Bregman, contacted Kovic's agent and entered into negotiations for the film rights. Filming was scheduled to begin in June 1977 with Paramount acting as distributor, but the project fell apart. Bregman and Pacino were unhappy with the script, and the studio dropped the film.

When the project fell apart, Stone was hired to write a new screenplay. Stone promised Kovic that if his career took off, he would return to Kovic to revive the project. Kovic stated that after the release of *Platoon*, Stone called Kovic and told him he was ready to return working on the film.

Stone's agent Paula Wagner had shown *Platoon* to Tom Cruise, after he had expressed interest in working with Stone. The studio was concerned over the prospects of Cruise appearing as a dramatic film lead. Stone, in particular, had dismissed his previous film *Top Gun* as a ""fascist movie"", but expressed that he was drawn to Cruise's ""Golden Boy"" image, ""I saw this kid who has everything. And I wondered what would happen if tragedy strikes, if fortune denies him ... I thought it was an interesting proposition: What would happen to Tom Cruise if something goes wrong?"" Kovic was also wary of Cruise's casting, but relented when the actor visited him at his home in Massapequa, New York.

With a big name like Cruise, the film was a colossal success, earning $161 million worldwide, becoming Stone‚Äôs highest grossing film. It also received critical acclaim and earned 8 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor. Stone would end up winning Best Director, marking his third Oscar win. Unstoppable.

- **Budget:** $17,800,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $70,001,698. ($177.0 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $161,001,698.

#**The Doors (1991)**

*‚ÄùThere are things known and things unknown. And in between are‚Ä¶‚Äù*

His eighth film. It stars Val Kilmer, Meg Ryan, Kyle MacLachlan, Frank Whaley, Kevin Dillon, Billy Idol, and Kathleen Quinlan. It is based on the history of American rock band the Doors and their influence on music and counterculture, mainly focusing on singer Jim Morrison.

For many years, there were attempts in making a Doors biopic, with directors like Quentin Tarantino, Brian De Palma, Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin attached at one point. Stone was offered the position and he met with the surviving band members, telling them he wanted to keep a particularly wild scene from one of the early drafts. The group was offended by this and exercised their right of approval over the director, rejecting Stone. But after watching *Platoon*, they approved Stone, although keyboardist Ray Manzarek had his reservations.

When Stone began talking about the project in 1988, he had Val Kilmer in mind to play Morrison, after seeing him in *Willow*. Kilmer had the same kind of singing voice as Morrison and, to convince Stone that he was right for the role, spent several thousand dollars of his own money and made his own eight-minute audition video, singing and looking like Morrison at various stages of his life. To prepare for the role, Kilmer lost weight and spent six months rehearsing Doors songs every day; the actor learned 50 songs, 15 of which are actually performed in the film. When the Doors heard Kilmer singing they could not tell whether the voice was Kilmer's or Morrison's.

Despite the band‚Äôs popularity, the film flopped at the box office. It also received mixed reviews; Kilmer received high praise for his performance, but many criticized its historical inaccuracies and depiction of Morrison.

- **Budget:** $32,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $34,416,893. ($79.2 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $34,416,893.

#**JFK (1991)**

*‚ÄùHe's a District Attorney. He will risk his life, the lives of his family, everything he holds dear for the one thing he holds sacred... the truth.‚Äù*

His ninth film. Based on the book *On the Trail of the Assassins* by Jim Garrison, it stars Kevin Costner, Kevin Bacon, Tommy Lee Jones, Laurie Metcalf, Gary Oldman, Michael Rooker, Jay O. Sanders, Sissy Spacek, John Candy, Jack Lemmon, Ed Asner, Donald Sutherland, and Martin Sheen. The film examines the investigation into the assassination of John F. Kennedy by New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison, who came to believe there was a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy and that Lee Harvey Oswald was a scapegoat.

Stone was introduced to Garrison‚Äôs book and immediately optioned the film rights. Stone met Garrison and grilled him with a variety of questions for three hours. Garrison stood up to Stone's questioning and then got up and left. His pride and dignity impressed the director. Stone's impressions from their meeting were that ""Garrison made many mistakes. He trusted a lot of weirdos and followed a lot of fake leads. But he went out on a limb, way out. And he kept going, even when he knew he was facing long odds.""

One of Stone‚Äôs primary goals was to provide a rebuttal to the Warren Commission's report that he believed was ""a great myth. And in order to fight a myth, maybe you have to create another one, a counter-myth."" Stone was hungry for more information and hired Jane Rusconi, a recent Yale University graduate, to lead a team of researchers and assemble as much information about the assassination as possible. Stone read two dozen books on the assassination while Rusconi read between 100 and 200 books on the subject.

The film marked a fundamental change in the way that Stone constructed his films: a subjective lateral presentation of the plot, with the editing's rhythm carrying the story. Stone brought in Hank Corwin, an editor of commercials, to help edit the film. Stone chose him because his ""chaotic mind"" was ""totally alien to the film form.""

Since its announcement, the film drew controversy. Many major American newspapers ran editorials accusing Stone of spreading untruths, including the claim that Kennedy was killed as part of a coup d'√©tat to install Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson in his place. Stone split his time making the film, responding to criticism, and conducting a publicity campaign that saw him ""omnipresent, from CBS Evening News, to Oprah.""

The film debuted with just $5 million, leading many to label it as a flop, although some blamed the 3-hour runtime as it limited screenings. But WB was confident that business would pick up, and they increased their marketing campaign. And it worked; it legged out to $70 million domestically. But the real story was in the rest of the world. Normally, a film focused on American politics would massively skew domestically, but *JFK* is not one of those. In fact, the overseas markets represented 65% of its worldwide gross. It earned a huge $205 million worldwide, becoming Stone‚Äôs highest grossing film. It was a phenomenon. 

Despite being accused of spreading conspiracy theories, the film received critical acclaim, particularly for its performances, directing, cinematography and editing. It earned 8 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director, winning for Best Cinematography and Best Editing.

- **Budget:** $40,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $70,405,498. ($162.1 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $205,405,498.

#**Heaven & Earth (1993)**

*‚ÄùFrom Vietnam to America, one woman's journey from hope, to love, to discovery.‚Äù*

His 10th film. Based on the book *When Heaven and Earth Changed Places* by Le Ly Hayslip, it stars Tommy Lee Jones, Haing S. Ngor, Joan Chen, and Hiep Thi Le. Tragedy forces Le Ly to leave her job and return to her previous province, where she meets Steve Butler, a gunnery sergeant in the United States Marine Corps. Things change when they fall in love.

The film was a critical and commercial dud.

- **Budget:** $33,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $5,864,949. ($12.7 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $5,864,949.

#**Natural Born Killers (1994)**

*‚ÄùThe media made them superstars.‚Äù*

His 11th film. It stars Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Robert Downey Jr., Tommy Lee Jones, and Tom Sizemore. The film tells the story of two victims of traumatic childhoods who become lovers and mass murderers, and are irresponsibly glorified by the mass media.

Quentin Tarantino wrote a script, in which a married couple goes on a killing spree. He hoped to direct it, but instead chose to sell it for $10,000. WB eventually got it, and Stone became interested in the film. Stone re-wrote the script with David Veloz and Richard Rutowski,, keeping much of the dialogue but changing the focus of the film from journalist Wayne Gale to Mickey and Mallory. The script was revised so drastically that Tarantino was credited for the story only. Tarantino stated that he did not hold any animosity towards Stone, and that he wished the film well.

Stone originally wanted it to be an action film, but incidents such as the O. J. Simpson case, the Menendez brothers case, the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan incident, the Rodney King incident, and the Waco siege all took place. Stone came to feel that the media was heavily involved in the outcome of all of these cases, and that the media had become an all-pervasive entity which marketed violence and suffering for the good of ratings. As such, he changed the tone of the film from one of purely action to a ""vicious, coldhearted farce"" on the media.

Stone cast Woody Harrelson partly because, ""frankly, he had that American, trashy look. There's something about Woody that evokes Kentucky or white trash."" At the time, Harrelson was primarily known for his comedic performances, namely his role on the sitcom *Cheers*, and Stone was compelled to cast him against type. Stone cast Lewis for a similar reason, noting that, despite her success as portraying a defiled teenage daughter in *Cape Fear*, he felt she could ""pull off white trash, too.‚Äù Stone cast comedy legend Rodney Dangerfield as Mallory‚Äôs rapist father, but Stone didn‚Äôt give him a script; he simply told Dangerfield he was going to play ""the father from Hell.‚Äù As such, Dangerfield wrote all the ""filthy stuff"" his character said. 

It was filmed and edited in a frenzied and psychedelic style and features both color and black and white cinematography, as well as animation, and other unusual color schemes and visual compositions. Editing of the film lasted approximately 11 months, with the final film containing almost 3,000 cuts (most films have 600‚Äì700). The film also employs a wide range of camera angles, featuring Dutch tilts prominently throughout, with the camera rarely angling along a horizontal field of vision. Coca-Cola approved the use of the Polar Bear ads for its product in the movie without having a full idea of what the movie was about; when the Board of Directors saw the finished product, they were furious.

The film topped the box office in its opening weekend, closing with $50 million domestically and $110 million worldwide, becoming another success for Stone. But the film received divisive reactions from critics and audiences. Those who hated it criticized its editing, visual style, depravity, graphic violence and satire, while fans praised it for those exact same things.

Tarantino disowned the film, saying, ""I hated that fucking movie. If you like my stuff, don't watch that movie."" He also claimed to have never watched the film from beginning to end. From almost the moment of its release, the film has been accused of encouraging and inspiring numerous murderers in North America, including the perpetrators of the 1997 Heath High School shooting and the Columbine High School massacre. Needless to say, it has appeared in lists for ‚Äúmost controversial films ever‚Äù.

- **Budget:** $34,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $50,282,766. ($106.4 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $110,282,766.

#**Nixon (1995)**

*‚ÄùTriumphant in victory, bitter in defeat.‚Äù

His 12th film. It stars Anthony Hopkins, Joan Allen, Powers Boothe, Ed Harris, Bob Hoskins, E. G. Marshall, David Paymer, David Hyde Pierce, Paul Sorvino, Mary Steenburgen, J. T. Walsh, and James Woods. The film tells the story of the political and personal life of former U.S. President Richard Nixon, portrayed as a complex and in many respects admirable, albeit deeply flawed, person.

While it received positive reviews, it was one of the biggest flops of 1995.

- **Budget:** $44,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $13,681,765. ($28.1 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $13,681,765.

#**U Turn (1997)**

*‚ÄùSex. Murder. Betrayal. Everything that makes life worth living.‚Äù*

His 13th film. Based on the novel *Stray Dogs* by John Ridley, it stars Sean Penn, Billy Bob Thornton, Jennifer Lopez, Jon Voight, Powers Boothe, Joaquin Phoenix, Claire Danes and Nick Nolte. Bobby Cooper is a drifter who is on the run due to his debt to a violent gangster. When his car breaks down in a town in Arizona, things begin to go wrong.

It was a critical and commercial failure.

- **Budget:** $19,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $6,682,098. ($13 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $6,682,098.

#**Any Given Sunday (1999)**

*‚ÄùLife is a contact sport.‚Äù*

His 14th film. Based on the 1984 novel by NFL defensive end Pat Toomay, it stars Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Dennis Quaid, Jamie Foxx, James Woods, LL Cool J, Ann-Margret, Lauren Holly, Matthew Modine, John C. McGinley, Charlton Heston, Bill Bellamy, Lela Rochon, Aaron Eckhart, Elizabeth Berkley, and NFL players Jim Brown and Lawrence Taylor. Tony D'Amato coaches the Miami Sharks football team and struggles to help them succeed. Meanwhile, he also has a troubled relationship with the owner of the team.

Stone failed to get the National Football League's permission to use real NFL team logos and stadiums for the film. As a result, the Sharks play at the Miami Orange Bowl (which the NFL Miami Dolphins abandoned after the 1986 season) in the fictional Affiliated Football Franchises of America (AFFA), which is not to be confused with the real AFA; the AFFA exists alongside the NFL in this universe, as the Dolphins are mentioned in one scene.

It received mixed reviews, and fell short of breaking even.

- **Budget:** $55,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $75,530,832. ($142.2 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $100,230,832.

#**Alexander (2004)**

*‚ÄùFortune favors the bold.‚Äù*

His 15th film. Based on the book *Alexander the Great* by the University of Oxford historian Robin Lane Fox, it stars Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer, Jared Leto, Rosario Dawson, and Anthony Hopkins. It is based on the life of the ancient Macedonian general and king Alexander the Great.

While Stone has attracted mixed reviews before, he wasn‚Äôt prepared for the reception here. The film got obliterated by critics, who lambasted it as one of the worst films of the year. The audience reception was also horrible; it got a ‚ÄúD+‚Äù on CinemaScore, which was the worst grade given to a $100+ million film. The film massively flopped in North America, and while it saved some face in Europe, it went down as one of the biggest flops in history. Ouch.

- **Budget:** $155,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $34,297,191. ($56.9 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $167,298,192.

#**World Trade Center (2006)**

*‚ÄùA true story of courage and survival.‚Äù*


His 16th film. It stars Nicolas Cage, Michael Pe√±a, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Maria Bello, Stephen Dorff, Jay Hernandez, and Michael Shannon. The film is based on the experience of a team of Port Authority Police Officers during the September 11 attacks, in which they were trapped inside the rubble of the collapsed World Trade Center.

Many major American newspapers ran editorials accusing Stone of having his film examine 9/11 conspiracy theories because Stone was known for examining various conspiracy theories surrounding the Kennedy assassination in *JFK*. However, Stone has stated that the film does not explore the conspiracy theories surrounding 9/11. He, the producers, and the real McLoughlin and Jimeno, have said the film is a simple dedication to the heroism and sadness of the day with little-to-no political themes.

After a few failures, this was a much needed success for Stone.

- **Budget:** $65,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $70,278,893. ($10.3 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $163,247,198.

#**W. (2008)**

*‚ÄùA life misunderestimated.‚Äù*

His 17th film. It stars Josh Brolin, Elizabeth Banks, James Cromwell, Ellen Burstyn, Thandiwe Newton, Jeffrey Wright, Scott Glenn, and Richard Dreyfuss, and follows the life of President George W. Bush.

It received mixed reviews, and was another financial failure.

- **Budget:** $25,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $25,534,493. ($37.2 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $29,560,587.

#**Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010)**

*‚ÄùGordon never gives up.‚Äù*

His 18th film. The sequel to *Wall Street*, it stars Michael Douglas, Shia LaBeouf, Josh Brolin, Carey Mulligan, Frank Langella, Susan Sarandon and Eli Wallach. The film takes place in New York City, 23 years after the original, and revolves around the 2008 financial crisis. Its plot centers on a supposedly reformed Gordon Gekko, and follows his attempts to repair his relationship with his daughter Winnie, with the help of her fianc√©, Jacob Moore.

In 2007, development began, as Douglas was very interested in playing Gekko again, with Stone back as director. Stone was not interested in a sequel, but reconsidered passing on directing the film after the stock market crash. Stone said that the film will provide more of a social commentary and admitted that he had never expected high finance to ""serve again as a tableau for his storytelling"". He also added that its plot will showcase the unemployment rate at an all-time high and the ""our national debt ever climbing.""

Neither Charlie Sheen nor Daryl Hannah were expected to return, for unknown reasons. Nevertheless, Stone convinced Sheen to return for a brief appearance. Sheen was able to shoot his scene in one day and described being on set with Stone and Douglas as strange, with Stone adding that it was difficult for the actor. Sheen reportedly had trouble remembering his lines and required some prodding to remember his cue during the party scene in which Gekko encounters Fox.

The film earned $134 million worldwide, although it still fell short of breaking even. Reception was mixed, widely considered inferior to the original.

- **Budget:** $70,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $52,474,616. ($75.4 million adjusted)

#**Snowden (2016)**

*‚ÄùThe only safe place is on the run.‚Äù*

His 20th film. Based on the books *The Snowden Files* by Luke Harding and *Time of the Octopus* by Anatoly Kucherena, it stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Shailene Woodley, Melissa Leo, Zachary Quinto, Tom Wilkinson, Scott Eastwood, Logan Marshall-Green, Timothy Olyphant, Ben Schnetzer, LaKeith Lee Stanfield, Rhys Ifans and Nicolas Cage. It follows the life of Edward Snowden, a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) subcontractor and whistleblower who copied and leaked highly classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) beginning in 2013. 

When Stone was first approached to helm the film, he was hesitant. At the time, he was working on another controversial subject, about the last few years in the life of Martin Luther King Jr., with Jamie Foxx attached to star, and did not immediately wish to tackle a project as incendiary again. Nonetheless, a series of events and persuasion prompted him to finally agree to direct it. Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who worked with Laura Poitras to break the Snowden story, asked him for some advice; a couple of months later, Snowden's Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, contacted Stone via his producer asking to meet him.

Stone travelled to Russia, where he met Snowden multiple times. He was wary over a film based on his life, but eventually gave his blessing and decided to help with the production. Although he became involved in the project, he was given no script approval, nor did he receive any payment for the film. Gordon-Levitt met Snowden as well, and pledged to donate his entire salary from the film to ""help facilitate the conversation"" about the relationship between technology and democracy.

Problems arose in Russia, however, as companies that were affiliated with the U.S. refused to become involved in the project, and no studio was ready to support it. It became extremely difficult for Stone, who had to finance everything along with the producer. Due to fear of interference by the National Security Agency, Stone decided to shoot the film mostly outside of the United States. Eventually, financing came through from France and Germany, and the film ended up being shot in Germany as a German production, with contracts being signed eight days before production began.

Well, Stone had it coming again: mixed reviews, box office failure. Ouch.

- **Budget:** $40,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $21,587,519. ($28.2 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $37,357,216.

#**Unrealized Projects**

He had a lot of films attached as director, but never got to work on them.

- *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas:* So many challenges in getting this made.

- *Conan the Barbarian:* Stone wrote the script and hoped to direct it, but John Milius took over. Milius also re-wrote his script, even though they‚Äôre both credited as writers.

- *Demolished Man:* It didn't become a film because of technical limitations and Stone's busy writer-director schedule.

- *Evita:* A passion project that eventually got released in 1996, but without Stone attached.

- A Howard Hughes biopic: He worked with WB in making the film. However, since Warren Beatty owned the rights to make the film, the project never materialized.

- *Return of the Apes:* He was gonna direct a *Planet of the Apes* film, with Arnold Schwarzenegger slated to star.

- *Elektra:* He was gonna direct an adaptation of the Marvel character in 1992, but it didn‚Äôt pan out.

- *George Washington:* Robert Redford decided to produce and star in the film, charting Washington's life before the American Revolution and through his presidency. He got Stone involved as director, but it never happened.

- *Mission: Impossible 2:* Cruise got Stone attached as the director in the initial phase. Stone described his version as ""a vehicle to say something about the state of corporate culture and technology and global politics in the 21st century"". He further noted that the film's commercial nature and Cruise's star power would, in a way, ""[give him] some camouflage"" when delving into overtly political themes. Stone would hire David Marconi to write the script, but the former would ultimately leave the project for unknown reasons.

- *American Psycho:* Stone was hired to adapt the novel, which would star Leonardo DiCaprio. Had Stone directed, James Woods would have portrayed Donald Kimball and Cameron Diaz would have portrayed Evelyn Williams. Stone dropped out of the project after DiCaprio left it in favor of *The Beach*.

- *Superman:* He expressed interest in direct the film in the early 2000s, when Nicolas Cage was attached.

- *Oppenheimer:* Stone tweeted in 2023 that he was once offered to make a film based on the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer saying ""I couldn't find my way to its essence"" at the time.

#**The Future**

Last year, Stone said he‚Äôs working on one final film. He didn‚Äôt disclose what it was about, but referred to it as ‚Äúan important narrative‚Äù.

He made 20 films, but only 19 have reported box office numbers. Across those 19 films, he made $1,489,138,647 worldwide. That's $78,375,718 per film.

#**The Verdict**

Quite inconsistent, but one thing you can absolutely hand over to Stone is that his hits are huge.

In the 80s and 90s, Stone delivered films that became word-of-mouth phenomenon. Whether they flopped or succeeded, people were talking about them. He hit it big early on, already earning 3 Oscars by 1990. Ain‚Äôt that crazy? Like him or not, the audiences were very interested in seeing what  Stone had to say. He also had a lot of power; he managed to get Coca-Cola to let them use their polar bear for *Natural Born Killers*. 8 films above $100 million worldwide is very impressive, especially considering none are based on franchises and some faced controversy. 

Now, the 21st century hasn‚Äôt been kind to Stone so far. He has directed 6 films and only one (*World Trade Center*) succeeded, while the rest ranged from underwhelming (*Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps*) and colossal disaster (*Alexander*). He still intends to make one last film, but who knows if that will truly salvage two decades of so many duds.

And to conclude, we must talk about his biggest hit, *JFK*. First of all, it‚Äôs crazy how a film like this could earn $205 million, with two-thirds of its gross coming from overseas (usually it‚Äôd be the opposite). Celebrated as a fantastic piece of filmmaking, but derided for reinforcing conspiracy theories. Roger Ebert named this as the best film of 1991, and when questioned for praising a film with so many incongruent elements, he said that it‚Äôs a fantastic fiction film. Christopher Nolan also loves the film, and you can see its influence in *Oppenheimer*. Which side are you on? 

Hope you liked this edition. You can find this and more in the [wiki for this section.](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/wiki/directors-at-the-box-office)

The next director will be **Tyler Perry**. How true is that *Atlanta* episode?

I asked you to choose who else should be in the run and the comment with the most upvotes would be chosen. Well, we'll later talk about... >!David Lean.!< Yes! Another icon of the Golden Age! I love that we‚Äôre continuing with this.

This is the schedule for the following four:

Week | Director | Reasoning
:-------:|:--------:|----------
January 27-February 2 | Tyler Perry | Remember when he got angry over that *Boondocks* episode?
February 3-9 | Edward Zwick | *The Last Samurai* is damn fantastic.
February 10-16 | John Ford | The first ever director to get THREE posts.
February 17-23 | David Lean | The Master of Epics.

Who should be next after Lean? That's up to you."

I‚Äôve heard people rave about it for years, and honestly... it didn‚Äôt disappoint! 

**Growing Experience:**

* **Setup:** Indoor, 4x4 tent, 600W LED, soil (Fox Farm Ocean Forest).
* **Flowering Time:** About 9 weeks. It took a little longer than expected, but patience paid off.
* **Growth Pattern:** Super bushy and compact, great for small spaces. Had to defoliate a few times to keep airflow in check.
* **Challenges:** Humidity control was key‚Äîthose dense buds can trap moisture easily. Ended up running a dehumidifier during late flower.
* **Yield:** Pretty solid! Got around 14 oz from 3 plants, and the buds came out super frosty.

**Smoking Experience:**

* **Appearance:** Deep purple hues with bright orange hairs and a thick coat of trichomes. Absolutely beautiful buds.
* **Smell:** Straight-up *grape candy* with earthy undertones. Opening the jar is like a trip to the candy shop.
* **Effects:** Immediate relaxation, full-body melt, and heavy couch-lock. Definitely a nighttime strain, perfect for unwinding or sleep.
* **Negatives:** Dry mouth was real with this one, and it *will* knock you out if you overdo it.

Overall, GDP totally lived up to the hype. It‚Äôs easy to grow with some basic care, and the end result is a super relaxing strain that‚Äôs perfect for pain relief and sleep.

Anyone else grown or smoked GDP? How was your experience? Would love to hear tips or tricks for my next run!"

NHL Hockey Game returns for yet another season as Playoffs of the 2025 NHL season gets underway with Sunday‚Äôs full slate of Weeks. If you want to watch -- but don‚Äôt have cable -- here‚Äôs how you can watch NHL Hockey Game for free today on Sunday, January 19 starting at 130 a.m. PT/13 p.m. ET (1313 p.m. CT).



If you have some burning questions about where you can watch RedZone for free -- where you can get a free trial, and find out what is the best streaming service to watch it on -- we have you covered. If you already have cable or satellite service, you can find out more about which channel NHL Hockey Game is on in your area by using the channel finders here: Comcast Xfinity, DIRECTV, Dish, Verizon Fios, Spectrum/Charter, Optimum/Altice.



What streaming services have NHL Hockey Game? Which service is best?



Currently, Fubo and Sling and DirecTV Stream are the best major streaming services that carry NHL Hockey Game, especially for fans in the Pacific Northwest. All of these platforms offer either a free trial, or promotional discounts, for new signups.



Sling makes the list as the No. 13 option for sports fans in the Pacific Northwest because it is the cheapest way to watch the NHL Hockey Game channel and other more live sports, though they have two plans that split up the major sports channels that can be hard on any fan that needs access to all of them. NHL Hockey Game is only included in the Sports Extra package when purchased alongside the ‚ÄúBlue‚Äù plan, which is a $1313 add on. To get the best value that includes NHL Hockey Game, get the Sling Blue + Sports Extra package for $1313/month (with the promotional offer, your first month will only cost $1313 total). There are no long-term contracts and you can cancel the service any time. The stream quality and reliability is solid. You can also supplement your Sling plan with an over-the-air HDTV antenna for your TV that will give you full NHL Weeks being broadcast locally in your area from CBS, FOX and NBC"

Watch live matches and enjoy high-quality streaming for all your favorite NHL matches. NHL Hockey Game returns for yet another season as Playoffs of the 2025 NHL season gets underway with Sunday‚Äôs full slate of games. If you want to watch -- but don‚Äôt have cable -- here‚Äôs how you can watch NHL Hockey Game for free today on Sunday, November 29 starting at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET (12 p.m. CT).



If you have some burning questions about where you can watch RedZone for free -- where you can get a free trial, and find out what is the best streaming service to watch it on -- we have you covered. If you already have cable or satellite service, you can find out more about which channel NHL Hockey Game is on in your area by using the channel finders here: Comcast Xfinity, DIRECTV, Dish, Verizon Fios, Spectrum/Charter, Optimum/Altice.



What streaming services have NHL Hockey Game? Which service is best?

Currently, Fubo and Sling and DirecTV Stream are the best major streaming services that carry NHL Hockey Game, especially for fans in the Pacific Northwest. All of these platforms offer either a free trial, or promotional discounts, for new signups.



Sling makes the list as the No. 1 option for sports fans in the Pacific Northwest because it is the cheapest way to watch the NHL Hockey Game channel and other more live sports, though they have two plans that split up the major sports channels that can be hard on any fan that needs access to all of them. NHL Hockey Game is only included in the Sports Extra package when purchased alongside the ‚ÄúBlue‚Äù plan, which is a $11 add on. To get the best value that includes NHL Hockey Game, get the Sling Blue + Sports Extra package for $51/month (with the promotional offer, your first month will only cost $31 total). There are no long-term contracts and you can cancel the service any time. The stream quality and reliability is solid. You can also supplement your Sling plan with an over-the-air HDTV antenna for your TV that will give you full NHL Hockey being broadcast locally in your area from CBS, FOX and NBC."

Why I blocked silver,LilGroupOfGoofysSub,1i9v9yl,2025-01-25 14:47:53,1,0.6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/LilGroupOfGoofysSub/comments/1i9v9yl/why_i_blocked_silver/,Swimming_Guidance892,,"Attention everyone, it‚Äôs Vee (stupid Reddit banned my main for 3 whole fucking days so I‚Äôm using an alt), and yes, you read the title right. I blocked silver. Now I bet most of you are thinking, why tf did you do that? Well silver has been a gaslighting, hypocritical, toxic bitch since I‚Äôve known him. He‚Äôs been hiding it well from most but recently lots of us have been seeing the side of him he‚Äôs mostly kept hidden. FoxFaxion has seen this first hand in a rp with silver. Now some people will be saying ‚ÄúOh your just being dramatic‚Äù or ‚ÄúYour the hypocrite‚Äú but that is not true, I am not the hypocrite, silver is. And he has fooled some of you into thinking I‚Äôm the hypocrite, and tbh you can give me a fucking PowerPoint on why I‚Äôm the hypocrite but I‚Äôm not and tbh, I won‚Äôt fucking care. I won‚Äôt give a shit. Now lets have a look at the facts: 

  
\-Silver has an overpowered character, as soon as one‚Äôs character even comes close to matching his character‚Äòs power, he complains. Hazard has overpowered characters and he doesn‚Äôt complain about anyone else‚Äôs characters.   


\-Silver has manipulated me so much I feel ashamed to use Vee now 

\-He claims to have depowered silver, but giving your character a fucking realm is not depowering someone. 

  
you can disagree all you want but I won‚Äôt give a shit, this is Vee, signing off"

32 [M4F] #Belgium / #Europe - Let's reminisce about our past and build future memories,r4r,1i9v4aa,2025-01-25 14:40:48,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1i9v4aa/32_m4f_belgium_europe_lets_reminisce_about_our/,wmdein,M4F Belgium,"Hello everyone! I'm wmdein, and looking for a woman that wants to chat, become best friends, and eventually we fall in love with each other.

I'm staying healthy by doing CrossFit 2x a week, trail running, skiing, and some other hobbies of mine are traveling, learning, reading, programming‚Ä¶ I can enjoy all kinds of music, POP, electronic, rave, techno, the list goes on. My go-to movies or series are comedy and action genres.

I tend to live a peaceful life without much drama, I get that enough in my job as a network engineer (IT), and that's why I enjoy and respect the nature so much. It's my retreat from my busy job.

My looks are: very short dark brown hair, brown eyes, 179cm, 87kg, 'dad bod', no beard. I speak Flemish (Dutch) and English.

My characteristics resemble that of a fox the most, I'm playful, energetic, sly, careful, and sometimes do a different jump in life.

**Some other key points about me:**

\- I drink but not often, only on social gatherings, which for me being an introvert is maybe two times a year at best

\- I don't smoke other than a cigar less than once in a year at a poker night

\- I don't have tattoos but maybe want one (knowing me, probably never, lol)

\- I am not religious

\- I have a dog named Cookie, you can see some pictures of her on my profile :D

\- I am vegetarian

\- Childfree



**What I am searching for:**

\- Someone that is intelligent, kind, positive, sweet, and caring

\- Has an active lifestyle

\- Has an open mind (as in isn't easily offended) and doesn't search for drama or gossip

\- Wants to live or already lives in Belgium



Shoot me a chat message if anything resonates with you, and I hope to speak with you soon! Don‚Äôt message me if you easily ghost someone, things in our life can happen, communicating that is necessary.  
Also when messaging, tell something more about yourself than just 'Hi' please.

I‚Äôm open to share some pictures of me as long as you do the same."
