Anyone have the hookup?"

Until one day they forget to lock your cage, and so you sneak out, and straight into a bin to hide!

Where you find that luck is on your side this time, because right beside you is a trenchcoat and a set of those glasses with the plastic nose attached!

So now you're free to roam the streets! ...provided that the general public, or the increasingly large/organised/aggressive search for you doesn't catch on to who you really are.......

Which really would be handy if they didn't, because you are just a blob (though you're still capable of driving and all that), and you have quite the task ahead of you;

You've got to find your way back home! And that is going to require your space ship!

...which unfortunately has been reduced to peices and sent to many different places unknown top secret places... and some of the peices won't be found at all as they've been destroyed... so they're going to have to be customly crafted, and this is going to take a bunch of different materials and tools... and you're also going to have to make the fuel for it yourself, which ain't easy even back home...

So a rather daunting task is ahead of you...

So now you're not just stuck as a blob in a disguise anymore! now you got Power!

So on with the mission!

(or maybe you instead just want to see how long you can last! or how much destruction you can cause before they get you! or if you have the skill to blow up the dam without transforming at all, or whatever! or maybe you want to free all the animals from their sub par zoo (Moo Deng can be found there), so they can roam the streets with you! or whatever! That's all cool too!)

(The game is fully destructable randomly generated Roguelike (that means when you die you have to start the entire game again, on a shuffled up map, keeping nothing but that which you have learnt..)!)

Have you heard about **Poppy**? If not, you're in for a treat! Poppy is the latest and greatest in the world of memecoins, and it's making waves for all the right reasons. Here's why you should be excited:

🌸 **Who is Poppy on SOL?** Poppy is an adorable baby pygmy hippo who has captured hearts at the Metro Richmond Zoo in Virginia USA. Born on December 9, 2024, to parents Iris and Corwin, Poppy is the third calf in her family. Her birth is particularly significant because pygmy hippos are an endangered species, making every new addition crucial for conservation efforts. Poppy is also a blood-related cousin of MooDeng, and we all know MooDeng.....

Poppy has quickly become a star, with the zoo offering special meet-and-greet experiences where visitors can see her up close and even feed her and her mother. These experiences are designed to raise awareness about pygmy hippos and support their conservation

💡 **What's so great about Poppy**

1. **Poppy named by Crypto:** The poppy community had a significant impact in the naming contest. In fact you can safely say that this is the fist time ever Crypto decided the outcome resulting in POPPY! Quite an historical event.

1. **Community-Driven:** Poppy thrives on the power of its community. Every decision, from development to marketing, is influenced by the voices of its holders. Led by Jake the Snake, a legendary crypto expert and an experienced team, the community is heading towards something unique.

1. **Partnership with zoo:** Partnership with the zoo is currently in the making which is quite an unique and an one of a kind milestone when realized. Donations have been raised and are pending to be donated. Plans have been laid out for more donations through NFT transaction profits and merchandise.

1. **Future plans**: Currently hovering around 1m market cap, Poppy has numerous milestones upcoming. 31st of January we have been invited to participate in Gate io meme coin space. A partnership with Magic Eden has been confirmed with NFTs being released on 14th of February. All poppy holders with x (precise amount under discussion) amount will receive an awesome NFT hand drawn by our fabulous designer.

1. **Fun and Engaging:** With regular events, giveaways, and interactive content, Poppy keeps the excitement alive!

As far as I've found, that's the only place to see koalas in Thailand.


Either way, I only now realized that this is also the home of the famous Moo Deng, therefore most likely will be swarmed by visitors on a weekend. Does anyone know if the queues are only for seeing the baby hippo, or does everyone who wants to explore the zoo have to wait for a long time? 

I've seen some previous posts mentioning getting a taxi/grab from Bangkok, but it seems unnecessarily pricey. Is it reasonable to take a bus/train from BKK to the nearby area and then hope for a grab to take us to the zoo? 


Maybe someone has already gone through the hassle of visiting and can help out :')"

"How to build a following with pet content on social media? Your pet could be the next Moo Deng, Grumpy Cat, or Pesto the Penguin",furrend,1i4xv2y,2025-01-19 07:58:12,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/furrend/comments/1i4xv2y/how_to_build_a_following_with_pet_content_on/,jungongsh,,"Remember Keyboard Cat and Grumpy Cat? Or maybe your TikTok feed is full of Moo Deng, the pygmy hippo, and Pesto, the massive baby penguin? Pet content is taking over the internet, and we have you — the creators behind those pets — to thank! But how do you stand out and build a following in such a crowded space? Here are a few tips to help your pet grab the spotlight they deserve.

Read more: [https://blog.furrend.xyz/how-to-build-a-following-with-pet-content-on-social-media-274004f18828](https://blog.furrend.xyz/how-to-build-a-following-with-pet-content-on-social-media-274004f18828) 

**Be Consistent**

Consistency is key when building a following. Post regularly so your audience knows when to expect new content. A good place to start is posting 4–5 times per week on Instagram and TikTok. Try it for a few weeks and see how it goes, adjusting the frequency if needed. The more often people see your posts, the more likely they’ll engage. But remember, you’re here to have fun! Share the best, the funniest, or whatever you think is your pet’s shining moment. If it resonates with your audience, you’ll know from the comments and engagement.

**Show Your Pet’s Personality — Find a Niche**

Every pet has a unique personality. Is your cat grumpy all the time? Does your dog have a quirky habit? Lean into what makes your pet special and find your niche. When people know what to expect, they’ll keep coming back for more of that irresistible charm.

Creator Julie talks about how she started with mice content and went viral online: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfKEPjZImW0&t=111s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfKEPjZImW0&t=111s)

**Engage with Your Audience**

Social media is all about interaction. Don’t just post and disappear — reply to comments, like other posts, and engage with your followers. Your audience will appreciate the effort and feel more connected to you and your pet.

>Join Furrend at [https://furrend.xyz/](https://furrend.xyz/)

**Use Social Media Features**

Hashtags, trends, and platform-specific features like Instagram Reels, YouTube shorts, or TikTok’s trending (it's going dark for now but let's hope it will be back online soon) audio can help boost your visibility. Keep an eye on what’s trending, and join the conversation. It’s an easy way to get more eyes on your content.

**Repurpose Your Content**

You don’t have to start from scratch for every platform. Repurpose your main content. A screenshot of a tweet can become an Instagram post. A long video can be clipped into bite-sized pieces for TikTok or Reels. You can even turn videos into audio clips for podcasts!
