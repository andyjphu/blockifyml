🌱 **Strong Ecosystem & Utility-Driven Token**

$KRL is not just a speculative token; it plays a crucial role in the Kryll³ platform. While the platform itself offers advanced AI-driven tools, $KRL unlocks exclusive features for users and serves as the backbone for governance, allowing holders to vote on platform upgrades and developmental priorities. This dual purpose ensures that $KRL is indispensable for both accessing premium capabilities and shaping the future of the ecosystem.

What is the Best Trading Bot For Binance in 2024?,aesirofficial,18puer2,2023-12-24 07:33:30,19,0.96,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/aesirofficial/comments/18puer2/what_is_the_best_trading_bot_for_binance_in_2024/,AESIRofficial,Educational,"We've prepapred an in-depth article to help you maximise your trading for 2024. Here are some of the best crypto trading bot platforms on the market.

# Why Use A Binance Trading Bot to begin with?

24/7 Trading: Cryptocurrency markets operate round-the-clock. Trading bots can operate at all hours, enabling traders to take advantage of opportunities even when they are not actively monitoring the markets. This can be particularly useful when looking to time breakouts for instance.

**Emotionless Trading**: Bots follow predefined rules, eliminating emotional decisions that can lead to impulsive trading.

* **Risk Free Testing**: A good trading bot for Binance will allow you to first test your strategy either using Backtesting, Papertrading or both, before taking it to the live market thus minimizing the risk of deploying an untested strategy.
* **Quicker Results**: Users can test multiple trading strategies at the same time by deploying multiple bots to run concurrently. This is crucial in order to maximize profits during a specific market cycle.

### Risks and Considerations

* **Maintenance Required**: A trading bot will require adjustments as market conditions change. No bot can operate under all market conditions.
* **Security Risks**: Users need to ensure that their API keys’ scope is properly restricted.
* **Technical Knowledge**: Some level of understanding is required to set up and configure a trading bot for Binance.

### UpBots

UpBots is a DeFi-centric crypto trading bot with tokenomics closely tied to its pricing structure and its own bot marketplace economy.

* **Token Ecosystem**: Users are required to buy and hold UBXN in order to pay for various platform services such as executing trades, copying other bots and more.

#### Upbots Pricing

* **No upfront fees**: UpBots uses a pay as you go system, where you pay a certain amount of UBXN (UpBots’ own token) in order to keep your bots running. The exact cost is up to how much, or how little you use the application, the number of bots you run, and the number of trades you place, so it is not very clear what kind of price you’d be looking at. Upbots promises to refund your service fees so long as you don’t recover your losses.

### Coinrule

Choosing the best trading bot for Binance, is not an easy task, but Coinrule might be the tool for you, if you’re looking for a trading bot platform to perform leveraged trades.

## Coinrule Key Features

In terms of execution speed, Coinrule promises “fast” execution speeds, however we were not able to confirm exactly what this means, so do test this if going for this option.

## Coinrule Pricing

Coinrule offers four pricing plans to suit different trading needs:

* **Free Plan**: This plan offers two live rules, two demo rules, seven template strategies, one connected exchange, and up to $3,000 in monthly trade volume.

### ArbitrageScanner.io

It also offers a scanner between exchanges that searches for spreads for you and sends you ready-made pairs for all coins with different parameters.

### SMARD

SMARD is an advanced automated trading software specifically designed for long term hands free investment. This means that unlike other tools on this list, you do not actually have to configure anything, the algorithm itself will manage your portfolio for you. While this may not be the best binance trading bot for everyone, it may prove as a solid long term investment strategy.  


**NOTE**: We have not tested this software so we cannot speak to its profitability. Unfortunately many proprietary automated investment solutions are closed off with limited information into what the strategy actually does.

#### SMARD Key Features

**Advanced Automated Trading**: SMARD is an advanced automated trading software that utilizes proprietary algorithms to autotrade on their users behalf, with no configuration required by the end user.

**Designed for long term investment**: SMARD states that their algorithm will not take unnecessary risks, and it’s more of a long term investment tool rather than trading strategy.

**No Configuration Required**: Due to it being more of an algorithmic hedge fund, users are not required to configure their trading bots.

#### SMARD Pricing

SMARD charges $1 per month + **10% monthly service fee** charge after you profit. The first payment will be made after one calendar month from the start of trading only.

### Bitsgap

As our search for the best trading bot for Binance continues, we turn our attention to Bitsgap. If most of the platforms we've seen so far try to compete by offering the user a wide range of features, Bitsgap is playing a completely different game by offering 5 out of the box strategies with some customization. Those are: GRID, DCA, BTD (buy the dip), DCA FUTURES and COMBO (DCA+ GRID).

#### Bitsgap Key Features

* Pre-Made Trading Bot Strategies: Bitsgap offers a range of pre-made trading bot strategies that can be customized to suit individual trading needs.
* Multi-Exchange Trading Terminal: Bitsgap provides a single interface to trade across 25+ exchanges, including Binance, Bitfinex, and Coinbase Pro.

* **Pro**: Priced at **$119/month**, this plan includes 25 active GRID bots, 250 active DCA bots, and unlimited smart orders, as well as futures bots, trailing up & down for bots, and take profit for bots.

### Shrimpy

Shrimpy is a general-purpose cryptocurrency trading bot that allows users to automate their trading strategies. The array of features it offers make it closer to Aesir, 3Commas and Cryptohopper, rather than some of the more specialized platforms we’e seen.  


It offers a range of features that make it an attractive option for both novice and experienced traders.

#### Shrimpy Key Features

* **Social Trading**: Shrimpy’s social trading feature allows users to follow other traders and copy their trades. This is a great way for novice traders to learn from more experienced traders and improve their trading strategies.

* **Plus Plan**: The plus plan costs **$49 per month** and includes access to 25 exchanges, 10 portfolios, and 10 automations, as well as customizable rebalance periods and dynamic indexing.

### TradeSanta

TradeSanta is another general-purpose trading platform, making it a strong contender for the best trading bot for Binance. However, we did mention that there is rarely ever a best one-size fits all, and it’s usually a matter of preference.

#### TradeSanta Key Features

* **Trade Terminal**: Allows you to view and manage your positions across multiple exchanges in a single view.
* **Multi Exchange Support**: TradeSanta supports multiple exchanges.
* **Mobile App**: Create trading bots and manage your portfolio on the go using TradeSanta’s mobile app.

#### TradeSanta Pricing

TradeSanta offers three pricing plans:

* **Basic Plan**: This plan costs **$25 per month** and allows you to run up to 49 bots. It includes all strategies, trading terminal, trailing take profit, TradingView screener signals, custom TradingView signals, and futures bots.
* **Advanced Plan**: This plan costs **$45 per month** and allows you to run up to 99 bots. It includes all the features of the Basic Plan, as well as additional TradingView signals and strategies.
* **Maximum Plan**: This plan costs **$90 per month** and allows you to run an unlimited number of bots. It includes all the features of the Advanced Plan, as well as additional futures bots.

All plans come with a free trial, and TradeSanta accepts payments in fiat and crypto.

### CryptoHero

Next up on our list if CryptoHero - a general purpose trading tool that, similar to Aesir, 3Commas and Cryptohopper, it offers customizable trading bots, a wide range of signals as well as TradingView Support. Is it the best binance trading bot for you though? Let’s take a look at the key features.

#### CryptoHero Key Features

**Arbitrage Trading**: CryptoHero offers traders access to a variety of arbitrage strategies such as inter-exchange arbitrage and intra-exchange arbitrage strategies. **Lease or buy trading bots**: You can earn a revenue by leasing your trading bot to be used by other traders, or conversely, pay a subscription fee for access to trader’s bot. **Trading Terminal**: CryptoHero allows you to manage all of your exchange trades in one holistic view.

#### CryptoHero Pricing:

* **Free**: Allows access to 1 trading bot, unlimited positions and offers the ability to short or long assets using simple trading bots. This plan has an execution speed of 15 minutes, making it quite limited in most cases.
* **Premium**: Allows access to up to 15 concurrent trading bots and offers Arbitrade and Advanced DCA bots as well. Starts at **$13.99 a month**. The execution speed of this plan is also 15m.
* **Professional**: With the professional plan at **$29.99 a month**, you can run up to 30 trading bots and also unlocks Grid type bots. The frequency is reduced to 5m which should be fine for longer-term investing, but not so much for scalping or day-trading.

Aesir on the other hand offers a 10 second frequency on the Pro plan, making it the fastest algotrading platform on the market. But then again the best trading bot for Binance, or any other exchange, is the one that most suits your needs.

### Mudrex

Mudrex is a paid crypto trading bot that offers portfolio management, automatic trading techniques, risk management, and access to a trading strategy library. The bot is offered in two versions: Basic and Pro. The Basic plan is free and includes portfolio management and automatic trading techniques. The Pro plan costs a monthly membership charge and has more advanced features, such as risk management and access to a trading strategy library  


Mudrex is closer in the range of features and overall approach to SMARD, in that it emphasizes long term investing using pre-built tools as opposed to swing, range or day-trading via a configurable crypto trading bot. Could this be the best binance trading bot for you to consider? Depends on your goals.

#### Mudrex Key Features

* **Pre-built investment strategies**: Mudrex offers a wide range of long term investment strategies for portfolio building. Users can subscribe to various packages depending on their risk tolerance. Some popular options are:
* **Portfolio Builder**: Mudrex also allows users to create their own portfolio of cryptocurrencies.

#### Mudrex Pricing

The Basic plan is free, while the Pro plan costs $16 per month. Mudrex also charges 0.5% on deposits and 2% on withdrawals, up to $10.

### Haas Online

HaasOnline provides a general-purpose approach to trading, similar to 3Commas, Aesir as well as some of the other Trading Bots that we have discussed in this article, making it a strong choice for the best trading bot for Binance if you are looking for an all-rounder.  


The platform offers four different plans: Lite+, Standard, Professional, and Enterprise. Each plan comes with its own set of features and pricing.

#### Haas Online Key Features

### Kryll

Let’s continue our search for the best trading bot for Binance and take a look at Kryll. Now Kryll really mixes things up. Whether that’s good or bad is up to you. In terms of functionality Kryll offers a general-purpose approach, with undisclosed speeds of execution.

#### Kryll Key Features

* **Portfolio Management**: Kryll allows you to manage your portfolio from several exchanges under a single view.
* **No Code Bot Builder**: Similar to 3Commas or Aesir, Kryll offers a no-code builder that allows users to build their best binance trading bot in just a few clicks.
* **Bot marketplace**: Kryll offers a marketplace that allows users to buy and sell trading bots through the platform.

#### Kryll Pricing

This is where things get a little more complicated with Kryll. Kryll’s pricing model is directly related to how much KRL (Kryll’s own ERC-20 token) you hold in your wallet as well as your trading volume. At a $5000 monthly trading volume, Kryll’s pricing looks like so:

* **No holding**: Holding no Kryll, will cost you $50 a month for the Kryll subscription and you’ll get 99 trading bots and 10% Referral fee bonus.
* **5,000 Kryll**: Holding around $2000 in Kryll at today’s price will bring your monthly subscription down to $42.50 a month, give you access to 119 trading bots, and a 25% referral bonus.
* **20,000 Kryll**: Holding around $8000 in Kryll gets you a $32.50 a month sub price, 129 trading bots and a 30% referral bonus.
* **200,000 Kryll**: This pricing model continues up to around $80,000 in Kryll, which brings your subscription down to $250 and gets you 399 bots and a 45% referral fee bonus.

### Gunbot

Gunbot is a general-purpose trading bot designed to work with multiple exchanges, and supports DeFi trading as well. Gunbot is a bit different from most of the software we’ve reviewed above, in that your strategies don’t run in the cloud. Meaning that Gunbot doesn’t run your trading bots. Instead, you’ll need to download a piece of software and run it locally on your machine. Or a Raspberry Pi if you have one.

#### Gunbot Key Features

* **DeFi Trading**: On the highest tier plan, Gunbot offers access to DeFi trading through dYdX exchange.
* **Custom Coded Bots**: Gunbot allows traders to use code in order to code their own trading bots. While this is a nice feature to have, the appeal to custom code your bot, in order to run it locally and pay a subscription fee for doing so might be quite limited.
* **Runs Locally**: As mentioned before, Gunbot runs locally as a piece of software that you download and install. It is currently designed to run on Windows, Mac, Linux an Raspberry Pi.

#### Gunbot Pricing

* **Standard**: Costs **$29/month** and offers access to 1 exchange, unlimited trading pairs, telegram community and customer support. It also comes with access to All strategies and Gunbot’s AutoConfig - the ability to make modifications to a strategy programmatically, on the fly
* **Pro**: Costs **$39/month** and offers everything in Standard plus access to up to 3 Exchanges.
* **Ultimate**: At **$59/month** you get everything in Pro as well as DeFi support, unlimited API slots and custom-coded strategies.

Gunbot’s highest tier has some pretty nice features, but having to run it locally might not be everyone’s cup of tea for the best Binance trading bot.  


## Binance Trading Bots - Frequently Asked Questions

Let’s condense what we have learned in order to help you make the right choice and approach trading bots in a responsible manner.

### What is the Best Trading Bot for Binance?

The best trading bot for Binance is the one that works best for you and your use cases. Whatever option you may choose, bear in mind that at the end of the day, all of these tools are there to help you optimize your existing strategy, and find new market opportunities, but they can’t make up for lack of knowledge or trading, and they are not magic money printers.  


We would recommend starting with our own [crypto trading bot](https://aesircrypto.com/), Aesir. Aesir is a state of the art algorithmic trading platform that allows you to automate your existing strategy, or find new ones through our social hub. It’s also the fastest algotrading platform on the market, and has a highly intuitive interface, that makes it easy for new and experienced traders to get started in minutes. Furthermore, we love to chat and we actively engage with [our community on Discord](https://discord.gg/cSuNMcrS78).

### How Much Do Trading Bots Cost?

The cost of trading bots can vary significantly, from free versions with basic functionalities to premium bots with advanced features and higher price tags. Even the pricing structure itself can vary from subscription-based to pay-as-you-go, and DeFi-centric pricing based on token holding.  


At Aesir, we believe in the power of simplicity, so we did away with convoluted pay-as-you-go or DeFi pricing. Instead, we’re offering a straightforward monthly subscription.

### How Safe Are Trading Bots?

White trading bots tend to be generally safe, the real answer here depends on several factors. First of all, in order to minimize any potential risk as a user, you need to ensure proper management of your API keys. Never give share them publicly, and always ensure that you don’t away more permissions than you have to.  


In addition to this, you need to ensure that you follow trading best practices, and avoid deploying untested strategies on the live market.

### Can Trading Bots Guarantee Profit?

No, bots cannot guarantee a profit. They are tools that can help execute strategies more efficiently, but their profitability depends on how you use them. Think of a trading bot as you favorite sports car. It’s really fast and can do incredible things, but only in the hands of a skilled driver.

### How can I start building my first trading bot for Binance?
