"Taking Flight, Chapter 63: Anybody Home? ",SMG4,1i6bdi4,2025-01-21 00:17:56,4,0.75,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SMG4/comments/1i6bdi4/taking_flight_chapter_63_anybody_home/,FarslayerSanVir,Fan Creation,"It's a dreary morning out on the open fields as SMG3's Airship glides through the clouds. Melony emerges from the Crew Quarters, having finished her nap as she notices Tari sitting quietly in the Rec Room. She kept her melancholy gaze focused outside the starboard window, not even noticing Melony until she raises her voice. 

Melony: Hey Tari.

Tari: Hm? 

Melony: You've been kind of....... out of it, lately. Everything alright?

Tari: Oh, that. Yeah, I just had a lot on my mind lately. 

Her mind wanders back to the incident at Spudsy's, putting the names of an unsuspecting frycook and a loud mouthed manager on the morning obituary. She was well used to average chill days segwaying into crazy adventures, but they usually didn't start off with a fresh double homicide in the back of a fast food diner AND man-made horrors beyond comprehension RIGHT OUT THE GATE. Usually it takes one of these arcs another chapter or two to get into the Heavy stuff. 

Tari: I just needed some time to clear my head, is all. 

SMG3: Attention all passengers. 

SMG3's voice echoes over the intercoms. 

SMG3: Any who wish to be a part of the away crew best be ready and head to the top deck. We will be arriving at our destination shortly, so CHOP CHOP. 

On the top deck we see Meggy and Mario already present, followed by Uzi, Noah, Vale, and Julia. Even Miss Mildenhall were present. This is basically their first major adventure on the ship, a prospect that Noah is most certainly excited about considering the fact he can't stay still. Meggy and Martha notice Tari and Melony appear from the bridge. 

Meggy: Hey guys. Everybody is just about ready to head out.

Martha: So, what's today's GRAND ADVENTURE this time?

Melony: Tari thinks there's some kind of ""evil plot"" going on, so we're taking a trip to Evo City to do a little investigating. 

Tari: There was this............ sick man named Lucas. He said a ""doctor"" lured him into an old Malonesky building, not too far from an old Parker's warehouse. 

Meggy: That...... doesn't really help narrow down why we need to go to Evo City of all places. 

Noah: Actually, it does! Evo City was founded with the help of two LOCAL companies, Malonesky Transport LLC and Parker's Building Materials. They basically had the whole area to themselves, so wherever you found a MTL office, there's most likely a Parker's warehouse somewhere nearby. 

Meggy: How do you know so much about this place?

Noah: We lived there for a while before coming to the showgrounds. 

Mario: Hm....... I think I've been there before.

The cavernous empty halls of his mind guide him to a not too distant memory as he recalls his story. It turns out he and Luigi were doing a plumbing job in the city. The job itself didn't go too well, since Mario didn't end up fixing anything. That and he MIGHT have left another sea monster on someone's house. 

Noah: Oh THAT'S why Mr. Roland was so grumpy! 

Mario: It wasn't all bad, though. I got this cool Shark hat at the gas station! 

Uzi: So......... we're going to this random city to investigate some sort of crime ring or something?

Tari showed some unease as she recalled the incident at Spudsy's. The image of Lucas in that state was not a pleasant one. 

Tari: All I know is that there's a self proclaimed ""doctor"" doing something horrible........

She takes a deep breath as her fingers curled into fists. 

Tari: And he needs to be stopped. 

Meggy: Well, can't say vigilante justice was on my bingo card for today, but........ f*** it. Let's go save the day again. 

Mario: Mario is ready to move his PINGAS.

Vale: It would be nice to get out of the house, maybe even let off some steam.

Three's voice once again rings out on the intercom.

SMG3: We have officially arrived at the outer limits of Evo City. Bravo Team, you are free to depart when ready. 

Noah pulls down a zipper on the back of his outfit, allowing a pair of leathery metal wings to unfurl. Julia and Vale follow suit, and they all give themselves a moment to let the appendages stretch and loosen up. Tari takes a deep breath as her own wings flare out from her back.

Tari: Everybody ready?

Noah: Lead the way!  

Martha: You three play nice, now. 

One by one, they all leap from the top deck and soar off towards the city. The only sound heard for miles was the scurrying of squirrels as they duck for cover at the sight of Bravo Team coasting through the sky above. 

Tari: See anything?

Julia: All clear from my angle. Noah?

Noah: All clear. Looks like we got here before the morning rush.

The team comes to a landing in the industrial district. They now stand before an old rundown warehouse with the name ""Parker"" emblazoned onto its side. 

Tari: The old Parker's warehouse. 

She turns her gaze towards a large building across the road. A nearby billboard bore an old advertisement for Malonesky Transport LLC. 

Tari: Bingo.

Meanwhile, Mario and Meggy have just been dropped off over at the Arrowhead Fields Trailer Park. The place was littered with vehicles in varying states of disrepair, with scrap parts and luggage scattered across the fields. Meggy was noticeably more on edge as the two searched for any signs of life amidst the wreckage. Some of the trailers looked as if they were ripped open from the outside, while others have been stripped down to their skeletons. There was a trailer that looks to have been ripped in half straight down the middle, and another that's been flattened into a rugged slab of metal. Her heart nearly dropped when she saw a hand poking out from between the folds. 

Meggy: Christ almighty. What the hell happened here? 

Mario: HEY, LOOK AT THIS.

Meggy rushes over to Mario's side, and the two stand before a mobile home. Not only was it the only vehicle that was somewhat intact, but the lights were on and it looked like someone was still inside. Mario cautiously walks up to the door and gives it a knock before retreating back to Meggy's side. The two wait with baited breath as the door swings open..........  revealing the sight of a weird looking toad with sunglasses waddling through the frame with a shotgun in hand. 

???: I'LL END YOU! Wait a minute....... Mario?

Mario immediately recognizes his bright yellow cap with the word ""boobs"" written in comic sans on all sides. 

Mario: BEN! 

Ben: MARIO, MY MAN! It's been too long!

Meggy: Wait a minute. You know this guy?

Mario: Oh yeah! We go WAY back. 

Ben: He fixed my pipes, we fought pirates, I was a mermaid for a while, it was fun. 

Mario: So what brings you to a junkyard like this?

Ben: Um, I'm on my Spring Break road trip of course!

Meggy: But it's not even Spring. 

Ben: Hey. Anything to keep the feds guessing. 

Meggy:......... Right.......... Anyways, do you have any idea what's going on here?

Ben takes a quick look around. The coast seems to be clear enough.

Ben: Oh, I have no clue. I just got here last night. Almost NOBODY wants to come here for some reason. Something about screaming metal hellbeasts or something like that. It's probably some crappy rockband or something. 

Meggy: Hm........ Screaming metal hellbeasts..........Alright. Thanks for the info, Ben. C'mon, Red! Let's go meet up with Tari.

Mario: Okie dokie. Bye, Ben! Tell Squidge I said hi!

Ben: Will do, man.

He shuts the door and goes back to blaring Midnight Riders on the radio as the two head off towards the industrial district........ unaware of the telescopic eye watching them from afar.

Persistent MTL_HUD_ENABLED - should this work?,macgaming,1i3gnlq,2025-01-17 08:45:12,0,0.5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/1i3gnlq/persistent_mtl_hud_enabled_should_this_work/,zenmaster24,Help,"Hi - trying to get `MTL_HUD_ENABLED` to always be set when booting so I dont have remember to enable it in a terminal every time. To do this, I thought I could use the below plist and add it to `/Library/LaunchDaemons`.

    <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC ""-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"" ""http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"">

          <string>/bin/launchctl setenv MTL_HUD_ENABLED 1</string>
        </array>
        <key>RunAtLoad</key>
        <true/>
      </dict>
    </plist>

`plutil -lint /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.myenvvars.plist` says it is ok, but when i try and load it with `sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.myenvvars.plist`, i get the following error -

    Load failed: 5: Input/output error
    
    Try running `launchctl bootstrap` as root for richer errors.

Running `sudo launchctl bootstrap system /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.myenvvars.plist` gives the error `Bootstrap failed: 5: Input/output error`.

Is there any way to get `MTL_HUD_ENABLED` set so that I dont have to remember to enable it each time anymore?

Thanks"

Charles was complicated. There were people saying he totally is nice, but there were some mentioning the immoral stuff he did. I think we need to remember that even though there are really good messages in mtl once you look past all the morbid/profane things, it still is a DARK COMEDY show and we should rate the characters’ morality in that context. But I do think that he isn’t “nice”, yet more moral compared to Dethklok. I think he would be nice to you unless you mess with his boys. ***So should we make an exception for the dead man and put him between “nice” and “morally grey”?***

Another reason for it is because I have a better suggestion for 2. It’s all of Dethklok. They are used to being selfish at times, easily getting away with all the deaths at their concerts, partying however much they wish and are simply heavy exaggerations of the metal culture, sometimes acting like kids who still don’t know the difference between good and bad. On the other hand, the way they learn to care for each other and their fans throughout the series always makes me happy. Moreover, they obviously can’t be “terrible” considering Salacia or the MMA. I probably won’t need to provide arguments for why they are well written. I think I explained my point pretty well, but other opinions are always welcome!

So who goes into square number 2? And should we put Charles in between after all? 

Once again, the most upvoted/commented character wins😉"

I know people weren’t happy about metal team leader in the item shop a couple years back, but did epic attach that backlash to anything? Or is it just a popular opinion that that might have been what happened? Every post I’ve seen has attributed the lack of starter packs coming back to the “backlash” around MTL. Yet nobody has ever linked a single piece of evidence showing that. Does anyone know for sure? Or is it really just speculation.

It really seems like it’s a coincidence and the community is inventing a conversation at epic that didn’t happen.

I would be alone as the concerts are specifically metal/ rock bands and none of my friends want to come with me. I never drove in mtl so forget that. It stresses me too much and montrealers are another breed when it comes to driving. A taxi from brossard or Longueuil is also way too expensive (estimate google gave me is a 30 to 40 min drive.) 

THE REAL QUESTION: do you think the metro is safe for a mid-20 girl ALONE after 10pm? From Longueuil to lionel-groulx?

Please be honest as safety is a big concern.

*(only the titles gained from the 175th edition of each thread are taken in account)*

&nbsp;

* ""2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9 tails kitsune"" : Gain a new tail by winning both the ""Ultimate Babymetal fan"" title, and the ""Most dedicated kitsune"" title! Also, if you win 10 ""most dedicated kitsune"" titles, you get a tail! (Good luck to get 9 tails!)

* ""Ultimate Babymetal fan"" : Gain the Su, Moa and Yui ""Ultimate"" titles. 

*  ""Su/Yui/Moa ultimate fan"" :  rewards the most upvoted post in those threads. Only 1 post by thread is taken in account. The answers to a post are not taken in account.

* ""Most dedicated kitsune"" : rewards a kitsune who posts a goodies in each of the 3 girls special threads **from the same week** (Sunday+Monday+Tuesday, also the ""momometal"" thread can be taken in account in replacement of the Yui thread). The answers to a post ARE taken in account but only if a goodie is integrated with the answer, furthermore only the posts/answers with **10+ upvotes** will be taken in account. Note: a goodie could also be a text like [that](https://www.reddit.com/r/BABYMETAL/comments/7fzsq5/princess_yui_tuesday_the_175th_edition_for_all/dqfm1j6/) or a haiku and so on. **For every 10 ""most dedicated kitsune"" titles you win, you get a new tail**.

I know how to enable/disable the Metal HUD with `/bin/launchctl setenv MTL_HUD_ENABLED [0|1]` and/or `defaults write -g MetalForceHudEnabled [YES|NO]`, and that you can hide it with Shift+F9; I just want it hidden until I press Shift+F9 to show it."

This is what I'm reading the week of 2024-11-16. I only included the ones I've added to my bookshelf to continuous reading.

**You can see my previous reading lists Here:** [**www.chaosdrifter.cc**](http://www.chaosdrifter.cc)

I'm native Chinese speaker so I read the raw from Qidian. you can try finding the english translation on novelupdate or try places like [app.omniread.com](http://app.omniread.com) where Advanced LLM models are used for MTL that should be more understandable and consistent than google translate. or you can use chatgpt/qwen/claude with the chrome plugin [immersive translate](https://immersivetranslate.com/en/) (just sign up and get your own API key for the cloud LLMs)

[**让你荒野求生，你手搓基础工业？**](https://www.qidian.com/book/1041376288/)  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ **(You are suppose to survive in the wilderness, Instead you built basic industries by hand ?)** no system, slice of life, modern world, survival, slow pace, no harem, no romance

MC has a simple gold finger that allows him to identify and analyze things that he touches. Like if he touches a rock, it'll tell him its mineral composition, weight, size, that's it. He owed a lot of debt to a loan shark company to pay for cancer for his now passed away grandmother. So they got him a spot in a wilderness survival show where the five million dollar top prize is enough to repay the debt. The show is live streamed to audiences and there are many participants from all walks of life.  MC has a major in manufacturing engineering and lived in a rural farm most of his childhood. So he is well versed in surviving in nature and started to use his skills to start a fire, fish, build shelter, smelt iron, etc. etc. There are also many other interesting characters in the book that's also part of the show. It is slow paced and you can learn a lot about wilderness survival skills. Read if you like that kind of slow paced nature novel.

[**领主又红名了**](https://www.qidian.com/book/1039477649/)  (The lord has been marked as Hostile again) ⭐️⭐️⭐️ medieval, Video Game, fourth apocalypse, farming, soul-like, no harem

MC transgressed into a game world where he is the commander of a small outpost in a dark soul like world where the humans are barely surviving. players from earth thinks they are playing a full immersive VR game and are recruited by unknown system. MC is acting like a NPC and guide the players to his advantage. So he can powered up with the resources gathered by the players as part of his ""quests"". I've just finished about 90 chapters and it is an OK read.

 [**给，主说这个好使**](https://www.qidian.com/book/1037691404/) (Here, The LORD says this will come in handy) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  **Cthulhu, steam punk, no harem, modern weapons**   ""Father, my wife has been acting weird lately. She keeps saying someone is calling her."" ""Here, ""Here, The LORD says this will come in handy"" ""What's this?"" ""This is a divine engravings M1911 pistol. Hold it like this, aim at your wife and then pull the trigger."" ...... Serious Intro: The whispers of the ancient gods can't drown out the sound of a crisply loaded bullet. The roar of the magical gods can't cover the thunder of a warship's cannon. The howl of the evil gods is far from being as pleasant as the sound of a laser cannon charging.

A mercenary who was summoned and reborn in a different world by the Fire Strike Buddha (author), takes on the identity of a priest to receive contracts from the gods, bringing a small shock of firepower to those defiled creatures that have lingered in the material world for too long! ""Here, The LORD says this will come in handy""  (Pulls out a gun/rocket launcher/sniper cannon/metal storm system/satellite cannon) (the weapons by blessed by the Gods, so they can do damage and cleanse the evil creatures)

 [**不会魔法的土木工程师不是好领主**](https://www.qidian.com/book/1037411368/) ⭐️⭐️⭐️  **(a civil engineer who does know magic is not a good lord)**    I just like the title. the story is ok so far, MC transgressed into a medieval world with magic and is the son of a lord with a large area. He'll be using his civil engineer degree in the new world to build roads, smelt irons and bring peace to everyone..........

 [**仙瘾犯了？电电就好！**](https://www.qidian.com/book/1038576104/) ⭐️⭐️⭐️  **(Addicted to Cultivation ? Some Electrical Shocks will fix it !)**  again, lured in by the interesting title. MC has no Spirit Essence and can't cultivate. But he discovered an ancient Cultivation Technique that doesn't need the Spirit Essence but uses electrical energy to start the Qi Refinement level. So he made a cruel acid battery to start cultivation. Just another using modern technique in ancient world to cultivate story.

 [**修仙：我在现代留过学**](https://www.qidian.com/book/1040257435/) ⭐️⭐️⭐️  **(Cultivation: I studied in the modern world)**  no harem, cultivation, modern.  MC is in a cultivation world, but he has a talisman in his mind that allow him to travel to the modern world as a senior in high school. so he uses the knowledge he learned in the modern world to further his cultivation in the original world. Time stops in the other world when he transgresses. So he has extra time to cultivate. This is a bit different from other novels where he also brings cultivation to the modern world by using electricity as the energy source. I might stop reading this one soon as its pacing is a bit too fast. It is kind of depressing, there is always a crisis that the MC needs to solve, kind of like many American TV shows. I read books to relax and enjoy."

The Knuckleblaster - REQS: 75 MTL, 20 LHT, 10 STR

Description: “A ridiculous weapon created by an eccentric Ignition Union inventor that was initially proposed as a mining tool, though after the tool caused a cave-in that took seven lives, it was denied by the Union’s higher ups. The inventor, eager to have his invention be used by the Ignition Union, instead proposed it as a weapon after a month of tweaking and fitting it for warfare. This time, the demonstration blew the higher-ups away, they demanded that the weapon be mass-produced as soon as possible. Though the weapon never saw an actual battlefield, it was used by Union miners in dangerous areas such as The Depths to fend off small to medium nuisances that disturbed mining duties with the ironsing-produced explosive shells. But now that some instances are in the hands of the public, some fighters have seen the might it carries in a battlefield.”

Special effects: Critical and flourish knock enemies away a considerable distance, and plant small amounts of iron rods.

Special-er effects: After a successful critical, 3 shells are ejected out. These can be hit back at an enemy (with a perfect hit, of course, which would be telegraphed with an orange flash and slight click sound) to cause a small explosion that ragdolls enemies briefly and plants 2 metal caltrops on the field.

This was just a fun little idea that I came up with while bored at school, so sorry if it might be bad.

(based off the Knuckleblaster from ULTRAKILL, of course.)"

The answers to a post ARE taken in account but only if a goodie is integrated with the answer, furthermore only the posts/answers with **10+ upvotes** will be taken in account. Note: a goodie could also be a text like [that](https://www.reddit.com/r/BABYMETAL/comments/7fzsq5/princess_yui_tuesday_the_175th_edition_for_all/dqfm1j6/) or a haiku and so on. **For every 10 ""most dedicated kitsune"" titles you win, you get a new tail**.

LLVM native assembly question,Compilers,1gi1xkr,2024-11-02 13:42:22,6,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Compilers/comments/1gi1xkr/llvm_native_assembly_question/,slgr,,"Hi, I'm following a tutorial on ARM Cortex-M bare metal programming (link below) that uses a GNU toolchain. Of course, there is some ARM assembly code needed to get a basic environment set up before you can use the procedure calls to move up to C, which can be compiled using an appropriate target-specific`*-as`.

I tried to figure out how to do this using an LLVM toolchain, but web searches seem to provide information only on compiling LLVM IR assembly, with options to generate target-specific assembly code from the IR source using `llc`.

So I'm left wondering if translating native assembly is even in the scope of LLVM? Or you need to use GNU (or some other) assembler to get a target-specific native binary from it?

random talent ideas that I felt like posting,deepwoken,1ghbei6,2024-11-01 13:49:11,3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepwoken/comments/1ghbei6/random_talent_ideas_that_i_felt_like_posting/,Flace_25,Meme,"**Bloom Path: Smeltery** (FIR/MTL) (Mutual Exclusives: Eruption Path, Azure Flames, Gilded Path)

* Fire no longer deals damage but instead applies Cauterized (from Sear) to the burning target (Bloom Fire).
* Every Metal Rod on a target amplifies the incoming PEN when they're on Bloom Fire (as opposed to Sear's stacking on each hit). Just like Sear, caps out at +40%.
* Causes your flames to burn and metal to glow a brilliant yellow (as opposed to Scrapsinger's more dull yellow). This effect applies to the Hero Blade of Flame, Pleeksty's Inferno Carvings, Ignition Deepcrusher, and the Pyre Keeper flames, as well as the Blazing and Metal enchantments, with a minor effect to Sear.

**Branding Eruption** (Prerequisites: Bloom Path: Smeltery, Metal Eruption (Mantra) )

* Metal Eruption deals constant damage over time on sustained contact (sort of like The Floor is Lava).

**Singeing Needles** (Prerequisites: Bloom Path: Smeltery, Any Rare Rending Needle Talent)

* Impaler: If an enemy is on Bloom Fire when pulled with 5 or more Metal Rods, they explode, dealing extra damage and igniting with Bloom Fire to themselves and everything nearby.
* Conductor: With a Conductor Rod applied, if an enemy uses a neither-Flamecharm-nor-Ironsing elemental mantra, they're ignited with Bloom Fire. This stacks with Conductor's element-reflection effect.
* Jailer: If an enemy is on Bloom Fire when pulled with 5 or more Metal Rods, the incoming PEN from their Metal Rods is set to +40% for the time they're restrained.

**Roaring Bellows** (Prerequisites: Bloom Path: Smeltery, Fan the Flames)

* Your stored Wind mantras can now empower your Metal mantras.

**Fire in the Hole** (Prerequisites: Bloom Path: Smeltery, Incendiary Formula)

* Bomb explosions apply a Metal Rod in addition to Bloom Fire.

**Fresh from the Oven** (Prerequisites: Bloom Path: Smeltery, Graceful Flame (Mantra) )

* Graceful Flame slowly builds up stacks of Reheated, a Supporting Status Effect that remains built up until the bearer's next M1 or Critical, where it then dissipates over time.
* Reheated causes the bearer's M1s and Criticals to deal increased damage to enemies on Bloom Fire, with Criticals applying Bloom Fire.
* Reheated is signified by the bearer's weapon taking on a yellow glow, more intense with more stacks.
* (More stacks of Reheated does not increase damage dealt, only increases the duration it lasts after release)

\-

**Hollow Path: Sequestrationist** (ICE/SDW) (Mutual Exclusives: Glass Path, Unyielding Frost)

* Chill now decreases movement speed in relation to the target's relative ether, with barely any slowing at full ether down to reducing movement speed significantly at no ether.
* Bottom Freeze applies Obscured, while Frozen completely blinds the target, turning their screen black.
* Causes your ice and shadow effects to turn a medium-grey. This effect applies to the Hero Blade of Frost, Gran Sudaruska, Hero Blade of Shadow, Crypt Blade, and Deepspindle, as well as the Chilling and Solar enchantments.

**Blot Out the Sun** (Prerequisites: Hollow Path: Sequestrationist, Shadow Roar (Mantra) )

* Shadow Roar applies Chilled and places Ice floors on the ground beneath it at the end of its animation.

**Relentless Blizzard** (Prerequisites: Hollow Path: Sequestrationist, Dark Hours )

* Dark Hours procs on targets standing on Ice floors.

**Left Alone** (Prerequisites: Hollow Path: Sequestrationist, Ice Eruption (Mantra) or Permafrost Prison (Mantra) )

* Enemies within a Rounded Ice Eruption or a Permafrost Prison are inflicted with Solar.

**Terror** (Prerequisites: Hollow Path: Sequestrationist, Fear)

* Chilled enemies who run from you briefly receive Bottom Freeze."

Sorry if it's a silly question, I'm new to hodini.

Below the examples of how I import my textures, I just need a proper glowy effect around the object too.

Is there a way to Convert Std./Phys Mtl to Vray Mtl with custom Presets?,3dsmax,1fydgc6,2024-10-07 13:32:46,4,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/3dsmax/comments/1fydgc6/is_there_a_way_to_convert_stdphys_mtl_to_vray_mtl/,GaboMambo_No5,Help,"Hi everyone!

Is there a way to convert Std/Physical Mtl to Vray Mtl with custom presets? Meaning, setting up the reflection values, BRDF (glossiness/roughness), IOR, reflection Max Depth, so on and so forth...

The reason for this is half the team are Interior Designers, they use an in house software for 3d Layout and interior design. We export those 3d models as FBX to 3dsMax, they get imported as you would expect, Physical Materials everywhere. All materials look the same. FBX models are somewhat useable to certain extent but materials are definitely not. 

We would like to speed up the turn around time for certain projects where deadlines are just to tight for us to replace every single material for a whole floor plan. 

I would like to at least have fabrics looking like fabrics, laminates as laminates and paints looking like paints. Even if the material it's exactly the same just with different bitmaps connected to the Diffuse slot. 

Is there a way to ""automatize"" this with the Vray/Max Scene converter? 
So that I can import fabrics first, convert just those materials with a ""fabric preset"", then move on to plastics, then metals, then laminates, etc...

Any suggestions? 

Thanks!!"

[Last week thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/BABYMETAL/comments/1fnwjk5/princess_yui_tuesday_the_530th_edition_for_all/)

Last week favourite post was [a nice pic](https://www.reddit.com/r/BABYMETAL/comments/1fnwjk5/princess_yui_tuesday_the_530th_edition_for_all/loll8qw/) posted by /u/da_one1morelight

Congratulations /u/da_one1morelight! You are now the *Ultimate Yui fan* for the week!

&nbsp;

*Special flair* 

""Ultimate Yui fan of the week"" >> /u/da_one1morelight you can now wear this flair. As long as you keep the title, you can wear the flair! However, if someone else win the title, you'll have to remove the flair. There can be only one bearer of this flair!

[here is the link to the thread by Facu474](https://www.reddit.com/r/BABYMETAL/comments/brak8b/user_flair_is_now_available_on_this_subreddit/) where it is explained how to activate a flair, according to your system.

&nbsp;

Also let's have a word about /u/freakplan &  /u/widdolsu & /u/ResplendentShade (first title!) & /u/ChrisJorge200 & /u/DrMocata & /u/TheAlomar_ & /u/da_one1morelight & u/warrose-mtl (first title also) & /u/Putrid-Classroom5101 who managed to gain a ""most dedicated kitsune"" title last week!

The answers to a post ARE taken in account but only if a goodie is integrated with the answer, furthermore only the posts/answers with **10+ upvotes** will be taken in account. Note: a goodie could also be a text like [that](https://www.reddit.com/r/BABYMETAL/comments/7fzsq5/princess_yui_tuesday_the_175th_edition_for_all/dqfm1j6/) or a haiku and so on. **For every 10 ""most dedicated kitsune"" titles you win, you get a new tail**.

So following my initial post (https://www.reddit.com/r/Miniswap/comments/1fisua0/h\_huge\_collection\_of\_old\_w40k\_chaos\_space\_marines/), I did not expected such an impressive wave of dm and help from members of this community. I've been quite positively overwhelmed.

First of all, Huge thanks to u/LlamaoftheGods for your help identifying, valuating & listing most of my collection, and also u/pyro_brigade & u/No_Carpenter_3224 for their purchase. Also, I won't list everyone that messaged me with help & support or simply to show interest or kind words, but I appreciate all of you for your messages.

The sheer size of this collection ([4K 60fps video of the collection](https://youtu.be/gWWgccBQ8gc?si=N-8o6bVnYx89g9fS)) and the quantity of rare vintage & classic metal OOP are making it seem like a mountain for me to individually fix, photograph, valuate and list, but I've gone through most of them now and this post is going to be updated frequently tonight and this weekend, so come back later to see for new listings until I finish it.

So for the first pitch of this post, here's the verification photo --> [https://photos.app.goo.gl/9ce6M9bSE66LYymF7](https://photos.app.goo.gl/9ce6M9bSE66LYymF7)

As much as the verif pic is a mess, I am actually obssessed with taking overly professionnal pics of every single piece of this collection and organizing each of them with detailed description in a neat Google Sheet, but for now, please refer to this [4K 60fps video of the collection](https://youtu.be/gWWgccBQ8gc?si=N-8o6bVnYx89g9fS) and this [Google Photo album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/5hyMBt63bxhsiHrw5) where I dump the 50MP macro focused pictures as I go through the pile.

Thanks everyone for your support and let's get these on a game board (or in a showcase I guess :P) once again!

# Official profile

**Agunimon**

A Digimon with power over fire that bears the might of the Ten Legendary Warriors. Agunimon’s DigiCore is covered in the holy blaze of the Spiritual Fire, allowing it to control fire at will. A guardian deity, it is an avatar of the Firewall that defends the Internet. Agunimon gets fired up easily, so it has a warrior side that uses yoga breathing to encourage mental discipline. Agunimon also has a somewhat old-fashioned way of speaking, akin to that of a martial artist. It fights with Eastern martial arts in battle, focusing its spirit to a point to gather flames in one place and raise its attack power. Agunimon uses its special move Pyro Punch to shoot a flame dragon from its fire-wreathed fist, and Salamander Break to unleash a whirlwind kick of flame.

**Vritamon**

A Digimon with power over fire that bears the might of the Ten Legendary Warriors. BurningGreymon’s skin withstands high temperatures, allowing it to move even through lava. This firefighter snuffs out fires with its own instantaneous, explosive flames. Said to have sprung forth from research data on active volcanoes, it is thought to contain an unknown, immeasurable energy. The fire dragon of Hindu mythology, adversary to the thunder god Indra, is embodied in BurningGreymon’s ferocious personality. The more glorious its tactics, and the mightier the opponent, the brighter its fighting spirit burns. It has a reckless side as well, refusing to retreat even from disadvantageous battles. BurningGreymon uses its special move Corona Blaster to fire a laser rivaling solar heat rays from the Rudriya Darpaṇa superweapons on its arms, or Flame Storm to flap its wings and release a high-temperature tornado.

**Aldamon**

A Digimon whose power over fire exceeds that of legend due to the unknown powers it obtained by fully inheriting the might of the Ten Legendary Warriors. Aldamon is a Demon God who transforms fear and anger into a righteous power to fight. Its violent behavior earns it many enemies, but its name reflects the fused form of a god in Hindu mythology, combining the wildness of a beast with the intelligence of a man. In battle, it unleashes attacks over incredibly large areas, melting and burning everything to a crisp. This aspect is a destructive power akin to the threat of a modern nuclear weapon. Aldamon uses its special move Brahmashira to boost the holy blaze of its DigiCore to its limits, creating an ultra-dense high-temperature solar core before detonating it, or Atomic Inferno to fire a rapid-fire stream of super-hot bullets from the Rudriya Darpaṇa superweapons on its arms. It can also use its Rudriya Darpaṇa for melee, and specializes in close-range combat.

**Kaisrgreymon**

A transcendent Digimon with power over flame, said to even surpass the might of the Ten Legendary Warriors. The power of the nine dragon veins flowing through Gaia resides in EmperorGreymon’s body. It has been prophesied that if it can harness that power, it will demonstrate unfathomable ability and rule over Gaia. It wields the Ryuugonken, a sword with the souls of dragons sealed within, in order to control this power. Its special moves include Firedrake Strike, by which it unleashes white-hot, blazing arrows from the Ryuugonken, and Pyro Dragons, by which it releases the power of eight of the dragon veins of Gaia, taking the place of the ninth dragon itself and crushing foes with its huge sword.

**Susanomon**

Susanomon is renowned in eastern folklore as the ultimate god of destruction and the ruler of regeneration. It is said to appear when network systems experience abnormalities, rendering the existing system unto nothingness and building a new one in its place. Its special moves are Ama no Habakiri, by which it cleaves anything and everything under heaven with the blade of light released from its ZERO-ARMS: Orochi, and Yakusa no Ikazuchi, the ultimate technique by which it points its blade of light (released from its ZERO-ARMS: Orochi) to the heavens, transforming it into destructive lightning that then rains down upon the world.

VIGILANT is the best mod ever created. 0/10 [extremely lengthy lore post incoming],TrueSTL,1feso66,2024-09-11 23:04:38,16,0.83,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/comments/1feso66/vigilant_is_the_best_mod_ever_created_010/,IgnemGladio,,"words words words words words

Ok now that all the Nords are scared away, TL;DR - VIGILANT is a fantastic mod and part of a trilogy that I am never going to finish because the ending bricked the saving mechanism and I am sick of this dogshit game. All of this is my interpretation of the mod and I am pretty illiterate in TES lore so if I'm wrong, feel free to laugh in my face. I am also going to talk about the mode story and my playthrough instead of just the gameplay, so if you don't like that, kick rocks.

-----

People *love* going on and on about how TES lore is 'quirky' and 'esoteric' whenever they can't understand it. It's not their fault, some of this shit just slips from deep contemplation and falls into crack hallucination territory. One second you're reading about Queen Alessia overthrowing the Ayleids, and the next second the Alessian Order is breaking time by doing dirty dancing on a tower. What's that all about? How does it relate to the mod? Why am I inside your house? Unfortunately, these questions have no clear answers. Elder Scrolls worldbuilding and lore can be really cool, and we often complain that their best parts are relegated to books instead of being represented in game. But what if someone found a way to make it happen?

I had downloaded this mod once before while searching for quest expansions for the Vigilants of Stendarr because in the base game they are punk ass losers who can't do shit. And then it turned out that VIGILANT has very little to do with the Vigilants anyway. Go figure. My first time playing, I got my ass kicked, found the mod too confusing, hadn't played Oblivion, and also somehow managed to get the worst ending. After that, I put Skyrim down for a year. I picked it up again for my fifth, current, and final time. This time, I vowed to give Skyrim more of a chance to prove itself than I usually do. I also finally planned on finishing this mod.

VIGILANT is a story told in four parts, with gameplay and themes inspired from video game horror classics and soulsbornes. The story starts with you being recruited as a Vigilant of Stendarr by a man called Altano. You get a temple base, a board with radiant quests, and an Estus Flask. Sorry, that falls under copyright infringement - it's a *Histus* flask. 

# Act 1 

Act 1 consists of you banishing a few daedra, killing a half-blind man, a cursed man, his wife and child (yes this mod makes you kill children), and being unable to stop the murder of a large number of Vigilants back at the base. The person partially orchestrating this disaster - Altano - summons Molag Bal to kill you and offer him up to you. Molag Bal - who materializes as a metallic dragon - eats him and tries to do the same to you, but you defeat him by overleveling yourself. MB tells you that he cannot really be defeated, and that this won't be the first time you will see him. It is better that you become his slave now. Refuse him and go to Act 2. Submit and go to **THE VOID.**

# Act 2

It turns out that the keeper of the temple's library survived, and she tells us that Windhelm is experiencing a bunch of mysterious disappearances - no, not from the Butcher. There is an ancient voice lulling prisoners into the ruins of Old Windhelm, which is very Bloodborne inspired. The ruins are infested with blood fiends and vampires, the latter being Vigilants who came there 20 years ago to look into disappearances similar to the present ones. The vampires in the sewers and tunnels speak of the Blood Matron - Lamae Beolfag calling them to join her coven. In reality, Molag Bal is using his first victim to expand his influence, but you outwit the daedric trickster, killing an undead Lamae and granting her a final rest. Or you could also accept her blood oath and proceed to **THE VOID.** Otherwise, the day is saved and you go to Act 3.

# Act 3

Before I tell you about Act 3, I have to mention, I fucked up installing the mod (which is not actually written in base language English) so while there is a voice acting add-on, all the books still had awful Japanese-to-English MTL, so this section is mostly from my memory of the first playthrough.

The Vigilants have lost contact with Bartholo, who is supposed to be looking into the murders of the Bruiant family in Chorrol. You go to the mansion owned by the family and are greeted by an Ayleid bard called Bal. No alarm bells ringing? Good. Being oblivious is fun. You enter the mansion and the doors shut behind you. As you look deeper into the rooms, some of them have small portkeys to hidden dimensions - twisted reflections of the Bruiant mansion with walls covered in rust and spikes, filled with fire, creatures of Oblivion roaming the halls. In each dimension you have to break a curse that was afflicting each member of the household, and their bodies hold notes that tell the whole story. Their unkillable ghosts let loose on the house, chasing you around, screaming horrifyingly and trying to kill you. Bal the bard had recently arrived in the mansion, and through jealousy, ill-will, and daedric influence, he tore the family and servants apart, leading to Marcus Bruiant sacrificing his child Julius to Molag Bal, and committing suicide out of shame. There is a single note on Julius' person. Two pages scrawled with one plea - 'No'. Julius' angry apparition sets the house on fire, and after you dispatch him, you have to find a way out. Except, the flames are too strong. You can lie down there, a martyr to the cause of the Vigilants, an unintended casualty, and an unlikely hero.

Or you can take the helping hand that Molag Bal offers you at quite literally the last moment, and you enter **THE VOID.** Which is Coldharbour. Which is Act 4.

# Act 4

Yeah so this is like 90% of the mod and it's Dark Souls. Like if you showed the area design of Coldharbour to a DS player they'd shit themselves and sue on FromSoft's behalf. I am being hyperbolic of course, but to really enjoy this portion you have to

1. Know at least a little bit about Oblivion lore or  
2. Be into Dark Souls or ESO

So of course I, having played 15 hours of Oblivion and never touching ESO or a FromSoft game in my life, am perfectly qualified to comment on this mod. Real fans never actually touch the fucking game, get good.

After escaping the Bruiant mansion, your soul ends up in Coldharbour, and for some reason it like a tattered replica of the Imperial City. The western horizon is...grey, to say the least and is littered with the corpses of Knights of Order. You emerge from a sarcophagus and are greeted by Inquisitor Pepe who says that the Alessian Order has been stuck in Coldharbour for thousands of years. The Alessian Order existed in the first era and one of its sects was responsible for the first ever Dragon Break. So what were they doing here in Molag Bal's realm? While confused, you don't have time to figure stuff out. You have to take revenge on MB for tricking you, or at the very least, get the hell out of here. There's no main quest, but there are three elements to the gameplay - exploration, NPC quests, and memories from the First Era. The founding Knights of the Nine are present all over Coldharbour, and are either going to be available as followers or will be completely insane and you will have to kill them. The half-blind man you killed in Act 1 is overtaken by Thrassian Plague, which actually seems to be doing the rounds all over MB's realm currently. There's also Soul Shriven all over the place...which have ash zombie-like bodies...with some of them having a plague tentacle sticking out of their heads...wonder what that's referencing.

Your first stop is towards the castle of Varla the Man-Hunter. You can come across the draugr of Belharza - son of Morihaus claiming that he was not a minotaur, demanding from you the heart of Shezarr, and saying that his son, Varla, should not believe in the lies that the Bard told him. Belharza had adopted an Ayleid child while killing elves and especially Ayleids by the drove. You even come across the memories of Pelinal and Morihaus. How? By *fighting them in one on one combat.* And one of the memories is of Pelinal storming the White-Gold Tower with a broken sword, slicing through Meridia's servants by the dozens - that one's not hyperbole. Their memories show that Pelinal saved one of Umaril's pregnant sex slaves - a woman named Mary - from being used in a gut sculpture despite the child being a threat to the world. Pelinal ultimately left the world because his hatred and bloodshed had brought sorrow to Kyne, while Morihaus and Alessia had to pick up the pieces of a world that had overthrown the Ayleids. Long after Alessia's death, Imga prophet Marukh helped install the Alessian order that venerated Shezarr, the god-hero of Man, and hated elves. And somewhere in this mess, around this time, entered the Thrassian Plague.

Coldharbour has a section dedicated to the victims and survivors of Thrassian Plague - the Slum. It is inspired by Blighttown in that it has poison-based damage, shitty platforming and so little light you'd think you had cataract. The enemies are all shit goblins that are in various stages of turning into slug-like Sloads and by the Nine, I cannot put into words the anger I felt at taking one step to the right and plummeting into apparently the Mariana Trench. At the bottom of the Slum is the shade of Mary, now leech-infested and covered in rags.

There is more to her story, but I don't want to be stuck inside Blighttown Lite anymore. If you want to reach Molag Bal, you have to get inside the mockery of Imperial City that he has created. The Slum takes you through a prison tower filled with both daedra and Alessians, and dumps you on the other side of the Imperial wall. The many chapels and priories and dungeons are slowly going to drip-feed you information about the times of the Alessian Order - it had been founded after Marukh emerged with Inquisitor Pepe from the jungles of Colovia with a red stone that they thought was a blessing from Saint Alessia. They set this atop the White-Gold Tower, and together with the Marukhati Selectives they 'danced' for a thousand years to rid Akatosh of his elven taint - Auri-El. Why? Simply because they hated elves.

This 'dance' is not referenced in the mod and comes from the in game books, but the way the Order functioned - burning Mary at the stake for supposedly being Mara incarnate, wiping out minotaurs believing them to be non-man abominations tainting Alessia's name, even killing thousands to fill up the soul gem that they believed had been passed down by Alessia (perhaps the Chim-el Adabal) - the dance was the strife of their people.

You make your way towards MB, and the dungeons get larger, the fights harder, and the plot more complex. In a Marukhati Temple, you encounter Marukh himself meditating silently. Pepe asks you to put him out of his misery. And when you do, you unleash Greymarch.

That's right! Marukh wasn't meditating, he was holding up the barrier that was stopping Jyggalag from ravaging Coldharbour! But again the question. Why would he do that for the realm of Molag Bal? Why is he here? Why are any of the Alessians who broke time in this realm of Oblivion?

Simple. The stone - Bal, in Daedric - that Marukh had found was not the Chim-el Adabal. It was a fake soul gem, a bottomless pit that burned away souls and consumed them whole. A Stone of Fire - Molag Bal. The King of Domination had been guiding people towards ruin all the time. He plotted to resurface in Tamriel. He broke apart the Bruiant family till they committed a heinous sin. He violated Lamae to create a vampire, and thus mock the cycle of life and death. He deluded Marukh with visions of grandeur, and turned a promise of peace into an empire of strife. Molag Bal hates compassion. He hates the Aedra. He hates the mortals. And he inflicts this hatred upon them by trapping them in an eternity of regretful, loveless limbo. All the failed Alessians, all the trapped Ada, all the souls who had been consumed and consigned to Coldharbour have only one way out - you. At the end of the story you have to face off against Molag Bal himself, who is a powerful vaguely three-phase fight with melee and magic. But you can also use defeated enemies as summons, and a vast arsenal you can use to conquer him.

The game ends with a cutscene of Lamae's lover - the bard who Molag would possess to profane her - telling her a bitter story. Depending on how much of a bastard you were, the game gives you options to either give her what she wants to hear, a bitter declaration, or a sweet promise. There are scenes that follow after, but I'll let you experience the full endings yourself because I've basically spoiled the rest of the mod for you.

I love this story and the way it's told. Major players have boss fights attached to them, or follow you around while you make your way through Coldharbour. The number of quests in Act 4 is small and only one of them is mandatory, but you come across them somewhat naturally and they ARE the story of the mod. The amount of quests you complete is the amount of understanding you'll have. There's mechanics that work like Dark Souls, the character stories are moving, the set pieces are amazing. It explores obscure Elder Scrolls lore and timelines in a very engaging way, gameplay wise. So why is this a 0/10?

Because figuring some things out in here can be *ass*. There is almost no conclusive single source of discussion, and I think the only person who has consistent knowledge on Vicn mods is u /Aelarr. But that is minor. Worse than all of that, is that I almost finished the mod today. Almost. As I was sitting there experiencing a sweet melody from the best ending of the game, it crashed multiple times and bugged out my save system. I couldn't fully watch the final cutscene that I was going in blind at the end of an 800 hour save file. And if I tried to quick save the game would crash. I can't quicksave in Skyrim now. So you know what? Fuck this game and fuck this mod. Enough of this dogshit watered down sandbox. I hate VIGILANT. I hate the Vigilants. I hate Skyrim. I hate this subreddit. Molag Bal was right, and I am going to prove it. I hope you play this mod, and I pray that you have to format your C drive because of it."

The foliage mostly uses alpha textures, green leaves and then transparent background and what not. So if anyone could help me fix this issue for the render, that would be greatly appreciated.

[Initio Oud for Greatness Tester (69ml/70ml) for $180](https://imgur.com/a/g5sx8JH) - this is a catch and release. Received it this week and sprayed 5 times to see if it will grow on me. Unfortunately, it didn't. Really strong beast mode perfume.

[Tom Ford Neroli Portofino (29ml/30ml) for $100](https://imgur.com/a/708uVHk) - sprayed like 5 times as well. Didn't reach for it since I purchased Frederic Malle's Cologne Indelegible around the same time. Full presentation.

[Hermes Equipage (99ml/100ml) for $110](https://imgur.com/a/xDWRHbF) - sprayed like 5 times as well. It is elegant smokiness. But then I realized it didn't fit my personality.

[Givenchy Gentleman Reserve Privee (80ml/100ml) for $75](https://imgur.com/a/FDzeMTl) - this is a good one with whiskey and woody notes but I don't reach for it as much so letting it go for others to enjoy.

[YSL Y Eau de Parfum (55ml/60ml) - $70](https://imgur.com/a/AArl2nN) - this is a good one with metallic opening and woody dry down as well but I don't reach for it as much.

[Coach EDT (38ml/40ml) for $20](https://imgur.com/a/KhWshpr) - bought this on a whim and then realized that I don't reach for it.

[Burberry Brit EDT (90ml/100ml) for $35](https://imgur.com/a/xy14Pfa) - good scent but then went to buy the Brit Rhythm flanker so it is now redundant.

[Zara Leather Jardin (99ml/100ml) for $35 ](https://imgur.com/a/rCvm2UK)- new bottle with magnetic cap. Bought this as soon as it was re-released by Zara like two weeks ago or so since it was hyped up by Sebastian as the best Zara fragrance. Sprayed it once and didn't like it. Sprayed it again just to make sure a week later. Still didn't like it. So has to go. Beautiful bottle but it is a very targeted scent for those liking smoky haze flower notes. My loss your gain."

How to get .obj textures to import from Blender,ProCreate,1f7hyzq,2024-09-02 17:06:47,3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProCreate/comments/1f7hyzq/how_to_get_obj_textures_to_import_from_blender/,Zancuno,3D Showcase,"So I was hunting the internet for how to fix a problem of mine. I was importing a model into ProCreate to draw the texture but none of my textures were importing.

After hunting the net for a while, I found some info here and there but after some trial and error I got things working.

First off: make sure your UVs are set on the model if you are not able to load it at all (just getting that out of there)  
Secondly, when you are using blender, have the textures assigned by image in folder, do not use generated textures that haven't been saved as a file yet.

After this, make sure your image names do not have any spaces in their names, for some reason ProCreate is either inconsistent or doesn't like it. Make sure these images are either .png or .jpeg.

So the main issue I ran into is that the textures were not loading because the .mtl file was formatted incorrectly. ProCreate seems to use different property names for loading textures in. These are important to change to load the roughness and metallic layers in (I cannot get normals to work even though it has a property, but ProCreate lacks the ability to make normals anyways)

This is the outputted .mtl I got from blender

    # Blender 4.2.1 LTS MTL File: 'project.blend'
    
    newmtl FullBody
    Ka 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000
    Ks 0.500000 0.500000 0.500000
    Ke 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000
    Ni 1.500000
    d 1.000000
    illum 2
    map_Kd FullBody Color.png
    map_Ns FullBody Roughness.png
    map_refl FullBody Metallic.png
    map_Bump -bm 1.000000 FullBody Normal.png

You can see the images have spaces in their names (If you don't see images in your .mtl, then that means you don't have file images assigned, so the paths aren't there, need to adjust your nodes so they pull file images, or you didn't use path options in export). This was causing map\_Kd to not register and thus not loading my basic texture.

So what to do?

After exporting a copy of my project from ProCreate and studying the .mtl file for changes, I modified my file to be this

    # Blender 4.2.1 LTS MTL File: 'project.blend'
    
    newmtl FullBody
      map_Kd FullBody-Color.png
      Ka 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000
      Ks 0.500000 0.500000 0.500000
      Ke 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000
      Ni 1.500000
      d 1.000000
      illum 2
      map_roughness FullBody-Roughness.png
      map_metallic FullBody-Metallic.png
      map_tangentSpaceNormal -bm 1.000000 FullBody-Normal.png //<-- may need clarification

map\_Kd still remains the same, so it was only the image name having spaces that was the issue.  
map\_Ns has been changed to map\_roughness as that seems to be what procreate uses  
map\_refl has been changed to map\_metallic

map\_bump has been changed to map\_tangentSpaceNormal but given you can't modify normals in ProCreate, it is redundant to have this other than to have the normals visible in the app if you can get it to work.

With these changes and notes in mind, I was able to load my .obj model with the textures I had into ProCreate.

You will have to edit the .mtl file after exporting the model, you should be able to use notepad or any kind of text editor that can open code for the job. If you ever re-export the model from Blender, you will have to modify the .mtl file again, so keep that in mind. Transfer your files with the modified .mtl to your device.

When in your device, you should be able to split view the files app with procreate and drag the folder containing your .obj, .mtl, and your textures into ProCreate's Library to import them all in and have everything present.

Hope this helps many, made this post simply because I had to dig in the internet to find answers and nothing was in one place. Maybe The way things are ordered and spaced don't have to be similar to what ProCreate exports, but did it to be safe."
IR1 Visa Received!! Montreal embassy - My 822 day journey...,NationalVisaCenter,1f5o092,2024-08-31 10:02:57,28,1.0,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalVisaCenter/comments/1f5o092/ir1_visa_received_montreal_embassy_my_822_day/,balderunnerdecker,,"Hi Everyone,

 I'm writing this since this entire Visa process gave me so much anxiety from beginning to end. Even though you know it's going to take a long time, living through it was a whole different matter. Once i got my IL,i was looking at information regarding the interview and there was so much negative or fearful things that popped up that gave me even more anxiety. Specifically around the 221g administrative processing. Now looking back, i understand that it is a bit of bias as most people who post are looking for help with a situation that may be negative. Thankfully, i found a redditor here posting about her positive experience in MTL. That helped me so much, i wanted to post my own positive experience. From the start of the USCIS Process to the end, it took 822 days. This was a very very long process but i know there are some who have been waiting longer.

ps. This is a long thread, so if you don't want to read the whole thing, just scroll to the bottom as i think if you're going through the process and worried about 221g, that's the part to read.

  
The Timeline

Married - March 2022

Submitted I-130 application - May of 2022

Approval of I-130 - Feb 2024

IL received - June 26th 2024

Interview - Aug 19th 2024

Approval - had a verbal approval by the officer saying it's ""conditionally approved"" and then we had the status turn to issued that same afternoon. Passport & Visa stamp arrived on Aug 23rd 2024.

Medical Exam

  I did Dr. Zatzman in Vaughan area (Toronto GTA). He was very kind and quick. Everything that i needed to do was in the building and was able to get all done in a few hours. He also sent out the medical results (and sent me an email confirmation saying he sent it) approx. 7 days after as it was electronically submitted to MTL.  I was worried about my vaccines as i got most of my Childhood vaccines in Srilanka and didn't have records for them but most of my vaccines i got as a teenager were in Canada.  The one i didn't have proof of was MMR vaccine and Dr. Zatzman said he could detect in my blood test, so that shouldn't be an issue. Thankfully my GP had done a titer test back in 2015 and had records of that and Dr. Zatzman took that as proof. He was truly great!

The Interview

  My husband joined me in Montreal a day before the interview (it was his first time there) and to give some moral support. My interview was at 7.30am and i got there about 10 mins before. there were only a few people before me. The security officer called people who had appointments at 7.30am one by one to check us in. Then we went through the metal detector and then put our belongings in a small lock box (do not bring a back or backpack, something small that can fit in what looks like a small mailbox). Then headed upstairs to wait. 

You'll go through two steps for the CR1/IR1 visa. 

Step 1 - You have to wait for your number to be called (you're given that before you go through the metal detectors) and you go up with your documents. I had a really nice person who asked me for my various documents. After the documents she asked me to confirm our address both in Canada where the passport will be sent and in the US where we will be living.

My Original Birth certificate (Original OR Certified copy), 

My husbands birth certificate (original OR certified copy)

RCMP Certificate - (We had the right kind but i know others don't. Ours also had expired since when we started this process in July 2023 as lawyers said our USCIS approval would be soon. By the time my interview happened we were passed July 2024, so they suggested we get an updated one as of July 2024 and that was what asked).

Husbands 2023 Tax return 

Step 2 - After step 1, you go back and sit down and await Step 2. This is where they call you in for the interview ( a monitor will show your number and they call your number as well). The interview booth are tucked away on the side , so initially many of us were wondering where it was but you'll find it soon enough. It's not private as you can hear the person beside you speaking but you do the best you can. The interview officer was nice and quick, he just asked a few questions.

My full name?

My husbands full name?

What did my husband do for work?

Where was i born ?

How did we meet?

The last question was a bit of a doozy. He asked me ""do you remember what happened in 1996""?. I was 12 at the time, so i honestly said ""i have no idea"". Apparently there was a note on my file that i had an encounter with a border guard. I genuinely do not remember and then he said ""don't worry about it"". I assume because i was a minor and it was 28 years ago, so it doesn't mean much although i've asked my parents and they don't remember anything either.

After that he said "" I'm going to conditionally approve your Visa"" and then gave me a track sheet. I asked him what that means and when i get my full approval. He said, he's not sure but the visa should be coming in 2 weeks and he's keeping the passport. He also said the reason he asked about 1996 was to eliminate any issues that may prop up when they are issuing the visa.  Then that afternoon around 4pm, the status on the Visa page said ""issued"".  I'm leaving for the U.S in a month.

Reading forums and Reddit, one of the thing that got me most anxious was a 221G Administrative processing. There didn't seem any rhyme or reason and while i haven't travelled a lot, I'm a Canadian citizen but i am foreign born.  There's a lot of info out there about what could go wrong, but few that went right. I had made my self anxious once i started reading the 221g rejections. If you're going through the process and haven't started looking into 221g rejections, my advice is don't. If you do get one, there's plenty of resources out there to help. However, looking into it before hand does not help in my opinion.

For all those going through USCIS process, waiting for the IL or interview, there's very few people who understand what we go through unless you've gone through it yourself. Regardless of how long it takes, it is mentally , emotionally taxing and it affects your relationship. All we have is the community like this and the hope that we all come out with the Green card/Visa approval in the end.  GOOD LUCK!

- **Learn the basics of the Metal Shading Language (MSL)** through straightforward, hands-on SwiftUI examples. We break down complex concepts into easy-to-understand lessons.

- **Create a mesmerizing lava lamp effect**, teaching you how to make dynamic, fluid visuals that respond to user interaction.

- **Design dynamic wave animations** that can be used in a variety of applications, from backgrounds to interactive elements.

- **Understand noise and Fractal Brownian Motion** to create natural-looking textures and effects that can bring your app to life.

- **Convert GLSL to the Metal Shading Language**, allowing you to leverage existing knowledge and resources while learning Metal.

- **Explore Voronoi and Perlin noise** techniques to generate organic and visually appealing patterns.

- **Work with practical code snippets** that you can easily integrate into your own projects.



Our approach is practical and project-based. Each module includes useful code snippets and real-world examples, ensuring that you can apply what you learn immediately. We also provide a comparison between Metal and GLSL, helping you understand the strengths and differences of each language.



By the end of this course, you will have the skills to craft beautiful and interesting apps that stand out in the crowded app marketplace. Whether you're developing for fun or aiming to release a professional app, you'll find valuable techniques and insights here.



Additionally, you'll get access to our vibrant Discord group. This is a great place to connect with fellow students, share your ideas, get feedback, and collaborate on shaders and apps. Our community is supportive and always ready to help you overcome any challenges you face.

Amex Platinum VS. N26 Metal,FinanzenAT,1et2oq6,2024-08-15 14:33:32,1,0.6,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinanzenAT/comments/1et2oq6/amex_platinum_vs_n26_metal/,RecentConnection9019,Allgemein ,"Guten Abend,

auf der Suche nach einer Kredit/Debit- Karte mit guten Versicherungsleistungen bin ich auf einen ungewöhnlichen Vergleich gekommen…

Da in Österreich bei der AMEX PLATINUM abzüglich der Guthaben (180€ Gourmet Österreich/ 180€ Gourmet ausserhalb Österreich/ 180€ Streaming/Amazon Guthaben), welche leicht einzulösen sind, die mtl. Belastung effektiv mit 10€ pro Monat veranschlagen würden bin ich aufgrund der umfassenden Versicherungsleistungen schon stark überzeugt diese Kreditkarte vernünftig einsetzen zu können…


Als Alternative dazu fällt mir das N26 Metal Abo ein, welches mit 13,90-16,90 zu Buche schlagen würde. Manko ist, dass es sich um keine Kreditkarte handelt, Pluspunkt sind alle Nachteile die ich mit der Amex hätte (Akzeptanz, keine extra Gebühren)…


Was ist eure Meinung dazu…

LG,

Christoph

Anyone been to the dermatologist for a piercing bump (not for a k-word)?,piercing,1enh2nt,2024-08-08 16:55:02,1,1.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/piercing/comments/1enh2nt/anyone_been_to_the_dermatologist_for_a_piercing/,grossepatatebleue,Troubleshooting/question existing piercing,"If yes, I want to know what your experience was like! I’m at that point myself where I’m at my wits’ end, but don’t want to give up on this piercing. 

For context: I have very sensitive skin that does not take well to piercing. I currently have a bump under my tragus that my APP piercer says he thinks might not go away if I don’t take it out soon. (He’s given me a month to see if it improves). Since I know people will ask:  I follow aaaall the aftercare recommended by the APP . (Except the downsize because the bump came too soon) and my piercer only pierces with implant-grade metals from brands approved by the APP.

Sooo anyone have luck with going to the derm for bumps? (And feel free to recommend someone if you’re in MTL!) If yes, tell us how it went :)"
Heavy Metal Sausage wine dinner,PhiladelphiaEats,1eidz4u,2024-08-02 12:08:47,128,0.99,18,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1eidz4u,maxsanjuan,Dining Out,"Made it off the waitlist for this dinner at the last minute yesterday and decided we needed to take the opportunity. I’m so happy we did. Such an intimate, casual, unique experience. It felt like your bad ass chef friend held a dinner with friends in his butcher shop after hours. 

You walk in and are seated in one of the 3 available tables, 2 set up in front of the deli case filled with homemade meats, ready for tomorrows butcher shop customers, and one set up literally in the kitchen. There were 6 diners total, which made it clear that they’re not doing this for a payday, but for a passionate love of the game.

The dinner we attended was in collaboration with a local wine maker, each dish being paired with a natural or orange wine - typically not my thing when it comes to wine, but was perfectly suited for the hip, hyperlocal food and feel. 

The meal started with the chefs casual, stream of consciousness description of the menu, and many details about the preparations of the upcoming dishes. The food kicked off with a charcuterie board with homemade leberwerst, chicken liver mousse, pâté, and home-cured spalla. Everything was rich and delicious, and extra charming knowing it was made it house. The pate was a standout.

Again, everything about the service was extremely casual and informal. The mismatch plates and cutlery, and the informal clearing and presenting of dishes made it feel like you were a guinea pig in your buddy’s culinary passion project, in the best way. 

Next was smoked trout, another delicious dish. Simple, slightly less out of the box, but basically perfect. Plates were cleared, wine was poured, and out came an herb and pepper ravioli - a unique and interesting pasta flavor combo - and a ramekin of slow cooked tomatoes, sourdough bread, and mussels. All very yummy, but my girlfriend didn’t care for the pasta as much as other dishes. I loved the unexpectedness of the flavors with the pasta, which at the very least left me intrigued and engaged.

The star of the show was the duck. Absolutely perfect duck breast, truly possibly the best duck ive had, and a duck confit tart that I could have eaten all night had it been less rich. That breast though… freaking outstanding.

Some desserts concluded the meal. Nothing to write home about in my opinion, but where the food lacked, the experience redeemed.

Overall, the food was great, and the experience was extremely special. I could see how the chefs innovative approach could lead to some hit or miss dishes at times, but regardless, this is an experience worth having if you’re into culinary creativity and unique dining experiences. I highly recommend it!"

Two weeks of perfect tranquility passed. The Maniac and the Hostess had decided to participate in Akari's trainings, but two days had been enough to dissuade them and force them to abandon their good intentions.
However, the girl did not become discouraged and decided to continue her personal mission. While climbing, due to the strong wind, she had fallen from a height of ten meters. She had not suffered any fractures, but the accident had kept her immobilized for a while. Despite this, she had decided to show up at the usual building the following day as well, much to Ooki's disappointment. No matter how hard he had tried to dissuade her, Akari had not listened to him.
""You'd better give up. You have nothing to gain by straining your physique like this,"" he admonished her.
""Once transferred, the bruise will disappear so I consider this a good opportunity to heal completely,"" decreed
the other abruptly, putting down her weapon and getting up nimbly. She seemed to have been bewitched by a strange excitement.
""You wait for wounds to heal, but remember that on a mission death is always lurking,"" He protested. 
""I know!"" she cut him short.
""Well, since you know then you should-""
""If my time comes, It means it was meant to be. I want to reach 100 points. I'm almost there now, and I don't want to waste this opportunity.""
Ooki had never seen her so eager. Freedom at any price, at any cost, did not fit into the Akari mindset that Ooki had come to recognize. Death loomed over them and would be the resetter of any effort. Ooki had noticed during the last trainings how much the girl's abilities had declined, yet he had never had the courage
to confide in her. Another incident would only be a matter of time, so he had decided to expose himself that day. After taking her aside, in a firm voice he expressed his great concern to her.
""Are you interested in the hundred points? All right, I'll make you a proposal. If we have a chance to capture the boss, I promise to give you first dibs on the last shot. Of course, we will have to cooperate, since I could never do it alone. So listen to me, go and rest and trust me.""
Akari looked at him in amazement, then laughed grimly. ""Thank you, but...""
""I'm serious."" 
""I know.""
""I promise you, I will always stay by your side ready to help you out.   For now, take a break."" 
""All right, will do.""
Ooki felt happy and satisfied. Akari had accepted his proposal, and this had warmed his heart. He had forced himself to talk to her in earnest before she broke free from the world of Gantz. He thought back to the day he had spent at the zoo, his feelings continuing to germinate.



Two weeks had passed since the previous mission, and Akari never showed up at the abandoned building again. To tell you the truth, he never showed up at school again either. Someone in class had revealed to Ooki that the absence was due to unspecified physical ailments. Convalescent or not, the matter would be resolved with
the next mission. For his part, Ooki continued to work out supports for his weapons. Attending a technical
institute helped him greatly in this regard. Processing such special weapons required specific tools and
sophisticated instrumentation that a mere student could not possibly have. Equipment that was worth several
million yen. Ooki had not confided in anyone and in the meantime had continued to work out some improvements. The latest modification concerned the length of the metal cable that adjusted the shooting
angle. Despite great efforts, he could not feel comfortable, as excessive interventions would complicate the
simple structure of the weapon.
""Maybe I should stop,"" he thought absentmindedly, 
""After all, in decisive moments what matters is reliability.""
He put on the suit, not without feeling the usual discomfort with that tight-fitting garment. He observed the bag he had decided to tie to his hip. He noticed how bulky it was compared to earlier times. He had filled it with a variety of devices all connected to his weapons. His training with Akari had not borne the fruit he had imagined and his skills had remained at a mediocre level, so he had no choice but to resort to his usual tricks so as to reach a competitive level.
He dropped dead weight onto the bed, literally exhausted. He had spent several hours in the lab that day working on the latest modifications. Just then, he became aware of the light beam, warning him that the transfer was about to begin. All transfixed, he hurried to fill his bag with what he had set out to take with him and what he thought would come in handy on the mission. He clutched the weight to his hips, as everything in contact with his body would be transferred with him.
As soon as he returned to consciousness, he saw that the room was occupied by about 20 people. The newcomers, unaware of anything, were clearly upset by their first experience, but unlike usual, a rather
sustained buzz could be heard.
Akari materialized shortly after Ooki. Seeing her, he breathed a sigh of relief. She looked around and smiled at him."" 
""Today is shaping up to be a very lively evening.... ""
Who would have expected it to be a night with so many condemned to death...""
Akari had taken it upon herself to warn the group about the mission's methods. The name of the target given
by Gantz was Alien Tiger. A boy with hair streaked with some streaks, which made him look very much like a
manga character (he even had eyebrows the same color as his hair), read the glowing ideograms that appeared on the sphere.
""What a name--
Are we sure he is an alien?""
""Maybe he'll like meat,"" a fat man with a double chin, a perm and a pair of sunglasses added wryly.
The girl who sat behind the fat man, decked out in tacky accessories, laughed nervously.
""Favorite phrase, Groarrrrrr... but what the heck does that mean?""
""You'll have plenty of time to find out later. Now you'd better put on the suit if you don't want to come to a
bad end,"" Akari scolded her. Hearing her cool, composed voice, the same as always when they were in that room, made Ooki breathe a sigh of relief.
""Ooki, I recommend the motorcycle..."" she had whispered to him during the general explanation. He did not
let her repeat it and headed into the adjoining room, where he found Izumi already riding one of the vehicles.
They cast a glance at each other, then Izumi went back to focusing on the control panel contraptions, Ooki deciding not to tease him. There was bad blood between the two of them; they had detested each other from the beginning. Probably a matter of skin.
Ooki headed to another motorcycle and began to place the cable system he had worked out. It was then that
they heard screams coming from the other room. The transfer had begun. ""Wasting time with that nonsense again?"" warned Izumi.
""Unfortunately, I'm not as gifted as you, who could earn points from the very first mission,"" Ooki replied wryly. 
""The important thing is that you don't get in my way-are we clear?""
Izumi's body began to light up. ""You, rather...stay away from Akari!""
Ooki was once again amazed at the strange atmosphere Izumi exuded. Bluster yes, but up to a point.
Moreover, a very unusual whiff of danger emanated from him.
Once the transfer was over, Ooki looked around and immediately felt a familiar atmosphere. He dismounted
from the motorcycle, trying to focus on some detail that would help him recognize the area. The moon was illuminating the road. He took a couple of steps toward a large white wall, then noticed the cage. The surrounding architectural structure left no doubt. It was the site of his first date with Akari.
""The zoo... so the Tiger Alien is hidden in here....
By now it was late at night. No visitors at that late hour, not even a watchman.... 
No one except their phantom enemy waiting for them, hiding somewhere. Ooki looked at the controller he held on his arm.
And turned on the radar. The bright dot began to grow larger. The detector signaled a suspicious presence a few
meters away from him. He stared at the large cage in front of him. From the darkness beyond the bars he heard a growl, at first faint, similar to a whine, and gradually growing more and more full-bodied. It seemed to him that the being was even sounding out words.
""Grrrrr... human... grrrrr...""
Without wasting any time he drew the X-Gun from his pouch, promptly squeezing the lock-on trigger. From
the darkness he seemed to catch a glimpse of a pale, almost faded image. The only thing he guessed was that
it was a substantial silhouette approaching him. The monitor whitened unexpectedly. Ooki barely had time to open the throttle and instinctively moved the bike. He was grazed by a substantial mass that passed within inches of his head. After breaking the bars of the cage, with a great leap the mysterious being had reached the
spot where Ooki was stationed the moment before. At last the moonbeams shed light on the attacker: it was a large capybara at least two meters long, its coat glowing white.
The motorcycle moved quickly and he shouted in the direction of the gantzers who had just materialized and were looking around as if dazed.
""Run away! The animals! The enemies are the animals!""
As Ooki walked backwards to catch up with the group, the cages to the right opened in unison and a deformed and furious thing hurled itself out of them. It was then that Ooki heard the first heartrending cry.
""What the hell is going on?!""
A fragment dropped from who knows where and hit the most exposed man. ""The belly! Something hit my belly!""
The companion standing next to him knelt with his belly ripped open by a whip-like lash. His guts spilled out as he desperately tried to throw them back in with his hands. The alien in the guise of a Malaysian baku, a gigantic being almost three meters long, jumped on him and immobilized him. Then, waving its large fingernails like whirlwinds, it began to pounce on him, literally shredding him. Ooki turned his handlebars and backed up. He tried to operate the X-Guns attached to the bike, but noticed the human bodies lying helpless
on the ground.
""Shit! I can't risk hitting them!""
He accelerated and purposefully brushed past the nearest animal, then took a seemingly deserted road. 
""I'm here, damn you! Catch me!""
Izumi soon realized that he had ended up in a zoo. Without wasting any time, he gave the motorcycle gas and
set out to find the tiger's cage. He judged it to be a simplistic solution, but judging from Gantz's reasoning, it was not at all unlikely that the phantom Tiger Alien was right in the area.
He was more determined than ever to take down the boss before Akari and the others got ahead of him. He considered her a
very skilled and experienced girl, but he was convinced he could overcome her.
""I'll be the one to take him out, they can bet their heads on it!"" he smiled mockingly. 
He was getting used to that paradox and thought of it as a kind of fascinating and engaging game. He had not asked himself too many questions about the nature of the situation, and the idea of being on the verge of death urged him to release his hidden energies. He realized that he was having the most exciting experience of his
life. Suddenly he heard the sound of some metal bars clashing on the concrete. He caught sight of a giant shadow and thought he heard a strange human voice. ""Tuuu! Is that you! Is that you?!""
He aimed his weapon and without blinking fired toward the dark silhouette whose contours gave the idea of a
large elephant. The stricken being staggered, while gushes of blood dispersed through the air as if they had been shot from a large fountain. But the animal did not lose its balance. His extraordinary size evidently had helped him cushion the blow. Izumi maintained his grip on the motorcycle's stick, while with his right hand he aimed the Shotgun again, this time aiming at the pachyderm's legs.
Struck at a joint, the elephant knelt on the ground, holding itself up on its hind legs. The trunk wiggled furiously. The animal inhaled some air and sneezed, dumping some kind of gelatinous liquid on Izumi. The boy did not lose heart and grabbed the sword he held at his belt. Within an instant, the blade extended and with a
diagonal slash cut the pachyderm in two. Then the boy backed up and with another precise slash severed its head cleanly from its body, which trembled in spasmodic convulsions until it collapsed to the ground. Izumi stopped the bike and stood looking at the giant gray mass that was lying on the ground.
""Is that all? That sucks, I had just started to warm up..."" He spat on the ground and set off in search of more prey.
--
Nishi had appeared in the area reserved for nocturnal animals, thus the least lit area of the zoo. The moon was shining in the sky, but it was not full, and the poor light reflections contributed to large areas of shadow. The X-Gun was set up to illuminate the dark areas, but its range was somewhat reduced and would only come in handy in the presence of the enemy at medium and short range. Yet Nishi was sure that what he was hearing were sounds of dragging footsteps, as if the shrubs all around had suddenly come alive.
He understood that something hostile was lurking nearby, yet he could only vaguely make out blurred shadows among the surrounding vegetation. Then he remembered the controller, placed on his arm.
""Of course, the radar...""
That device would have helped him detect any enemy presence in the vicinity within moments. An indispensable aid in that dimly lit area. The map that appeared in the display lit up, immediately alerting him
to the presence of several bright dots. Nishi winced. He was practically surrounded by enemies and they were stationed no more than fifty meters away from him. He increased the scale of the map and noticed that the dots were positioned in a sort of circle.
""Dammit, I'm trapped...""
Keeping his position as the center of reference of the radar, he noticed that the circle formed by the bright
dots was shrinking moment by moment. That invisible, silent enemy had cut off all escape routes for him. He
thought about whether he should shout to signal his presence to the other gantzers. Then, reasoning, he decided to give up the idea. His pride in not giving it up to Ooki and Akari was too strong; he certainly did not want to stoop to asking for help. As he assessed the situation, he seemed to notice an individual about ten
meters away from him. He made to call out to him but winced and managed to contain himself. He saw strange silhouettes that had swooped down on the man. He heard the sound of jaws in action, of broken bones and smashed flesh: his blood froze in his veins. He focused his vision, but of the human figure there was now no trace. He kept his X-Gun aimed and retreated a few steps. He heard the last chews and a series of strange squeaks: evidently the herd was finishing its horrible feast. Blood spurted into the air and a drop wet
his cheek. Fear caused him to laugh nervously.
It was then that one of the beings turned toward him. It had the appearance of a monkey, but the face
looked more like that of an insect. It had protruding, retina-like eyes like those of flies, while a strange cricket-like beak bordered its half-open mouth, from which sprouted mistletoe-like tentacles.
Nishi fired a shot that, amazingly, hit the mark. The insect monkey's head shattered into a thousand pieces.
The boy's joy was short-lived. Around the corpse assembled a screeching torment of other small creatures.
Nishi tried to take advantage of that moment to escape. He cast an eye over the controller, but was disappointed to find that his situation had not improved at all.
""There has to be a way,"" he muttered, not expecting a response.
He adjusted the controller's scale, increasing it to try to detect a chink in the encirclement. In the state of
anxiety he was in, he inadvertently pressed an unfamiliar button.
It was then that he heard a voice. 
""Hey, over there! Is anyone there!""
Nishi saw the insect monkeys blow up under the Shotgun blast of a group of gantzers who had evidently
broken the encirclement. The boy made to signal his presence but realized to his horror that more monkeys were swooping down on them. Instinct, and especially the enhancer suit, enabled him to leap onto the branch of a large tree behind him. The leap was more powerful than normal and got him over a couple of meters in
height with ease. He hugged the trunk and looked down to check the situation. He was barely balancing and had to take extra care not to plummet to the bottom. He thought that nothing would stop those monstrous monkeys from climbing up to him.
He tried to overcome his panic, then heard shouts coming from
below. ""What the heck are these little monsters?!""
The man who had rushed to his aid did not have time to react and was overwhelmed by the insect monkeys who
tore him to pieces. Those beings seemed to have forgotten about Nishi and had lashed out at the newcomer.
Shotguns had knocked out several aliens but some gantzers had broken away from the group, ending up prey to
the surviving monsters. Nishi witnessed the horrific scene of a man having his heart ripped out of his chest. He perched silently on the branch and tried not to watch that massacre.
""I will not be devoured...""
Meanwhile, the rest of the group had returned to rescue their comrades, but they were literally overwhelmed
by other beings who emerged from the darkness. The battle lasted a matter of minutes, until the insect
monkeys managed to slaughter even the last gantzer. Nishi judged it reasonable to remain hidden in the branches of the tree, as quiet as he could. The monkeys, as expected, returned to the vicinity of the tree and began to look around. Nishi broke into a cold sweat; perhaps his time had come. Instead, unexpectedly, after scanning the area far and wide, the pack moved away without caring about him. It seemed like a miracle.
Nishi thought he could still get away with it. He looked around until it seemed to him that he could see no more signs of life. He noticed the strange characters that had appeared on the controller display.
""Change of frequency? What the hell does that even mean...""
Then he had like an epiphany. He jumped down and followed the path taken by the herd of monkeys. It was
then that he definitely realized that they were unable to see him. He fired the X-Gun, blasting the last one in line.
The others turned around surprised to observe their fallen comrade, but did not react, even though Nishi was standing a few steps away from them.
""It's all clear...""
It was blatant that they did not see it. The credit probably went to that button accidentally pressed a few minutes earlier. He basically realized that he had become invisible. He took advantage of this and continued to fire on the pack.
""Damn you! Now I'm going to take you all out!""
In a fit of rage he began to laugh, happy that he could safely exterminate those horrible monsters. Near the tiger's cage were stationed some animals whose size certainly made them fearsome.
""No doubt about it, over there must be the boss..."" Izumi smiled, squaring them with disdain. He grasped the Shotgun with his left hand and clutched the hilt of the sword with his right. In the previous two weeks he had trained hard to familiarize himself with the suit and the weapons. He went on the attack. The first to fall was a
gray bear, struck by a precise slash. The animal scrambled to the ground as foamy blood gushed from its mouth.
Izumi had taken down the beast with ease, striking it in the chest. This time he decided to wait for his opponent to bring the next attack. A yellowish-coated mandrill showed him its fangs menacingly. Normally it was a monkey little larger than a child, but that being reached the size of a grown man. The mandrill screamed in anger and called out for other animals. Izumi became aware of the other hostile stares that were squaring him.
""All the better-the more of you there are, the more fun I have."" 
""Is that him? It must be him!"" shouted one voice. 
""Yes, it's him!"" replied another.
It was the turn of the pack of monkeys to attack. One attempted to cling to its flanks, but was quickly knocked down. Kicking and slashing his way through, Izumi managed to repel the first assault, decimating his opponents. The sword whirled through the air as returning blows struck relentlessly at the beasts, many of
which ended up cut in two. When the rant was over, it was the turn of a giant hippo. This time Izumi nailed it with a precise shot from the Shotgun. In the midst of that carnage, amidst streams of blood and flying shreds of flesh, the boy felt on cloud nine.
""That's all you know how to do! Come on, let me have more fun!""
Despite the incitement, the attacks suddenly ceased. Izumi looked around suspiciously. 
""Is that him?"" whispered a voice.
""That's him, isn't it?"" whispered another.
""So that would be him,"" asked another in a whisper. 
""But is it really him?"" raised the first.
The whispers overlapped each other. Izumi lost patience. 
""What the hell is wrong with you people? Speak up, damn it!""
But he got no response. The aliens seemed as if intimidated.
""What's the matter with you? Did you wet yourselves? Or
what!"" 
""Are you the key?"" a calm, quiet voice asked him.
""The key?""
Izumi tried to focus, to locate the animal that had spoken.
""I heard that they will need the key. If you are the key, then I will kill you."" 
""What the hell are you talking about? Cut the nonsense and step forward, you monster! Or would you rather I come and flush you out?""
Izumi grinned smugly. He braced himself with his sword and pointed the shotgun at him. 
""I smell human... "" he replied in an almost wheezing voice from before.
This time Izumi waited no longer and took a few steps forward. The voice came from the tiger's cage and gradually changed into a dull, deep growl, as if it had come straight out of the bowels of the earth. Izumi approached cautiously and caught sight of a large silhouette that was approaching the railing, gradually gaining its shape.
""You are... the Alien Tiger!""
He heard the sound of grass and trampled pebbles, until the silhouette of a big cat appeared from the darkness.
It was nothing short of gigantic, at least as big as a rhinoceros. Izumi immediately had the impression that he was not facing a
simple alien.
""Now we'll see how much the big boss is worth...""
The tiger did not respond and turned in a testy tone to the other
animals. 
""It's not him.""
""What did you say?"" intervened Izumi. The tiger did not answer him and continued.
""I was hoping to eat the key ... instead this is just a miserable louse.""
Izumi shook his hair out of his face and looked indignantly at the panting tiger, who was breathing with his tongue hanging out.
""Louse to me? Now we'll see who the real louse is.""
""Don't fret, human ... I will avenge my beasts and tear you to pieces...""
""You will be the one who will end up sliced! In fact, I'll have some nice tiger steaks!""
With a leap Izumi landed above the wall bordering the tiger's cage and twirled the black blade of his sword in the air. Then he aimed the Shotgun aiming directly at the animal's head.
""Those toys don't work on me, human..."" The tiger laughed heartily and crouched down ready to pounce.
A breath of wind brushed Izumi's face. He continued to hold down the trigger of the Shotgun, but what he got
was only the sound that signaled an error. It was as if the weapon had jammed.
""Maybe I pressed the lock-on wrong...""
Meanwhile, the tiger had disappeared from his sight. In fact, the big cat had taken a great leap forward, landing behind him without making the slightest sound. So he had gone on the counterattack.
Izumi realized this, but it did not upset him too much. The enhancing suit swelled to the limit to cushion the animal's lunge. With a precise movement, the boy swung the sword over his right shoulder and repulsed the opponent's assault, blocking its paw. He then let go of the sword's grip and grabbed the Shotgun with both hands, unloading an impressive volley of shots toward the supposed target. However, the tiger had already disappeared from his field of vision.
""I saw you, don't hope to escape me!""
The animal's leap had been impressive, but Izumi also had excellent reflexes and above-average responsiveness.
The alien's dexterity advised him not to lower his concentration. He fired at a large stone and forced the tiger out into the open again. He noticed that the alien had slightly changed its appearance. Its front legs had become slimmer and slender, at least compared to the hind legs that produced the momentum for jumps. They now
resembled human arms, though at least twice as long as a normal human's, and extremely elastic. Izumi also noticed the sharp, curved nails sticking out of his fingers. The eyes no longer appeared to be the round ones typical of felines.
Rather, they had an almond-shaped cut, with vaguely oriental lines.
""Did you see me? Are you sure you can see me!""
The Alien Tiger made another portentous leap for a beast of its size, going to rest on a large branch of the nearby tree. Then it turned in on itself and changed position, with light, measured movements that shook the foliage but did not break the branch. He then contracted his body and pounced on Izumi again, taking advantage of the blind spot in his view. However, the boy had read the movement. He pretended to grant himthat trajectory, but it was a ploy to force him into the open. He turned sharply and pointed the barrel of the
Shotgun in the direction of the tiger's head.
""I said I can see you just fine!""
He pulled the trigger, but the momentary lapse allowed the giant animal to tilt its head a couple of inches so
that it avoided the blast. The shot lacerated his right ear but did not compromise his balance. The tiger managed to land in a dark area and prepared for the new offensive. Izumi decided to throw the rifle to the ground and concentrate on the sword. He grasped the two-handed hilt, waving it in front of his opponent's
muzzle, then sank a vigorous blow into the soft scruff. The sword penetrated flesh and blood splashed into the
air. But when Izumi made to pull it out, he found that the weapon was stuck in the giant feline's body, and no matter how hard he tried, he could no longer free it.
The tiger stiffened his neck muscles and with a jerky movement forced his opponent to let go. The recoil knocked Izumi to the ground. The boy rolled a short distance away and grabbed the X-Gun he held at his waist, unloading it on the tiger. This time he hit the shoulder, but the animal did not shake much more and returned
to the counterattack. With a superhuman effort, Izumi threw himself backward, managing for the umpteenth time to avoid the deadly lunge. The impact with the concrete had split his lip and a trickle of blood slid down from the corner of his mouth. He fired again in the direction of the tiger, but the animal smoothly avoided the
X-Gun's light trails with a snappy zig-zag motion. Izumi then played his last card. He made a feint to force the tiger to lean forward and with a gesture worthy of an acrobat, drew the spare sword he kept concealed for emergencies. He plunged the blade into the behemoth's body. 
""You thought I was just going to shoot you! Let me feel where your heart is, you bastard!""
The X-Gun monitor quickly scanned the alien's body as the sword continued to torment his flesh. The tiger shuddered like a gasp. It was then that the dull sound of a ray from an unknown point went through the air and hit the back of the giant alien's head. Izumi frowned as the tiger rolled its pupils and fell to the ground in a
lake of blood.
Izumi became aware of the curious invisible silhouette, whose outlines he could barely see, that was
approaching in his direction. The flickering halo surrounding it produced tiny sparks and elusive silver
reflections. The silhouette lost transparency and began to define its contours. Izumi, increasingly puzzled, recognized Nishi's likeness. The boy materialized with the X-Gun in his hand as the last remaining sparks crackled in the surrounding air.
""I did it! It was me who shot him down! It was me!"" 
""You bastard..."""

Is this a good quote for New Jersey,hvacadvice,1e8s9rr,2024-07-21 13:59:14,1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/hvacadvice/comments/1e8s9rr/is_this_a_good_quote_for_new_jersey/,iexaltu,,"Received a $10,441 quote from a vendor who works through PSEG & JCPL for 0% financing. We have a forced air system split between the 1st and the 2nd floor. The quote was to replace the heating and cooling unit on the first floor which is about 1600 SF. Is this a reasonable quote? For the first time in my life, I am tempted not to shop around as this seems ok but wondering if I am missing something. Below is some of the details on my ($10,441) quote. There is also a 80% AFUE TWO STAGE ECM 120K BTUH for $8700. Are these good quotes? If so, which one should we pick?

What framerate does Studio One 6 run at?,StudioOne,1e6e8nm,2024-07-18 11:27:29,2,0.75,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudioOne/comments/1e6e8nm/what_framerate_does_studio_one_6_run_at/,theinfamousmielie,,"So I'm having some trouble with another DAW making my temps run higher than any other DAW (S1 included) and I'm trying to understand why.

The tech support team from the other DAW has come back to me to suggest that their DAW runs at 60fps thus increasing GPU load, thus increasing temps.

This sounds entirely plausible, but I'd like to know if anyone knows what Studio One's FPS is. I don't mean video stuff, I mean the rendering the UI. It looks smooth, it feels like it's running at 60fps too, but I don't know this for sure and I'm not sure how to find out.

Can anyone help me?

MINOR EDIT: When I get a chance I'm going to do some measuring to see how hard the GPU is working on my laptop when each DAW is running. I'll update with my findings.

POST-TESTING UPDATE: So very interesting. I used the macos command \`/bin/launchctl setenv MTL\_HUD\_ENABLED 1\` to show an overlay reporting on Metal's rendering, launched S1 and opened an empty project. As would be sensible, Studio One does not run at 60FPS at all times, as would be expected, because that would be very inefficient. It idles at \~15fps. When playing, it goes to 60, which is my refresh rate. The macOS GPU history graph shows zero GPU usage.

For interest, the same test shows Bitwig 5.1.9 running at \~20fps when idle, and a slightly surprising \~48fps when playing. Of interest here is that the macOS GPU history graph shows around 25-30% GPU usage even when idle.

Bitwig 5.2 beta has a reworked graphics engine, so i can't see the reporting as it clearly doesn't use Metal., but the GPU history shows a higher usage of the GPU across the board at maybe around 35%."
