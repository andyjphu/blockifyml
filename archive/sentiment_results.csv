Back in July I bought 2800$ in bitcoin that was being put aside for tax time. My reasoning for that was to hedge $CAD inflation and maybe make a little extra. Since then its been sitting with 100$ thrown in here and there and today I make the regrettable but responsible decision to sell at 80% profit totalling 6500$. I hate selling as I know BTC is only going up in price but I will be able to pay the remaining 3200$ I owe on a 27% APR car loan. 

No more stress about a 200$ bi weekly car payment means I can allocate the 200$ into buying more bitcoin and with time my BTC reserve will sit above 6000$+, hedge CAD$ devaluation with no pressure to sell it. Thank you for reading. Taking profit is good and all but It cannot be enjoyed if I owe that amount with a 27% interest rate. 

Bonus is my credit score will be looking snazzy!",Neutral,0.9995144605636597

The more I think about what bitcoin is and what people are trying to utilize it for the more I think that this is probably here to stay 

I don’t agree with Bitcoin. Buying money with money is fundamentally unsound, and buying bitcoin makes less sense than buying gold, but I understand what they are trying to accomplish.  

The bitcoin guys think that bitcoin is a better version of gold. I wouldn’t be surprised if the majority of bitcoin maximalists used to invest in precious metals. I at the very least know of one maximalist who was very big on buying silver before bitcoin came around.

Regardless of if bitcoin is here to stay, a lot of these guys are playing a very dangerous game. More often I’m seeing posts about people liquidating their 401(k) and putting it into bitcoin.  Like all investments there’s a chance that you’re wrong about the thesis entirely.  And like all investments and markets, there will be a day where you’re down a significant amount of money.  When this day comes, many will be wiped out when they need it the most, especially if they’re trading on margin.

To me buying bitcoin doesn’t make any more sense than buying gold. The best you can expect any unproductive asset to perform is in direct proportion to inflation, but wouldn’t you want to do better than that?   There’s obviously a lot of speculation around bitcoin currently and maybe it is the next “big thing,” but regardless, I will not be participating.",Neutral,0.9994902610778809

Is there any solid reason for them to think this way? I get that you guys will probably have a bit of pro-bitcoin bias, but come on, if Bitcoin works, I could make a ton of money. And if I lose 1,000€, it’s frustrating but not the end of the world. It’s an amount I can afford to lose, and I don’t enjoy buying unnecessary goods anyway, my money is just sleeping in my bank account.
I’m very confident about cryptocurrencies and truly believe in their future. I strongly believe cryptocurrencies are the future of finance and technology.

I’m a 36 year old guy. I first heard about bitcoin around 2011. I dabbled in it back then. Created a wallet, bought some bitcoin, (even mined some dogecoin back when it was first starting out lol). Of course I sold my bitcoin far too early and lost access to my dogecoin (I think the website I was mining through took all the money and ran).

Anyway, point is, I’ve realized that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and I want to know how to invest in cryptocurrency properly, so I started trying to get more involved than just investing in coins on RobinHood.

I recently bought a Ledger device, and along this journey back into crypto, I came to two major realizations.

1. Buying actual coins and storing them in a wallet is risky. Sure, it’s one thing to play around with a few hundred dollars, but putting ten or a hundred thousand dollars on a wallet feels eerily unsafe.

2. Buying, selling and storing coins is not a simple process. Sure it’s not *super* complicated, but I believe the average person with little to no technical knowledge will likely struggle quite a bit, even with companies like Trezor and Ledger walking the user through the process.

Regarding my first concern - your money is likely safe as long as you keep your seed phrase in a safe offline location and never lose it. However, the problem is all of the possible ways your seed phrase could be stolen. Ledger initially said there was no way for them to access your seed phrase, but then later released a feature called recover, which means they did have access to the seed phrase. Aside from the possibility of the company one day getting hacked and leaking your keys, there’s also the possibility that a keylogger could grab it, or that your hardware wallet could have been tampered with on its way to you. 

This thought process all seems a little paranoid, but becomes less so if you are considering dropping $100,000+ into a bitcoin wallet, which is completely uninsured. If someone manages to steal your money, no one (not even law enforcement) will come to save you.  

After doing some research, I came to the conclusion that the safest way to create a bitcoin wallet is to use an air-gapped hardware wallet with verifiable open source code and a software wallet from a separate company which also has open source code. But even then, without insurance, it still feels a little scary.

Anyway. My point is that these two issues - security and simplicity are preventing the world from adopting and using cryptocurrencies in the long run. 

So my first question is - is there a solution to these problems on the horizon? Because if there isn’t, I don’t see the value of investing.

My second question is - which cryptocurrency is likely to be both the future leader of cryptocurrency payments, and also likely to increase in value over time?

Bitcoin is the leader, but when I send or receive bitcoin using my Ledger, it takes about 10 minutes for the transaction to settle. This makes it impractical for everyday use.

ETH is in 2nd place, it uses a similar technology, is faster, more energy efficient, and is decentralized, but the supply is unlimited, which prevents inflation I guess.. but also limits potential profits.

I think the ideal coin would be exactly like bitcoin, but with a faster transaction time and less energy use, and also a solution to the problems I mentioned above (security and simplicity). And also one that does not involve any “governing body” having any sort of control over it. 

So my question is.. does such a coin exist?",Neutral,0.9991480112075806

Nano Is The Ultimate Green Investment: Nano IS Our Earth's Lifeline!,nanocurrency,1i9spf7,2025-01-25 12:56:43,17,0.87,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/1i9spf7/nano_is_the_ultimate_green_investment_nano_is_our/,NanoisaFixedSupply,,"We are are in a dire situation. We're living on a ticking time bomb, folks. Climate change, resource depletion, and overshoot (that's when we're using resources faster than they can be replenished) are not just buzzwords; they're stark realities. Every day, we're pushing our planet closer to the edge of multiple tipping points, where recovery might be impossible. We're not talking about a far-off future here; the freight train of ecological collapse is barreling down on us at breakneck speed. Climate crises, mass extinctions, and resource depletion are no longer looming threats—they're here, now. Traditional financial systems, with their endless money printing, are driving us towards a cliff of no return, accelerating our consumption beyond what Earth can sustain.



The environmental savior is Nano. Imagine a currency that not only doesn't contribute to pollution but actively helps reduce it. That's Nano for you. Here’s why investing in Nano could be the best and greenest decision you'll ever make:

  
1. Zero Environmental Impact: Unlike Bitcoin, which uses energy-intensive mining, Nano operates on a feeless, instant, and eco-friendly network. Nano's transactions are processed with negligible energy, making it one of the greenest cryptocurrencies out there. By supporting Nano, you're directly reducing the carbon footprint of your financial activities. You are not mining precious rare earth metals out of the ground and contaminating ecosystems. Water supplies are not being poisoned by using Nano.

  
2. Fixed Supply = Fixes Overshoot: Nano's total supply is capped at 133,248,297 coins. This fixed supply mimics the finite nature of our planet's resources. In a world where overshoot is killing our ecosystems, a currency with a limit will force us to reconsider our consumption patterns. It's an economic model that aligns with ecological sustainability, pushing for efficiency and conservation rather than unchecked expansion. It forces us to be responsible and well calculated with our economic decisions. This is a win win. Perfect money ethics will promote ethics on a societal level. You want more Nano? -  you can't just print up more of it, you need to do actually do something valuable for people to earn it. Nano will end the age of financial injustice. With a fixed supply, Nano enforces limits on our economic behavior, mirroring the finite resources of our planet. It's a now-or-never moment to curb overshoot. Without this, we're doomed to consume our way to extinction. 



3. Saving Biodiversity: By fostering an economic system that values sustainability, we can redirect capital towards preserving biodiversity. Each Nano transaction could fund a tree, protect an acre of rainforest, or support initiatives that regenerate ecosystems. Your wealth could directly translate into a healthier planet. The average size of monitored wildlife populations on earth has declined by 73%over the last 50 years! Every Nano transaction could literally save a species, a forest, an ocean. We're talking about immediate action to preserve what's left of Earth's biodiversity. Your investment could be the line between existence and extinction for countless species.



  
Your Role in The Earth: Here's the deal: by investing in Nano, you're not just betting on a cryptocurrency; you're investing in the future of our planet. You're choosing a path where economic decisions are tied to ecological health. Every Ӿ you hold is a vote for a world where money supports life, not destroys it!  


* Be Part of the Change: By using Nano for everyday transactions, you're pushing for a system where every exchange is a step towards sustainability.
* Educate and Advocate: Share the vision of Nano. The more people understand its potential, the quicker we can shift to a sustainable economic model.
* Invest for Impact: Your investment in Nano is an investment in a sustainable future. It's not just about profit; it's about preserving life on Earth!
* The clock is ticking. Educate everyone around you about Nano's environmental urgency.
* Invest Immediately! Time is of the essence. Your investment in Nano could be what tips the scale towards survival.



The freight train of ecological disaster is upon us, but we have a chance to derail it. Nanocurrency isn't just another cryptocurrency; it's our lifeline to a sustainable future. It's time to make your money count for good, not just your financial portfolio; but in the health of our planet. Nano might just be the key to saving our planet from extinction.",Neutral,0.9997537732124329

In a dramatic turn of events, French authorities successfully rescued David Balland, the co-founder of the renowned crypto hardware wallet company Ledger, after he was kidnapped from his home in central France. The incident unfolded early Tuesday morning when Balland and his partner were abducted, sparking a high-stakes police operation.

The kidnappers, in a chilling move, demanded a substantial ransom in cryptocurrency, highlighting the growing trend of crypto-related crimes. However, their plan was thwarted by the swift and coordinated efforts of French law enforcement, including the elite GIGN tactical unit. Part of the ransom was paid as part of negotiations, but most of the crypto assets were traced, frozen, and seized by the authorities.

Balland endured physical abuse during his captivity, including a hand mutilation, while his partner was found tied up in a car. The rescue operation culminated in the arrest of 10 suspects, nine men and one woman, most of whom were known to police for past criminal activities.

This incident underscores the vulnerabilities faced by high-profile individuals in the crypto sector and the need for enhanced security measures. Ledger, known for its innovative hardware wallets, has been a target due to its significant role in the crypto industry.

As the crypto world continues to evolve, this case serves as a wake-up call for prioritizing personal security alongside technological innovation. The crypto community must grapple with the risks inherent in this space and work towards stronger safeguards to protect its key players.

I think our community is great and Sloth a huge opportunity. I am always impressed by individuals who not only have ideas but also implement them straight away. Then there are others who constantly call for the developers and are annoyed that they don't want to appear. 
Have you also thought about the fact that the developers might never show themelves? It's a long shot but Bitcoin works without its developers...
Now to the actual topic - the reason why I'm writing this:
I know how software development works and have already implemented numerous platforms as a project manager. However, just imagine we are developing a concept for a joint E-Commerce platform or exchange that enables us to offer exclusive products (could be a service, art, tickets, VIP club memberships, software etc.). I know that there are already many creative people in our community who could contribute to this. The only accepted payment method would be SLOTH. Let's define the value of SLOTH together as a community. The focus would of course be on user friendliness, reliability, transparency and establishing SLOTH as a object of exchange. Help users to acquire SLOTH by offering a simple onboarding solution (can be done through a partnership with crypto exchanges or by integrating a function that allows users to by SLOTH directly on the platform etc.).
I believe that we as a community can really implement this without the developers. 
What do you think, are we as a community able to implement such a project and create a need that can only be met by using SLOTH?
I look forward to your input.",Neutral,0.9976215958595276

So, you want to be a Bitcoin wizard, do you? Donning the digital robes, waving your enchanted private keys, and conjuring payments out of thin air? Well, gather ‘round, for I’m about to show you the mystical path to Bitcoin mastery. All you need is a little courage, a touch of curiosity, and the ultimate spellbook: our [Bitcoin QR Code Maker API](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/). Let’s begin.

# Lesson 1: The Call to Crypto Adventure

Every wizard’s journey begins with a spark—a sudden realization that the fiat system is, well, as magical as a soggy wand. The Bitcoin network offers something better: decentralization, transparency, and a community of like-minded sorcerers (okay, maybe we call them developers, traders, and miners).

But here’s the catch—cryptocurrency isn’t for the faint-hearted. It’s a world where digital alchemy turns trust into transactions and where QR codes are your enchanted runes. That’s where the Bitcoin QR Code API comes in. It’s your staff of power, allowing you to wield the blockchain with grace, efficiency, and a flair for the dramatic.

# Lesson 2: Mastering the QR Code Spell

What’s a Bitcoin wizard without a spell? In our case, the spell is the QR code—a deceptively simple black-and-white matrix that can carry the weight of a thousand satoshis. These magical glyphs are your gateway to seamless transactions, enabling anyone with a smartphone to scan and pay faster than you can say “Hocus Pocus.”

Our [Bitcoin QR Code Maker API](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/) takes this spell to the next level. Whether you’re running an e-commerce store, managing a fundraiser, or just flexing your developer muscles, this API helps you generate Bitcoin QR codes with ease. Think of it as your trusty grimoire—it works quietly in the background, but its power is undeniable.

# Lesson 3: Crafting Magical Use Cases

Every good wizard knows how to use their tools creatively. Here are a few enchanting ideas for the Bitcoin QR Code API:

1. **The Merchant’s Charm** Running a shop? Use QR codes to accept Bitcoin payments at lightning speed. No fiddling with wallets, no confusion—just scan, pay, and poof, transaction complete.
2. **The Charitable Enchantment** Fundraising for a cause? QR codes make it easy for donors to contribute in Bitcoin. A scan and a tap later, their donation is on its way.
3. **The Developer’s Elixir** Building a decentralized app? Integrate the Bitcoin QR Code API for frictionless payment processing. Your users will thank you for the wizardry.
4. **The Party Trick** Hosting a crypto-themed event? Use QR codes to collect ticket payments or even as giveaways. Watch as your attendees marvel at your blockchain sorcery.

# Lesson 4: Decoding the Wizard’s Toolbox

You might be wondering, “What makes this Bitcoin QR Code API so special?” Well, let me enlighten you:

* **Simplicity**: No need for an advanced degree in cryptography. The API is designed to be user-friendly, even if your last coding project was a “Hello World” app.
* **Customization**: Personalize your QR codes to reflect your brand or style. Add colors, logos, and more to make your QR codes pop.
* **Speed**: In the fast-paced world of Bitcoin, every second counts. The API generates QR codes faster than you can say “blockchain.”
* **Security**: The API ensures your transactions are safe and secure. No sneaky goblins tampering with your funds here.

# Lesson 5: Overcoming Common Wizarding Challenges

Every aspiring wizard faces challenges on their journey. Here are a few pitfalls to avoid:

1. **The “Oops, Wrong Address” Curse** Double-check those QR codes! One tiny mistake, and your Bitcoin could end up in the abyss. The API minimizes errors, but a little caution goes a long way.
2. **The “Tech Hex”** Not a coding expert? Fear not! The Bitcoin QR Code API comes with documentation so clear, even a Muggle could understand it.
3. **The “Overwhelm Spell”** The crypto world can be daunting. Take it one step at a time. Start small, experiment with the API, and soon you’ll be casting complex payment spells with ease.

# Lesson 6: The Future of Bitcoin Wizardry

The beauty of Bitcoin wizardry lies in its infinite potential. As more people adopt cryptocurrency, the demand for seamless, secure transactions will only grow. By mastering tools like the Bitcoin QR Code API, you position yourself at the forefront of this digital revolution.

Picture this: a world where your QR codes power vending machines, enable micropayments, and even unlock doors (okay, maybe not literal doors, but certainly doors of opportunity). The possibilities are as vast as a dragon’s treasure hoard.

# Lesson 7: Joining the Wizarding Community

No wizard works alone. The Bitcoin ecosystem is brimming with fellow spellcasters eager to share knowledge, trade tips, and collaborate on magical projects. Join forums, attend meetups, and never stop learning. The more you engage, the more powerful your spells will become.

And don’t forget to share your creations! Show off your Bitcoin QR code-powered projects and inspire others to embrace the magic of cryptocurrency.

# Final Exam: Your First Spell

Ready to test your skills? Head over to [Bitcoin QR Code Maker API](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/) and start experimenting. Whether it’s for personal use or a grand project, you’ll quickly see how this tool can transform your crypto experience.

# Epilogue: From Apprentice to Master

Becoming a Bitcoin wizard isn’t just about tools and transactions—it’s about embracing a mindset of curiosity, innovation, and empowerment. With the Bitcoin QR Code API by your side, you’re not just participating in the crypto revolution—you’re leading it.

So go forth, young wizard. Create, explore, and share your magic with the world. And remember, every time someone scans your QR code, you’re casting a spell that bridges the gap between technology and possibility.✨",Neutral,0.9996658563613892

I found an app for Android that lets you mine real Bitcoin for free by watching ads and even one option without an ad. But the more ads you watch the more computing power you get to mine BTC faster. It doesn't make your phone slower because you are not using the actual phone to mine anything.

Android: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitcoin.minning.com](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitcoin.minning.com)

iOS: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bitcoin-mining-cloud-mining/id6503180820](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bitcoin-mining-cloud-mining/id6503180820)

You can use my referral code if you want: KFMNOM

The minimun amount to withdraw is 0.0000002 which takes about 2 days to mine. You can download Speed wallet to your browser and use that as a wallet for example.

Tip for more Bitcoin faster: I also use my old phone that I don't need and installed virtual machine to it to run android phone on it so I have currently installed 3 apps to mine, takes a little time to click all the ads and wait for those videos to end but so far I have earned 0.00000087 in under a week.

Edit: The amount we mine doesn't have much value today but history has shown that Bitcoins value could rise so it will be worth it in the future :)",Neutral,0.9995967745780945

Best 3 Cryptos Under $1 To Buy This Week: Doge Uprising Could Be The Best Meme Coin Of 2025,draqai,1i9rbei,2025-01-25 11:56:57,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/draqai/comments/1i9rbei/best_3_cryptos_under_1_to_buy_this_week_doge/,MammothBattle33,,"🚀 Hot Picks for Crypto Lovers: 3 Tokens Under $1 to Watch This Week  

Guess what, crypto fam? It’s the perfect time to hunt for those low-cost tokens that can turn you into the next *to-the-moon* success story. This week’s must-watch trio is sizzling: $DUP (Doge Uprising), $TRX (Tron), and Arbitrum. Let me spill the tea!  

Doge Uprising is creating some massive buzz right now. Currently in Stage 3 of its presale, $DUP is priced at just fractions of a cent. So what makes it special? It’s a meme coin, but with utility dripping in ambition—staking capabilities, an NFT marketplace, and all the viral appeal you could dream of. Early buyers are already piling in, and if the hype keeps soaring, $DUP could overshadow other meme coins by 2025. I mean, imagine flexing your gains this time next year... spicy, right?  

Meanwhile, let’s not forget about $TRX! Tron continues being a classic darling for decentralized applications. Reliable, consistent, and super cheap—perfect for stacking up in your bag for steady returns.  

Then we have Arbitrum, the tech genius among the trio. If Ethereum is your bae but those gas fees make you wanna scream, Arbitrum’s Layer 2 solution keeps things fast and wallet-friendly. While it may not have the meme coin vibe, it’s all about building solid, long-term value.  

But let’s be real... Doge Uprising is the one making everyone raise their eyebrows (and investments). The combo of cheap entry points, staking possibilities, and an irresistible meme factor makes $DUP seriously worth considering.  

Crypto season is all about being smart *and* spicy with your picks. So don’t sleep on these gems. Secure that bag and start dreaming of 2025 as your breakout year.

Mi spiego meglio:  
Poniamo il caso che, io credo fortemente nei btc  e cripto in genere, e al tempo stesso voglio anche speculare, la strategia migliore quale sarebbe ? investire tutto in un aspetto es: detenere bitcoin reali e vendere di tanto in tanto, nonostante la tax a 33%.  
Oppure una parte detenerla per non pagarci mai tasse a lunghissimo termine  - prima o poi magari cambia - ed una parte sfruttarla tramite etn/azioni mcrs per approfittare dell'oscillazione ?

spero di essere stato chiaro, magari non mi sono espresso molto bene. però quello che penso e ho capito da studi effettuati, che comunque avere un azion dell'azienda o l'etf non è proprio come detenere il btc fisico, quindi è differente a livello di ""prodotto reale"" e quindi di come dire ""credo"" nel progetto ?!",Neutral,0.9999213218688965

 Here's my situation:

* I’ve got about **50k CHF** in IBKR right now 
* this is not my only pot of money, I have a fair bit chunk of money invested through my swiss bank (UBS) and another private bank (Kaiser Partners) which is fortunately giving me good returns
* **My risk tolerance is high** for this type of investment, as I see IBKR is a sort of an experiment to see how things go, perhaps I could move more money into it at some point but not soon as I still prefer to keep my money safe in Switzerland
*  Going forward I plan to invest additional **2K per month,** starting from April/May
* Although I prone to risk, I do not have the time to play with stocks or bitcoins so I am focusing on **low-cost ETFs**, possibly **avoiding some overlap** between them**,** but not necessarily 
* I’m also setting aside **2.5k CHF** for active stock trades.

My initial plan is:
